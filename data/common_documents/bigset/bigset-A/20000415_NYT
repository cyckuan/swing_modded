CLEMENS STRUGGLES AGAINST ROYALS BUT MANAGES TO GET VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens keeps teasing the Yankees, pitching the
way they expect in some spurts and disappointing them in some
others. They want to believe that Clemens can dominate, and
sometimes he does. But there are other puzzling starts when Clemens
is ordinary, and the Yankees get exasperated. Friday night Clemens
was a little bit of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a botched pop fly that scored two runs, the Yankees
defeated the Kansas City Royals, 7-5, as Clemens lasted six innings
to earn the victory. The Yankees can point to how Clemens battled
on a chilly night when his fastball was inconsistent and when he
needed to rebound after slogging through two innings. The Yankees
will focus on the positive with Clemens because they can get away
with doing that in April.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, though, it was another ugly game for the Yankees,
another game in which they did not play crisply but still won. The
Royals rumbled into Yankee Stadium as the most dramatic team in the
major leagues after winning four straight games, all in their last
at-bat. The streak died Friday night when Mariano Rivera bagged the
final four outs without the Royals' hitting the ball past the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was long and ugly,'' the Yankees manager, Joe Torre, said.
``It's just nice to be able to get away with games like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre had expressed a desire for a starter beside Orlando
Hernandez to record a victory, which Clemens finally did. But it
was not an artistic effort, as Clemens surrendered five earned runs
and seven hits in six innings, walking four, hitting one and
throwing a wild pitch. What were the positives? Well, he never lost
a lead and managed to win despite uncorking a whopping 114 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   On a windy evening with temperatures in the 40's, Clemens never
seemed comfortable. He went to a full count on five of the first 10
batters and took 36 pitches to muddle through the second inning. He
began the inning by drilling Mike Sweeney in the right forearm with
a fastball, causing Sweeney to tumble to the dirt and shout in
pain. One out later, Clemens walked Mark Quinn. A groundout pushed
runners to second and third with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fired two quick strikes past the No. 9 batter, Rey
Sanchez, setting up an enviable situation where he could pump a
fastball past Sanchez or get him to bite on a split-finger
fastball. Clemens threw a split-finger fastball that stayed up in
the strike zone and Sanchez lashed it to center for a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has often questioned why Clemens does not throw a crisper
fastball more to simply overpower hitters, which he might have been
able to do against a batter who had never opposed him. Clemens
roared back in the third by inducing two groundouts and a strikeout
on nine pitches. It was the Clemens the Yankees wish they could see
more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I'm getting myself into poor counts,''
Clemens said. ``I've just got to work through it. It's simple math,
and I've got to get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada belted a two-run homer into the right-field upper
deck off Jay Witasick to even the score at 2-2 in the second. Ricky
Ledee's two-out, run-scoring double in the third made the score
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens and the Yankees were fortunate in two game-turning
situations in the fourth. With Chuck Knoblauch on first and two
out, Derek Jeter tapped a ball between first and second base.
Sweeney strayed too far from first, so second baseman Carlos Febles
fielded the ball and threw to Witasick for what should have been
the third out. But Umpire Mark Wagner called Jeter safe. Replays
appeared to show Jeter was out.
</P>
<P>
   After Witasick walked Paul O'Neill to load the bases, Witasick
seemed to sneak through a dicey spot by getting Bernie Williams to
hit a pop fly to shallow left. The ball hung in the air for an
agonizingly long time, long enough for Williams to ponder having
stranded three Yankees and for the Royals to exhale. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa drifted back on the ball behind third, started to
settle under it about five feet from the foul line and suddenly
veered away as if Sanchez, the shortstop, had called for the ball.
The 200-foot pop dropped to the grass and the glaring mistake
allowed two runs to score, giving the Yankees a 5-2 bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens bounced a split-finger fastball for a wild pitch to
produce the Royals' third run. After Jeter's two-run single made
the score 7-3, Clemens gave up Gregg Zaun's two-run homer to keep
the Royals close. Two batters later, Clemens trudged to the dugout
after finishing the sixth and finishing his night.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen assured a victory for Clemens. He just left some
unanswered questions about his pitching.  &QL;

FANS GET A LOOK AT FACE-LIFT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Luxury suites, dugout-club seating where folks can
basically listen to manager Davey Johnson's conversations, and a
rubberized warning track _ all part of a $50 million renovation
project _ were unveiled Friday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as elaborate as the new ballparks opening around the
league the past few years, it'll do just fine. Not just in the
interim but for a while.
</P>
<P>
   That new stadium next to the Coliseum just doesn't seem to be an
issue for the Dodgers, but neither does any other site. Chavez
Ravine remains the location of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago never to say never,'' Dodgers
managing partner and CEO Bob Daly said, ``but I think this
guarantees we'll be here for a while. There's no public funding in
Los Angeles and it's very expensive to build a ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do some more things with it as time goes on. Next year
we'll go into some tinkering. There are a lot of things we'd like
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tinkering is more on the inside than the outside,
particularly a new clubhouse for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Masaoka shipped out: Onan Masaoka lost his spot as the
Dodgers' situational lefty to Jeff Williams. He was sent to
Triple-A Albuquerque following the game to make room for
right-hander Eric Gagne, who will start today.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers weren't happy with the way Masaoka was throwing the
ball, the thinking being that his sprained ankle in spring training
didn't allow him to build arm strength. His velocity had dropped
from the low 90s to the high 80 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm, it's not hurting me, but hopefully if I go down and
stretch it out and get more innings, then it comes back,'' Masaoka
said. ``But we'll see how it reacts. I understand where they're
coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, who had a 7.50 ERA in five games, will start a few
games for the Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Perez lives on: Lefty Carlos Perez's outing Thursday was
enough to earn him at least one more start, which he'll make
Tuesday against Houston. Perez allowed three runs in six innings
against San Francisco for his first win since May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me calm down a little bit,'' Perez said of the
outing. ``I feel better, more comfortable. I think it's time to
start winning some games in a row. It feels good and I feel 100
percent. There's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But how long Perez remains with the Dodgers could be contingent
on a couple of factors. First, on how he performs. He made one
solid outing, but the prevalent thought in the organization remains
that he must prove himself time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if Gagne pitches well, he would force his way into the
rotation. The Dodgers wanted him to win a starting spot in spring
training, but he faltered miserably.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Perez) battled and he made improvements,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``He's just got to continue to do that
to regain his form of old that made him one of the better pitchers
in the National League prior to `99. It's in there. It's a matter
of getting it to come out and being consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Kevin Brown did some light
throwing before the game and was fitted with a new brace for his
broken right pinkie so he can be more active. Asked whether he
could be ready April 24, when he's allowed to come off the disabled
list, Brown said, ``It's possible, but I don't know. It's tough
sitting and watching a game when you pitch every fourth, fifth day.
It's definitely tougher when you're not doing anything.''. . . .
Gary Sheffield had three hits to extend his streak to 10 games and
Shawn Green increased his hitting streak to nine games.

METS' OLD RELIABLES PRODUCE A RARE VICTORY FOR FRANCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Manager Bobby Valentine's critical comments about
the Mets had general manager Steve Phillips flying here Friday on a
damage-control mission. But when Valentine spoke to students at the
Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia on Wednesday, he did say
some positive things about his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them have surfaced,'' Valentine said before Friday
night's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. ``About the way we
fought last year, and Mike, and Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura, and it would be
hard to be critical of those Mets. Along with Edgardo Alfonzo,
Piazza and Ventura provide the thump in the middle of the Mets'
lineup, and their offensive production drives this team.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way again Friday night, and the Pirates could not
control the damage. With all the pregame focus on Valentine and the
players he had apparently slighted, the Mets' old reliables led
them to an 8-5 victory in 12 innings. The Mets had 20 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza had five hits, the most he has ever had in a game,
including two homers. Ventura hit his first homer of the year, and
Alfonzo tripled and knocked in a run. Melvin Mora drove in the
go-ahead runs on a two-run broken-bat single off Jose Silva (2-1)
in the four-run 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The winning pitcher was John Franco, who worked two scoreless
innings and ended a streak of 112 games pitched without a victory.
Franco's last victory came on Sept. 13, 1997; he lost all 10 of his
decisions in between.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting a 4-3 lead in the ninth inning, the Mets' closer,
Armando Benitez, had two outs and a 2-2 count on Pat Meares. But
Meares smoked a triple to right field, scoring Jason Kendall to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came right back in the 10th, when Derek Bell singled
through the middle with two out and Rey Ordonez, who was on second,
raced for home. But Kendall, the Pirates' catcher, received Adrian
Brown's throw with his thigh blocking Ordonez's path to the plate,
and Kendall tagged Ordonez out to keep the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   The game had been tied at 2-2 in the top of the seventh inning.
With one out, Piazza got a curveball from the right-hander Jason
Schmidt and drove it over the fence in right field, putting the
Mets ahead, 3-2. It was Piazza's second home run of the year and
the fifth of his career off Schmidt, who has surrendered more
homers to Piazza than to any other active hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets increased their lead to 4-2 on the next pitch when
Ventura also took Schmidt over the right-field wall for a homer.
Ventura, who hit 32 home runs last year, was batting .139 before
connecting Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had a hand in the Mets' other runs. His sacrifice fly
scored Rickey Henderson to give the Mets their first run in the
third inning. In the fifth, Alfonzo hit a one-out triple and scored
on an opposite-field double by Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be enough to support the left-hander Al Leiter,
who was starting for the first time in 11 days. He had strained his
groin in the Shea Stadium opener, in which he pitched eight strong
innings. He was sharp again Friday night, pitching seven and
two-thirds innings, allowing two earned runs on homers by Wil
Cordero and Kevin Young.

KNICKS HAVE NO ANSWER FOR CARTER, OR RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ All night long, Vince Carter would take off from the
floor with the unpredictability of a bottle rocket and leave behind
a vapor trail. In his wake, he left fear.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks tried to disguise their trepidation Friday night with
fits of visible anger. Afterward, they tried to smooth over their
anxieties with some reassuring words. But after another night when
they were baffled by Carter's moves and confused by their inability
to compete with the brazen Raptors, there is an unusual nervousness
beneath the Knicks' usual swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a team that is not haunted by the Knicks. Here is a team
that does not tremble at their lore. Here is the team they may face
in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What if they face this team in the first round? What if they
can't stop Carter again? On Friday, he unraveled their mental state
one more time as he scored 34 points and led the Raptors to a third
straight double-digit victory against the Knicks. This one was the
worst of all, an 86-71 victory for the Raptors that began with a
28-11 lead after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had only scored 2 points by then. The Knicks seemed
psyched out by his presence and let it filter down to their
horrible defense, slow transition offense and sloppy ball-handling
(19 turnovers). It was enough to let coach Jeff Van Gundy engage in
the kind of self-flogging that has become familiar when the Knicks
look as though they are flirting with danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made it crystal clear what we need to do against
these guys,'' said Van Gundy, whose team dropped the season series,
3-1, to the Raptors and allowed Carter to average 33 points a game.
``He knows that we know we don't want to play him. We didn't want
to compete against him. I'm frustrated with myself. I haven't come
up with the right plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy tried Larry Johnson, then Latrell Sprewell, then
Marcus Camby, and not one of them could get close enough to put his
body on Carter. Meanwhile, the rest of the team was falling apart
on the side. Allan Houston (10 points) couldn't guard Dell Curry
(10 points) in the first quarter. Sprewell (3 for 13) couldn't get
off a focused shot, and Patrick Ewing (16 points) was too slow to
react to Antonio Davis (17 points) on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we meet them in the playoffs, we have to find a way,''
Sprewell said. ``We have to figure out how to get it done. This
game will be fresh in our minds. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Knicks and sixth-seeded Raptors have just three
games left in the regular season. If the Knicks hadn't fallen
apart, they could have put the pressure on second-seeded Miami,
which lost to Indiana Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been like a highlight reel for them,'' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``Vince Carter has crushed us. Tracy McGrady has
had his way with us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy sounded as if he was at his wits' end before tipoff.
In three games, Carter had averaged 32 points by weaving and
whirling past Sprewell. So Van Gundy tinkered with that strategy
and saddled Johnson with the task of keeping up with Carter.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible. Some teams have had luck putting a body on
Carter and making him feel an arm in his ribs as he has taken shot.
Johnson couldn't get that close. Before he knew it, Carter would
step away from him, leap as he launched and snapped off
back-to-back jumpers in front of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He just looked over at Van Gundy in disgust after Carter rose up
for a third straight jumper to put the Raptors ahead, 35-16, with
seven minutes left in the second quarter. It would get worse. Van
Gundy pulled Johnson and put Sprewell back on Carter, but that
didn't work, either. In 45 seconds, Carter did a scissors kick as
he hit a fallaway 3-pointer at the shot-clock buzzer, and then lost
Sprewell on a screen for another 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks hit bottom at that point, down by 41-20 with 4:45
left in the half. No amount of pleading Van Gundy did in the
huddles registered. They let Carter destroy their confidence, ruin
their concentration and trickle down into every other part of their
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks finished the first half behind by 47-27, and were
shooting 32.4 percent. They had 12 turnovers, including 4 by Camby,
and had only one star to count on, Ewing. But he was in foul
trouble, and could deliver just 10 points in 14 minutes of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carter had 15 points (6 for 8), while Curry picked
apart Houston's defense for 10 points and Davis slipped outside of
Ewing's reach for another 10.
</P>
<P>
   These were the same Raptors who lost eight of nine games late
last month. The Raptors left people wondering if their young stars
would fold under the crush of the regular-season finish, and then
under the pressure of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take talent over experience anytime,'' Van Gundy said.
``I don't buy into it. This Toronto team can go to the finals out
of the East. They're that good.''
</P>
<P>
   They kept on validating that theory in the third quarter. With
Davis making a mockery out of Ewing's defense outside the paint, he
scored 6 points in two minutes to give the Raptors a 59-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carter kept right on scoring, no matter who Van Gundy put on
him. The third Knick to try his luck with Carter was Camby. With
Camby's wingspan in his way, Carter simply dribbled forward,
stepped back and launched some more.

DODGERS HOME OPENER A REAL GALA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were weary from two months on the road and
five hours of sleep, maximum, thanks to the scheduling genius of
baseball, which made it all the more a wonderful time for the home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   The sleepy-eyed Los Angeles Dodgers were guzzling coffee like
harried college students readying for exams. Some had no idea where
they live, or how to get home from Dodger Stadium. They needed a
boost, and the soldout crowd was there to provide the stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Once the yawning stopped, the Dodgers continued their strong
play as Gary Sheffield, Shawn Green and Eric Karros each drove in
two runs, and Orel Hershiser, who received a standing ovation
before throwing a pitch, battled through six innings as the Dodgers
beat the Cincinnati Reds 8-1 Friday in front of 53,223.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an outstanding opening day,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``We've been through the toughest time you
could imagine with this schedule. None of us got much sleep
(Thursday) night; to come in and wing the bats and play like we did
was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, a team that thought completing a grueling season-
opening road trip to Canada, New York and San Francisco at .500
would be fantastic, has won five straight and is 7-3. The Dodgers
have not won six in a row since July 25-Aug. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of day, opening day or not, guys can come and
try to get through the game, but we were battling,'' Green said.
``That's the thing right now that I'm really excited about. All
these little signs are pointing in the right direction for this
team. You look at Cincinnati last year and they were doing the
things we are doing early. You see the tendencies of a team early
on, and I think the tone of the year gets set early on.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is brought with tempered enthusiasm, but it lives.
On a day when expectations were limitless and the chance for
disaster great, Hershiser fought out of jams to record his first
win with the Dodgers since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly wasn't smooth. His only perfect inning was his
last. Twice, double plays bailed him out of trouble and the Reds
had runners at third three times but failed to get them in. The
only run was an Aaron Boone homer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the starting rotation that brought question marks when
Kevin Brown was injured is 3-0 with a 3.13 ERA in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what's going on in my life and what I have to look
forward to, this is a huge day,'' Hershiser said. ``It's hard to
describe. To be 41-years-old, to do something this special, to have
this kind of special day and have it turn out positive, it's an
awesome feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really like a playoff game. Opening day, a sellout, Mr.
(Bob) Daly's first game (as an owner). It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, once the Dodgers woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings they had two hits, including a Sheffield
solo homer. Meanwhile, the Reds looked poised to break it open in
every inning. And no time was better than te seventh. With the Reds
trailing 2-1, and reliever Terry Adams pitching, Ken Griffey Jr.
was up with the bases loaded and two out. Griffey, who hit into a
double play in the first inning, struck out on a high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning the Dodgers broke the game open with
six runs.
</P>
<P>
   With a run already in, Sheffield (3 for 3, HR) was intentionally
walked to load the bases only to have Green drive in a pair to
break the game open with a two-run double. Karros followed with his
own two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was it right there, with Griffey and Adams,'' Sheffield
said. ``I feel this team, we could win a one-run game or explode.
That's what championship teams need to do.''

FISHER FINALLY YIELDS TO INJURED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The seemingly indestructable Derek Fisher, who has
playedthrough every bruise and strain the last four seasons, was
finally felled by injury Friday, when the Lakers placed him on the
injured list for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who never talks about his injuries, has quietly carried
on for the last two weeks despite a bone spur in his right ankle.
Coach Phil Jackson hopes to have his hustling guard back for the
playoffs, which begin next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't moving right out there on the court the last couple
games,'' Jackson said. ``We felt if anything, some rest might help
him get back in the fray a little bit, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers activated rookie guard John Celestand to take
Fisher's place on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Counting Friday night's game against Sacramento, Fisher will
miss the last four games of the regular season. Normally, a player
on the injured list must skip five games, but Fisher's status for
the postseason will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff rosters must be set by Thursday at noon, so the Lakers
have until then to determine if Fisher can play. Rosters cannot be
changed once the playoffs begin, except in extreme cases in which a
team has several injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want to go in with players that are 100 percent or
close,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll force it if he can,'' Jackson said of Fisher.
``He's had this problem before. This is not new to him. But we hope
to get rid of that. We need someone that can take care of some
details out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for gambling on Fisher's continued health, or on Celestand's
inexperience in the playoffs, Jackson said: ``I'm not thinking in
those type of terms yet. . . . I think Derek's going to get healed
and he'll be fine, and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had played in all 78 games and was averaging 6.3 points
and 2.8 assists in 23.1 minutes. He also started the first month of
the season, in place of the injured Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   __ His turn: Celestand was supposed to get his opportunity to
play last week, but the Lakers spiked a plan to put Ron Harper on
the injured list. Now the 6-2 guard from Villanova gets four games
to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a good time at the end of the year to get some
playing time hopefully, and get a little bit of experience,'' said
Celestand, who appeared in 12 games in November and December but
hadn't played since. ``I've been anxious for a long time. It was
hard, because I thought I was going to play earlier, and it was
kind of disappointing, but we've got a good team and I've just got
to wait my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Silenced: Lawrence Tanter, the Lakers' longtime
public-address announcer who has rarely missed a game, was out ill
Friday.

THERE'S STILL BITE IN OL' BULLDOG

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Orel Hershiser isn't superstitious or anything.
All the same, he'd really rather we didn't make a big fuss over how
well he and the other Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitchers are
faring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day you start saying the starting pitching is awesome,''
Hershiser cautioned, ``is the day the starters start to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we won't make a big deal of the fact the Dodgers are 3-0
with a 3.13 ERA since their staff ace, Kevin Brown, broke his
pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was the latest pitcher to star in a starting role. He
turned back Cincinnati and the clock Friday, pitching six gritty
innings in the Dodgers's 8-1 win in front of a Dodger Stadium
sellout of 53,223.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for someone brought in mostly for insurance and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers signed Hershiser in December, presumably to buttress
the relieving corps. The Bulldog had other ideas, though. He wasn't
ready to be put out to the pasture that is the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed left-hander Carlos Perez in spring training and drove
Eric Gagne, a pitcher 17 years Hershiser's junior, down to Triple-A
(if only temporarily) by usurping a spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Let the cynics say there's something wrong with a starting
rotation that can find room for a 41-year-old arm. But to look at
Hershiser as a pitcher whose best years are behind him is to see
the hourglass as nearly empty when the flip side is he's full of
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser brought 3,110 innings of hard-earned knowledge to the
mound for the Dodgers' home opener and proceeded to collect chits
for all that combat duty. Like Perez and Chan Ho Park before him,
Hershiser proved that where their starters have the will, the
Dodgers are finding ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite battling untold distractions and a potent Cincinnati
lineup, Hershiser stuck around for 18 outs, thereby saving the bulk
of the bullpen for another day. It was the fifth time in 10 games a
Dodgers starter has stuck around through the sixth, no small factor
in their 7-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   When the starting rotation has staying power, it has a domino
effect on the whole team.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen is better for it, gaining a decided advantage when
it's able to field a fresh arm every night. Batters are harder-
pressed to groove in on a reliever they aren't facing night in and
night out.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Dodgers reliever Mike Fetters, who was with Baltimore
last year. The first few weeks of the Orioles' 1999 season, Fetters
said, ``We couldn't get our starters out of the third and it took a
toll on the bullpen. Guys had to throw out of their comfort
zones.''
</P>
<P>
   The hitters also benefit from the doggedness of their starters
inasmuch as tenacity tends to be contagious. If a pitcher is
digging deep to get the job done, his teammates will take it upon
themselves to make his counterpart dig even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Friday when, fortified by Hershiser's will, the
Dodgers batters kept fighting, finally breaking open a one-run game
with a six-run seventh inning. It marked the sixth time the Dodgers
have scored more runs in the last three innings of a game than in
the opening or middle three innings, which suggests the starting
pitchers aren't the only ones hanging tough.
</P>
<P>
   Stalwart starters can benefit their managers most of all. As the
Dodgers' Davey Johnson quipped, ``When they go six, I become
smarter. When they go seven, I get to be a real genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser has stuck around for 18 major-league seasons because
he pitches with both his head and his heart. What he did for 98
pitches Friday was practice what he has been preaching to the
pitching staff since the start of spring training: Control one's
emotions for optimal control of one's pitches; block out
distractions and never, ever give up.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a less-focused pitcher might have come unraveled a
little bit when he stood front and center in the Dodgers's first
home game of the season in the team's refurbished, re-energized
crib.
</P>
<P>
   A less-wily pitcher might have come undone in the third inning,
after giving up a leadoff home run to Aaron Boone and practically
capitulating to his rookie counterpart, Rob Bell, allowing him to
work the count to 3-2 before striking him out.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Pokey Reese, sent Hershiser's fourth pitch into
left for a double. After Barry Larkin grounded out, Hershiser
frittered away a 1-2 count on Ken Griffey Jr., walking him on seven
pitches before bearing down to get Dante Bichette to pop up to
first for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was walking a tightrope,'' Hershiser said,
summing up the inning.
</P>
<P>
   His high-wire act so inspired his teammates, they bound together
like protective netting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole team rallies around a performance like
that,'' said reliever Terry Adams, who succeeded Hershiser in the
seventh and struck out Griffey swinging with the bases loaded to
wiggle out of the inning unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges then mopped up. But make no mistake; on this day it
was Hershiser who provided the polish.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department Friday asked an appeals
court in Atlanta to lift an emergency injunction and give federal
law-enforcement officials the power to reunite Elian Gonzalez with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal court cancels an order issued on Thursday that
blocked the child's transfer, the government will be free take him
from his Miami relatives and allow the father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, to return home to Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   The swirl of legal maneuvering took place as hope for a
settlement dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Elian's Miami relatives showed no sign that they
would soften their determination to keep the boy even as
immigration officials wrote to Lazaro Gonzalez, the child's
great-uncle, reminding him that his legal authority over the child
ended on Thursday at 2 p.m. when he was ordered to take Elian to
authorities at an airport north of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in a brief filed with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Atlanta, the Miami relatives said that they had been
denied an opportunity to show in court why Elian should remain in
the United States. They said they had evidence that ``Elian
confronts serious psychological injury if he is removed from his
home with Marisleysis and taken to Cuba.'' Marisleysis is Lazaro
Gonzalez's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the relatives made public an uncorroborated
affidavit from Orlando Rodriguez, a neighbor of Elian's father in
Cuba, which said that the father mistreated his former wife, who
drowned in the attempt to flee Cuba with Elian last November. It
said that Rodriguez had ``personal knowledge'' of Juan Miguel's
mistreating his former wife, Elian's late mother, Elizabet Brotons.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said Rodriguez saw the father hit Brotons ``to the
point she went to the hospital'' and that similar acts were
inflicted on his son. The relatives said two other witnesses could
submit sealed affidavits about such behavior by Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a mood of grim resolve replaced the
disappointment over Attorney General Janet Reno's fruitless trip to
Miami on Wednesday to try to talk the relatives into giving up the
boy. Officials said that Reno was at last resigned to taking the
step she had hoped to avoid: a tactical law-enforcement operation
to remove the child from Miami forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Reno had quietly met law-enforcement
officials in Washington and Miami to discuss the operation.
</P>
<P>
   They said she alone would choose the timing and nature of the
action, adding that it was likely to be carried out using a minimum
of force at a time of the day when demonstrators were not likely to
be massed in the streets of the Little Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said it was possible that Reno would delay a
tactical operation until next week, when there would be fewer
people available to take part in protests than on Saturday or
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it is clear that there is no injunction, the
government will move to implement its enforcement action to enforce
our order,'' an immigration official said Friday. ``It seems clear
that the relatives have no intention of working with us on a
cooperative agreement to turn over the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, downpours reduced the number of demonstrators outside
the Gonzalez house from the thousands who marched in the streets on
Thursday to about 150 people, some of whom sang songs about Elian
during their soggy vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed its brief with the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta. A judge on the panel had
issued a temporary order on Thursday, which prevented the
government from transferring Elian to his father and blocked the
boy's return with his father to Cuba. Gonzalez is now waiting in
Washington for a reunion with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief said, ``It is very important to
Elian's long-term well-being that Elian be transferred to his
father's care as as soon as possible, that the transfer be
unambiguous, that his care-givers since his arrival in the United
States prepare him for and participate in the transfer in a
supportive manner and that the transfer occur at a neutral
location.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that that Reno and the immigration commissioner,
Doris Miessner, ``have gone to extraordinary lengths'' to obtain
the cooperation of Elian's Miami relatives in the last week. But,
the legal paper argued, the relatives had refused to obey lawful
government directives, like the order to hand Elian over to
authorities at the Opa-Locka airport north of Miami by the Thursday
afternoon deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's filing said that if the relatives
surrendered the child the government would use its authority to
keep Elian in the United States while the appellate court
considered the relatives' appeal of a decision by a federal
district judge in Miami who ruled that the government could allow
the child to return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said that Gonzalez had agreed, in a letter sent on
Thursday to the Justice Department, to remain in the United States
for the appeal _ so long as he is given custody of his son.

<P>
   The computer files at the heart of the case against the former
Los Alamos scientist Dr. Wen Ho Lee were given higher security
classifications last year only after he was fired in the midst of
an espionage investigation at the weapons laboratory, say defense
lawyers and federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Dr. Lee downloaded the files onto his computer, they
were classified but not designated secret or confidential, as the
indictment against him alleges. Instead, they were governed by a
lower kind of security precaution, according to both sides in the
case, as well as a document that federal prosecutors filed as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holscher, the lead lawyer for Lee, said the after-the-fact
change, which he said his team discovered while studying
prosecution evidence, would be a powerful weapon for the defense.
But Holscher would not say how he intended to use it, beyond
declaring, ``The indictment is deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though government officials conceded that the original security
level was low, they emphatically denied that the material Lee
downloaded was insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our indictment and look forward to litigating this
issue when Dr. Lee is tried,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice
Department spokesman. ``What Lee stole was the crown jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Albuquerque Journal reported the low level of
security for the downloaded data.
</P>
<P>
   Since his indictment Dec. 10, Dr. Lee has been held without
bail, in solitary confinement and under unusually tight security in
Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have accused him of seizing the heart of the
American nuclear arsenal, but his backers maintain that his actions
were nothing out of the ordinary and that he is being singled out
because of his ethnic background. A native of Taiwan, Lee is a
naturalized U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The downloaded material had a security designation ``protect as
restricted data,'' or PARD, a category applied to scientific data
so voluminous and changing so frequently as to be impossible to
assess in terms of security. It is not a security classification
per se, but rather a rule for handling potentially sensitive
materials, and is governed by the secrecy provisions of the
nation's atomic energy laws.
</P>
<P>
   While PARD material by definition is classified and the
designation holds out the possibility that some of it might be
highly sensitive, it is not subject to the same stringent
precautions applied to data designated secret or confidential. For
example, scientists working with it may leave it on their desks
overnight, rather than in a safe. And careful records are kept on
the disposal of all secret and confidential data before its
shredding and burning; PARD printouts required no such accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PARD data must be kept in secure premises at the weapons
laboratory; by law it cannot be transferred onto unsecured
computers, as the government has charged Dr. Lee with doing.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the case agree that the material Dr. Lee is
accused of downloading contained nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official intimately familiar with the legalities of
the case and strongly supportive of the government's position said
the downloaded data included computer instructions on how to
simulate the design of a nuclear warhead, including exact
dimensions and other geometrical information that when standing
alone would be guarded assiduously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is poking a major hole in the case,'' the
official said of the PARD issue. ``What would be a problem is if
things weren't as alleged in the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stu Nagurka, an Energy Department spokesman, said the agency
``can't comment on the indictment in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration weapons expert strongly contested the
idea that the PARD behind the Lee indictment was any less important
than more concentrated data on nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A duck is a duck is a duck,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team countered, though, that any critical
information was buried in a virtually indecipherable mass of benign
data.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the dispute, Steven Aftergood, a secrecy and
classification expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a
private group in Washington, said the development would throw the
government on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes some of the heat off Wen Ho Lee and puts it on the
government, and particularly on the security system,'' Aftergood
said. ``The murkiness of the classification issue takes this out of
the category of `crown jewels,' `worse than the Rosenbergs' and
`change the strategic balance,''' he added, citing descriptions of
the case. ``It's much more complicated than it seemed at first.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was arrested in December, after years of being
investigated as a possible Chinese spy, the government, in a
59-count indictment, accused him of systematically endangering the
design security of virtually every nuclear warhead in the American
arsenal through unauthorized computer transfers of many of the most
sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   While he is not charged with espionage, the indictment claimed
he acted ``with the intent to secure an advantage to a foreign
nation.'' Most of the data that Lee downloaded is missing. He
claims it was destroyed and insists that his actions were strictly
in the line of scientific duty.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Younger, director of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos,
told the federal court at a December bail hearing that the
downloaded data in the wrong hands could ``change the global
strategic balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the indictment said that in 1993, 1994 and 1997
Lee had illegally transferred secret and confidential restricted
data, the federal term for information on the design, manufacturing
and use of atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But according to ``Grand Jury Exhibit One,'' a 47-page Los
Alamos analysis of material that Lee downloaded in 1993, 1994,
1995, 1996 and 1998, the downloading involved either unclassified
or PARD data. The analysis was filed in the federal courthouse in
Albuquerque as prosecution evidence.

DECONCINI VISITS WITH ELIAN'S DAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   told a former Arizona senator that he's ``very upset'' that
Miami relatives released a home video of Elian instead of allowing
the boy to deliver his wrenching message directly to his dad.
</P>
<P>
   In the tape, Elian sits on a bed and tells his father in
Spanish, ``I don't want to go to Cuba . . . I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who is fighting the relatives for custody,
``was very upset about the tape they did,'' former Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Gee, that's most unfortunate that they wouldn't have
the boy call you,' and he said, `Exactly!' '' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's response to the video was, ``If he wants to tell me
something, I'm his father, and we used to talk a lot,'' DeConcini
said. Questions have been raised about whether Elian's message was
coached.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini, who retired from the Senate in 1994, visited
Gonzalez, his wife and baby as a representative of a business and
political group seeking to re-establish U.S. trade relations with
Cuba. The meeting Thursday night took place in a highly secured,
split-level home in a modest subdivision outside Washington that is
home to the chief of the Cuban Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
   According to DeConcini, Gonzalez said he declined an offer to
remain in the United States that was conveyed by Lazaro Gonzalez,
Elian's great-uncle in Miami. Juan Miguel told DeConcini the deal
would have included $2 million, a job, a car and a home with a
swimming pool, all from influential Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been to Cuba and knowing how repressive it is, I was a
little surprised that he might not want to stay (in America). But
his answer was pretty fatherly, I thought,'' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no price for my kid's reunion with me, and we have a
home and a life in Cuba,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said through an
interpreter, according to DeConcini.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Castro foundation in Washington said Friday that
Gonzalez probably would receive aid from the Cuban-American
community if he remained, just like any other Cuban refugee. But a
foundation official called the $2 million ``nonsense'' and charged
that DeConcini was being used by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just stupefied that a man like Dennis DeConcini could go
into that house and think it is just a normal environment where
three people are free to express their opinions and make their
allegations and that we all should accept them at face value,''
said Jose Cardenas, director of the Cuban American National
Foundation, which has offices in Washington and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said that the father is ``under total control of the
Cuban government, he is a victim'' and that DeConcini is a pawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea about $2 million is just absolute nonsense. Of
course, somebody would probably provide him a job, but he'd have to
show up and work. The bottom line is, America itself is the
incentive for people to free tyranny. They can't be bought with
cars and cash.''
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini, highly critical of Castro while in the Senate, says
that Cuba no longer poses a threat and that the continued embargo
is inconsistent with U.S. economic interests. But DeConcini, who
led a fact-finding trip to Cuba last year, said he is not naive
about the pressures on Cuban citizens to conform to the interests
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him a ton (of questions), being a former (Pima County)
prosecutor. Why don't you defect? Did they offer you anything here?
Did Castro or anybody in the Cuban government put pressure on
you?'' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His answers were pretty typical of what you think a father
would say. He acknowledges that life is good in the United States,
and he says that. And he doesn't admit that communism is terrible,
but he says, `It's my home, my family is there,' and he shows me a
picture of his family _ father, grandmother, mother and brother and
cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother drowned off Florida last Thanksgiving during a
raft trip from Cuba, and he has been in the care of Miami relatives
during the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   DeConcini said he believes the Justice Department has purposely
dragged out the saga to be sure the father doesn't want to defect
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had plenty of time to do it. He's been out taking coffee
to the police out there. He could have gotten in the car and left.
He doesn't want to,'' DeConcini said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gonzalez ``had some tears in his eyes as he talked about
his son, because I asked him, `How much communication do you have
with your son? Are you allowed to talk with him?' '' DeConcini
said. &QL;

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _  &UR;  &LR; He came to Los Angeles Dodgers spring camp
claiming to be in the best shape of his life, and people nodded.
Heard that one before.
</P>
<P>
   Got off to a nice little start the first week and proclaimed,
``You ain't seen nothing yet.'' And they figured, right, how
original.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, it is clearly becoming time to pay attention to Gary
Sheffield. To what he says, maybe. To what he does, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing pitchers are, for all the good it's doing them. It
remains two very early weeks into the 2000 season, but Sheffield is
looking like a hitter who is out to prove something.
</P>
<P>
   Which it turns out, he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like the Dodgers haven't seen the best of me,''
Sheffield said. ``I just want to go out, do the best I can, and the
more games I play, the more you'll all see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are seeing plenty so far. Friday afternoon in their
home opener against the Reds, it was Sheffield opening the scoring
with his third home run. When the Reds tied the game, it was
Sheffield's hit that put the Dodgers back on top for good in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has hit in each of the Dodgers' first 10 games,
batting .429. Actually, he ended last season with a six-game
hitting streak, giving him a carryover streak of 16 games (.414).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is locked in,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
``He's had nothing but good at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every at-bat, there is a chance to see something happen. He's
fun to watch right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like success is new to the outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   He won a batting crown with the Padres at age 24. He had 42 home
runs and 120 RBI for the Marlins in 1996. The next year, he helped
lead the Marlins to their World Series title. Just last season, he
became the first Los Angeles Dodger to hit at least .300, with 30
home runs, 100 RBI, 100 walks and 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sheffield believes there is more to come, more to him than
the Dodgers have had chance to witness. That at age 31, the last
remaining Dodger acquired in the Mike Piazza trade can take his
game up another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like on the field, anything I put my mind to, I can
do,'' said Sheffield, who at one time briefly considered retiring.
``I have that enthusiasm back.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has left-handed Shawn Green hitting behind him, though
the Reds _ in the ultimate respect of the hot hitter _
intentionally walked him in the seventh to get to Green (who
doubled, to score two). Sheffield has been in the midst of his
recent tear, despite badly spraining his ankle Saturday in New
York. Briefly he was on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned,'' Malone said. ``That was like Black Sunday.
(Kevin) Brown fractures his pinkie, (Gregg) Olson irritates a nerve
in his elbow, (Eric) comes up with a sore back.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson wanted to give him a day off, but
Sheffield wasn't going to let something like a swollen right ankle
slow him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to rest him a game, but he wouldn't come out,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   With seven stints on the disabled list during his career,
Sheffield knows he has a reputation for being injury prone, and
it's one he wants to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, at least verbally, in his third season with the
Dodgers, Sheffield is emerging as a force at the plate and in the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's becoming a leader just by his performance,''
Malone said. ``He's stepped it up a notch. He sort of leads by
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sheffield: ``I can't say it's my team. I feel like I have a
role as a leader and I feel like guys respond to me. But I just go
out and play baseball.''

NO MO HITS IN LOSS

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Anaheim Angels starting pitcher Ken Hill had to leave
Friday night's game against the Chicago White Sox because of the
stomach flu, but after the Angels' 9-4 loss, it was Mo Vaughn who
was feeling sick.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Vaughn is fine. It was his 0-for-5 performance which
gave him that queasy feeling. Vaughn's batting average dipped to
.216, and he has only four RBI in 10 games this season. He had
opportunities Friday but left runners on base in his first four
at-bats in front of a home-opening crowd of 38,912 at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta get hot,'' Vaughn said. ``We gotta get consistent
production from 3-4-5. The opportunities are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Nos. 4 and 5 in the order weren't so bad Friday. Tim
Salmon had two doubles in the cleanup spot and Garret Anderson, who
signed a four-year contract extension, hit a two-run homer in the
No. 5 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn came up with nobody out and runners on first and third in
the first inning and popped out. With a runner on first and none
out in the third, he flied out. With a runner on first and one out
in the fifth, he hit into a double play. With a runner on third and
two out in the seventh, he struck out. His flyout in the ninth
ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm slowing down the chain,'' he said. ``I'm not doing the
things I'm capable of doing, things that should be done. I'm not
clicking right now. We could have been up, 1-0, 2-0, 3-0. I'm not
casting in, but I'll get it together and get hot. I gotta get it
together, and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels left the bases loaded in the top of the first,
the White Sox took the lead on Frank Thomas' solo homer with two
out in the bottom of the inning. In the second inning, Ray Durham
drove in a run with a sacrifice fly and Greg Norton scored two more
with a double for a 4-0 White Sox lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (1-2) worked a 1-2-3 third inning but gave up a run in the
fourth and didn't make it out of the inning. In 3 innings, Hill
gave up five runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Ken was under the weather a little bit, but there
never was a point where scratching him was an option,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He threw a lot of pitches and it
caught up with him. His command wasn't quite what it was in his
previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken's arm is live, it feels good. His mechanics were sound,
but his stamina wasn't there. Even between innings, the innings got
long and he got tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was back in his hotel room before the game was over, but
Angels catcher Bengie Molina said the weather added to Hill's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was moving everywhere, in and out, he's never had
that much movement on his ball,'' Molina said. ``His ball is
straight. The way it was moving tonight, it was the wind.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protesters for global justice call their
headquarters a convergence center, and the abandoned downtown
warehouse does seem to attract all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up against a mound of backpacks and surrounded by the
remnants of a donated macrobiotic lunch is James Osborne, a
23-year-old self-described ``transient'' from St. Louis. Osborne
said he took a Greyhound Bus to Washington because ``someone told
him'' about destructive pipeline projects and bad trade policies.
``I believe there should be no leadership and no organization,'' he
said, though he rejected the label of anarchist.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, David H. Richardson, a 57-year-old Ph.D. economist
at the U.S. Department of Labor, checks the schedule for civil
disobedience actions intended to shut down the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. Richardson is a shop steward of the
American Federation of Government Employees, and says he worked
hard to persuade the national union to endorse the officially
sanctioned portion of the demonstrations scheduled for Sunday,
which it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is at the point that it needs support from outside the
movement,'' said Richardson, looking a little like a headmaster in
a high-school playground. ``Globalization brings a lot of different
people together.''
</P>
<P>
   If they accomplish nothing else, this week's series of protests
against the financial institutions and in favor of debt relief for
the Third World do seem likely to confirm Richardson's observation.
Globalization and the backlash against it bring disparate people
together. The cry to temper the march of capitalism around the
globe comes from voices as diverse as the Catholic Church, a cell
of anarchists and many people and organizations in between.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this unlikely coalition of protesters
and interest groups is, like so many grains of sand blown together,
liable to scatter once its members make a collective point or
achieve individual goals. Or, as some leaders hope, whether it is
the foundation of a new social movement that will apply sustained
pressure on national governments and international institutions to
rewrite the rules of globalization and limit the power of
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Though some environmental groups began pressuring international
financial institutions to become more ecologically sensitive two
decades ago, the movement is still in its infancy. The big bang for
American organizers came only a few months ago, during the Seattle
protests against the World Trade Organization, when they took
credit not only for befuddling police but also for contributing to
the collapse of world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington protests, which began last Sunday with a quiet
rally for debt forgiveness and will culminate this Sunday with an
effort to prevent world finance ministers from attending the spring
meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, are the second big test for
the movement. While it is having some social and political impact,
its main achievement is probably logistical: uniting groups with
different agendas around a common cause and attracting new
recruits, especially college students and unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met some steelworkers and we bonded right away,'' said
Margareta Lelea, 20, a sophomore at the University of
California-Davis. The agricultural development major, who stuck a
green star on her face for ``ecological awareness,'' came early to
Washington to attend nonviolence training seminars at the
convergence center. It is the first major protest she has attended,
though she sympathized with those who opposed NATO's bombing of
Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of union people as interested in the same
issues, but they are,'' she said. ``There's all kinds of
interconnections being made. Without interconnections there's no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke among lieutenants who pulled together the protest is
that there are as many 501-C-3s in their ranks as there are people,
a reference to the IRS form that independent, nonprofit groups must
file each year. The movement against the World Bank and the IMF is
in some way less a mobilization of the masses than a convention of
nongovernment organizations _citizens groups that have individual
agendas, fund-raising campaigns and, in many cases, leaders with
large egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we got people together is that we let everyone
represent their group. They don't have to join our group,'' said
Kevin Danaher, a founder of Global Exchange, one of the groups
instrumental in igniting the protests in Seattle and Washington.
``Is a lot easier for people to compromise when they don't really
have to subordinate their egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Danaher is 49 years old, tall and bald with a white goatee. He
traces his roots as a protester to the anti-apartheid movement in
the 1980s. More recently, he has led campaigns against Nike,
persuading the company to improve conditions for foreign factory
workers, and Starbucks, in which he successfully urged the coffee
chain to sell coffee produced under the TransFair ``fair trade''
label that claims to share profits with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Danaher is a smooth talker who has traveled the country,
speaking at scores of campuses as a kind of Paul Revere for
globalization's woes. But he says he is just an adviser to the
protests against the World Bank and IMF.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him describe it, the movement has thrived in part
because it rejects the straight-jacket of a typical political or
social movement, with its leaders and head offices and official
strategies. That allows groups to flow in and out without draining
the movement as a whole. Greenpeace, one big player in the world of
environmental activism, used to campaign against the World Bank and
IMF, but has no official role in this weekend's events.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The unofficial lieutenants of the Mobilization for Global
Justice, as the Washington protests were named, have used the
Internet to connect environmental, religious, labor and student
groups that would otherwise not be in regular contact, some 500 of
them in total.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of citizens groups autonomously coordinating
strategy has proved its effectiveness. A Rand Corp. study for the
Pentagon detailed how Mexico's Zapatista rebel movement in 1994
used media-savvy tactics _ a ``social netwar,'' the study dubbed it
_ to generate support abroad for its campaign against the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The study said swarms of independent
citizens groups can prove far more effective than the hierarchical
movements when combating established institutions because they
can't easily be ``decapitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Danaher admires the Zapatista model. ``We also have a
mosquito-bite strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the movement's strength, but it is also a weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the main backers worry that the movement's successes to
date have been purely tactical _ headline-grabbing civil
disobedience and a flair for organization. They fret that the
coalition could blow apart as quickly as it came together.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the strains are showing. Though religious groups are
one of the main forces behind debt relief, they have refrained from
any direct involvement in the demonstrations this Sunday. Instead,
they scheduled their own rally last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam and Greenpeace, two the best-known names in social and
environmental activism, have severed formal ties to key umbrella
coalitions of protesters, though members of both groups are still
participating in the protests. The split came about partly over
goals. Oxfam officials, for example, say they have made progress
trying to reform the World Bank, and getting government to agree to
debt relief. Global Exchange, in contrast, wants the bank and fund
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much of this has been about tactics, getting all these
groups together and keeping things moving,'' said John Sellers, of
the Berkeley, Calif.-based Ruckus Society. The observation is
especially poignant coming from Sellers, a Greenpeace veteran who
moved to the Ruckus Socity several years ago. He runs training
camps around the country to teach varied protesters the mechanics
of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Over a beer at a Washington bookshop-cafe one recent evening,
Sellers seemed unsure whether the movement could sustain its
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if we're going to have a center of gravity we have to
figure out really what we want and where we go from here,'' he
said.

BRUINS FINALLY GET VICTORY OVER NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They are headed in opposite directions. The Cal
State Northridge and UCLA baseball teams have different goals,
though.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins want to be in the College World Series this year.
Northridge wants to be in the mix for the College World Series as
well, though maybe two seasons from now.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Friday night's game between UCLA and Northridge
seemed so, well, blah.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used a three-run fifth to break open a close game and
won 10-5 at Jackie Robinson Stadium. But there were hardly any
nervous moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a scout-league game atmosphere,'' said Northridge
coach Mike Batesole, alluding to exhibition games played against
each other by college teams each fall. ``Our goal is to keep
throwing the young guys out there. (UCLA) is a top-five team. It's
good for us to look at what we want to be someday.''
</P>
<P>
   True, 15th-ranked UCLA (24-13) went into this three-game
nonconference series against Northridge leading the Pac-10 at 6-2.
The Bruins are better than the Matadors (13-24) across the board.
</P>
<P>
   So it is satisfying for Batesole to see CSUN trailing 3-2 after
three innings and 6-3 going into the bottom of the seventh. But
there were painful visions.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hit into two double plays, had two hits against Bruins
starter Ryan Karp (5-1) and had a runner picked off second base in
the fifth _ after a successful sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time next year, this better not be happening,'' Batesole
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the staid appearance of the game, the Bruins did have
motivation _ they hadn't beaten the Matadors since 1995 and CSUN
was 4-0-1 in the teams' last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no clue it was five years. Wow,'' said UCLA left fielder
Bill Scott, who was 4 for 5 with a double and two RBI. ``We haven't
forgotten what's happened. Last year, they took it to us (CSUN won
10-4 in Northridge). It was a pride thing; we've had some bad
performances against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Karp, a sophomore right-hander, had his second consecutive
quality start. He allowed two unearned runs, both in the third, and
struck out six. Left-hander Ryan Carter gave up four hits and two
runs in 2 innings of relief for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karp and Carter are two of the best 20 pitchers in the country
right now,'' Batesole said.
</P>
<P>
   A bright spot for Northridge was right fielder Tim Coltey, who
had three hits and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always doing good things,'' said Coltey, a freshman from
Long Beach, ``but they're not enough to get the (win). We came in
here pumped up. We're always thinking positive.''

NO CRIMES FOUND AT BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Infuriating Los Angeles Unified's inspector
general, local, county and state prosecutors on Friday said
insufficient evidence exists to prove environmental crimes were
committed during the development of the ill-fated, $175 &UR;  &LR; million
Belmont Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's, Los Angeles County District
Attorney's and City Attorney's offices reported separately that
none of the suspected felonies or misdemeanors can be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer found that no state agency failed
to perform its oversight duties as required by law during the
planning or construction of the nation's costliest high school,
which was abandoned before completion because of environmental and
financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti's lead environmental prosecutor
contended that the environmental conditions at Belmont are not
unique and ``appear to be very limited,'' adding to an already
fierce debate over the safety of the 35-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   And City Attorney James Hahn's office said insufficient evidence
existed to prove any misdemeanors and noted that even if there were
proof, the statute of limitations for prosecution already had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement agencies based their conclusions primarily upon
a six-month review of the evidence compiled by LAUSD Inspector
General Don Mullinax. City and county prosecutors said they also
conducted independent reviews of the project and consulted with
state and local regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly angry, Mullinax categorized the response as a
``brush-off'' that would set a dangerous precedent of companies not
being punished for breaking environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for the children and the taxpayers of Los
Angeles,'' Mullinax said. ``(These decisions) show that children
can be put at potential risk and taxpayers' dollars wasted, but no
one is held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax added that developers across the state should joyously
proclaim: ``This is a great day. ... We can build where we want,
skirt the law and no one will hold us accountable!.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his lead investigators was more direct. ``This is clearly
a prosecutorial whitewash of Belmont,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school board voted in January to kill the project, a
debate over the safety of the campus has intensified and become
increasingly politicized. Along with the school's unprecedented
price tag, the main disagreement centers around whether toxic
hydrogen sulfide and explosive methane rising from an oil field
below the site make it unsafe and if so, there is vast disagreement
about whether a fail-safe technical fix can be designed and
installed to protect students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the attorney general's, district
attorney's, and city attorney's offices rejected Mullinax's
criticism and allegations of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed with the internal auditor's response,
which attempts to deflect attention away from the fact that (the)
report simply does not support the allegations of criminal
wrongdoing,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a violation of the public trust for any
prosecutorial agency to file criminal charges when there is
insufficient evidence to support the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Vincent B. Sato, supervisor of the
environmental protection section, added: ``This is not a whitewash.
Very experienced and seasoned environmental prosecutors worked on
this for quite some time. There just wasn't anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Head Deputy District Attorney John Paul Bernardi, who heads up
the environmental crimes division, said Mullinax was off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary jurisdiction in the case was felonies. They didn't
show us any felonies,'' Bernardi said.
</P>
<P>
   He then added, ``I am not convinced that they have demonstrated
the methane problem that was described.''
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential referral sent last September to the three
agencies, as well as the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mullinax said his
million-dollar audit found ``reasonable cause to believe'' that the
developer, former school boards, state agencies and several
environmental consultants violated environmental, hazardous waste,
and education laws and statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax singled out Temple Beaudry Partners _ a consortium led
by Kajima Urban Development _ and environmental consultants El
Capitan, CalEx, Intera, Law/Crandall and Remedial Management Corp.
None of the firms responded to requests on Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Mullinax has a ``reasonable cause to believe'' crimes were
committed, prosecutors said, the same evidence failed to provide
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which must be met in a criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the past six months, representatives from each agency
have met repeatedly to reach a consensus on their handling of the
Belmont fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies did not address findings contained in Mullinax's
second audit of Belmont, which documented a long list of alleged
financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the prosecutorial agencies on the suspected
financial crimes are expected this summer. One official involved in
the review of Mullinax's second audit described the financial
allegations as ``more promising than the environmental stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Mike Lansing, who supports abandoning
Belmont, said he now hopes to push for completion of a final
battery of environmental tests by the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, one of the
project's most vocal supporters, and state Assemblyman Antonio
Villaraigosa, a mayoral candidate, have offered to find the
$1million needed to complete the tests.
</P>
<P>
   School board members Valerie Fields and Caprice Young, who both
voted with a five-person majority to abandon Belmont, said they
accept the prosecutorial decisions, but showed no sign of changing
their stance on the school's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have, in a criminal finding, a very high level of
proof, and that's very hard to get,'' Fields said. ``It may be
unethical, but it may not rise to that level.''
</P>
<P>
   While nearly identical in their conclusions, the state, county
and city presented their evaluation of Mullinax's allegations to
the public in very different forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office issued a brief statement from
Lockyer but would not release its report. A spokeswoman said the
report was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Daily News obtained a copy of an 18-page report
written by Richard M. Frank, chief assistant attorney general. It
focuses almost entirely on the responsibility of state agencies,
including the Department of Conservation, Department of Toxic
Substances Control, Department of Education, Division of Oil and
Gas, and the Governor's Office of Planning and Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the affected state agencies performed well and
faithfully executed their responsibilities under California Law,''
Frank wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The City Attorney's Office released a 25-page packet that
addressed each of the allegations in Mullinax's referral letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are concerned that the on-site methane
accumulation at the Belmont Learning Complex poses a threat to
public safety, as prosecutors we are ethically bound to consider
only legally admissible evidence in making a charging
determination,'' the City Attorney's report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office released a 57-page report,
supported by more than 400 pages of exhibits, including aerial
photos and detailed maps.
</P>
<P>
   Since construction was temporarily halted at Belmont in February
1999, Garcetti has faced mounting criticism over his handling of
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the described conduct would support a felony
prosecution,'' the report said, suggesting administrative or civil
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page, written critique of Garcetti's report, Mullinax
refused to back down from his belief that key players involved in
Belmont broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly troubling, Mullinax insisted, was Garcetti's lack
of interest in the failure of Belmont's developer and a contractor
to alert the city's fire department that they had found significant
amounts of explosive methane gas in areas they previously said were
clean. The companies delayed giving fire officials the updated
information for six months, Mullinax said, while buildings were
under construction on the site.
</P>
<P>
   If the city had received that information in time, Mullinax
said, proper protections against methane buildup could have been
designed and installed. Other Los Angeles buildings in the vicinity
have included such protections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it the right way,'' Mullinax said. ``They didn't put
up a building first and then say, whoops.''
</P>
<P>
   City and county prosecutors said that no basis exists for
criminal prosecution of the developer for its handling of the
site's methane conditions or its dealings with the fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Temple Beaudry Partners, which was fired by the district last
November, has denied any wrongdoing.

SANCTUARY DISPUTES ALLEGATIONS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wildlife Waystation officials vowed Friday to
fight allegations that the facility is unsafe even as state
officials released details of problems that caused them to halt
tours and other operations.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency said it found hundreds of Fish and Game Code
violations when a team of 20 inspected the exotic animal sanctuary
last month. The most serious include allegations of allowing
wastewater to flow into a stream and caging that does not meet
state codes.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife Waystation founder and director Martine Colette, who
said she feels betrayed and unjustly accused, assembled her own
team of researchers and other supporters and even actress Dyan
Cannon at a news conference at the facility Friday to help counter
the state's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters said the 1,200 lions, tigers, monkeys and other
animals receive top-shelf care at the nation's largest rescue
sanctuary for exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way station performs an incredible duty for animals in
need,'' said James Mahoney, a research professor from New York
University's School of Medicine, who flew in to Los Angeles to
speak on the way station's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney gave about 50 chimpanzees to the way station in 1995
when the university research laboratory he worked in was being
turned over to a private researcher. Mahoney said he searched the
United States for a place to house the chimps and chose the way
station.
</P>
<P>
   He visits the animals regularly and said they receive
``exemplary care.''
</P>
<P>
   A concern that any of the chimps are HIV positive or have
hepatitis B is unfounded, Mahoney said. That conclusion, he
believes, may have been drawn because the animals were involved
with research for finding vaccines for both diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The health of the chimps remains a concern, however, for Fish
and Game officials, who said they have still not received health
records requested weeks ago. State officials have expressed concern
that a quarantined chimp has not been properly isolated .
</P>
<P>
   The chimps' health was not, however, among the concerns outlined
in a five-page letter sent to the way station on Friday. The letter
details 10 specific alleged violations found during the three-day
inspection. Most refer to water problems such as trash and other
possible dangerous items found within 150 feet of a stream.
</P>
<P>
   Colette said the entire 160 acres of the way station is near or
part of a stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot get 150 feet away from the water,'' she said. ``The
garbage in my office can't be 150 feet away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game officials maintain they saw workers spraying feces
into a stream. They declined to release tapes they have said
support their allegations, saying the tapes are part of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Blevins, watermaster for the San Fernando Valley, said
that in more than 20 years of inspecting the area, he has not found
the way station to be responsible for water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing going on here that is adverse to the water
quality in the San Fernando Valley,'' Blevins said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 cages were inspected last month and state
officials said two-thirds are out of compliance. Half of those have
``minor deficiencies, but the remainder have substantial problems
that may be difficult to bring into conformance,'' according to the
letter sent by Michael R. Valentine, an attorney for the California
Department of Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game spokesman Steve Martarano said the next step is to
set up a meeting with way station officials to work out the
problems.

HOME FOUND FOR ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Garret Anderson found a home in center field after the
trade of Jim Edmonds last month, and Friday the Angels signed him
to a contract extension that will keep him at home through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who is making $3.25 million this year in the final
year of his current contract, is believed to be getting a deal
worth between $19-21 million over four years beginning with the
2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made it clear in recent weeks he wanted to stay in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the direction the team is going,'' said Anderson, 27.
``The coaches, the direction of the front office and some of the
moves they made. And the people who I work with every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual, especially after Anderson had his best
season in 1999 _ 157 games, .303 average, 21 homers, 80 RBI, 188
hits _ and was the club's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're full of surprises,'' general manager Bill Stoneman
joked. ``We started to work on it in spring training, but it took a
little bit of time. It was something neither of us wanted to carry
into the season, but it seemed like it made tons of sense to keep
it going because it was something both sides wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who was reared in Granada Hills and lives in Sand
Canyon, said staying close to home was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely something I wanted to do, but I didn't know
how possible it was going to be,'' he said. ``I had to be ready for
the reality it might not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!What a rookie:!off! The Angels have had only one American
League rookie of the year in club history _ Tim Salmon in 1993 _
but have two who could contend for the award this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Ortiz (1-0, 3.60 ERA) won his first start of the season,
but even more impressive so far has been sec- ond baseman Adam
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, acquired from the Cardinals in the trade for Edmonds,
had three hits Friday and is now hitting .357 with a team-high five
stolen bases. But Rookie of the Year?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so early, so far off,'' the former Cal State Northridge
standout said. ``It's not what anybody in here wants to hear about,
as far as what your mindset should be. Something like that comes
with the team's success.''

LAKERS HOLD OFF KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At some later date, perhaps in another week or
so, the wisdom of the Los Angeles Lakers' strategy Friday night may
be called into question. For now, it will go down as just another
satisfying, if meaningless, victory on the way to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lakers meet the Sacramento Kings when those playoffs
begin,they'll have only themselves to blame for orchestrating the
matchup with their toughest possible first-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Sacramento, 121-114, at Staples Center, the Lakers
prevented the seventh-seeded Kings from gaining a game on the
eighth-seeded Seattle SuperSonics. If the Kings, just a game up on
Seattle, slip to the No. 8 slot, it means a first-round meeting
with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   And few teams have, in the words of coach Phil Jackson, been as
befuddling to the Lakers as the Kings _ whose point total Friday
was the most scored against the Lakers this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the season series, 3-1, including both games at
Staples. But this game was typical of the way things have gone _
with the Kings pushing the Lakers to the brink at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   It took a monstrous, 41-point night from Shaquille O'Neal to
hold off the scrappy Kings. O'Neal, playing his first game in more
than a week after resting a sprained left ankle, made 16 of 29
field goals and 9 of 15 free throws to go with 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added 31 points and Glen Rice scored 24, making 8 of
13 field goals. Ron Harper had 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento took a 15-point lead in the first half, watched the
the Lakers wipe it out and build a double-digit lead in the second
half, then clawed back in the final minutes to make things
interesting again.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 13 points in the fourth, the Kings
pulledwithin three points, 111-108, with just over three minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant hit a pair of free throws and a fadeaway jumper that
bounced up and in as the Lakers pulled away again. Rice and Bryant
combined for six free throws down the stretch to put it away as the
Lakers _ who already have clinched the league's best record _
improved to 65-13, with three games left to play.[ep They survived
a 36-point, 10-rebound night from Chris Webber, who has given them
fits in every meeting this season.
</P>
<P>
   Having weathered Bryant's one-game suspension, Harper's one-game
rest and O'Neal's two-game respite, the Lakers trotted out their
regular starting five for the first time in five games. But they
looked more like third-stringers in the first half, as the Lakers
fell to a 65-57 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings came out with their usual rapid-fire offense, and
almost everything seemed to find the net as they made 58.7 percent
of their shots,led by a 21-point, 9-for-12 effort from Chris
Webber.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the worst defensive halves of the season for the
Lakers,who lead the league in opponents' field-goal percentage
(.414). The 65 points scored by the Kings was one point shy of the
most allowed by the Lakers in a half this season. And Sacramento's
39-point first quarter was the most scored by a Laker opponent in
any quarter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson made 5 of 7 shots for 14 points as the Kings built
as much as a 15-point lead in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers stayed in the game on the strength of O'Neal's 19
points, Bryant's 12 points and a 7-point effort off the bench from
Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, O'Neal showed little rust after a one-week layoff
to heal a sprained left ankle. He missed 4 of his first 5
field-goal attempts, but quickly settled into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson figured O'Neal would have no trouble reacclimating after
his only injury absence of the season. Asked before the game what
he anticipated, Jackson quipped, ``I expect 50 points, 20 rebounds,
10 blocks, five assists.''

War II changed Africa forever, in great part because the European
colonial powers drafted hundreds of thousands of young men like
Dibba from the remotest corners of their African colonies and sent
them to places they never knew existed. A clear moral imperative
may have guided U.S. and British soldiers as they fought in Europe
and Asia, but for many African soldiers _ fighting as they did for
their colonial masters, the same men who talked of battling the

   ``Big business is on a collision course with American democracy,
and American democracy has been losing,'' said Nader, who in his
dark suit was the most conventional-looking person in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The man who became famous by killing off a sporty but unstable
little car called the Corvair some 35 years ago is at it again,
running for president on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his previous presidential effort in 1996, when he
refused to raise money, spent less than $5,000 and attracted barely
1 percent of the vote, this time he is serious, Nader insists. And
that could spell trouble for Vice President Al Gore, from whose
Democratic column Nader is likely to draw most of his votes,
political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically said I wasn't going to campaign in '96,'' said
Nader. ``This is a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is cranking up that campaign just in time to step onto the
world stage this weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters
descend on Washington to demonstrate against the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Green Party affiliates from
around the world are playing a major role in the protests, and
Nader himself will address demonstrators near the White House on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not to win, of course, but to get more than 5
percent of the vote, the number that would qualify Nader for
millions in federal campaign matching funds that he says he would
use to build the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Green Party breaks 5 percent, the Democratic Party
won't be the same again,'' said Nader, still irrepressibly dour and
hauntingly hungry-looking at 66, reflecting on the prospect of
undercutting the influence of the centrist Democratic Leadership
Council and its president, Al From. ``If you think Al From and the
Democratic Leadership Council has a grip on the Democratic Party,
wait and see what a significant and growing progressive third party
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vice President Al Gore, the apparent Democratic
nominee, say they are not losing sleep over a Nader challenge.
Nader is not the most skillful of campaigners, and even many
liberal allies question his ability to move voters. Further, the
Green Party is better known for its internal squabbling than its
ability to run campaigns or raise money. Nader's aides say they
have raised thousands of dollars so far, but will not file their
first campaign finance report until next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's yielding even a few percentage points to Nader could
be damaging to the vice president if the election is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent poll by the Zogby Group showed Nader receiving
more support than Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate,
5 percent to 3 percent. The poll indicated that the vast majority
of Nader's support came from Democrats and that he was doing
particularly well in California, considered a vital state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   All of this suggests that an aggressive Nader campaign could
eliminate any advantages Gore might have gained from Buchanan, who
is expected to siphon votes from the likely Republican candidate,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nader intends to remain a thorn in Gore's side by promoting
issues that many liberals _ a large number of whom defected to Bill
Bradley in the Democratic primaries _ say the Clinton
administration has neglected: universal health care, urban poverty,
the environment and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Bradley, Nader _ like Buchanan _ is a fierce opponent
of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade
Organization, endearing him to traditionally Democratic union
members who feel the Clinton administration's free-trade policies
have hurt American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have very little loyalty to either party,'' Nader
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Nader contends that he expects to draw almost equally from both
major parties. But Republicans are a rare species in his crowds.
More common are disaffected Democrats like Stanley Campbell, 49,
who voted for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 but feels Gore has
become Bush's look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bore versus Gush,'' said Campbell, the director a church
social service agency who watched Nader speak in Dekalb, Ill.,
recently. ``I just don't know if there would be much difference
between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that this year will be different from 1996, Nader
says he has hired 15 full-time campaign workers in Washington and
will soon dispatch 10 more _ possibly including former Bradley
campaign organizers _ to get him on the ballot in every state. (The
Green Party is already on the ballot in 13 states, including New
York and California.)
</P>
<P>
   He has also vowed to raise $5 million, and he says he may get
some help from celebrities like Paul Newman, Warren Beatty and
Susan Sarandon, and musicians like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and
the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   But to get anywhere near 5 percent, Nader will have to overcome
some big obstacles, not the least of which is the Green Party
itself. The party is notoriously disorganized and fractious, with
some groups opposing any involvement in electoral politics and
others supporting another candidate, Jello Biafra, the former lead
singer for the rock group the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Nader. Gawky, shy and prone to long speeches,
he is the first to acknowledge that he is not the world's best
campaigner. He is, for one thing, painfully uncomfortable with
asking people for their votes. Last week, for instance, a Delta
Airlines workers stopped him in the Minneapolis airport to say,
``I'm a big fan.'' All Nader could say in return was, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigning takes a level of political ego I just don't have
yet,'' he said after the man had sped off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is also notoriously private, refusing to tell even co-workers
where he lives. (It is in an apartment he rents in the Dupont
Circle section of Washington.) And the only crumbs of biographical
information he salts into his hour-long speeches are passing
references to his Connecticut hometown of Winsted. Rarely does he
mention that he is the son of Lebanese immigrants, that his father
owned a restaurant, that he studied Chinese at Princeton and law at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His secretiveness has spawned a host of dark theories among his
critics. Some contend that despite his seemingly penurious
lifestyle, he is actually quite wealthy. Some contend that he lives
in a million-dollar town house here, not in the ill-furnished
apartment of Nader lore. (Nader says the town house he has been
spotted entering is his sister's.) They say that despite his
seemingly penurious way of living, he is actually quite wealthy,
that he purposely spent almost nothing on his 1996 campaign to
skirt federal election laws, which require candidates who spend
more than $5,000 to file reports disclosing their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says he will file a financial disclosure report next
month. It will show, he said, that despite his attacks on genetic
engineering firms and Microsoft, he owns technology stocks. It will
also disclose, he said, that he earned about $200,000 last year in
speaking fees but gave half of it to charities. Most of his
remaining earnings went toward ``projects.'' He lives on about
$25,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how such a private man could run for such a public job,
Nader, who has never been married, replied, ``When you work all the
time you don't have a problem in terms of private time. There is no
private time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among many leftists, Nader is not considered the dream
candidate. In a recent essay in The Nation, Katha Pollitt
complained that Nader was a less than scintillating standard-bearer
and that his 1996 campaign had focused too much on trade issues to
the exclusion of other issues dear to the left, such as race
relations, health care, and gay and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of progressives cranking up an organization, raising
funds, fomenting energy and enthusiasm on behalf of this doomed
project,'' Pollitt wrote, ``well, it's just too depressing. If
working on Nader's campaign is the best way progressives can spend
the next eight months, it's time to hire a hearse and lie down in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who says he is running partly at the behest of Green
Party leaders, replied, ``I think she ran out of material that
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his platform seems to reflect some of the criticisms of
progressives like Pollitt. At the top is universal health care
followed by an anti-poverty program built heavily on
consumer-protection ideas, including loan discrimination by banks,
high auto insurance rates and landlord abuses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate welfare,'' one of his favorite issues, will also
play front-and-center in his campaign as he rages against
government tax-breaks and subsidies which allow big companies ``to
privatize profits and socialize risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to win support from social conservatives, he
plans to attack big media corporations for exploiting children with
their racy programming and aggressive marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   While he is counting on anti-trade protests this week to raise
his national profile, Nader says his best hope for gaining
attention will be to squeeze between Gore and Bush in televised
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The private commission that will determine presidential debate
participants has said candidates must be receiving 15 percent in
national polls to be included. Nader contends the threshold is
ridiculously high and plans to recruit Buchanan to protest the
process. And he said that if he prevails he hopes to raise the kind
of questions that will spark interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates are asked, What is your position on welfare, what
is your position on crime?' '' Nader said. That's not the right
question. It needs an adjective. What is your position on corporate
welfare? What is your position on corporate crime? We're going to
open this up. We're going to provide adjectives to these issues.''

HOME AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG SPOON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Well, they did it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got their home opener in before the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Forced by the schedule makers to wait nearly two weeks into the
season to play a home game, the Dodgers tried to make up for lost
time here Friday afternoon. And although dark clouds and a couple
light showers threatened the festivities, there was just no way
they were going to rain out the Dodgers' parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers paraded 16-year-old drummers in the outfield. They
paraded 41-year-old Orel Hershiser to the mound. The drummers
drummed, the Bulldog growled and the Dodgers beat big, bad Ken
Griffey Jr. and the Cincinnati Reds, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   All is well in the ``new and improved`` Dodger Stadium, where
the foul territory is shrinking as fast as the Krispy Kreme
doughnut stands are moving in.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, soon to become the fourth oldest ballpark in the
major leagues, is a mere shadow of its former self. Fox has gone
corporate on the Dodgers, cluttering up the club level with 33 new
luxury boxes. Not only that, they took out the landmark sunken
``dugout`` boxes behind home plate and replaced them with nine new
rows of seats in a little neighborhood they call the Dugout Club.
</P>
<P>
   Fans there were even closer to the plate Friday than was
Hershiser, who played out a 1988 highlight reel for six innings
before retiring to the real dugout with a 2-1 lead and eventually
the win. Presumably, he is not after Dave Johnson's job for at
least another five days.
</P>
<P>
   The more things change, the more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like Dodger Stadium, it felt like L.A., but it
definitely felt like a different ballpark,'' said Hershiser, who
returned to the Dodgers this spring after a five-year absence. ``It
felt different to look in to the catcher and see people right
there. Before, there was always an optical ilusion that the catcher
was out there all alone for you to focus on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop the distractions from coming in. The yellow
seats, which have always stood out in the background here. The
(outfield) wall with all that stuff (murals) on it when you look
out there. You have to keep control of every thought when you're
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you're 41 and your Bulldog status admittedly is
now more like that of a cocker spaniel with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hershiser allowed only six hits in six innings, including
a home run to Aaron Boone leading off the third. Yes, he got
Griffey to ground into a double play in the first inning and
retired him on an inning-ending grounder with a man on third in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But he also threw 98 pitches, worked out of a stretch about half
the time and failed to argue with Johnson when the manager
suggested perhaps that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a mutual agreement,'' Hershiser said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? No harm done. The man knows his limits, the fans got
their thrill and the Dodgers won anyway, jumping on Reds relievers
for six runs in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   So Hershiser uses his changeup a little more these days because
his fastball lost some of its fast and his sinker lost some of its
sink. So what? As long as he keeps games close and the fans
continue to fall for a guy with a baby face who tries real hard to
scowl, Orel will be around a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up some days and I feel like a kid, and other days I get
up feeling like I'm 41,'' Hershiser said. ``You hope the days you
pitch, you feel like a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was one of those days. This was not a hard one to get up
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. The man lives a charmed life.

LEGAL ASPECTS OF ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE ARE CUT AND DRIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 2nd-to-last graf.)  
(With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal battle over Elian Gonzalez turns on a narrow question
of law that makes the political fight over whether the boy should
be raised under communism virtually irrelevant to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   That question is who has the power to make decisions for the
6-year old child in deciding whether to seek political asylum in
this country, legal experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father has said he does not want to seek asylum for
Elian but the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed an
application in Elian's name on Dec. 10. He then sued when
immigration officials refused to accept the application.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is who speaks for the child,'' said Linda Silberman,
a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on
international child custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country,'' Silberman continued, ``we treat family
relationships as sacred. We don't go looking at whether people are
poor, at what people's political views are, and we only intervene
in a family when there is a very high threshold of proof that a
child is in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The case centering on the asylum issue reached the federal
appeals court in Atlanta after a decision in federal court in Miami
went against the boy's Miami relatives. It has become the main
legal battleground in the case.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the suit that a judge on the appeals court issued a
temporary order on Thursday barring Elian's father from taking the
boy back to Cuba until the full court could review a request by the
Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United States while the court
considers their case.
</P>
<P>
   Most other issues that have been swirling in the news media and
politics _ including the question of what is in Elian's ``best
interests'' _ are peripheral and are expected to be swept aside as
the appeals court begins its examination of the case, legal experts
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez is contesting a March ruling in favor of the
federal government and the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, by
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore in Miami. He ruled that
immigration officials had the power to decide, as they did this
winter, that the father, not the great-uncle, spoke for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The father had told immigration officials in Havana in December,
``He should be returned immediately to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration officials' decision, Moore said, was based in
part on two interviews they conducted with Gonzalez in Cuba in
December. The officials found no evidence that Gonzalez was an
abusive father, the judge said, which would be a ground to deprive
him of the presumption that he speaks for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Congress had given immigration officials sweeping
powers to make such decisions and had sharply limited the power of
courts to review those decisions. Only when immigration officials
abuse their discretion, for example, by making decisions that have
no basis in fact, can courts overturn the rulings. The judge held
that in Elian's case there was no abuse of discretion by
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Miami relatives have asserted that the
father cannot speak freely because he is under the control of the
Castro government. When U.S. officials met with Gonzalez in Cuba,
they tried to assess whether he was able to answer freely by giving
him written questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   He answered that he was offended that the Miami relatives were
``questioning my paternity rights.'' The Miami relatives have said
such answers cannot have been freely made because the Castro regime
is authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it was standard in cases of small children
for their parents to speak for them. ``A bedrock principle of the
Constitution is that strangers and even relatives have no right to
interfere with a parent's right to custody of his or her child,''
said Michael R. Masinter, a professor of constitutional law at Nova
Southeastern University Law Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said there is no absolute age when children are
considered able to make decisions like whether they will seek
asylum. In one much-publicized case in 1980, a Ukranian immigrant,
Walter Polovchak, was considered old enough to seek asylum at age
12, even though his parents wanted him to return to Ukraine. But
the experts said they knew of no case where a child as young as 6
was considered mature enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Friday that the legal posture of Elian's case has
been confused in public commentary about it.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Miami relatives, for example, have advocated
that the decisions concerning Elian should be handled by a Florida
family court. They have said that is because a family court judge
would consider the ``best interests of the child,'' a legal
standard typically applied in state courts when there is a contest
over the custody of a child between two parents.
</P>
<P>
   That position gained support in early January, when a Florida
circuit court judge, Rosa Rodriguez, issued an order in favor of
the Miami relatives. But this week, a new state judge in the case,
Jennifer Bailey of Miami-Dade Circuit Court, said the boy's
great-uncle had no legal standing even to raise the question of
what would be in Elian's best interest. Florida family law holds
that he is too distant a relative to make a claim against the
father, she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey also said the immigration official's decision to defer to
Elian's father's wishes superceded any state court power in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Further confusing the legal picture, a lawyer for the Miami
relatives filed a separate suit Friday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, asking the court to bar Elian's return to Cuba unless
government officials could certify that the Castro government would
not violate his human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Michael C. Dorf, a professor at Columbia University Law School,
said that would be a difficult suit for the Miami relatives to win
because it would give anyone who is dissatisfied with a decision
denying an asylum application a human rights claim. In addition,
Dorf said, the Washington court would be reluctant to wade into a
case that is already before the federal appeals court in Atlanta.

PENTAGON RULES OUT MISCONDUCT PROBE OF GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert `deputy' in 12th graf.)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's inspector general Friday dismissed
all accusations against Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, who has
accused another Army general of sexual harassment, according to a
senior Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   The one-week inquiry found that there was ``no basis
whatsoever'' for the accusations made by a retired Army officer who
sent an electronic message to the Pentagon on April 7 accusing
Kennedy of personal misconduct during the 1980s, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was found,'' the official said. ``There is no there
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon refused to identify the retired officer who made
the accusation against Kennedy, the highest ranking woman in the
Army, just weeks after it was disclosed that she had filed a
complaint accusing another general of groping her in her office in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation against Kennedy had further upset senior Army
officers already divided over the first sexual harassment complaint
brought by one Army general against another. Kennedy's defenders
said they were not surprised that the accusations were groundless,
saying they were a predictable attempt to undermine her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely classic _ we've seen this in every single
case where a woman has stepped forward and made an allegation and
gotten any kind of notoriety,'' said Susan Barnes, a lawyer who has
represented military women who have brought sexual harassment
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Several women officers praised the Pentagon for quickly handling
the inquiry into the accusations against Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very crucial that this was taken care of quickly,''
said one woman who is a senior officer. ``Most of us recognize that
these things happen, and there is a tendency to blame the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy filed her complaint against Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith
last August _ accusing him of sexual harassment four years earlier
_ after she discovered that he had been appointed deputy inspector
general of the Army and would have responsibility over such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to comment on her accusation or discuss the
investigation of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said, however, that the Army inspector
general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, is still interviewing witnesses
in that case, which is complicated because Kennedy did not make a
complaint at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And without a complaint in his file, Smith appeared to be a
credible candidate for the post of deputy inspector general, said
one Army official.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Kennedy's said Friday that she has told them in the
last week that she expected accusations to be made against her once
the case became public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an e-mail to me she basically said that she expected it to
get nasty,'' said one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn P. Foote, a retired Army brigadier general, said that
Kennedy told her at a lunch this week that no one should worry
about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I'm tough as leather; they're not going to hurt
me,''' Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   The division over the case extends to Congress where Kennedy's
motives have been questioned. Last week Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind.,
said the timing of her complaint seemed ``to make her look
vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of Kennedy's, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said
Friday that she was asking the secretary of the Army for a status
report on the changes recommended by a senior review panel three
years ago to ``eliminate sexual harassment within the ranks and to
support those victims of sexual harassment who chose to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the furor, several professional organizations of
women in the military are preparing a reception for Kennedy next
month to honor her before she retires this year. One organizer said
the women wanted her to be remembered for much more than the sexual
harassment case she filed.

THE MARKET'S BREATHTAKING PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `about $1 trillion Friday' to `more than $2
trillion this week' in 1st graf. Adjusts figures from 5.5 to 5.6
and from 83 to 84 in 3rd graf.)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial in its editions of
Saturday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   Economists have warned for years that stock prices are
unrealistically high, needing to fall by about a third, by one
prominent estimate, to regain financial sense. But no amount of
warning could take the fright out of Friday's record drops in all
major stock averages. Investors lost more than $2 trillion this
week. Besides the horrific blow to personal wealth, there is the
added threat to the health of the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   How important an event Friday's plunge proves to be depends on
how much the market bounces back next week, and on other factors as
well. Will people reduce their spending enough to trigger a
recession? Will businesses, finding it harder to raise money on
Wall Street, cut back investment plans, delivering a blow to
long-term economic growth? On these scores, there are firm reasons
to remain optimistic. Stocks lost an astounding 23 percent on a
single day, Oct. 19, 1987. Friday's major averages dropped between
5 and 10 percent. Yet even the 1987 debacle caused relatively
little hardship on Main Street. Under the shrewd leadership of Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve kept the economy growing. Greenspan
is still in charge of the Fed, and he has the tools to make sure
that Wall Street and Main Street do not rise and fall in lockstep.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the stock market decline portends for the economy, the
sheer size of Friday's losses was stunning. The index of 30 stocks
that make up the Dow Jones industrial average fell a record 618
points, more than 5.6 percent. That is about 65 points more than
the previous record. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, a more
representative sample of American stocks, lost a record 84 points,
almost 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers Friday were owners of Nasdaq stocks,
especially technology stocks. The Nasdaq lost a record 355 points,
or almost 10 percent. The index is off about 35 percent in the past
month alone. Many will regard the drop in technology stocks _
Microsoft has lost more than $200 billion in value from its peak,
Intel about $100 billion _ as an inevitable correction. Often
prices have little connection to the profits these companies can be
expected to earn anytime soon. Some investors might have convinced
themselves that technology stocks operate by a different set of
financial rules. But this week, ordinary algebra reasserted itself.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about finding a single, decisive explanation for the
plunge. Everyone will seize a favored candidate. The important
point is that when stocks lose touch with their economic moorings,
anything _ an ugly inflation report, as occurred Friday, or a
judicial blow to a prominent company like Microsoft, which
triggered an earlier slide _ can frighten investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, investors have taken falling stock prices as
a golden opportunity to buy, so stock prices have quickly
rebounded. No one can know if that pattern will reappear when the
markets open on Monday, but every study of stock prices is
reassuring. Take any reasonably long-term period, and stock
investments do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   As a political footnote, it is worth adding that Vice President
Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will be watching the
markets closely. Both Bush's tax-cut proposal and Gore's health and
education plans depend on surplus revenues. A good chunk of the
current surplus has been supplied by a boom in tax revenues from
capital gains. A downturn could affect not only productivity and
pocketbooks, but the way politicians and voters behave later this
year.

   WASHINGTON _ The crash last week of an Osprey aircraft, which
killed 19 marines, was a grim reminder that the military builds
weapons and aircraft that cost fortunes and still fail.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will spend $310 billion this year. That is more
than the world's 12 next-largest militaries combined, more than
half the budget of the United States, excluding benefits like
Medicare and Social Security. But that money buys weapons that
``take far too long to build, cost far too much and don't deliver
as promised,'' said Louis J. Rodrigues, the top expert on military
procurement at the General Accounting Office, the independent
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill for six new systems _ three new tactical jet fighters,
along with the Osprey, the Comanche helicopter and the beleaguered
missile defense program _ will come to more than half a trillion
dollars. Most, if not all, will go into full-scale production with
open questions about their cost and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's position is plain: There can be no price tag on
national security. These weapons represent America's global
superiority. If they are costly, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to pay for it,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen told Congress last month when asked about the price of these
weapons. ``It's going to cost more money, and we ought to face up
to it and say we're a rich country.''
</P>
<P>
   He was seconded by Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who testified that ``there simply is no
alternative'' to spending hundreds of billions on
``state-of-the-art weapons and technology to defend America.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of how wisely the Pentagon spends money persists.
Not that much has changed since 1969, when an Air Force financial
analyst, A. Ernest Fitzgerald, uncovered the very first
billion-dollar cost overrun, on the Air Force's C-5A plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two phases of a weapons program,'' Fitzgerald
famously said. ```Too early to tell' and `Too late to stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billion-dollar overruns are now commonplace. Last week alone
brought three of them: more than $1 billion on a new version of the
Patriot missile, which failed in the 1991 gulf war; more than $1.4
billion on the Crusader artillery system; and more than $2 billion
on a new Navy destroyer. And though the Marines insisted last week
that the Osprey is a well-tested bargain at $40 million a plane,
Pentagon records released Wednesday show that the true figure is
$83 million, and that the plane still has crucial tests to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental weapons system problems persist,'' said David M.
Walker, the comptroller general of the United States, who runs the
GAO. ``We have a process that is very costly and does not give you
what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   That process begins with top-secret threat assessments. What if
an ally buys U.S. fighter jets and turns into an enemy? The
Pentagon has responded to that possibility with three tactical
fighter programs, at a total projected cost of $350 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning threats creates an urgency about finding
technologies to defeat them. Thus, the threat of nuclear
annihilation led to the ``peace shield'' _ the Star Wars system on
which $60 billion has been spent without a single working system to
show for it. The Pentagon said last week it would spend $30 billion
more on a far smaller shield.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Rodrigues said, ``we bring in critical technology
that is unproven,'' instead of drawing on existing state-of-the-art
systems that have passed rigorous tests. This leads to building
systems while still trying to figure out how to make them work.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Air Force has begun building F-22s _ at $200
million per plane, history's most expensive jet fighter _ even
though the design keeps changing and the on-board computers need
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons that depend on unproven technology often fail to pass
tests. The tendency, then, is to fudge the tests, and in fact, most
of the Pentagon's biggest new weapons have been marked by
``insufficient and often unrealistic testing,'' along with
overstated performance claims and understated cost reports, the
accounting office says.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain technology also leads to development periods of 15 to
20 years, twice as long as a generation ago. Over time, costs rise,
old weapons wear out and the new ones may not even meet the
nation's evolving needs when they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the systems that are being produced and are being
contemplated were designed during the Cold War,'' Walker said.
``But do they make sense? What is the current and projected threat?
We are so far ahead of the rest of the world. How far ahead do you
need to be? Wants are unlimited _ but what do we really need?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, changes in weapons procurement may not come until
costs get so high that they dry up funds for recruiting, training
and paying servicemen and women. But it's clear what needs to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Pentagon must begin acting more like a business,
using proven technology when possible, rather than inventing
technologies and hoping they will work, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the services must stop warring among themselves for
money. Retired Adm. Bill Owens, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff in 1994 and 1995, says the services must be stripped of
the power to demand new weapons, which should reside with the
secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
This would constitute a revolution inside the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to change, while America stands unchallenged in
military and political power, Owens said. But of the Pentagon, he
warned, ``If we don't get some major reform done inside that
building in the way we buy weapons systems, we will pass some
critical point where we no longer can do what the nation needs us
to do.''

<P>
   To cynics, the news last month that three Georgetown University
law students had settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges
of running an Internet stock manipulation scheme that netted almost
$350,000 probably came as no surprise. After all, lawyers have had
an image problem at least since Shakespeare, and it hasn't improved
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But even people who think the phrase legal ethics is an oxymoron
may have been startled by Georgetown's announcement that it would
take no action against the students, Douglas Colt, Kenneth Terrell
and Jason Wyckoff, who did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   That decision created considerable public controversy, and the
school, which initially said the students had suffered enough,
quickly reversed itself and opened an investigation into their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the full picture of what the SEC's response
was,'' said Karen Siebert, a school spokeswoman. ``Whether or not
they will graduate is not certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown is also the school that in 1998 quietly allowed
Stephen Glass, who fabricated all or parts of dozens of stories he
wrote at The New Republic magazine, to become a full-time law
student. He is now only two months from earning his degree.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert said Georgetown had decided that Glass deserved a second
chance. ``A system of justice should provide more than just
punishment,'' she said. ``He had paid a very high price for his
misdeeds, and we were not in a position to ban him forever from
society.'' Siebert noted that was the business of bar admissions
committees to decide who is fit to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's behavior may have raised some eyebrows, but is
hardly outside the norm for U.S. law schools. ``That's the result I
would recommend,'' said Stephen Gillers, vice dean at New York
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``In admitting an applicant, Gillers said, ``what we are doing
is not making a decision about the person's character for
practicing law, but making a decision about the person's
intellectual capacity to practice law.''
</P>
<P>
   But other legal experts see the Colt and Glass cases as signals
of a breakdown in the way law schools deal with unethical and
immoral conduct, an abrogation of their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a mistake if we think that everything that isn't
illegal isn't shameful,'' said Jeffrey Rosen, a George Washington
University law professor who worked with Glass at The New Republic.
The fact that Glass' actions weren't illegal ``should only begin
the discussion of what social and professional consequences he
should suffer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Cox, a Duke University law professor, said law schools
should hold to themselves and their students to a standard.
``Institutions have to announce what they're about, and what law
schools ought to be about is preparing people for a life of
responsibility,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Rubin, a professor of constitutional law at
Georgetown, notes that moral standards were often used by elites to
punish vulnerable members of society. ``We have replaced a system
of community control over people's behavior with one associated
with more formal procedures for ethical or legal lapses,'' Rubin
said. ``This has been an enormous step forward for society.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University, partly
agrees. ``There has been a very unbecoming history of the moral
character standard being used to keep the riffraff out _ read Jews
and immigrants,'' she said. Still, Rhode, the author of a Yale Law
Journal article on the way law schools and bar committees deal with
unethical behavior, said law schools should take student misconduct
seriously wherever it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to create an impression among future applicants to
the bar that serious misconduct is a matter of concern,'' she said.

</P>

   James Cox, a Duke University law professor, said law schools
should hold to themselves and their students to a standard.
``Institutions have to announce what they're about, and what law
schools ought to be about is preparing people for a life of
responsibility,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Rubin, a professor of constitutional law at
Georgetown, notes that moral standards were often used by elites to
punish vulnerable members of society. ``We have replaced a system
of community control over people's behavior with one associated
with more formal procedures for ethical or legal lapses,'' Rubin
said. ``This has been an enormous step forward for society.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University, partly
agrees. ``There has been a very unbecoming history of the moral
character standard being used to keep the riffraff out _ read Jews
and immigrants,'' she said. Still, Rhode, the author of a Yale Law
Journal article on the way law schools and bar committees deal with
unethical behavior, said law schools should take student misconduct
seriously wherever it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to create an impression among future applicants to
the bar that serious misconduct is a matter of concern,'' she said.

<P>
   Since the invention of the stethoscope by the French physician
Rene Laennec in 1816, medicine has been troubled by a predicament:
The technological advances that have enhanced our ability to
diagnose and cure have also distanced us from our patients.
</P>
<P>
   This problem was highlighted recently, when PE Celera Corp., of
Rockville, Md., announced that it had identified the 3 billion
chemical letters of which human genes are made _ a feat
accomplished by row upon row of tireless, automated gene-sequencing
machines, like something out of Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New
World.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time technology has finally advanced far enough that it
will enable medicine and medical research to return to some of its
best, and most old-fashioned, traditions. In fact, the emerging
gene sciences will reunite the patient, doctor and researcher in
ways not seen since the 19th and early 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to a doctor was once an intimate encounter, a laying on
of hands. A doctor, frequently in your own home, would place his
ear on your chest to listen to your heart. And the physicians held
in highest esteem were those who could find telltale clues to
illness in the subtlest blanching of the skin, a barely perceptible
flutter of the heart. This is what the 19th-century Boston
physician Jacob Bigelow had in mind when he defined a great
physician as ``one who understands diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, most diagnostic procedures are performed by technicians,
using machines whose results are interpreted by a specialist who
may well be halfway around the world from the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Medical research has moved away from the patient, too. A
generation ago, researchers tried to understand disease through the
detailed analysis of a patient's blood, saliva and urine. But the
discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 gave scientists the tools
to study the basis of disease itself, by focusing on ``model
organisms'' like yeast, fruit flies and cultured mammalian cells.
Most of the major advances in the fight against cancer, in fact,
have come from researchers in laboratories, who have never treated
anyone with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   For patients, this reduction of the complex and deeply personal
experience of their disease to a generic collection of symptoms has
often turned treatment into an impersonal ordeal, and contributed
to Americans' disenchantment with their health care system. But the
sequencing of the human genome _ perhaps the ultimate example of
scientific reductionism _ will, paradoxically, demonstrate that
each case of disease is unique, and for the first time, give
doctors the ability to devise individual treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ability to determine quickly the entire sequence of
every letter of an individual's DNA is still far away, already
medicine can evaluate selected regions. It is now possible to
predict, in many cases, who will likely develop Huntington's
disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. Within the next
five to 10 years, it will be possible to anticipate who might be
most vulnerable to many other illnesses like diabetes, Alzheimer's
disease, and many types of cancer. Ultimately, the identification
of the specific genetic cause of a disease will allow the
development of new treatments _ or better applications of old ones
_ though these specific therapies are at least a decade away.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the genome project will be used to create
individual genetic profiles, which will allow more precise
diagnosis of disease, as well as to anticipate which medicines will
be most effective for every person. Consider the example of a
60-year-old woman with hypertension. Right now, the illness must
first be detected by a doctor, and then (if diet and exercise do
not help) treated with a series of medicines to try to find one
that works best. Sometime in the next decade, however, a gene test
will tell patients that they will get hypertension, many years
before it develops.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of such information will demand a level of
intimacy and trust between doctor and patient that is rarely seen
today. After all, it's one thing for patients to learn that they
have a strep throat or a sprained ankle; it's another for them to
comprehend the implications of a progressively more complex genetic
risk profile. This is not the kind of information amenable to a
10-minute office visit, or a brief phone conversation. Rather, it
demands the sort of relationship that the eminent 19th-century
physician, Sir William Osler, had in mind when he said, ``the good
physician treats the disease, but the great physician treats the
patient.''

   In some cases, the course indicated by genetic testing will be
clear. If DNA analysis reveals an increased risk for skin or lung
cancer, the patient should be especially careful about sun exposure
and smoking. But what if testing suggests an increased risk for
breast cancer, or Alzheimer's disease, or sudden heart attacks? The
physician of the future will need to have not only the scientific
sophistication to understand the implications of the data, but also
be able to communicate this weighty knowledge to patients in an
insightful, compassionate and useful way.
</P>
<P>
   The medical researcher, too, will inexorably be drawn back to
the patient. For all the possibilities offered by the Human Genome
Project, we are much more than our DNA. And our genetic code, for
all its symbolic power, is not an inscription in the Book of Life,
saying precisely who will live and who will die, in this place, at
this time, by this cause. An interesting consequence of the Genome
Project will be greater awareness of the role of environmental
factors in disease. Why is it, for example, that if one identical
twin has juvenile diabetes, the other twin experiences the disease
less than 50 percent of the time, even though their DNA is
essentially the same?
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most common diseases, research is coming to
understand, actually represent collections of different diseases
that may each have their own genetic cause. The process of
subdividing large disease categories into smaller groups on the
basis of careful clinical observation, and then analyzing the DNA
of each group to identify an underlying genetic cause, will become
increasingly important in medical research. Ultimately, it may help
to identify the molecular causes of different types of
hypertension, cancer, or diabetes. But this will require the
doctors of the future to relearn the art of diagnosis, which has
become little more than a tool for assigning patients to
pre-existing insurance categories.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctor and patient will need to modify what have been their
traditional roles. Physicians must learn how to express humility,
telling their patients that there is much about their illnesses
they do not understand, but that together they can learn more about
them. Researchers, likewise, must embrace a level of complexity far
exceeding that present in controlled laboratory experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, life will be different in the post-genomic
era. Yet it is reassuring that the gene-based medicine that will
shape the next century may return us to the understanding that, in
the end, the answers about health and illness will come not from
DNA or silicon, but from intimate relationships. How pleased
Bigelow and Osler would be.

<P>
   In the closing days of World War II in Germany, Cameron
Anderson, a young U.S. Army private, casually pocketed a valuable
14th-century manuscript from the castle of Grossgrundlach on the
outskirts of Nuremberg. It troubled him for years.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson, now a retired president of Kinney Shoe Co.,
informed the German authorities of his desire to repatriate the
manuscript, they arranged to have him fly to Germany on an
all-expenses-paid, red-carpet trip to personally present the
8-by-12-inch document to Baron Helmut Haller von Hallerstein, whose
family had owned the castle of Grossgrundlach for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Not every light-fingered U.S. veteran has been so penitent. Maj.
Gen. Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., who commanded the 6th Marine Division
on Okinawa in World War II, would not hear of returning the
15th-century Buddhist temple bell _ a Japanese national treasure _
presented to him in Okinawa by his troops, which he in turn donated
to the Virginia Military Institute, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after Shepherd's death in 1990 that the Defense
Department dared to arrange the return of the bell.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stimulate more cases like Anderson's, art
institutions and private and governmental agencies around the world
are publishing catalogs on the Internet describing artworks in
their holdings that might have been confiscated or looted by
members of the armed forces during World War II and, if so proved,
should be returned to their rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of this research and publication _ the latest such
disclosure was announced April 12 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art
_ is to uncover ownership histories of the artworks tainted by Nazi
occupation authorities or by Red Army ``trophy squads.''
</P>
<P>
   What is belatedly coming to light, however, is that while U.S.
soldiers in World War II were expressly forbidden from stealing by
Article 93 of the Articles of War, a surprising number of U.S.
servicemen and women _ like Anderson _ stole artworks and other
valuables.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises questions _ and fears _ in the minds of veterans
and their heirs. Might a U.S. veteran who came home with a medieval
painting taken from a bombed-out French church run afoul of the law
when attempting to return it? Is it possible to profit legitimately
from such acquisitions?
</P>
<P>
   As to the second question, someone possessing stolen property
does not have clear title to it, and therefore cannot make a lawful
sale because he cannot pass along clear title.
</P>
<P>
   The only possibly lawful way to profit from war booty would be
to sell it to its owner (who presumably already has title). The
catch is that the prospective buyer may instead accuse the seller
of extortion, or file a civil suit to recover the property without
paying ransom. Furthermore, the U.S. Customs Service does not take
kindly to someone offering illegally imported or smuggled artworks
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   A thief cannot hide behind the statute of limitations, said
William H. Kenety, a Washington lawyer who has advised clients on
art matters, because, ``as a general rule, the statute does not
begin to run until the victim knows the location of the stolen
artwork, and that conceivably could take forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what about the Napoleonic ``spoils of war'' theory, in
which soldiers who have made great sacrifices in order to achieve
victory are said to be entitled to trophies?
</P>
<P>
   ``The `spoils of war' practice is no longer sanctioned by
civilized nations,'' said Constance Lowenthal, director of the
Commission for Art Recovery at the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quedlinburg case, which concerns the theft of medieval
church treasures from Germany by an American officer in World War
II, has set an important precedent,'' Lowenthal said. ``Even though
in that case the thief's heirs escaped trial on a technicality, it
has been a powerful deterrent because it showed that if you indulge
in careless or shady acquisitions, let alone outright theft, you
not only run the risk of a possible civil action, but also may face
criminal prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to return looted art is to follow Anderson's
practice: give it back to the owner or a responsible official at
the locality from which it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever got in trouble for trying to arrange the voluntary
return of a looted artwork,'' said Thomas C. Kline, a Washington
lawyer who specializes in the recovery of lost cultural property.
``Unless, that is, he was asking an extortionate price.''

   ``The `spoils of war' practice is no longer sanctioned by
civilized nations,'' said Constance Lowenthal, director of the
Commission for Art Recovery at the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quedlinburg case, which concerns the theft of medieval
church treasures from Germany by an American officer in World War
II, has set an important precedent,'' Lowenthal said. ``Even though
in that case the thief's heirs escaped trial on a technicality, it
has been a powerful deterrent because it showed that if you indulge
in careless or shady acquisitions, let alone outright theft, you
not only run the risk of a possible civil action, but also may face
criminal prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to return looted art is to follow Anderson's
practice: give it back to the owner or a responsible official at
the locality from which it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever got in trouble for trying to arrange the voluntary
return of a looted artwork,'' said Thomas C. Kline, a Washington
lawyer who specializes in the recovery of lost cultural property.
``Unless, that is, he was asking an extortionate price.''

<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton denounced the soaring salaries of
America's chief executives and vowed to do something about them if
he won the presidency. Sure enough, in his first year in office he
pushed through a law that slapped a new tax on some companies
paying their top executives more than $1 million. At the time, the
typical chief executive officer of a large company was making about
$3 million a year in salary, bonus and stock awards.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since, CEOs' average pay has more than
tripled to $11.9 million, according to Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners, a
pay consulting firm in New York. The average corporate chieftain
now makes more in a single day than the typical American worker
makes in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, executive pay has managed to disappear as a
political issue.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore do not mention it. Even as they
battle over the next seven months to position themselves as
reformers, executive salaries seem unlikely to enter the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Their vanquished rivals paid it scant attention, too. Bill
Bradley said the rich have a right to get richer but should feel a
moral obligation to spread the wealth. And John McCain even
disavowed a bill he had co-sponsored in 1997 that would have made
it more difficult for companies to pay their executives with stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, the populist issue has paled. The media's
annual lists of the fattest corporate cats, which have been
appearing in recent weeks at the same time many stocks have turned
south, have caused little protest. The political paradox is
fascinating: A candidate makes hay out of a perceived problem and
wins an election; the problem worsens but the issue vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation is simple. The U.S. economy has been the
envy of the world in recent years as it has enjoyed the longest
expansion in its history. Executives, be they savvy bosses like
General Electric's John F. Welch or Internet wunderkinds, are
getting much of the credit. In the last two years, European
companies have begun to pay their bosses more like American
executives in an effort to produce similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the current volatile stock market, where many stocks are
worth less today than they were a year ago, executives have
persuaded corporate boards and shareholders to fork over bigger and
bigger awards _ some of which do not depend on share prices. Still,
outrage is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to criticize a nine-year boom?'' said Ira T. Kay, an
executive compensation consultant at Watson Wyatt Associates in New
York and a prominent defender of current CEO pay levels. ``You want
to hold your breath until it continues to a 10th or 11th year.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sky-high salaries say they cannot argue. ``As long
as the economy stays good and most people are very hopeful about
their personal economic future, no one's terribly concerned about
excessive CEO pay,'' said Robert B. Reich, who served as Clinton's
secretary of labor.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, too, that the new mega-millionaires have donated
liberally to both Bush and Gore. If there is one issue on which
Silicon Valley executives will brook little dissent, it is the
generous accounting rules for stock options. The laws on options
``have become the new third rail of American politics,'' said
Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder
Services of Rockville, Md., which advises large investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed with which the political winds have shifted
suggests that more than economic indicators and political gifts are
at work. Early in 1996, after a series of layoffs at big companies
around the country, Newsweek ran a cover article titled ``Corporate
Killers,'' which pilloried businessmen who had fired workers but
still earned millions of dollars. A few days later, Pat Buchanan
won the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary while
blasting American business and credited his victory to ``peasants
with pitchforks'' storming the Republican establishment. The next
year, McCain made his proposal on stock options.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the political situation seems similar today. Big
layoffs, like those announced at Coca-Cola and Xerox earlier this
year, continue to accompany the economic expansion. And the average
pay for a CEO has more than doubled since 1996, according to Pearl
Meyer. But there is nary an article on the new Corporate Killer nor
have pitchfork-wielding peasants appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The changing attitude of Americans toward money may be
responsible. Since the 1996 election, hundreds of recent college
graduates and mid-level workers have become millionaires, thanks
mostly to the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, an $11.9 million pay package looks less unusual. The
attitude has spread to popular culture. To paraphrase the
television hit, most Americans want to  &UR; be &LR;  millionaires, not
criticize them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, however, such feelings could set the stage
for a new political firestorm over executive pay. When the economy
eventually slows _ and the plunge of technology stocks last week
suggests that the time may not be far off _ struggling workers are
more likely to reconsider their views on big pay packages. ``We're
in a rare moment of history in which there seems to be a gulf
between money and effort,'' said Reich, a professor at Brandeis
University.
</P>
<P>
   If that gulf seemed like an inviting political target in 1992
when the typical chief executive made 100 times what the typical
employee did, it could be irresistible when the multiple is closer
to 400. At that point, CEOs could face a choice between accepting a
large pay cut or waging an unpopular political fight. They might
then look back at the early months of 2000 as that unusual period
when they could enjoy both record paychecks and the presidential
campaign.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Throughout 40 years of Cold War and its
aftermath, Fidel Castro has cast himself as the man who really
understands the world, the intellectual scold of the rich and
powerful, the nemesis of the world's last superpower. And there he
was again last week, preaching to the world's rich nations about
their obligations to the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of here on the other side of the world, in North
Korea, was a regime often seen as perhaps the most intransigent,
introverted and unpredictable _ in other words, least worldly-wise
_ on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by events of last week, it is the North Koreans who
seem to have come first to a reluctant understanding of how the
world really works these days: that what a desperately impoverished
Communist outpost sitting next to a capitalist hotshot needs most
is not an enemy to rail against but a partner to join futures with.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how different that view is from the one Castro offered
at a summit meeting of the world's poor nations in Havana, in the
kind of speech he has been giving almost throughout living memory.
He said the world was in need of a ``Nuremberg to put on trial the
economic order that they have imposed on us.''
</P>
<P>
   What was wrong with that picture, of course, is what has been
missing from Cuba's foreign relations now for five decades: normal
diplomatic and economic ties with the United States. Without them,
history since the Soviet collapse strongly suggests that no number
of visits from heads of state will make a moldering Cuba thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, North Korea was also contemplating a summit
meeting _ this one in June. It is to be the first ever between
leaders of the two Koreas. In these two summit meetings are
critical lessons about how to unravel the final, knotty strands of
the Cold War _ lessons that North Korea seems to have absorbed
first.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing that its reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, will begin
dealing directly and at the presidential level with South Korea,
Pyongyang may have finally figured out how to come in from the
cold. Although caution is still very much in order, diplomats and
political analysts here say North Korea may be signaling a historic
shift in its strategy by deciding that South Korea's greatest value
is as an awkward partner rather than an unredeemable foil.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuba, an analogous development would be to see Castro
finally come to terms with a U.S. president _ Bill Clinton is his
ninth _ perhaps after concluding that without the United States, no
conceivable amount of Canadian mining or tourism investment will
suffice to re-energize his country's economy and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Castro cannot be blamed alone for the yawning
political distance between Cuba and United States. Where Cuba is
concerned, Washington has simply never had a Kim Dae Jung, the
present South Korean leader, who at great political risk conceived
and doggedly pursued a policy of engagement with the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to first disarm the North, as Washington has
so adamantly tried but failed to do, Kim sent representatives of
nongovernmental organizations north with food, clothing and
medicine,'' said Kenneth C. Quinones, a former State Department
expert on Korea who is director of Mercy Corps International's
Northeast Asia Project. ``Instead of economic isolation, he
encouraged businessmen from the South to go North.''
</P>
<P>
   Several recent administrations, including Clinton's, have toyed
with the idea of ``normalizing'' relations with Cuba, only to
conclude that the calendar of domestic politics made the costs too
great.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs were amply illustrated last week by the inability of
even Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, to get a quick
resolution of the travails of Elian Gonzalez, trapped as he is in a
custody battle between a father who wants to keep living in
Castro's Cuba and relatives in Miami who revile Castro above all
else.
</P>
<P>
   Well into his 70s and perhaps with his eye fixed on history,
Castro seems to find little appeal in making concessions to
Washington, especially of the democratic kind. ``The Koreans have a
summit, there is a two-nation policy in China and Vietnam reforms
its economy, but none of it matters because of a notion called
Cuban exceptionalism,'' said Anthony P. Maingot, a professor of
sociology at Florida International University in Miami. Using the
Spanish word for vanity and unreality, he continued: ``What we are
left with is Fidel and his  &UR; vanidad &LR; , and when you are talking
about totalitarian states, personalities count. He simply sees no
benefit from change.''
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of Cuban leaders may well be more pragmatic,
with the essential caveat that they deal with Washington, not the
conservative, Miami-based exiles.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this light that the announced Korean summit appears
most impressive. Experts differ over what brought it about. For
some, dollars alone are the answer. Pyongyang itself has described
the last couple of years of economic free fall as resembling a
near-death experience. As a senior South Korean official said last
week, ``They have come to realize that we are likely to become
their main donors in areas like food and fuel.'' Moreover, lowering
tensions would likely pave the way for the North to attract aid and
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe that politics are driving a North
Korean regime that is essentially shielded from internal security
threats. Now is simply the time, they say, when the diplomatic
stars are all aligned, meaning that Seoul, Tokyo and, perhaps more
tentatively, Washington, seem ready to do business with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a serious moment here, where things could go very,
very well,'' said Leon V. Sigal, a Columbia University expert in
international relations. ``To say they could still go badly is not
news on the Korean peninsula. But we could be seeing fundamental
shifts in the political relationships, and this is taking place
because Seoul, Tokyo and Washington are moving in the same
direction for once.''

news on the Korean peninsula. But we could be seeing fundamental
shifts in the political relationships, and this is taking place
because Seoul, Tokyo and Washington are moving in the same
direction for once.''

   In a high-wire act performed daily by many psychiatrists,
patients are assessed for their potential danger to themselves or
others. Recent publicity about mentally ill people who were
evaluated and released before committing violent acts have put that
process under scrutiny. Psychiatric professionals say that
predicting violence accurately is impossible, but there are tools
that help them make clinical judgments. Most important is the
individual interview.
</P>
<P>
   Following are notes from an initial psychiatric interview with a
troubled 18-year-old high school senior (some details have been
omitted to protect the patient's privacy). The interview was
conducted by Dr. William S. Pollack, author of ``Real Boys:
Rescuing our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood'' (Holt, 1999). He is
on the faculty of Harvard Medical School and is director of the
Center for Men and Young Men at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
Pollack's comments are also included.

   _+ By LAURIE GOODSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The young man is brought in to my office
for evaluation by his parents, who tell me their son has been
fighting a lot and has become sullen and withdrawn in the last
month. The day before, he started screaming at his teacher, and the
principal said he could not return to school until he saw a
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   I asked his parents to sit in the waiting room while I talked to
their son. He shakes my hand limply and avoids my gaze. He sits
down, and for two minutes there is silence. I'm giving him time to
see if he'll shape the interview at all. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. I hear there have been some troubles. I guess you're here to
see whether I can be of some help.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yup.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You probably don't want to talk to me. Why would you? You
don't know if you can trust me, and it sounds like you haven't been
talking much anyway lately, but I'll make a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   A. What?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think it might be useful to you to talk to me. I have a
sense that people have been on your case, and at least I'd be
someone who could listen to what is going on, because things don't
sound so hot right now.
</P>
<P>
   A. (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(Whispered)(END ITALICS HERE) OK
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what really brought you here?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, my parents are getting worried about me because I'm
getting into fights all the time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)He's not denying problems, but describes
them through someone else's eyes. This tells me he's not ready to
take responsibility, or he's frightened to say something is wrong.
But he's not out of touch with reality, and not uncooperative.(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what's making you upset and angry?
</P>
<P>
   A. You know, I have to say it's kind of weird.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's weird?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(He's quiet again.) (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who are you angry at?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, that's it. I'm just angry at everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long has this been going on?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, maybe a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's been happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I get into fights with a lot of guys and my Mom is on
my back a lot. Nag nag nag.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, yeah. Then there's my history teacher. Yesterday she
just went at me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Went at you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, she wouldn't leave me alone. I didn't know the answer,
and she just kept asking me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what did you do?
</P>
<P>
   A. I just started screaming at her: ``Get the hell away from me!
Leave me alone!'' And she sent me to the principal and they called
my parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Anything like that ever happen before to you?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) I am trying to get at whether there is a
history of angry outbursts. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A. No, nothing like this, although I have been feeling I guess
not so good for the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So when your teacher did that it must have been really
upsetting to you, must have really hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   A. Why do you think that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, you yelled at her. You felt out of control, and if I
were in that class and if it were me, I'd feel really ashamed about
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) I'm putting myself in his shoes, and
letting him know he's not crazy. The reason he can't talk is he's
afraid of what will happen to him. Like many boys in trouble, he
needs desperately to hide his shame that he's falling apart inside.
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A. I guess I should have left her alone, but I just couldn't
stand it. And I just had these ideas. Well, I don't know, never
mind. They're not important.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think this is one of those things you probably don't want
to talk to somebody you don't know about.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yup.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can't promise anything, but look how upset you were. Maybe
if you try to talk to me I could at least try to get people off
your back.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I just had this idea that I'd like to get up and sock
her right in the mouth. (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(Adding quickly)(END
ITALICS HERE) But I'd never do it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) We now know he has some potential for
violence, and he's on the edge. That doesn't mean he's going to do
it, but there's the potential. His aggression is the surface
expression of what is, in many boys, an underlying depression. I
have interviewed hundreds of boys like this.(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do your friends say about all of this?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)I'm trying to assess, does he still have
friends, is he connected to people, is he telling anybody else and
what are his peers saying. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't see them much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mostly watch TV by myself.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) He's loosening up. Now I ask about his
plans, thoughts and fantasies _ not just his actions.(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. And do you think about anything while you're watching TV?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's just a weird idea that goes through my mind. I told you
with these things, I'd never do them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know these are just your thoughts, but I think it would
really help to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   A. You sure you won't think I'm crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's hear them.
</P>
<P>
   A. My friend's father, next door, has this collection of guns. I
think they use them to start races.

on edge enough to potentially do something, not that I think he's

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(He is quiet and looks scared.)(END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   Q. It's scary to talk about all of this.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(He nods.) (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think that's because there's even more, isn't there? My
guess is the rest of it isn't just about other people.
</P>
<P>
   A. How the hell would you know something like that?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I don't really know it, but I've helped other guys who've had
these kinds of dreams and ideas before.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I guess I've got to say you're right. I think about
maybe shooting me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever thought about hurting yourself before?
</P>
<P>
   A. Just a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever had a plan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah, the gun was one plan, and then I saw a show once on TV
where someone used rope and they hung themselves. I've thought
about that once or twice.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) I want to know how far he's taken his
plans. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you actually buy the rope or get the gun?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I'd never really hurt anybody, I told you.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(He starts to tear up.) (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. That might be true, but I'm concerned that you're very close
to hurting yourself, and then who knows what else could happen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) I'm emphasizing my empathy for him, not
just protecting others. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A. The only thing I don't get is, sometimes I feel down, but
sometimes I have a lot of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think that's actually part of the problem. You're up and
down. And when you have the energy I think even YOU know you're
afraid of what you might do.
</P>
<P>
   A. What happens now?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think it would be important we both do something. We both
know you need help and you need it right away. I know you won't
like this suggestion, but I think it would be good at least for a
short time to use the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)

   He was hospitalized for about two weeks and treated with
medication and psychotherapy. As he got a little less depressed and
more trusting it came out that he had witnessed his biological
father abusing his mother, starting when he was about 5 years old.
He is now in his early 20s. He has intermittent therapy for
depression. His fantasies of violence sometimes return, but he has
never been violent to date toward anyone. (END ITALICS HERE)

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, April 16:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-SHAH (Undated) _ A secret history of the 1953 coup in Iran
that returned the shah to power has surfaced, revealing the inner
workings of a plot that set the stage for the Islamic revolution in
1979. A special report. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic and sidebars.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-INSTITUTIONS (Washington) _ Commissions are examining
whether the World Bank lends too much to middle-income nations and
not enough to the world's poorest. The IMF is embroiled in battles
over whether it did more harm than good when it placed strict
budget-balancing and interest rate requirements on nations hit by
the Asian contagion. And the World Trade Organization, which is not
meeting in Washington this week, is a target nonetheless. ``I think
one of the common complaints is that many of these organizations
don't listen as well as they say they do,'' said Andrea Durbin of
Friends of the Earth, who frequently interacts with the
institutions at the center of the protests. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-PROTEST-VOICES (Washington) _ Voices of some of the
protesters in Washington. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   GAMBIA-BORDER (Farafenni, Gambia) _ African borders remain the
absurd legacy of European colonialists who carved up the continent
more than a century ago without consulting any Africans. But
colonial map drawing reached an absurd extreme here: Gambia, an
enclave inside Senegal, is about 300 miles long, though only about
15 miles wide. The maps, though, were never that precise. By
Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-RECONSTRUCT (Macuto, Venezuela) _ Armed with shovels
and pickaxes, Jose Estevez and half a dozen neighbors stood at the
door of what used to be his home here and contemplated the dried
mud and debris that filled the building to the ceiling. With a
shrug, he called out, ``Let's go, folks,'' and began to dig. Four
months ago, a 25-mile strip of Caribbean coast just north of
Caracas was inundated by floods and mud slides. But after an
initial burst of activity, government relief has been been slow in
arriving. People like Estevez have decided to begin helping
themselves. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-DIPLOMACY (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Despite the indictment
of President Slobodan Milosevic on war crimes charges and the
efforts of Washington to isolate his regime, the Western diplomatic
quarantine of Yugoslavia has broken down, with every major European
country represented here by senior diplomats. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Perm, Russia) _ The Russian authorities have
yet to disclose the results of their inquiry into the ambush on
March 29, which led to the death of as many as 36 policemen from
the Perm region, reverberated through the news media and shook the
nation's confidence in its generals. But a handful of survivors who
have returned to this Ural mountains region have given their
accounts. And it is a tale of high-level incompetence, poor
training and terror on the battlefield. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN-U.S. (Astana, Kazakhstan) _ At the start of a
five-day visti to Central Asia, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright renewed U.S. criticism of Kazakhstan over its sale of some
40 MiG fighter jets to North Korea. And President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, reproached Albright for, in essence, not minding her
own business. By Steve Levine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TAX-AUDITS (Undated) _ Last year, for the first time, the poor
were more likely than the rich to have their tax returns audited,
new Internal Revenue Service data compiled by Syracuse University
researchers show. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACT (New York) _ Mutual fund managers have long
exhorted investors to live by a very simple mantra when the stock
market falls: Buy on the dips. For a decade, investors have largely
followed that advice, driving U.S. stocks ever higher. Until
Friday. By Alex Berenson and Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   SC-GOP-DEFECTORS (Columbia, S.C.) _ A few hours after two
representatives startled the Southern political world this month as
the first Republicans in the state to become Democrats since the
end of Reconstruction, they were stripped of their positions on two
prestigious committees and moved to the Military, Medical,
Municipal and Public Affairs Committee, which has so few
responsibilities that not a single Republican serves on it. By
David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-MOB (Youngstown, Ohio) _ Reality is a tired saga here. It
already includes a prosecutor who was gunned down after being
deemed unbribable; the racketeering and murder-conspiracy
conviction of Lenine ``Lenny'' Strollo, the local godfather; the
conviction of Rep. James A. Traficant Jr.'s late district manager
as an admitted bagman for the mob; plus assorted county
commissioners and patronage appointees gone bad. By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-WRITERS-TAXES (Los Angeles) _ After years of heated
conflict, the union that represents screenwriters and the city of
Los Angeles have reached a truce over imposing local taxes on
writers, artists and other self-employed people who work at home.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Dateline TK) _ Developments in the Elian Gonzalez
case.
</P>
<P>
   WELLESLEY-GIFT (Undated) _ In the largest donation ever to a
women's college, a New York couple has given $25 million to
Wellesley College. By Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-DILEMMA (Houston) _ Bush's dilemma is that he must hold on
to right-wing conservatives but keep enough of a public distance
from them to court the political middle. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-REFORM (Washington) _ When Vice President Al Gore declared
late last month that he would devote himself to remaking the system
of political finance, he conceded that he was an ``imperfect
messenger'' for campaign finance reform. But supporters and critics
of Gore agree that he has been, since first elected to Congress in
1976, a steady if largely invisible supporter of measures to change
the political finance system. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-CUBAN-BOY (Los Angeles) _ On March 30, prompted by no one,
Al Gore thrust himself into one of the most emotionally and
politically charged cases in the country. After months of saying
that the fate of the 6-year-old Cuban boy should be decided in the
courts, Gore said that Elian Gonzalez should be granted permanent
residency status. There was a fierce backlash. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.

<P>
   SCOTUS-CULTURE-WARS (Washington) _ For anyone wanting a

scoutmaster whom the Scouts expelled after learning from a

<P>
   In February, Vince McMahon turned his attention from the raunch
of his staged World Wrestling Federation events to create the XFL,
a high-octane, ``smash mouth'' football league. Last month, NBC
Sports became his 50 percent partner and will carry XFL games
Saturday nights starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon vows legitimate football _ even though the rules will be
tweaked to create more offense, WWF stars like Val Venis, Triple H
and the Rock won't be sacking and tossing quarterbacks into the
cheap seats. McMahon has not revealed how he will merge real
National Football League-style football, which produces plenty of
smashed mouths and serious injuries, with the debauchery that makes
the WWF's television shows and exhibitions must-see attractions for
young males.
</P>
<P>
   But for the real strategy behind Vince McMahon's secret plan to
turn himself into Vince Lombardi with bulging pectorals, let's turn
to his unauthorized manifesto, ``The XFL: An Accident Waiting to
Happen'':
</P>
<P>
   The Field: 100 yards long, enclosed by a steel cage.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: Players will wear old-style leather helmets, shoulder
pads filled with goose down and spandex singlets to expose bruises
and broken bones. (For pantywaist football, see the NFL.)
</P>
<P>
   The Game: Each of the four ``acts'' will last 15 minutes _ or
until the quarterback is pinned for a count of three. There will be
no timeouts, not even for injury. Just because the quarterback
can't get up doesn't mean he can't be trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Teams: Eight teams of 40 feral players each, with names that
evoke terror, immorality and enormous royalties: the Miami Vile,
Los Angeles Pestilence, San Francisco Sin, Philadelphia Turpitude,
Chicago Carnage. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Names: Players will be renamed for weapons, poisonous animals or
defeated presidential candidates, i.e., Rat Casket, Boa Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: Touchdowns will be called smackdowns. Each smackdown
will be worth 6 to 12 points, depending on the length of the
scoring play and the creativity of the humiliation heaped on the
defense. For field goals, defenses must count three Mississippis
before trying to rush the place kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Fomenting rivalries: A system of ``tag teams'' will be created,
so that if the Pestilence is being routed mercilessly by the
Carnage, for example, the Sinners can rush to the Pestilence's aid
from a cell inside the stadium. If the Sin subdues the Carnage and
the Pestilence wins, the Sin will receive three points.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame entrances: Armed cheerleaders in bikinis, trained by the
Godfather's working-girl wannabes, will precede players onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleading: Each team's cheerleading squad will be captained
by wrestlers ranging from the evil Kane to the septuagenarian
exhibitionist Mae Young. All cheers will conclude with squad
members whacking fans with metal chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Scripts: Scripted dialogue and action will not be tolerated, as
they are in the WWF. But general outlines will provide a compass.
Quarterbacks can review outlines on teleprompters built into their
helmets. All games are subject to rewrite by the XFL executive
council depending on team standings.
</P>
<P>
   End zone celebrations: Hugging, dancing, finger-pointing,
taunting and trash-talking will be mandatory and sharpened during
two weeks of pre-season education at the Stone Cold Steve Austin
Institute of Shame.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback protection: No such thing. No ``in the grasp'' calls
to limit sacking, no safe zones. QB's are carrion. Miniature heart
monitors implanted inside quarterbacks' chests will let XFL.com
surfers witness real-time terror.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives: Penalties are now ``incentives'' _ bonus yardage for
showing egregious aggression. Perfect mandible claws, full nelsons
and body slams will allow offending teams to move 10 yards
downfield. A 15-yard incentive will be awarded for an open field
tackle launched from atop the steel cage.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties: Actions that purposely slow a game will receive 10-
and 15-yard penalties, i.e., a quarterback using a confusing
cadence to draw the defense offside or a running back moving side
to side, rather than forward.
</P>
<P>
   Concealed weapons: Optional and recommended. Rolls of dimes,
shivs and brass knuckles are unlikely to be spotted by each game's
one-man officiating crew, despite the scantiness of the singlets.
Those who can't hide them effectively will suffer a temporary loss
of their NRA benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fan involvement: Young fans who win regional age-group
competitions in Punt, Pass &AMP; Bludgeon contests will be eligible to
stand beside emergency medical personnel at the Tylenol Trauma
Bowl, the league's championship game.

CRIME, PUNISHMENT AND THE PASSIONS OF MIRANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Supreme Court prepares to revisit the
Miranda decision, in a case to be argued Wednesday, there is
something oddly appropriate about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda, of course, was a case about confessions, and 34 years
after the court raised the bar for obtaining confessions from
criminal suspects, not only do people who receive the famous
warnings still bare their souls, but the country is awash in
confessions of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ appears to be
a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller list,
revelations of appalling intimacy on television. Political leaders,
or would-be leaders, are expected to admit to all manner of
personal transgressions: Barely two years ago, the country was
mesmerized by President Clinton's grudging path toward confessing
to what, by the end, everyone already knew.
</P>
<P>
   So it should be no surprise that after all these years, long
after other landmarks of the Warren Court's criminal procedure
revolution were comfortably absorbed by the criminal justice
system, Miranda vs. Arizona still stirs passions, as the foot-high
stack of briefs filed in the pending Supreme Court case attests.
True, 80 to 90 percent of suspects waive their Miranda rights and
talk anyway, and many police departments have long since made peace
with Miranda. But the decision still casts a long symbolic shadow.
</P>
<P>
   As Miranda's reappearance before the Supreme Court demonstrates,
the passions unleashed in 1966 never really went away; they just
kept flowing underground, kept alive by the political right largely
out of sight of the liberal establishment that had considered the
question closed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new case is the result of a tenacious search for a vehicle
that might push the Supreme Court to resolve the question of
whether a long-ignored 1968 law supplanted Miranda. The argument is
being made by an otherwise obscure University of Utah law
professor, Paul Cassell, who was only 6 years old when Miranda was
decided but who has since built a career as its mostly widely
published critic, along with the Washington Legal Foundation.
Cassell says Miranda has unduly handicapped the police in pursuing
criminals, although social scientists on the other side have raised
serious questions about the validity of the statistics he offers to
back up his argument.
</P>
<P>
   Congress intended the 1968 law, known as Section 3501, to
replace the Miranda warnings, in federal cases, with an inquiry by
the trial judge into whether a confession was voluntary in light of
``all the circumstances.'' This is essentially the case-by-case
test the Supreme Court found unworkable two years earlier when it
decided Miranda. Section 3501 and Miranda are mutually exclusive;
by the time the court decides Dickerson vs. U.S. early this summer,
only one of them will be left standing. (While a decision in favor
of Section 3501 would apply only to federal cases, it would free
states to adopt their own statutory substitutes.)
</P>
<P>
   That the battle over Miranda still rages is evidence of ``the
whole cultural unease, the ambivalence, about confession and what
we expect and want from it,'' said Peter Brooks, the Chester D.
Tripp Professor of Humanities at Yale University, who has written
an illuminating book on the role of confession in western thought.
``Troubling Confessions: Speaking Guilt in Law and Literature,''
which is to be published next month by the University of Chicago
Press, examines confession's deep roots in religious, literary,
legal and cultural tradition. Confession is ``one of the most
complex and obscure forms of human speech and behavior,'' Brooks

simultaneously to punishment and absolution, discipline and
redemption. Confession is supposed to serve the interests of the
state even as it meets the needs of the soul.

<P>
   The book examines confession in the context of the church, the
analyst's couch and the novelist's pen, as well as in judicial
opinions, which Brooks reads as literary texts and places in the
company of Dante, Rousseau, Dostoevsky and James Joyce. He quotes
Joyce's depiction of Stephen Dedalus, in ``Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man,'' returning home after confession, ``conscious of
an invisible grace pervading and making light his limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   That urge to feel the cleansing power of confession, Brooks
says, ``must make us suspicious of its use for other purposes:
purposes that seek punishment rather than absolution, or, even,
that claim that absolution and purification pass through
punishment, rather than penance.''

   The urge is so strong that false confessions have long troubled
the criminal justice system, as the court noted in the Miranda
decision. Aside from the constitutional and human rights arguments
against coerced confessions, there are substantial questions about
whether such confessions are reliable; a lawyer's presence offers
protection not only against compelled self-incrimination but also
against false confession.
</P>
<P>
   The majority and dissenting opinions in the Miranda case
themselves reflect the justices' encounter with confession in its
various aspects. Focusing on confession as the route to punishment,
Chief Justice Earl Warren's majority opinion emphasized the need to
protect people from the ``inherently compelling pressures'' of
custodial interrogation, which ``work to undermine the individual's
will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not
otherwise do so freely.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Supreme Court prepares to revisit the
Miranda decision, in a case to be argued Wednesday, there is
something oddly appropriate about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda, of course, was a case about confessions, and 34 years
after the court raised the bar for obtaining confessions from
criminal suspects, not only do people who receive the famous
warnings still bare their souls, but the country is awash in
confessions of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ appears to be
a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller list,
revelations of appalling intimacy on television. Political leaders,
or would-be leaders, are expected to admit to all manner of
personal transgressions: Barely two years ago, the country was
mesmerized by President Clinton's grudging path toward confessing
to what, by the end, everyone already knew.
</P>
<P>
   So it should be no surprise that after all these years, long
after other landmarks of the Warren Court's criminal procedure
revolution were comfortably absorbed by the criminal justice
system, Miranda vs. Arizona still stirs passions, as the foot-high
stack of briefs filed in the pending Supreme Court case attests.
True, 80 to 90 percent of suspects waive their Miranda rights and
talk anyway, and many police departments have long since made peace
with Miranda. But the decision still casts a long symbolic shadow.
</P>
<P>
   As Miranda's reappearance before the Supreme Court demonstrates,
the passions unleashed in 1966 never really went away; they just
kept flowing underground, kept alive by the political right largely
out of sight of the liberal establishment that had considered the
question closed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new case is the result of a tenacious search for a vehicle
that might push the Supreme Court to resolve the question of
whether a long-ignored 1968 law supplanted Miranda. The argument is
being made by an otherwise obscure University of Utah law
professor, Paul Cassell, who was only 6 years old when Miranda was
decided but who has since built a career as its mostly widely
published critic, along with the Washington Legal Foundation.
Cassell says Miranda has unduly handicapped the police in pursuing
criminals, although social scientists on the other side have raised
serious questions about the validity of the statistics he offers to
back up his argument.
</P>
<P>
   Congress intended the 1968 law, known as Section 3501, to
replace the Miranda warnings, in federal cases, with an inquiry by
the trial judge into whether a confession was voluntary in light of
``all the circumstances.'' This is essentially the case-by-case
test the Supreme Court found unworkable two years earlier when it
decided Miranda. Section 3501 and Miranda are mutually exclusive;
by the time the court decides Dickerson vs. U.S. early this summer,
only one of them will be left standing. (While a decision in favor
of Section 3501 would apply only to federal cases, it would free
states to adopt their own statutory substitutes.)
</P>
<P>
   That the battle over Miranda still rages is evidence of ``the
whole cultural unease, the ambivalence, about confession and what
we expect and want from it,'' said Peter Brooks, the Chester D.
Tripp Professor of Humanities at Yale University, who has written
an illuminating book on the role of confession in western thought.
``Troubling Confessions: Speaking Guilt in Law and Literature,''
which is to be published next month by the University of Chicago
Press, examines confession's deep roots in religious, literary,
legal and cultural tradition. Confession is ``one of the most
complex and obscure forms of human speech and behavior,'' Brooks
writes, in part because it serves a dual role, leading
simultaneously to punishment and absolution, discipline and
redemption. Confession is supposed to serve the interests of the
state even as it meets the needs of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The book examines confession in the context of the church, the
analyst's couch and the novelist's pen, as well as in judicial
opinions, which Brooks reads as literary texts and places in the
company of Dante, Rousseau, Dostoevsky and James Joyce. He quotes
Joyce's depiction of Stephen Dedalus, in ``Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man,'' returning home after confession, ``conscious of
an invisible grace pervading and making light his limbs.''
</P>
<P>
   That urge to feel the cleansing power of confession, Brooks
says, ``must make us suspicious of its use for other purposes:
purposes that seek punishment rather than absolution, or, even,
that claim that absolution and purification pass through
punishment, rather than penance.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge is so strong that false confessions have long troubled
the criminal justice system, as the court noted in the Miranda
decision. Aside from the constitutional and human rights arguments
against coerced confessions, there are substantial questions about
whether such confessions are reliable; a lawyer's presence offers
protection not only against compelled self-incrimination but also
against false confession.
</P>
<P>
   The majority and dissenting opinions in the Miranda case
themselves reflect the justices' encounter with confession in its
various aspects. Focusing on confession as the route to punishment,
Chief Justice Earl Warren's majority opinion emphasized the need to
protect people from the ``inherently compelling pressures'' of
custodial interrogation, which ``work to undermine the individual's
will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not
otherwise do so freely.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Byron R. White, one of the four dissenters, had a
different focus. Granting, he said, that confessions should not be
coerced, neither should they be discouraged, because they can be a
positive good for the person confessing. ``Has it so unquestionably
been resolved that in each and every case it would be better for
him not to confess and to return to his environment with no attempt
whatsoever to help him?'' White asked. ``I think not. It may well
be that in many cases it will be no less than a callous disregard
for his own welfare as well as for the interests of his next
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this debate, the Miranda decision raises, at least
implicitly, a separate issue that remains all the more compelling
for never having been satisfactorily resolved: the question of free
will. The majority's premise was that, properly advised of his
rights, a suspect could make a free and rational decision about
whether to talk, and any confession would then be voluntarily given
_ or at least, the law could so presume.
</P>
<P>
   But this concept of a freely chosen and ``knowing waiver'' of
one's rights contains a paradox: If the court was correct that the
atmosphere of the interrogation room is inherently coercive, then
how can the choice to waive those rights in that very setting ever
really be free? ``How do you ever know what's voluntary?'' Brooks
asked in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Brooks said, the court bought into a comfortable
fiction _ that of the rational person who, once freed of undue
pressure, can make a rational choice. ``The law has to insist on
the Enlightenment notion of people as actors exercising free will,
but actors in the criminal justice system rarely fit that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silence in the situation requires a radical effort of the
will: Everything in the culture presses toward speech,'' he writes,
referring to questions in the interrogation room. Rarely the
product of free and rational choice, confessions ``arise in
situations of constraint, whether physical or psychological,'' he
says, ``motivated by inextricable layers of shame, guilt, disgrace,
contempt, self-loathing, propitiation and expiation.''
</P>
<P>
   By offering the ritualized formula of the Miranda warnings, it
could be argued, the court has shielded society from the need to
confront that disconcerting truth.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, the four Miranda warnings _ ``You have
the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against
you in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer and to have
the lawyer present during questioning. If you cannot afford a
lawyer, one will be appointed for you.'' _ look like fragile reeds
on a sea of turmoil and human vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting the deeper meanings of Miranda in its full cultural
context is neither comfortable nor reassuring. That Miranda
continues to roil the waters after 34 years tells us something
about law, something about politics, but perhaps most of all, in
our confession-saturated society, something about ourselves.

<P>
   ESSEN, Germany _ She blushed bright red and managed an
embarrassed smile. Her arms dangled awkwardly, until, overwhelmed
by the ovation from the congress of her Christian Democratic party,
Angela Merkel managed a wave so rigid it suggested an East German
leader from the Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of pollsters, dubious campaign financing and image
manipulation, Germany has abruptly produced an anti-heroine as the
new leader of its main conservative political force.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, 45, East German by birth and a physicist by training, is
being put forward by her scandal-mired party as an antidote to
politics as usual. But she is also representative of a broader
trend: the political breakthrough by women in Germany and France,
the dominant countries of continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who led the Christian Democrats
for 25 years and his country for 16, believed firmly in the the
three K's: Kinder (children), Kueche (kitchen), and Kirche (church)
as defining a woman's proper role. A fourth K, for Kanzlerin, or
female chancellor, was simply out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the conservative culture of our party, a female leader was
unthinkable until very recently,'' said Kurt Biedenkopf, the
Christian Democrat premier of Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Sussmuth labored long and hard under the Kohl system,
rising to become the Christian Democratic speaker of the Bundestag.
But even she felt she could go only so far. ``In a male-dominated
political culture, I was allowed into the forecourt of power,'' she
said. ``But the forecourt was the limit set by Kohl, and he made
that abundantly clear. The difference today is that Merkel can
reach the very center of power.''
</P>
<P>
   How long Merkel's political honeymoon will last, and whether she
can revive her battered party, remain to be seen. Her message,
beyond the straightforward image that has allowed her to emerge as
the party's potential savior from financial misdealings, remains
vague. But the zeitgeist is on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness has grown that the female vote cannot be taken for
granted, and that, as in the United States, it wins elections. For
example, Roman Catholic women over 45 long constituted an essential
pillar of the German Christian Democrats. But religion is now less
important, working women have different priorities, and party
allegiance has become more fickle. The 7 percent drop in the female
vote for the Christian Democrats in 1998, and the 5 percent surge
in the female vote for the Social Democrats, gave a decisive nudge
to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his quest for power.
</P>
<P>
   Women appeared to be drawn to women candidates, and the Social
Democrats, unlike the Christian Democrats, had imposed a quota,
saying a minimum of 40 percent of their candidates must be female.
</P>
<P>
   In France, too, the female vote has migrated from its
concentration on the Gaullist right toward the center and left.
Political swings now tend to involve both sexes equally, although
women vote rather more for ecologically minded parties and rather
less for the extreme-right National Front than men.
</P>
<P>
   The French Gaullist party, like the Christian Democrats long a
bastion of European conservatism, recently opted for a woman,
Michelle Alliot-Marie, as its new leader. Francoise de Panafieu, a
straight-talking former custodian of the Paris parks, has emerged
as a potential mayor of the French capital. And Martine Aubry, the
Socialist labor minister, is widely seen as a serious future
contender to become France's first Madame la Presidente de la
Republique.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more chic today than being a woman in
politics,'' said Elisabeth Badinter, an author and philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this shift lies several factors. The push for equality of
opportunity that started with the feminist movements of the 1970s
has produced a generation eager to eliminate the last barriers to
women in politics and the upper echelons of business. In German top
management, women account for only 6 percent of posts; the same low
ratio applies to the presence of women in the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by his feminist wife, Sylviane Agacinskci, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin has made women's issues a central plank of
his policies. Even the constitution was recently revised to favor
of women as candidates: parties are now obliged by law to present
lists that are at least 50 percent female for some elections.
</P>
<P>
   German women, propelled by a particularly strong feminist
movement, made faster headway in politics: almost one-third of the
parliament is female today, compared with 11 percent of the French
lower house. But it took unification, a decade ago, to challenge
deeply held patriarchal attitudes. East Germany was a place where
women worked _ 80 percent of them had a job. Even today, the
percentage of women who work in the eastern part of the country _
73 percent _ is far higher than the 56 percent in the west. ``In
one area at least, communism taught us something positive,'' said
Christel Hanewinckel, a Social Democratic parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Merkel to shake up the last loden-coated male bastions of
German conservatism. She has come up with a slogan ``Markt und
Menschlichkeit'' _ ``The Market and Humanity'' _ that captures the
difficulty of her task. There is no shortage of men, particularly
in Bavaria, who would be happy to see her fail in her attempt to
juggle national identity and globalization, the Internet revolution
and social welfare, immigration and the Volk. But the initial
evidence is that Merkel will gain support from East Germans and
from women, which may shield her from sniping.
</P>
<P>
   If she can pull it off, and if she can galvanize her party,
Germany may be treated to an extraordinary sight: that of a woman
entering the still-unfinished Berlin Chancellery, a vast Kohlian
monument to male fantasies of power, and taking office as the first
Kanzlerin in a house built for a Kanzler.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their ranks are admittedly small, but their views
seem incompatible with their political philosophy. Still, in recent
weeks a number of prominent conservatives with tough law-and-order
credentials have raised questions about _ of all things _ the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have pushed for more DNA testing to help acquit the
unjustly convicted. Others have called for more procedural
safeguards. Declaring that the death penalty discriminates against
members of minorities and poor people who cannot afford competent
lawyers, the televangelist Pat Robertson recently called for a
moratorium on executions. The columnist George Will wrote that
``skepticism is in order'' when it comes to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting that a conservative rethinking of the death
penalty will spawn a political groundswell that will sweep away
capital punishment. But there are signs that they are scrambling
long-held notions about it. Recently, the Republican-controlled New
Hampshire state House of Representatives passed a bill to abolish
the death penalty, and the nonpartisan, but decidedly conservative,
Nebraska legislature approved a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., will announce
that he is sponsoring a bill with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that
would provide competent lawyers for defendants in murder cases and
guarantee death row inmates access to DNA testing if that could
help exonerate them.
</P>
<P>
   And last January, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, said
he was imposing a moratorium on executions after 13 people in his
state had been unjustly sentenced to death since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot support a system which, in its administration, has
proven so fraught with error and has come so close to the ultimate
nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life,'' he said, in
announcing the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate is shifting,'' said Tim Lynch, director
of the Project on Criminal Justice for the Cato Institute, a
conservative-libertarian research and advocacy organization. ``I
think a lot of conservatives may not go as far as liberals and say
it should be abolished. But what happened in Illinois is getting
people to rethink whether sufficient safeguards are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative qualms about capital punishment are generally not
based on the alleged immorality of the death penalty; few
conservatives express a belief that executions are cruel and
unusual punishment and therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the legitimacy of capital punishment is the
issue,'' said Bruce Fein, a conservative constitutional scholar.
``There are crimes that I feel are so heinous that there isn't
anything else that would represent sufficient societal
condemnation. But having said that, there is nothing that could be
more terrible to a system of justice than to send innocent people
to death. In that sense, I think the current system has flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   While some like Fein reject the idea of the death penalty as a
deterrent to crime, others like Will, argue that even if it is, its
misapplication should raise serious doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic political twist, some conservatives are proffering
an anti-government libertarian argument against capital punishment,
pushing a cause long favored by pro-government liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the foul-ups and mix-ups and incompetence
that you often find in government work, it gets scary,'' said
Lynch. ``You realize that the institution that puts people to death
is the same institution that delivers the mail to the wrong
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that morality does not feature at all in the new
thinking. Some anti-abortion advocates draw little distinction
between killing a fetus and executing a person. ``It's a
consistency,'' Smith said, ``not an inconsistency, that people who
believe in the sanctity of life have an incentive to be sure that
the innocent are never put to death by state action, whether they
are unborn or in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, some conservatives say, a number of reasons for the
sudden change of heart on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   With homicide tumbling to its lowest rate since 1967, there is
less fear and anger about crime, and as a result a general
softening by the public on the question of capital punishment. In a
recent Gallup Poll, 66 percent of respondents said they favored the
death penalty. Although high, the figure represents the lowest
level of support for executions in 19 years. Hence, conservatives _
and everybody else _ now have more political room to vent whatever
concerns they might have had about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The use of DNA testing has also brought into sharp relief the
cases where defendants have been wrongly condemned to death, and
many conservatives have been shocked by stories of defense lawyers
falling asleep during murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   These new right-wing critics of capital punishment are a result
of a new smarter strategy by death penalty opponents, say some
death penalty experts and conservatives. Frustrated that moral and
abolitionist arguments were not getting them to first base with the
public, anti-capital punishment advocates stopped swinging for the
fences and lowered their sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an attempt to appeal to the public's concerns,'' said
Richard Dieter, a longtime death penalty opponent who is now
executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ``We
found out that they're not going to be opposed to the death penalty
just because a few people said they should. But they are concerned
about issues of fairness and innocence.''

FINDING ROOM FOR THE POOR IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ On all sides of the debate about globalization,
in rich and poor nations alike, there lurks a disturbing, shared
sense that even as industry expands around the Third World,
something is going tragically wrong in the poorest economies and
most disadvantaged societies.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is about how and why this is happening, and what can
be done about it _ and these questions threaten to divide world
opinion as nothing has since the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, leaders of the Third World meeting in Havana and
protesters marching in Washington both denounced the global economy
and its symbols: the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the World Trade Organization. But slogans and oratory do little
to illuminate the profound complexity of human development in the
new economic order.
</P>
<P>
   From a village-eye view where life is harshest, some development
experts say, nothing could be more irrelevant than global theories
or rants against multinational companies. To the poorest people who
live without teachers, doctors, roads, electricity and sometimes
even food and water, the culprit is a lot closer to home: the
local, state or national government. When the people of Calcutta
march to denounce power cuts or uncollected garbage, they fault the
government of West Bengal, not the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Among development experts working at the grass roots, in fact,
there is no dearth of ideas about how to bring the benefits of
globalization to the poor. Computer technology, for example, can be
brought to poor regions at a relatively low cost with the use of
satellite telephones, making available all kinds of information in
health, education, agriculture and consumer advice.
</P>
<P>
   International companies, for another example, could be persuaded
to conduct hands-on projects in their factories that could help
workers improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say national debt relief should be tied to
requirements that the poor reap the benefit. Some say that
well-meaning outsiders might rethink such activities as labor-union
boycotts of low-wage imports because this only denies poor people
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In most theories, one theme increasingly stands out: If the
world wants development of poverty-stricken nations, it must
improve the way the world governs itself, at all levels. Big
international institutions need to assure that their policies work
for all levels of society. National governments need to make
programs like health and education reach more than an urban elite.
Aid already goes into building courts, political organizations,
economic regulatory bodies and police forces, but the experts say
more is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, speaking at the
University of Havana last week, suggested that both the
anti-internationalists and the critics of their own rulers deserve
to be listened to. ``The issue,'' he said, ``is primarily one of
governance _ how the international community of sovereign states
and multilateral organizations copes with global challenges, and
how individual nations manage their own affairs so as to play their
part, pull their weight and serve their peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan is not alone in his focus on governance at every level.
Virtually no intergovernmental organization or independent
mainstream development group argues any longer that international
organizations or national governments are so worthy of aid that it
can be given without guarantees that it not be diverted, stolen, or
used to bolster a nondemocratic regime.
</P>
<P>
   Debt relief _ a demand made by Third World leaders in Havana _
is an example. Oxfam, which no one could accuse of insensitivity to
the poorest nations, now argues that governments seeking debt
forgiveness should be expected to demonstrate that the money saved
will go into programs to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals like these align international organizations
advocating for the poor more with the citizens of poor countries
than with their governments, and that gives globalization a new
twist: The familiar critique has been that globalization empowers
multinational corporations and organizations like the World Bank
and World Trade Organization to act as if they had more power than
states. Now, nongovernmental organizations are responding in kind _
building links with intergovernmental organizations or
multinational corporations that have direct aid programs, thus
circumventing national governments.
</P>
<P>
   The very institutions that have been most criticized by
protesters in Seattle or Washington have begun moving to act
differently too. Bengt Save-Soderbergh, secretary-general of the
International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in
Stockholm, which is supported by 19 democratic governments, says he
has seen the World Bank move dramatically into social programs in
recent years _ ironically, just as protesters operating on outdated
images single it out for attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Michigan Business School, Dr. Linda Y.C.
Lim, a professor of international business, says the International
Monetary Fund has also moved well beyond its charter as a purely
fiscal rescue squad into the once-forbidden territory of human
rights. Last year in Indonesia, it withheld desperately needed
financial support because of army-inspired violence in East Timor.
``A lot of people have become unhappy with the IMF attaching
conditions like democracy and human rights, which are not in its
charter,'' she said in an interview. But she said that in Asia
these days, ``a lot of reformers like having the IMF there'' _
because it gives local leaders political cover to initiate reforms
that are needed if the economy is to be made rational.

   This is not to say that the global organizations, and the big
nations influential in setting their policies, don't inflict pain.
The World Trade Organization is a target of discontent everywhere,
though not, as many Americans believe, because it avoids human
rights issues like child labor and freedom to organize unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main complaint of developing countries is that the WTO is
a rich man's club set according to rich man's rules which tend to
disadvantage the poor guys,'' Lim said. She said developing nations
see huge subsidies going to U.S. agribusiness while poor countries
are expected to end their subsidies. ``The sectors which benefit
poor countries have not been liberalized,'' she said, ``and those
sectors are textiles _ labor-intensive textiles _ and
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, battles over globalization are supposedly
fought in the name of the poor. But countries make choices about
how to allocate resources. Amartya Sen, the Nobel Prize-winning
Indian economist who has long argued that democratic government is
the best guarantee against the worst effects of drought or economic
hardship, has more recently chided his home country for its failure
to improve the lives of those at the bottom, particularly women,
even as India and its neighbor Pakistan, have decided to build
missiles and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   May Rihani, who has worked for years to mitigate inequities of
wealth, class, gender and education in villages in Egypt, Pakistan,
Mali, Guinea and Malawi, puts the argument this way: `'In the
villages where I work the rural perspective is not globalization.
No. The rural perspective is: We have not received the services
that are basic, that we see our compatriots in urban areas
receiving. Why?''

   May Rihani, who has worked for years to mitigate inequities of
wealth, class, gender and education in villages in Egypt, Pakistan,
Mali, Guinea and Malawi, puts the argument this way: `'In the
villages where I work the rural perspective is not globalization.
No. The rural perspective is: We have not received the services
that are basic, that we see our compatriots in urban areas
receiving. Why?''

   Taking a Little Time Out for Making Amends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush met with a dozen gay Republicans and
pronounced himself psychically refreshed. ``I'm a better person for
the meeting,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to the Bush campaign,
acknowledged that his consulting firm had been lobbying Bush on
behalf of the Microsoft Corp. and pronounced it a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, in agreeing to meet with Bush in
Pittsburgh next month _ their first face-to-face encounter since
Bush knocked him from the presidential race _ said he was a step
closer to endorsing his fellow Republican. ``If not then, certainly
over time,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week, it seemed, for making amends. Throughout the
primary season, when his ability to appeal to Christian
conservatives was especially crucial to his candidacy, Bush
repeatedly rebuffed the requests by the gay Log Cabin Republicans
for a sit-down. Now, moving ever more closely to the middle, the
governor was displaying a more embracing side, even if the meeting
was greeted warily by some gay leaders as well as bysome
Republicans on the far right.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, too, the Bush campaign seemed intent on
extending its reach, as the governor proposed a $2,000 tax credit
to help low- and moderate-income working families buy health
insurance. It was part of a package Bush called ``a new prosperity
initiative'' designed to make poverty a ``stage, not a fate.''
</P>
<P>
   His presumed Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore,
meanwhile, was tiptoeing gingerly around a different sort of
national concern. In the midst of last week's volatile tug-of-war
over Elian Gonzalez, Gore canceled a news conference to avoid
weighing in again on the issue at a potentially explosive moment,
his campaign said. (Two weeks ago he said he supported legislation
to grant the boy and his father permanent residency status.)
</P>
<P>
   On another day, Gore took up residency in the home of a
Charlotte, N.C., language arts teacher. He spent the night in the
home of Laurel Wingfield, talking about education over midnight
snacks. This was Gore's own outreach program to the Republican
Party. That's the side Wingfield said she voted with most of the
time.

   The Case of the Dozing Diplomats &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the world knows how Alain Dejammet, France's just-departed
ambassador to the United Nations, was amusing himself during those
long Security Council consultations. He was thinking about naps.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Paris after four years in New York, Dejammet went public
with his guide to sleeping at the United Nations _ ``Dormir aux
Nations Unies.'' The little booklet, no more than a computer
printout with a black cat on the cover page, has kept photocopiers
busy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet, who says he had the help of a couple of other French
diplomats in compiling his survey, ranked 12 mostly cozy,
preferably dark, corners where the chairs were perfect for catching
a snooze. The only perfect score of 20 went to a place off limits
to everyone except the French _ their private office near the
Security Council. A possibly better-quipped and certainly more
accessible siesta center that rated high is the periodicals
library, with enveloping sofas and, the guide says, the calm of
``an abandoned monastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitely out: the off-campus Meditation Room across First
Avenue, where blue-tinted windows create a gloom worthy of ``a
Draculesque crypt'' and there is the annoying squeak of tourists'
sneakers and many Scandinavian visitors.

   Shorn of Its Horns, The Nasdaq Stumbles
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in Nasdaq stocks is no more.
</P>
<P>
   As shares in the fledgling technology companies that dominate
the Nasdaq composite and investors' hearts plummeted, the index
fell deep into bear market territory. Although the more established
companies in the Dow Jones industrial average held up a bit better,
inflation fears were re-ignited by the government's announcement
Friday that consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in five years.
This drove the Dow down 5.6 percent alone. All the major stock
indexes are now showing significant declines for the year.

   President Alberto K. Fujimori, the longest-serving Latin
American leader after Fidel Castro, fell just short of winning an
outright first-round victory for a third five-year term in an
election tainted by accusations of fraud from international
monitors. When a runoff for June was announced, crowds of tens of
thousands of protesters dispersed and international observers
expressed relief.

immediately after he offered it. But there was no mistaking his
words: First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, if elected to the Senate,
``would be a star of the quality that has not been seen since Bobby
Kennedy was elected senator from the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican presidential candidate is known for his
candor. But his remarks were a bit surprising, given that McCain
has campaigned for Clinton's Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

   Waiting With Elian
</P>
<P>
   The government asked a federal appeals court to order Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives to return the boy to his father, who
agreed to stay in this country until it rules. The relatives,
turning to another court for help, invoked the U.N. human-rights
charter in asking that the child be allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   After daring the government to take him by force Thursday, by
the end of the week Elian's Miami relatives vowed to keep waiting,
holding the child, until federal agents come to them _ something
that won't happen until a last-minute injunction is resolved in the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Europe's Jews. He is now obligated to pay Lipstadt's and Penguin's

   President Vladimir Putin of Russia won ratification of the

The passage, Putin's first legislative initiative since his
election, was viewed as a sign that he seeks not only a
constructive relationship with the West but also intends to fight
hard to block U.S. efforts to revise or abandon earlier
arms-control treaties. The treaty must still be approved by the
upper house, and the U.S. Senate has yet to approve several

</P>
<P>
   CONFESSIONS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As the Supreme Court prepares
to revisit the landmark Miranda decision on confessions by criminal
suspects, there is something appropriate about the timing.
Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ seems to have
become a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller
list, revelations of appalling intimacy on TV. Politicians are
expected to admit to all manner of personal transgressions. Now,
long after other milestones of the Warren Court were absorbed by
the criminal justice system, Miranda still stirs passions. By Linda
Greenhouse. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-POVERTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ On all sides of the
debate about globalization, in rich and poor nations alike, there
lurks a disturbing, shared sense that even as Internet millionaires
are being made and industry expands around the Third World,
something is going very wrong in the poorest economies and most
disadvantaged societies. The dispute is about how and why this is
happening, or what can be done about it. By Barbara Crossette.

<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-DEATHPENALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Several
prominent law-and-order conservatives have recently raised
questions about the death penalty. Some urge more DNA testing to
help acquit the unjustly convicted. Others seek more procedural
safeguards. Pat Robertson wants a moratorium on executions because
the death penalty discriminates against minorities and the poor.
George Will thinks ``skepticism is in order'' about capital
punishment. By Steven A. Holmes.

   CEO-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1992, Bill Clinton decried the
soaring salaries of America's chief executives. In the eight years
since then, CEOs' average pay has more than tripled to $11.9
million, but this year's presidential candidates have not mentioned
it. The populist issue has paled. The changing American attitude
toward money may have something to do with it. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   WEAPONS-COSTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has always
insisted that there can be no price tag on national security:
weapons represent America's global superiority, and if they are
costly, so be it. But the issue of how wisely the Pentagon spends
money persists. Little has changed since 1969, when an Air Force
financial analyst told Congress that the 77-aircraft C-5A program
was $2 billion over budget _ an unheard-of sum back then.
Billion-dollar cost overruns are now commonplace at the Pentagon.
And telling the truth about costs still comes hard. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSTUDENTS-ETHICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ To cynics, the news that
three Georgetown law students had settled SEC charges of running an
Internet stock manipulation scheme probably came as no surprise.
After all, lawyers have had an image problem at least since
Shakespeare. But even people who think the phrase legal ethics is
an oxymoron may have been surprised by Georgetown's announcement
that it would take no action against the students, who did not
admit or deny wrongdoing. A look at other examples of law schools'
laxity on students' ethical lapses. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-GENOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The human genome project could
enable medicine and medical research to return to some of its best,
and most old-fashioned, traditions. In fact, the emerging gene
sciences will reunite the patient, doctor and researcher, in ways
not seen since the 19th- and early 20th centuries. By David A.
Shaywitz and Dennis A. Ausiello
</P>
<P>
   WWII-ART-THEFTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Art institutions and private
and governmental agencies around the world are beginning to publish
catalogs on the Internet describing artworks in their holdings that
could have been confiscated or looted by one of the belligerents in
World War II and, if so proved, should be returned to their
rightful owners. By William Honan.
</P>
<P>
   PSYCH-VIOLENCE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Psychiatrists say
predicting violence accurately is impossible, but there are tools
that help them make clinical judgments. Most important is the
individual interview. A sampling of some notes from such an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   XFL-FOOTBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Vince McMahon has turned his
attention from the raunch of his staged World Wrestling Federation
events to creating the XFL, a high-octane, ``smash mouth'' football
league, in partnership with NBC. But for the strategy behind Vince
McMahon's secret plan to turn himself into Vince Lombardi with
bulging pectorals, let's turn to his manifesto, ``The XFL: An
Accident Waiting to Happen.'' By Richard Sandomir.

<P>
   NKOREA-CUBA-REVIEW (Seoul, South Korea) _ Cuba's Fidel Castro
has been the intellectual scold of the powerful, preaching to the
world's rich nations about their obligations to the world's poorest
nations. North Korea has been seen as intransigent, introverted and
unpredictable and un-worldly-wise. But judging by recent events,
it's the North Koreans who seem to have come first to a reluctant
understanding of how the world really works these days: That what a
desperately impoverished communist outpost sitting next to a
capitalist hotshot needs most is not an enemy to rail against but a
partner to join futures with. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-WOMEN-POLS-REVIEW (Essen, Germany) _ Europe's men of power
hold open a door for women. In an age of pollsters, dubious
campaign financing and image manipulation, Germany has abruptly
produced an anti-heroine as the new leader of its main conservative
political force. Angela Merkel, East German by birth and a
physicist by training, is being put forward by the scandal-mired
Christian Democrats as an antidote to politics as usual. But she is
also representative of a broader trend: the political breakthrough
by women in Germany and France, the dominant countries of
continental Europe. By Roger Cohen.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   CONFESSIONS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As the Supreme Court prepares
to revisit the landmark Miranda decision on confessions by criminal
suspects, there is something appropriate about the timing.
Confession _ by almost anyone to almost anything _ seems to have
become a national obsession. There are memoirs on the best-seller
list, revelations of appalling intimacy on TV. Politicians are
expected to admit to all manner of personal transgressions. Now,
long after other milestones of the Warren Court were absorbed by
the criminal justice system, Miranda still stirs passions. By Linda
Greenhouse. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-POVERTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ On all sides of the
debate about globalization, in rich and poor nations alike, there
lurks a disturbing, shared sense that even as Internet millionaires
are being made and industry expands around the Third World,
something is going very wrong in the poorest economies and most
disadvantaged societies. The dispute is about how and why this is
happening, or what can be done about it. By Barbara Crossette.
(Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-DEATHPENALTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Several
prominent law-and-order conservatives have recently raised
questions about the death penalty. Some urge more DNA testing to
help acquit the unjustly convicted. Others seek more procedural
safeguards. Pat Robertson wants a moratorium on executions because
the death penalty discriminates against minorities and the poor.
George Will thinks ``skepticism is in order'' about capital
punishment. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   CEO-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1992, Bill Clinton decried the

   TRADE-INSTITUTIONS (Washington) _ Commissions are examining
whether the World Bank lends too much to middle-income nations and
not enough to the world's poorest. The IMF is embroiled in battles
over whether it did more harm than good when it placed strict
budget-balancing and interest rate requirements on nations hit by
the Asian contagion. And the World Trade Organization, which is not
meeting in Washington this week, is a target nonetheless. ``I think
one of the common complaints is that many of these organizations
don't listen as well as they say they do,'' said Andrea Durbin of
Friends of the Earth, who frequently interacts with the
institutions at the center of the protests. By David E. Sanger.

MONTHS LATER, MUD VICTIMS IN VENEZUELA STILL LACK AID
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACUTO, Venezuela _ Armed with shovels and pickaxes, Jose
Estevez and half a dozen neighbors and volunteers stood at the door
of what used to be his home here and contemplated the dried mud and
debris that filled the building to the ceiling. With a shrug, he
called out, ``Let's go, folks,'' and began to dig.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, in the worst natural disaster in modern
Venezuelan history, a 25-mile strip of Caribbean coast just north
of Caracas was inundated by floods and mudslides. But after an
initial burst of activity, government relief has been been slow in
arriving, for reasons ranging from political squabbling to lack of
organization. People like Estevez, tired of the waiting, have
decided to begin helping themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, official reconstruction efforts appear to have
been slowed by a dispute between the state and federal governments.
The governor of Vargas State, Alfredo Laya, belongs to a left-wing
party that originally was part of President Hugo Chavez's coalition
but has now broken with the president and is running its own
candidates in national elections scheduled for May 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Chavez coalition, Patriotic Pole, is running a rival slate,
meaning the president has little interest in doing anything that
would enhance Laya's popularity, though the federal government
denies that the rivalry has anything to do with why money for
relief and reconstruction efforts has slowed to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   The national government says it wants to move many of the
150,000 people who were displaced by the floods and mudslides to
the interior and rebuild the disaster zone's tourist facilities.
Money for such a large relocation program is scarce, however, and
opposition is vehement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This land and this house are mine, and I'm not going to accept
some 20-year government bond for what belongs to me just so that
they can build some big development for tourists,'' said Estevez,
who is 60. ``How can I go to the interior with no support when my
business is here and I need to eat now?''
</P>
<P>
   For several days in April, local people protesting the
relocation plan have blocked the main coastal highway west of here.
Some carried placards proclaiming, ``No real estate deals, no
displacements'' and ``We are going to die of hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents also criticize Chavez for rejecting help from the
American military. Though his government accepted aid from many
other nations, a contingent of American military engineers had to
turn back when Chavez said he would find their presence
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake to say no to them and their equipment,''
said one resident, Gladys Cedeno Zamora, ``but our president is a
pigheaded man, and now we are the ones paying the price for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, human rights groups are investigating accusations
of abuses by government security forces in the chaotic days after
the mudslides. At the time, residents complained of summary
executions of suspected looters, as well as arbitrary arrests and
searches, mistreatment of people taken into custody, and forced
disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clandestine activities were undertaken, and they were
generalized, not isolated,'' said Liliana Ortega Mendoza, director
of the Committee of Families of Victims, which has filed complaints
with international courts. ``The government's investigations into
what happened has not been what I would call free, open and
transparent, and no officials have been disciplined or called to
account.''
</P>
<P>
   An accurate death toll from the disaster has still to be
determined. The Chavez government first minimized the number of
casualties and then suggested that 30,000 to 50,000 people might
have died, figures that are now considered exaggerated. According
to recent Venezuelan press reports, fewer than 1,000 bodies have
actually been recovered, and about 5,000 people are still missing,
with the vast majority presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The toll, said Antonio Jaime, the International Red Cross
delegate here, ``could be 10,000, or it could be two or three
thousand, but honestly, the chaos and confusion were such that it
is going to be difficult for anyone ever to be able to give you a
certifiable figure.''

   TRADE-INSTITUTIONS (Washington) _ Commissions are examining
whether the World Bank lends too much to middle-income nations and
not enough to the world's poorest. The IMF is embroiled in battles
over whether it did more harm than good when it placed strict
budget-balancing and interest rate requirements on nations hit by
the Asian contagion. And the World Trade Organization, which is not
meeting in Washington this week, is a target nonetheless. ``I think
one of the common complaints is that many of these organizations
don't listen as well as they say they do,'' said Andrea Durbin of

SAY

<P>
   PERM, Russia _ Chechen rebels were raking a column of Russian
militiamen with machine-gun fire and mortars when the militia made
a desperate effort to save what was left of its men.
</P>
<P>
   Barking into a radio, the Russians, special police from the Ural
mountains region, promised to be more lenient toward the Chechens
in Vedeno, a mountain town in southern Chechnya. In return, they
wanted the rebels to let them take their wounded and retreat. The
militants responded by pressing the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Allah will decide all,''' recalled Vladimir
Kurakin, one of the few survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities have yet to disclose the results of
their inquiry into the ambush on March 29, which led to the death
of as many as 36 policemen from the Perm region, reverberated
through the news media and shook the nation's confidence in its
generals.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of survivors who have returned to this region have
given their accounts. And it is a tale of high-level incompetence,
poor training and terror on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the whole thing could have been avoided,'' said Sergei
Ostapchuk, one of those who was caught in the firefight, his head
swathed in bandages.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a tale of bureaucratic fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian politicians have portrayed the Perm militia as
heroes, there was no military plane to take Ostapchuk home. He
returned to Perm in economy class on a regular commercial airliner
after making a connecting flight in Moscow. So did Aleksandr
Prokopov, a 29-year-old noncommissioned militia officer who lay on
a stretcher balanced across the airline seats and whose leg was
amputated in Perm soon after his return.
</P>
<P>
   Money worries were also on the soldiers' minds. Before shipping
out to Chechnya, the militia members were given a three-month
salary advance of about 20,000 rubles, or $700. But because their
tour was cut short by the ambush, some of the survivors feared that
they might have to pay most of that money back.
</P>
<P>
   In long, detailed interviews, they told of the ordeal that began
in Vedeno, the hometown of Shamil Basayev, the most notorious of
the Chechen warlords. After the Russian military seized Vedeno with
great fanfare in February, Basayev's palatial red brick house
became the headquarters for the Russian military commandant there.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, however, the generals declared the military
phase of the operation over and withdrew virtually all of the
Russian troops from the area. The special police unit from Perm was
sent to keep the peace in Vedeno, where about 7,000 Chechen
civilians remain. The Russian Army's high command seemed so relaxed
that the policemen were worried that they would not qualify for
combat pay, despite a number of disturbing incidents in Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
   March 28 was a quiet day. The militia drove around Vedeno with
Yuri P. Trutnev, Perm's mayor, who was visiting the town along with
the chief of the Perm region's militia to show their support for
their hometown boys and deliver toys to needy children. These were
good photo opportunities for the news media back home, about 1,400
miles northeast.
</P>
<P>
   That evening the policemen received what turned out to be the
fateful order, instructing them to send a few dozen men to a nearby
settlement. Gennadi V. Igumnov, the governor of the Perm region,
said in an interview this month that the purpose was to pick up
nine prisoners in nearby Zhani-Vedeno and take them and their
confiscated weapons to a more secure location.
</P>
<P>
   There is an old Russian saying that the biggest problems in the
country are roads and fools, and in Vedeno the two came together.
The Russian authorities have still not said who ordered the convoy
to leave Vedeno. The militia insists it came from a high-ranking
commander, and the local Perm newspaper Permskiye Novosti said it
had come from Maj. Gen. Sergei Makarov, the commander of the
eastern group of Russian forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The militia's mission was based on a gross misreading of the
rebels' tactics. After being chased into the mountains, the
militants split into small groups and began to carry out guerrilla
attacks. There was no longer a clear front line in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   That put a premium on proper reconnaissance and close
coordination with the more heavily armed army forces. Neither
existed. Anatoly Kulikov, a former interior minister and commander
of the Russian troops in Chechnya during the previous war there,
noted that the militia was not trained to call in airstrikes or
artillery barrages. Nor are its radios compatible with those used
by the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Those deficiencies could have been remedied if a contingent of
Russian soldiers had escorted the militia column. Vladimir
Rushailo, the interior minister, had ordered that militia convoys
be properly protected after an earlier ambush, and it is not clear
why that order was not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main task of any commander is not just to prepare an
order, but to ensure that it is carried out,'' Kulikov said
caustically.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 a.m., a 49-man column left Vedeno along with several
trucks and a lone armored personnel carrier. Most of the policemen
were from Berezniki, 100 miles north of Perm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we approached the last of our checkpoints, the Interior
Ministry troops who manned it said the road we were to go on was
under Chechen control,'' recalled Kurakin, a 35-year-old platoon
commander. ``But we had our orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The column had gotten all of 4 miles when one of its trucks
broke down. So the commander, Valentin D. Simonov, walked up to a
nearby house. Suddenly, there was a burst of gunfire, and Simonov
was mowed down. The policemen jumped out of their vehicles and
dispersed, and the armored personnel carrier made a quick U-turn so
that it could join the fight, the survivors recalled.
</P>
<P>
   There were no leaves on the trees, but the rebels were on the
high ground and were well hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very well prepared,'' said Prokopov. ``They knew all
the distances to the targets and had picked the lines of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurakin added: ``They had small arms, large-caliber rifles,
machine guns, grenade launchers. They had everything. Just name
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the trucks and the armored personnel carrier were hit. As
the fighting continued, the militia had several frantic
conversations with the militants on the radio.

 PERM, Russia: the radio. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, they tried to negotiate their way out, offering to
ease their patrols in Vedeno in return for safe passage out. Then
they threatened to level the town if they were not permitted to
retreat. But nothing worked. As the firefight continued, a rescue
party was sent from Vedeno. These men, too, were mostly militia,
although there were also several ``kontraktniki,'' essentially
mercenaries who sign six-month or one-year contracts to fight in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As the rescue column rumbled through the forest, its members
could hear the shooting ahead. Suddenly, some of them were felled,
said Ostapchuk, who was in the rescue party. Anticipating the
rescue attempt, the rebels had set up a second ambush closer to
Vedeno, which the first column had passed without even noticing,
and now were shooting with sniper rifles, which were equipped with
silencers.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was snipers, then machine guns,'' said Ostapchuk.
``It was hard to figure out where the rebels were because the shots
were echoing through the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue column tried to fight its way forward, but as it
approached a narrow pass in the road, the rebels blasted the
armored personnel carrier at the head of the convoy, blocking the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned later that we were just 800 meters from the first
ambush,'' Ostapchuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rescuers were trying desperately to save their own
lives. They piled some of the wounded into one of the surviving
armored personnel carriers and beat a retreat. Nobody in the rescue
party was killed, but 17 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen later said fog prevented the military from
defending the original column, but the survivors say the weather
was clear much of the time. And they add that the militia could
have used flares to identify its position and those of the rebels
when patches of fog emerged _ if only helicopters had been there
when they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Kulikov is a member of the Russian Parliament's Security
Committee. After the attack, the panel demanded that Rushailo, the
interior minister, and the military prosecutor report on why the
debacle occurred. Instead, they sent an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aide read a paper from which nothing could be understood,
neither the causes, not the names of those who are guilty,''
Kulikov said in an interview. ``And, most important, he did not say
what measures were taken in order to prevent such tragic incidents
from happening in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have not asked Ostapchuk for his views, but he
has taken away a few lessons from the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change our military structure radically, establish
cooperation between our different types of forces and improve our
reconnaissance,'' he said. ``If some of our guys had just flown
over the area beforehand, they could have seen what the rebels had
in store for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was to blame, he raised his hand and pointed up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's them,'' he said, referring to Russia's top commanders.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the police built barricades and wrapped razor
wire over the gleaming glass front of the World Bank headquarters,
James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's Australian-born president, gathered
his staff last week and told them to ``remember to stand tall,
because we are way ahead of the protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   In the battle over who is to blame for the widening economic
inequities that thousands of people are arriving in Washington to
rail against, it was a telling moment of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find demoralizing is that there is no organization on
earth that is doing more for the poor than we do,'' Wolfensohn said
last week. ``Globalization is not something the World Bank can turn
back. It's not something the International Monetary Fund can stop.
We can only help people and countries adjust to it, to try to close
the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn paused and then, referring to the head of the World
Trade Organization, the initial target of the protesters' ire in
Seattle late last year, he added, ``You know, Mike Moore said today
that blaming us for civil strife and poverty is like blaming the
Red Cross for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but second-guessing generals and doctors is hardly
new, even in economic war.
</P>
<P>
   And if the protesters on the streets sound extreme in demanding
that the bank and the monetary fund be shut, they are hardly the
only ones taking aim at the half-century-old institutions designed
for a simpler economic era.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a week goes by in Washington these days without an
environmental group criticizing the World Bank's 650-mile-long
oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon, or a development project
on the fringes of Tibet that has been caught up in the politically
sensitive question of whether the bank is helping China dilute the
proportion of Tibetan people in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Commissions galore are re-examining whether the bank still lends
too much to middle-income nations and not enough to the world's
poorest. The IMF is still embroiled in battles over whether it did
more harm than good when it placed strict budget-balancing and
interest-rate requirements on nations hit by the Asian contagion.
And then there is the World Trade Organization, which is not
meeting in Washington but is a target nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Asia, the WTO is seen as a tool of Washington,
forcing countries to ingest hormone-treated beef or allow in U.S.
manufacturers. In Washington it is seen by many on Capitol Hill,
particularly conservatives, as a rogue bureaucracy intent on
setting labor, environmental and trade rules that override national
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the common complaints is that many of these
organizations don't listen as well as they say they do,'' said
Andrea Durbin, director of international programs for Friends of
the Earth, who frequently interacts with the institutions at the
center of the protests. ``The Indonesians have a new saying for
dealing with the World Bank _ they invite us, they inform us, and
then they ignore what we have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that the criticism is having some effect.
The IMF now publishes far more data about the economic condition of
its member countries than ever before. The idea was to flush out
nations that routinely hid bad news, but recently, to the fund's
delight, it set off howls in London when it questioned the wisdom
of Britain's economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn came to Saturday's meetings brandishing charts
showing that big power projects, once 25 percent of the World
Bank's lending, now account for just 2 percent, and that spending
on nutrition, education and ``microloans'' to small businesses,
many run by women in the Third World, has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about new partnerships with the World Wildlife Fund in
Brazil. For the first time, the top agenda item for the Development
Committee, the bank's main policy-setting body, is a review of
programs to fight AIDS, taking the bank into areas previously
handled by the United Nations and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that many of these changes do not strike at
the core of the bank's operations and that the pressure for better
focus and far bigger changes is growing. Twice in the last few
months Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has given speeches
outlining the Clinton administration's agenda, calling for ``a new
division of labor between the IMF and the World Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   While Summers hedged his comments carefully to avoid fueling
more extreme critics, he clearly is worried that the bank lent far
too little money for humanitarian purposes during the Asian crisis,
and should get out of some lending that could clearly be handled by
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of legitimate questions about what proportion
of the bank's projects work, and how well they get executed,'' a
senior American official said. ``And there are questions about
whether the bank's rhetoric matches its realities.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the proposals to reform the bank and the fund
appear to be at cross-purposes, there is rough agreement that both
have strayed from their main missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants the bank and the IMF to return to their core
competencies,'' said Nancy Birdsall, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who participated in a
study with the Overseas Development Council. ``The question is how
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF should lend to poor countries, she said, but ``not for
too long, because they get sucked into other issues, from reforming
education to bank supervision to designing the medical-care
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put poverty reduction in the World Bank, and managing
crises back in the IMF,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But another major study, commissioned by Congress and headed by
Alan Meltzer, a Carnegie Mellon professor who until recently called
for the elimination of the fund, concluded that the IMF should lend
money to countries in distress for no more than 120 days, with
perhaps one renewal. Fund officials say that is ridiculous; they
would have been pulling money out of Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea before their recoveries had gathered any steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these ideas don't make any sense,'' said Stanley
Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official. ``It's fine to say that
countries shouldn't rely on the IMF, just the way it would be nice
if people didn't need to rely on psychiatrists. But sometimes you
need some outside help, and it's usually when all the private money
is pulling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the fund's track record has been mixed at best _ not
surprising, since countries come to the fund only when they are in
dire financial straits _ it has been a ripe target.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is little question that some of its policies in
recent years made bad situations worse. It encouraged the free flow
of foreign capital in and out of countries around the world before
many had the supervisory systems to handle it. And it had to back
down from early requirements that Indonesia stop subsidizing fuel
and other critical staples.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fund is at a politically vulnerable moment. Its
longtime chief, Michel Camdessus, has just retired, and a bruising
battle over the selection of his successor is dividing its board.
</P>
<P>
   As the new chief, Horst Kohler of Germany, arrived in Washington
last week for the meetings, he was greeted with a vituperative
blast by Joseph E. Stiglitz, who was formerly the head of President
Clinton's council of economic advisers and, later, chief economist
at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters on the street, Stiglitz wrote in the magazine New
Republic, would ``say the IMF's economic `remedies' often make
things worse _ turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions
into depressions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they'll have a point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz went on to describe a culture of arrogance and inertia
within the fund, fueled by a staff of ``third-rank students from
first-rate universities'' and older men who ``act as if they are
shouldering Rudyard Kipling's white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the street protesters, he said the fund ``undermines the
democratic process by imposing policies'' in return for its
emergency cash. But his main complaint appeared to be that the fund
was not willing to adopt his approach to handling the Asian crisis
when he was at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Stiglitz published his blistering account, the IMF
and economists have been shooting back in equally nasty language.
Rudiger Dornbusch, a prominent professor at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and an occasional critic of the fund, immediately
circulated a response arguing that Stiglitz's argument was ``as
contrarian as it is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When countries arrive at the IMF, on a stretcher, this is not
the time for cute ideas,'' he wrote. ``Drastic politics are
necessary to avoid hemorrhage, currency collapse and irreparable
meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The austerity imposed by the fund, Dornbusch and others argue,
is nothing compared with the austerity that would be imposed if the
country in trouble simply ran out of cash, at the very moment when
private investors are fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Dornbusch said, austerity was as successful as
it was unpopular. ``The chief lesson for the IMF is that next time
they should apply exactly the same remedies and enjoy as
spectacular success,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has been musing about his presidential
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want a pardon. He doesn't want to be just another
Senate spouse. He doesn't want to give up the job he loves.
</P>
<P>
   I've been fretting over his future, too. And I think I've come
up with a novel way for him to still play a starring role in the
nation's life.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Bill stumbled with Monica and Hollywood big shots
groused that Clinton critics in Washington were unrealistic? A
president, they said, should be allowed to have grays, and not be
viewed in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   As Sean Daniel, a producer, told The New York Times' Bernard
Weinraub: ``There's an understanding here that you can have a
messed-up private life and still do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Herskovitz, who produced ``thirtysomething,'' said we
should accept ``the possibility of complexity and ambivalence'' in
marriage. ``In Hollywood,'' he said, ``marriage is often not seen
as a monolithic simple entity.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you'd think when Hollywood had the chance to influence the
culture by limning its own chief executives, it would paint with
those intriguing shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Hollywood is sticking with that old Henry Fonda formula.
They may love Clinton out there, but they are not ready to give us
a fictional president who is morally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   We get dream presidents like Harrison Ford in ``Air Force One,''
Morgan Freeman in ``Deep Impact'' and Bill Pullman in
``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy ``Dave,'' with Kevin Kline, started out with a
duplicitous, libidinous president. But he was quickly consigned to
a coma and replaced with a true-blue twin.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's ``West Wing,'' we get President Josiah Bartlett, a
Nobel Prize-winning economist who is a faithful husband, fabulous
dad and forgiving boss. The guy is so preternaturally inspiring
that even President Clinton is smitten. ``West Wing'' was created
by Aaron Sorkin, who sired a similarly idealized leader in ``The
American President.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's success has spurred a lot of interest in Washington
dramas packed with extremely attractive young men and women who do
good by day and get down by night.
</P>
<P>
   In ``D.C.,'' a Senate staffer, a lobbyist, a TV producer and a
Supreme Court clerk, all roommates, opine: ``Sometimes it's not
about blind ambition. It's about doing the right thing.'' And,
``You know who makes this place really hum? It's us, the people
behind them. We're the only ones with enough energy to write the
laws, run the committees, party 'til 3 and then do it all again the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Washington shows are in the hopper. This will be Clinton's
true legacy. Along with George Stephanopoulos, he showed Hollywood
that politics could be sexy, that Pennsylvania Avenue could be

<P>
   Speaking to newspaper editors in Washington last week, the
president was asked if he was going to have an impeachment wing in
his presidential library. ``Yeah,'' he said, ``we'll deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Impeachment Wing. It had a nice ring, like ``West Wing''
but less goody-goody. If the saint in that show can get big
ratings, what could a sinner in a new show called ``Impeachment
Wing'' get?
</P>
<P>
   Since Bill Clinton is casting around for something to do, why
not cast himself in his own Oval hour? It would give the
Entertainer in Chief the third term he really wants. It could be
MTV's ``Real World'' meets ABC's ``World News Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sitcom pals, the Thomasons, could write it, capping
their efforts to fuse show biz and politics. The TV President
Clinton could do good by day and get down by night. Or vice versa.
There could be an eerily familiar cast of supporting players: the
steely but vulnerable senator-wife; the knowing but unknowing
secretary-gatekeeper; the frisky but delusional mistress-intern;
and the bungling but tall attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood should take a lesson from the phenomenal success of
``The Sopranos.'' Audiences are willing to embrace an ethically
compromised, dysfunctional patriarch with big appetites, a
complicated marriage and an edgy relationship with his college-age
daughter. A mama's boy who fears his life will amount to a Big
Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Look for ``Impeachment Wing'' in the 2001 May sweeps. On cable,
of course.

COMMENTARY: GOLDILOCKS AND THE BEARS  
 BY PAUL KRUGMAN  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors buy because others are buying, sell because others are
selling. When stock prices are rising, it's called ``momentum
investing''; when they are falling, it's called ``panic.'' And
panic, which had been building all week, broke out in full on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest losers in the final sell-off was Tiffany's:
The price of the jeweler's shares abruptly fell 13 percent,
apparently because investors feared that it was especially
vulnerable to a market decline. And they may well be right. (``He's
your guy/ when stocks are high,/ but beware when they start to
descend./ It's then that those louses/ go back to their spouses./
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.'') But will the turmoil in the
stock markets spill over, not just into jewelry, but into the real
economy generally? Is this the end of the ``Goldilocks economy''?
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before. Never mind 1929 _ that stock slump
occurred in an environment of institutional weakness and sheer
policy stupidity that I think (I hope) no longer exists. We aren't
going to raise interest rates to peg the dollar to gold, or allow
banks to tumble like dominoes. The example to worry about is Japan
in the '90s _ an economic juggernaut that stumbled badly after the
burst of a financial bubble, and even a decade later has by no
means regained its former vigor.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, some Japanese have been arguing for years that any
day now the United States is going to go through the same
comeuppance they experienced _ that our ``new economy'' is as
fragile, perhaps illusory, as their bubble economy of the late
1980s. And after the last week a few Americans may be wondering if
they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been obsessed with Japan's economic problems for years
_ it really bothered me to see a wealthy, politically stable
country seemingly unable to pull itself out of a simple demand-side
slump. I think I have some idea why in their case what started as a
mere paper loss ramified into something much worse. And to me
America's prospects of avoiding a similar fate look very good.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, there are three ways that a stock slump can
turn into a prolonged recession. First, a decline in stock prices
can expose an underlying lack of good projects for businesses to
invest in. Second, falling prices of assets can undermine corporate
balance sheets, leaving companies unable to make investments no
matter how justified. Third, a financial slump can inspire perverse
government actions _ like raising interest rates to defend your
exchange rate even as the real economy implodes.
</P>
<P>
   On the first count: America is in the midst of a technological
revolution _ unlike Japan, which in 1990 was at the end, not the
beginning, of a productivity surge. And demography is on our side:
A steadily growing work force, thanks in part to immigration,
should help to sustain continuing high investment.
</P>
<P>
   On the second count, things could be much worse. There has been
some increase in corporate debt in recent years _ and some
individuals have, of course, gotten overextended. But we don't need
yet more dot-coms to keep the economy going, and by and large the
prospect that companies other than dot-coms will find themselves
unable to pursue profitable investment projects because they are
unable to raise the cash seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   On the final count: Sometimes it's good to be big. The United
States has a huge economy, which despite growing international
trade is not all that dependent on imports. So even if the new
nervousness on Wall Street drives down the value of the dollar _
certainly a possibility _- the Federal Reserve won't feel that it
has to raise interest rates to prop up our currency. Nor need we
fear, the way smaller Asian countries did in 1997-98, that we will
be crushed by the burden of foreign-currency debts: We do have
debts to foreigners, but relative to the size of our economy they
aren't that large _ and anyway (shhh! don't tell anyone) they're in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So the best bet has to be that our real economy will come
through this nervous period more or less unscathed; it's been ugly
in the markets, but it isn't the end of the world; Goldilocks is
still alive and well. And anyone who has been selling on the belief
that it is the end of the world ought to take a deep breath and
calm down.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rain will end from west to east across Long Island and southern
New England as low pressure accelerates out to sea south of Cape
Cod. Plenty of clouds will linger in the mild, moist air in the
wake of the low from the central Appalachians to the Middle
Atlantic Coast. Some sun will break through the clouds east of the
mountains in Virginia and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow band of snow and ice will occur from parts of the
eastern Dakotas to areas near Lake Superior. Moisture-laden air
will be lifted over a shallow cold air mass resulting in locally
heavy freezing rain and sleet in central Minnesota and northern
Wisconsin. Several inches of wet snow will accumulate farther
north. Meanwhile, a broken band of potent thunderstorms will erupt
in the warm air over the central Mississippi valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a swath of rain will reach central and northern
California. A few showers will dampen the Northwest. The Southwest
will stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ENDLESS SEASON
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, meteorologists monitoring the southwestern Pacific
issued an alert for the possible formation of a tropical cyclone
near Fiji. In the western Pacific, the season for tropical storms
never ends. The western tropical Pacific has the warmest ocean
water on earth, making it ideal breeding ground for tropical
storms. In the Atlantic, the cool waters of spring are inhospitable
to tropical storms. Indeed, April is the only month when no
tropical storm has been detected in the Atlantic.

IRS IS MORE LIKELY TO AUDIT POOR THAN RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, the poor were more likely than
the rich to have their tax returns audited, new Internal Revenue
Service data compiled by Syracuse University researchers show.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS audited 1.36 percent of all tax returns filed by people
making less than $25,000 last year, compared with 1.15 percent of
returns filed by those making $100,000 or more. Since 1988, audit
rates for the poor have increased by a third, from 1.03 percent,
while falling 90 percent for the wealthiest Americans, from 11.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The need to audit the highest-income taxpayers is somewhat less
today than in 1988, IRS officials say, because more of these people
are wage earners whose pay is fully reported by employers and
because Congress has eliminated some of the deductions most likely
to be abused.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no reason to reduce audits of corporations
and the self-employed, which fell to record low levels last year
because Congress did not authorize funds to keep up with the
increased number of such taxpayers. These taxpayers received less
scrutiny even though the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said in 1997 that they were more
likely than the working poor to pay less in taxes than they owed.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of IRS audits on the bottom of the income ladder
extended to businesses as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, unincorporated businesses with less than $25,000 in
sales, classified by the IRS as Schedule C enterprises, were more
likely to be audited than larger unincorporated businesses. The IRS
audited 2.7 percent of the tiny ventures, more than double the 1.3
percent rate for those with $25,000 to $100,000 in sales and more
than the 2.4 percent rate for those with over $100,000 in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The intensified focus on low-income taxpayers resulted from
pressure on the IRS beginning in 1995. Newt Gingrich, who was then
House speaker, and other Republican congressional leaders were
concerned about misuse of the earned income tax credit, a program
that allows the working poor, especially those with children, to
receive money from the government through a form of negative income
tax. They proposed to sharply reduce the credit, prompting
President Clinton to counter with a plan to bolster audits so that
fraud and mistakes would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS was also far less likely to take action last year
against those who did not pay their income taxes, the new data
show. Levies on paychecks and bank accounts were down 85 percent
from 1997, and liens to secure the government's interest were down
69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seizures of property to pay back taxes, the most severe
enforcement action, were down 98 percent, to 161, from about 10,000
annually in the previous 10 years. Auditors recommended $4.5
billion in taxes and penalties last year, down from $6.3 billion in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline in enforcement is because of shrinking staff
and complex new rules enacted by Congress in the IRS Restructuring
and Reform Act of 1998. Seizing property, for example, now requires
a 54-step process that more than two dozen revenue officers have
described as virtually impossible to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   And the permanent IRS staff is the same size now as in 1983,
even though the total number of tax returns has increased by
one-third and the number of complex returns by high-income
individuals has grown even more.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, one of every 66 corporations of all sizes was audited,
a level of scrutiny significantly lower than the one-in-37 audit
rate for Schedule C businesses with less than $25,000 of revenue.
Among the largest corporations, those with over $250 million of
assets, the audit rate was 34.5 percent last year, down from 54.6
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   These findings emerge from an exhaustive compilation of tax data
posted on the Internet on Sunday by the Syracuse researchers. The
data, covering IRS audit and enforcement actions through last Sept.
30, the end of the government's 1999 fiscal year, was provided to
the university's Transaction Records Access Clearinghouse by the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the commissioner of internal revenue, said
that overall audit rates had fallen so far that he feared the tax
system could not bear any more cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, asking a House subcommittee to support a 9 percent
increase in his budget, Rossotti said, ``We're really risking the
entire tax system'' by continually slashing audit rates.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rossotti said: ``I am not going to make the
claim that at this moment the system is threatened, because I don't
know at what point it is threatened by falling audit rates. But
longer term, the threat is there if a belief begins to develop
that, hey, I am paying my taxes but the guy next door or the
business across the street isn't, and the IRS is not, or cannot, do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said that the only reason audit rates for the working
poor had risen while the rates for wealthier taxpayers had declined
was a mandate from the White House and Congress for close
monitoring of the earned income credit.
</P>
<P>
   A couple without children can use the credit to eliminate all
income-tax liability and get back an additional $347, but working
parents can wipe out their liability and collect as much as $3,816
more. Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways and Means
Committee, said studies had shown that more than 20 percent of
returns claiming the credit had misused it.
</P>
<P>
   But John Karl Scholz, a University of Wisconsin economist who
studied the earned income credit in 1995 when he was a Clinton
administration tax policy adviser, said that while fraud was a
continuing problem, most of the issues uncovered in audits tended
to be disputes over who got the credit when a couple with children
had separated or divorced. Rossotti expressed the same view in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Scholz said, ``If you consider the amount of noncompliant
behavior uncovered for a dollar of IRS enforcement resources, the
amount of attention being given to the earned income tax credit is
much too large.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the special audits of the working poor and people who
fail to file a tax return, the audit rate for those making less
than $25,000 would fall from one in 74 to one in 300. For
businesses with sales under $25,000 the rate would fall from one in
37 to one in 588.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said, ``The issue of whether you are more likely to be
audited if you make less than $25,000 than if you make more than
$100,000 is totally distorted by the presence of the special earned
income tax credit program.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who heads the Senate Finance
Committee and who was the sponsor of the restructuring act, said he
was troubled by many of these statistics. ``The tax laws must be
applied with integrity and fairness,'' he said, adding, ``I am
hopeful that with adequate resources, better training, the
leadership of Charles Rossotti and continuous modernization of the
agency, the IRS will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the chief tax writer in the House, said he had found no
flaw in the IRS audit priorities, and he criticized the Syracuse
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire analysis is terribly misleading and cynical,''
Archer said in a statement. ``Ninety-seven percent of all the
so-called audits relating to the earned income credit are
correspondence audits, which is a relatively simple matter of
mailing additional information to the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the IRS is scrutinizing the earned income
credit with such wariness that it is sometimes denying the credit,
on nothing more than suspicion, to people who are legitimately owed
it, according to several low-income taxpayer clinics run by law
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Los Angeles, a tax court judge heard the case of
Maritza Reyes, a cleaning woman who earns $7,000 annually and who
was denied the credit after an audit. She had separated from her
husband, and each had taken one child and applied for the earned
income tax credit. The IRS rejected Reyes' application for the
credit but at trial produced no evidence to support its position
that she had not actually separated from her husband. A ruling is
expected in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Doti of the Chapman University law school in Orange,
Calif., who with Pallavi Shah, a law student, represented Reyes,
said that many low-income people audited by the IRS wound up in
worse straits than did Reyes. Few have access to low-income legal
clinics, and they give up when they are wrongly denied the credit.
Then their cases are added to the statistics on fraud and errors on
which Congress relied when it financed the increased audits of the
working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fraud in this program, but the handling of this case
is bizarre,'' Pallavi said, adding that the situation was not
unique. The IRS declined to comment on the Reyes case, as it does
in all cases involving individual taxpayers. ``Our policy is to
rely on the facts and the law in determining eligibility,'' said
Frank Keith, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   To identify tax cheating by high-income taxpayers and those with
complex returns, the IRS relies on face-to-face audits by highly
trained revenue agents. The number of such audits declined sharply
again last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the earliest year for which data is available, one in
63 tax returns received such an audit, but last year only one in
322 did, down from one in 217 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This decline partly reflects the shrunken IRS audit staff, which
has less time to examine complex returns.
</P>
<P>
   But a second factor, perhaps more significant, is also at work,
said David B. Burnham, who with Susan Long is co-director of the
Syracuse research organization. The IRS relies on data at least 11
years old to select returns for audits based on patterns of income
and deductions, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the economy, including companies offering more stock
options in lieu of cash compensation and taxpayers deducting
interest on home equity loans and margin debt, make much of this
data useless for identifying cheating.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995 Congress has barred the IRS from making new
studies to measure taxpayer compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse Web site at www.trac.syr.edu also lists data from
the Administrative Office of the U.S. courts showing that criminal
prosecutions for tax crimes, long a minor government activity,
continue to decline. Last year, there were just 722 such
prosecutions in the nation, half the figure in 1981, when there
were one-third fewer taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS data also showed an area of increased activity that may
foreshadow the government's ability to collect taxes in the years
ahead. The number of cases opened on people who have stopped filing
returns has soared. In 1997 the IRS initiated 822,898 taxpayer
delinquency investigations. Last year that number nearly doubled to
1.58 million.

(Eds: `The' before Gambia in quotes cq.) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARAFENNI, Gambia _ When Abdoulaye Sowe built his mud house
along a dirt road that links this country with Senegal a year ago,
he chose a spot a few hundred feet north of the Senegalese border
guard's straw shack.
</P>
<P>
   North of the shack lay Senegal; south of it, Gambia. So Sowe, a
Senegalese farmer new to the area, slept soundly in the belief that
his house was well inside Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Then some old-timers told him that the guard's shack was built
only a couple of years ago, and that before that the border guard
had sat for years on the roots of a large tree. Indeed, the tree _
standing several hundred feet north of the shack and Sowe's house _
was long regarded as the borderline.
</P>
<P>
   So overnight the farmer found himself, in mind if not in
reality, inside Gambia, a newcomer to the familiar no man's land of
an African border town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that I am both in Senegal and the Gambia,'' said Sowe
as he lay on the ground of his courtyard on a recent Friday
afternoon. ``But I am not sure. I have not made inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sowe the newcomer might not know is that more than in any
other corner of the world, borders in Africa are fluid and porous.
On the world's maps, Africa's borders remain the absurd legacy of
European colonialists who carved up the continent more than a
century ago without consulting any Africans.
</P>
<P>
   But African life on the ground often ignores the existence of
borders, responding to the far stronger forces of family,
ethnicity, commerce and language.
</P>
<P>
   All those things are shared by the Gambians and Senegalese. That
is not surprising, because Gambia is an enclave _ described
variously, and usually unflatteringly, as having the shape of a
worm or tongue _ inside Senegal. The British clung to this piece of
land in French West Africa in the never-realized hopes of
exploiting the Gambia River, considered one of the best navigable
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And so colonial map drawing reached an absurd extreme here:
Gambia is about 300 miles long, though only about 15 miles wide, a
good jog north to south if not for the lack of bridges on the
river, which flows east to west.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, though, were never that precise, as Sowe's sudden move
to Gambia showed. Did the border shift? Did the guard tire of
sitting on a tree root? Those questions and others would have been
put to the guard. But on the recent Friday the guard was not there.
Maybe he was off to afternoon prayers. Maybe there was other
pressing business.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. People came and went, Senegalese and Gambians alike,
mostly on donkey carts. Unlike the bigger crossing a few miles
west, this one had no sign at the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambians and Senegalese are from the same families,'' said Ali
Sallah, 40, a tailor who named his shop ``Senegambia'' because he,
like many people, leads businesses and lives in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever is from the Gambia has relatives in Senegal,'' he
said. ``And whoever is from Senegal has relatives here. Nobody can
divide us. So it's better to unite.''
</P>
<P>
   The obverse of the borderless life that Sallah and his family
lead has been political leaders' insistence on the inviolability of
Africa's colonial borders.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the artificiality of the borders has contributed to
wars and stunted economic growth _ in this instance, by leaving the
Gambia River unused _ politicians have held on to territories whose
geography nearly condemns them to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Africa remains sliced up into strangely shaped nations: some
jagged little ones like Gambia with a million people; others
mammoth places whose sparse populations are hemmed in by long
straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most Gambians offer a quick explanation as to why their
politicians resist the pull to unite with Senegal: They do not want
to share power. Most leaders, as Caesar admitted, would rather be
No. 1 in a small village in Gaul than No. 2 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are president, even of a small country like the Gambia,
you always have a group of people to dance for you and a red carpet
that will be unfolded in front of you,'' said Halifa Sallah, a
well-known sociologist who is also involved in politics in Gambia's
capital, Banjul.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Gambia and Senegal briefly formed a confederation,
called Senegambia. But political squabbling doomed the union.
Recently, after an independent member of the Gambian Parliament,
Hamat Bah, resurrected the idea, a newspaper cartoon depicted him
picking up a carcass with the old confederation's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are being short-sighted,'' Bah said in an
interview in his office in Banjul. ``Confederation is critical to
the long-term economic and political development of the Gambia and
Senegal. It would open up the River Gambia to get goods not only
through our two countries, but from all of West Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bah added, the river has ``narrowed down in many
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easily navigable as it used to be,'' he said,
``because not many big boats are passing through, and no one is
dredging it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Banjul, on the streets near the Gambia National Transport
Control Association, trucks destined for the Gambian interior _ as
well as Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Mauritania _ were
being loaded with goods. Twenty-eight such trucks leave Banjul
every day for various parts of Gambia, said Alieu Ngum, the
association's field coordinator. Scores leave every week for the
neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one uses the river now,'' Ngum said.
</P>
<P>
   Borders may harm Gambia's long-term growth. In the short term,
though, they benefit many people. Gambia's import duties are
considerably lower than those in the rest of the region. So the
trucks being loaded contain many goods that Gambia, serving as a
transit point, simply brings in and then ``re-exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the re-exporting is simple smuggling, sometimes done by
paying off a customs guard to avoid further duties. Whatever the
method, it is easier to do on land than on the river. Re-exporting
may add little to building up Gambia's economy, but it makes up a
third of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Farafenni, about 75 miles east of Banjul, thousands
arrived after the Trans-Gambian Highway was built four decades ago,
linking the northern and southern halves of Senegal, said Sambujang
Jagne, 64, this town's traditional chief. Nationality mattered
little. English was the official language on this side of the
border, French on the other side. But African languages bridged the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here, as elsewhere in Africa, colonial officers divided ethnic
groups and families when they drew boundaries. To the British, what
counted was the Gambia River, which promised access to the African
interior. The only problem was that the surrounding region was
under the control of the French.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to exploit the river fully, the British tried to sell the
territory to the French, or swap it for another. But the French,
having built railways to circumvent their lack of access to the
river, were not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Britain believed that an independent Gambia would not survive
and fully expected its former colony to form some sort of union
with Senegal. The Senegambia confederation was born after Gambia's
longtime prime minister, Dawda Jawara, was toppled in a coup while
attending the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1980.
After the Senegalese military placed him back in power, he agreed
to the confederation.
</P>
<P>
   But Senegambia _ which was supposed to integrate things like
security and foreign policy _ led nowhere and eventually died when
Senegal pulled its troops out of Banjul one morning without
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senegal wanted full political and economic integration,'' said
Halifa Sallah, the sociologist. ``But Gambia did not want that,
because it would have wiped out the economic advantage it has with
low import tariffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the formal dissolution of Senegambia in 1989, the two
countries have drifted further apart.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal, nearly 20 times the size of Gambia, has become a
democratic society, although with a violent separatist movement in
Casamance, a region isolated from the rest of Senegal, and left
underdeveloped and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Gambia, by contrast, has slipped into petty despotism since a
29-year-old army lieutenant, Yahya Jammeh, seized power in 1994.
Shunned by Western donors, Gambia turned to Libya and was the only
country to support Nigeria under the military dictator Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, with rumors of a possible coup circulating,
President Jammeh has seldom been seen in Banjul, spending most of
his time in Kanilai, his home village.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of Senegambia seems to fade with each day, surviving
only in places like the tailor shop here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved from Senegal to Farafenni, I knew I had relatives
here,'' said one of the tailors, Ibrahim Janneh, 25. ``But when I
arrived in Farafenni, I found there were more than I had expected.
I'm Senegambian.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The benefits of recharging groundwater with
recycled wastewater rather than sending it down rivers to the
Pacific Ocean have been known for decades, proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen water recycling projects are in place across the state,
according to the Water Reuse Association of California. But most of
them use the water for industrial or irrigation purposes, and not
human consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The Forebay Groundwater Recharge Project, opened in 1962 near
the Whittier Narrows Dam, is the region's oldest ``toilet-to-tap''
site. It recharges the central and west basins with 50,000
acre-feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   A second one has been operated in Orange County for about a
decade, which takes water from the Santa Ana River discharged by
communities upstream from Anaheim and spreads it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just clear to everybody in the water business that we
don't have a choice,'' said Tom Dawes, project manager for the
Orange County Water District, which is planning a 110,000-
acre-foot project that will serve 2.3million residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These projects can help stretch our resources,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Studies commissioned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation
District in the mid-1980s found no ill health effects to residents
using the Montebello water in the short term, according to David
Spath, chief of drinking water and environmental management for the
state Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of it was there weren't any health effects that
were obvious,'' Spath said. ``Recognizing that on the long-term
basis, it was very difficult to do an epidemiological study in that
type of environment in Southern California with the mobility and
everything else to really get a picture where you could say with
100 &UR;  &LR; percent surety that the results were unequivocal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are water reclamation projects in at least
four other states, according to the Water Reuse Association. Three
_ in St. Petersburg, Fla., Centreville, Va., and El Paso, Texas _
provide water for human consumption, with no health problems
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, water recycling proposals elsewhere in California have
been marginally successful at best.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of San Diego convinced the City Council to kill
funding for a ``toilet-to-tap'' project last year. And a project
introduced in 1995 in Irwindale came under fierce opposition from
residents as well as the Miller Brewing Co., which had a plant
downstream from the project.
</P>
<P>
   After an intense lobbying effort and much legal wrangling, the
project was scaled down and located downstream from the Miller
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Tennant, a former West Covina mayor and a physician with
a doctorate in public health, formed a citizens committee to fight
the project. Tennant said he opposed it not because of the idea of
reclaiming wastewater, but because of problems with specifics, such
as a shallow and contaminated groundwater table and inadequate
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a look at each project individually and see
whether the situation makes common sense,'' Tennant said. The East
Valley project's plan to filter the water more than 500 feet down,
and wait five years before withdrawing it ``sounds like a good
project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, rising costs for imported drinking water could drive
the demand for more projects that use recycled wastewater. Costs
have discouraged all but the largest projects, but the gap is
narrowing, making recycled wastewater more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Water District, for instance, charges agencies
in its six-county service area $431 for an acre-foot of drinking
water. The cost 10 years ago was $230 an acre-foot, MWD officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The East Valley project's cost is about $500 per acre-foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it in terms of the long-term price of water and
having to buy water in the future, it looks increasingly cost-
effective,'' said Frances Spivy-Weber of the Mono Lake Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better get used to it. This is a way to drought-proof the
economy.''

TOILET-TO-TAP PROJECT TO START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
and MICHAEL COIT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sewage water flushed by San Fernando Valley
residents will one day end up flowing from faucets throughout the
East Valley and much of Los Angeles as part of a new
``toilet-to-tap'' project that starts as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The concept seems repulsive at first glance _ and some Valley
leaders tried to make the point a decade ago _ but state health
officials insist the recycled water goes through a rigorous
five-year purification and monitoring process that makes it clean
and safe for drinking. It also is mixed with regular groundwater,
diluting the amount of recycled water coming out of the tap to less
than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The concept _ embraced by environmentalists and some communities
in Southern California _ was designed to reduce Los Angeles'
controversial dependence on water from the Mono Lake watershed.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials talked about the virtues of securing
the region's water supply for years to come and using recycled
water for lawns and industry. Drinking recycled water was mostly
discussed as a futuristic concept.
</P>
<P>
   But now that it is close to becoming a reality, residents of the
East Valley, where the treated water would be first introduced, are
unconvinced the ecological benefits outweigh the ``yuck factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is human waste,'' said Lori Dinkin, president of the
Valley Village Homeowners Association. ``I'm very uneasy about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for official assurances and studies that it is safe, Dinkin
said, ``They also said that about Love Canal. And they have said
all these lovely things about Agent Orange. I don't like to think
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the $55million East Valley Water Reclamation Project could
begin as soon as Monday, the water won't reach taps for at least
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Under a three-year pilot program, more than 10,000 acre-feet of
wastewater, or 3.2billion gallons, will be sent annually from the
Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Basin to
the Hansen Dam spreading grounds, 10 miles away in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The water seeps through the ground, which naturally filters it,
and eventually becomes part of the groundwater that is pumped from
wells, chlorinated, mixed with other water and piped to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   If the system of motors, pumps and pipes performs well and
monitoring wells confirm that groundwater quality is not affected,
the project could be expanded to 35,000 acre-feet _ 11.4 billion
gallons _ a year. That's enough to supply about 70,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the water system's current setup, recycled water could
be sent to homes in North Hollywood, Studio City, Van Nuys, Sherman
Oaks and Pacoima. It could also go to most of Los Angeles south of
the Santa Monica Mountains except Bel-Air, Pacific Palisades,
Brentwood and the Harbor Area.
</P>
<P>
   However, water officials note that they are planning a separate
project that would allow water drawn from East Valley wells to be
pumped up to the Los Angeles Reservoir, which means it could be
sent to any of the DWP's roughly 630,000 households throughout Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hailed the water recycling effort when they
announced state funding for the project in 1993. But the praise was
in the context of saving Mono Lake and using wastewater in
landscaping and industry. In announcing construction funding,
``toilet-to-tap'' was mentioned by Mayor Richard Riordan and former
Gov. Pete Wilson only as a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to use reclaimed water and to pump it to Forest
Lawn to water the grass,'' said Gerald A. Silver, president of
Homeowners of Encino. ``But it's another thing to take that water
and put it into the drinking system _ even with a five-year lag.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the project has been in the works for 10 years, there
has been little public involvement or awareness of the issue in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs' office was surprised to learn the project
was about to start. He plans to demand a public hearing on the
issue before the City Council's Environmental Quality Committee,
but the meeting would not affect the start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there have been permits and the authorities say it's
safe, when you start talking about drinking reclaimed water, there
needs to be a public airing on this,'' said Wachs' deputy, Tom
Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said they last heard of the project about five years ago
when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was trying to
get various permits from state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Public hearings were held during the planning process in the
early 1990s and in 1995. In addition, project manager Bill Van
Wagoner said notifications were sent to homeowners in the area near
Tillman and Hansen Dam affected by the pipeline construction, which
began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups believe the project will reduce dependence
on imported water and thus is less destructive to wildlife habitats
in Northern California and along the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   David Czamanske, chairman of the Los Angeles Sierra Club
chapter's water resources committee, noted that in some respects
all water has been recycled, whether by nature or by man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water that we drink every day has been around for millions
of years and circulated through who knows what _ dinosaurs, black
bears and panthers,'' Czamanske said. ``The water becomes purified
through natural processes or it can be purified through reclamation
processes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arguments touting the ecological benefit fell flat when San
Diego proposed a similar ``toilet-to-tap'' project in the
mid-1990s. But two Southern California cities are treating
wastewater for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oldest, in operation since 1962, is the Montebello
Forebay Groundwater Recharge Project, near the Whittier Narrows
Dam. Operated by the Water Replenishment District of Southern
California, it recharges the central and west basins with 50,000
acre-feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   A second one has been operated in Orange County for about a
decade, taking water from the Santa Ana River discharged by
communities upstream from Anaheim and spreading it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Neither project has experienced health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling wastewater will be increasingly critical in semiarid
Southern California, officials say, because California _ already
the nation's most populous state _ is expected to grow faster than
any other state, placing greater demand on supplies of drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Growth could be exacerbated by a prolonged period of
drier-than-normal weather _ perhaps 20 years _ expected by
meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've realized now is there's no magic bullet when it
comes to water supplies,'' said Thomas Erb, Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power water resources director.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a drought, we would tap our groundwater surpluses as much
as we could, but we hope to increase the groundwater supply for use
on an annual basis,'' Erb said. ``The East Valley project, ... if
we can reach our maximum capacity there, is going to be a valuable,
valuable project.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles historically has drawn much of its drinking water
from the Mono Lake basin through the city's aqueduct. Those
imported supplies are supplemented by Valley groundwater and
deliveries from the regional Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   A long legal fight that finally ended in the mid-1990s cut the
city's take from the lake basin. More water must be left to restore
streams and bring the lake back to levels set by the state Water
Resources Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles now draws about 65 percent of its drinking water
from the aqueduct, compared with 75 percent earlier. Groundwater
now accounts for more than 20 percent, and the Metropolitan Water
District provides nearly 15 percent of the city's drinking water,
Erb said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation since the drought of the early '90s has helped Los
Angeles reduce water use to levels comparable to 1970, despite the
addition of 1 million more residents.
</P>
<P>
   Savings have come from volume-based water rates that encourage
more efficient irrigation, ultra-low-flow toilet rebates and
giveaways, and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought ... basically was a wake-up call,'' said Hoover
Ng, senior engineer for a project that recharges Los Angeles
County's central and west groundwater basins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we build up our groundwater basins, we could have enough
water stored, like good depositors in a bank, when the next drought
hits.''

   ELIAN-CUBANS _ The legendary clout of Miami's exile community
has never been so obvious as during its spirited, unified standoff
against the U.S. government and Janet Reno, a former Miami hero. Is
this the last hurrah of the exile community as a political force or
the beginning of something even more powerful? The buzz has been
that since the death of long-time power broker Jorge Mas Canosa and
the arrival of more moderate rivals to his Cuban-American National
Foundation, the community clout had begun to wane. The Clinton
administration has managed to play the different groups off against
each other more than once. But now even the naysayers are taking
notice of what a motivated exile community can do when truly
aroused. Elian has united this often never-quite-so-monolithic
community as never before. And so far, they've managed to thumb
their nose successfully at the full might of the federal
government. Whither the storied Miami exile enclave? (Douthat, Palm

   ESSAYIST-PROFILE _ YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. _ For 20 years, Steve
Harvey, a professor at Young Harris College in North Georgia, wrote
poems before finding his real voice in the personal essay. In two
collections, ``A Geometry of Lilies: Life and Death in an American
Family'' and ``Lost in Translation,'' he writes with fluent ease
about love and marriage, about change and loss. His tone is by
turns winsome and reflective. ``People ask me what my books are
about,'' he says. ``It's very hard to say.'' He will write of his
kids ganging up on him (``I marvel at the transparent guile of
their planning huddles, the determined looks as they gather courage
for the synchronized assault, their reckless confidence as they
throw their bodies at their father.'') or of discovering he is
perfectly happy living without a television (``Our mind connects
the dots, lending depth and perspective, and ultimately, meaning to
the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube. And yet, the experience
sedates us, engaging just enough of our senses to lull us into a
stupor.''). He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind
always seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what
might be called the universal. (Skube, Atlanta

U.S. STANDS ALONE IN EFFORT TO ISOLATE BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Despite the indictment of President
Slobodan Milosevic on war crimes charges and the efforts of
Washington to isolate his regime, the Western diplomatic quarantine
of Yugoslavia has broken down, with every major European country
represented here by senior diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States has no diplomats here and has no plans to
send any as long as Milosevic remains in power, even though it
continues to retain a local staff of about 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   Most NATO countries withdrew their diplomats during the war, but
have slowly seen the need for some representation in Belgrade,
generally regarding Yugoslavia as too important to ignore. But
sending new ambassadors is awkward because convention requires a
meeting with the head of state, who in this case has been indicted
for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On the French Embassy here, there is a sign that says, ``Embassy
of Switzerland, French interest section.'' But the embassy
functions with some three diplomats, who issue visas and provide
consular services but also behave like diplomats. Similarly, the
British, with a senior diplomat who had already served four years
here, are formally represented by Brazil, the Germans by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And both France and Germany have issued limited visas for
European parliamentary meetings to Yugoslav officials like the
former Socialist Party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, who are on the
European and American lists of people banned from traveling to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Europeans want to distinguish between the
isolation of the government and Serbian people, who still regard
themselves as Western-oriented. The tension between the Clinton
administration and the European Union over the efficiency of
sanctions and how to bring down Milosevic surfaces regularly, with
many Europeans believing that opening up trade, contacts and travel
with Serbia will bring down Milosevic much faster than isolation,
which the regime manipulates in its propaganda of a brave Serbia
surrounded by enemies.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, for example, the Europeans went ahead with oil and
energy aid for Serbian cities controlled by the opposition against
strong initial U.S. objections, and the Europeans also forced
through the lifting of a ban on air travel to and from Belgrade _
one of the main requests of the democratic opposition here.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Australia rebuffed sharp U.S. complaints and
sent a new ambassador to Belgrade who presented his credentials to
Milosevic on Thursday, together with the new Russian ambassador, in
a ceremony covered lavishly in the state news media here.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and many European capitals are trying to avoid giving
Milosevic that kind of propaganda opportunity, which would let him
show that the world is coming to terms with his survival in power.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said that
Canberra had refused a direct American request, reportedly from
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to drop the appointment, or
at least to skip the meeting with Milosevic and fax the new
ambassador's credentials instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry has insisted that countries
abide by the Vienna conventions governing diplomacy and present
credentials to the head of state. The Americans ``asked us if we
would fax the credentials,'' Downer said. ``The Yugoslav
authorities made it clear they wouldn't accept faxed credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks and Italians, NATO members with traditionally close
historical and business ties to the Serbs, kept embassies open here
during the bombing, as did Canada. The Italians also want to send a
new ambassador here, but are trying to negotiate a way to avoid a
meeting with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But they are expected to have no more success than the
Australians did, which will force them to either meet Milosevic or
downgrade their official representation here to a charge d'affaires
or deputy chief of mission ad interim, appointments that do not
require the presentation of credentials to the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here said they had hoped that the strange tale of the
Portuguese ambassador, Antonio Tanger de Correa, would create a
model. Portugal currently holds the presidency of the European
Union, its six-month term ending in June, and Lisbon had requested
that Belgrade approve Tanger de Correa's appointment before the war
and Milosevic's indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, given de Correa's European role, Belgrade agreed to
accept his credentials at the level of the first deputy foreign
minister. But the government does not invite Tanger de Correa to
receptions or official meetings because his credentials have not
been presented to the head of state, inviting the Portuguese deputy
chief of mission instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought there would be a `Portuguese model,''' one
diplomat said. ``But we were wrong. The Portuguese ambassador is
really treated like a nonentity here, not really like a diplomat at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav diplomat said: ``We are a real country and not some
African colony,'' stressing that diplomatic conventions require
ambassadorial appointments to be accepted by heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Other governments have avoided the problem by not rotating
ambassadors or by bringing in lower-ranking diplomats, effectively
downgrading relations. This is what Washington did even before the
NATO bombing war, with the embassy here headed by a senior
diplomat, Richard Miles, who had been an ambassador in other
countries but had a deputy rank here. Miles is an ambassador again,
now in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic, which is applying to the European Union, has
kept its ambassador here, Ivan Busniak, for about four years. But
Prague is unsure if it will rotate him. If he leaves, Prague _
mindful of its Western orientation _ has decided to replace him
with a deputy chief of mission ad interim ``and wait for better
times,'' the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sharply denied a story in last week's
Sunday Times of London that it would send a low-level diplomat here
by June. The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said: ``There
is no consideration whatsoever about returning a diplomat to
Belgrade.'' But he said that discussions continued through third
parties, including the Swiss, about appointing ``protecting
powers'' in each other's country to take care of consular problems,
property questions and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But even those discussions are frozen, officials of both
countries say. The Americans objected to Belgrade's request that
China act for it in Washington, so Belgrade objected to the
American request for first Sweden and then Switzerland. Washington
wants Belgrade to pick a country that is traditionally neutral;
Belgrade says it can pick whatever country it wants, and it has
also asked for the keys to its embassy in Washington, which the
Americans sealed during the war.

<HEADLINE>
IN THE STOCK MARKET, A SENSE THAT THE GAME HAS CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sweltering second-floor office of a midtown
Manhattan branch of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a discount brokerage, Sean M.
Mullin, a 23-year-old broker, tugged at his tie as he explained how
he had spent much of Friday afternoon. As the market plummeted,
Mullin was making ``margin calls'' on investors who had bought
losing stocks with borrowed money. Those investors now had to put
up more cash as collateral or sell their shares to pay off their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said he disliked making margin calls, although he had no
choice. ``You get people on the phone, and they're just upset,'' he
said. ``They'll call you and say, `How much do I owe?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own portfolio, ``I'm holding tough,'' Mullin said.
``It's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain was everywhere Friday as the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell almost 10 percent, capping its worst week
ever, and the Dow Jones industrial average was off more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other market declines over the past decade, investors have
been quick to follow experts' exhortations to buy on dips. That
buying has driven U.S. stocks, especially technology stocks, to
unprecedented levels.
</P>
<P>
   It may happen again when the market opens on Monday. But as
investors reviewed the damage wrought last week, their uncertainty
about the market's near-term prospects was palpable. And few of
them sounded eager to step up and buy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of shock among many investors on Friday, a
suggestion that the game had run its course, at least for a little
while.
</P>
<P>
   The selling, the crescendo of a week when the Nasdaq fell 25
percent and U.S. stocks lost $2 trillion in value, did not reflect
panic. It was worse, a steady and relentless decline that showed
few signs of letting up as the 4:00 p.m. bell finally rang to end
the action, closing a one-sided bout that finished several rounds
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual investors, panicked sellers were hard to find,
except for people who had to pay taxes or who faced margin calls.
Figures from Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in
Connecticut, confirmed the anecdotal evidence, showing that big
institutions, not individuals, accounted for most of Friday's
selling.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seemed to be bargain hunting either. The aggressive
buyers who drove technology stocks up to all-time highs last month
seem to be out of fresh cash, and more conservative investors still
think the highfliers are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic was clear Friday afternoon at Quick &AMP; Reilly. There,
clusters of investors were talking to brokers, making trades and
checking the stock prices displayed on computer monitors. Above
them, a muted television played CNBC, the business news cable
channel, as a series of pundits talked and the Dow skidded south.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a desk at the front of the branch, Dmitri Jones, a
Quick &AMP; Reilly consultant, said he did not expect the sell-off to
end soon. Despite sharp declines, technology stocks are still
overvalued, and many conservative investors will not be interested
in buying them until they fall much lower, he said. ``A lot of
people are waiting on the sidelines,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are too badly bruised to step up right now, he said.
``You look at people's accounts,'' he said. ``It's straight
carnage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he had bought 200 shares of Microsoft on Tuesday. ``I
thought I was getting a bargain,'' he said ruefully. Since then,
shares in the software company have plunged, costing Jones more
than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than I make,'' he said. ``I'm just looking at my
future getting smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinod Malhotra, another investor, said, ``It's very bad,'' as he
worriedly checked the ever-changing prices displayed on the
computer screens near the branch's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra said he owned shares in several of the Internet and
technology highfliers that have been hardest hit in the last month,
including Internet Capital Group, down from $147 on March 6 to
$52.0625 at Friday's close, and Exodus Communications, which has
fallen from $179.625 on March 23 to $85.5625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it has been a very expensive couple of weeks,
Malhotra said. He has accounts at several brokerage firms, and he
said his largest portfolio, at Prudential, had fallen from $1.8
million to under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malhotra has no plans to sell. ``I have no choice,'' he
said. ``I have to hold on until they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A few investors started unloading stocks before last week.
Norman Nouskajian, a San Diego lawyer, said the irrational behavior
of other investors drove him to sell most of his stocks six weeks
ago. ``When I saw some of my clients who were in businesses having
nothing to do with finance divert their time and money into the
market, to me that pointed to a type of excess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of keeping half of his assets in the stock market, as he
usually does, Nouskajian said he cut back to 20 percent. His
remaining stocks have lost half their value, erasing about 10
percent of his net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in no particular hurry to get back into the market.
``Next week, I might nibble a little,'' he said. ``I feel sorry for
people who have taken a lot of money and thrown it at the
overpriced tech stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald F. Zele, a retired auditor who lives in Farmington,
Conn., told a similar story. Zele said he had called his
stepdaughter on Tuesday and told her to sell her mutual funds, and
had then sold all of his own stocks and funds. ``Today's debacle
proved me right,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zele wants to get back in. But not yet. ``People are
panicking and getting out at all costs,'' he said. ``This thing
could get a lot uglier. I can't wait to get back in, but right now
I am not going to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The nervousness is hardly confined to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kim S. Fennebresque, president and chief executive officer of SG
Cowen, an investment bank that specializes in underwriting stock
issues for the health care and technology companies that have been
hardest hit over the last month, held a conference call Friday to
reassure his employees that Cowen's future remained bright. But
afterward, Fennebresque confessed that he was less sanguine about
the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who buy too soon may ``catch a falling knife,''
Fennebresque said. ``One cannot help but be a little sober about
the playing field in which we find ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fennebresque said he worried about a ``poverty effect'' as
investors who have lost money cut back on purchases. It is probably
too early for that, especially since both the Dow and Nasdaq are
still higher than they were even six months ago. Several real
estate brokers and travel agents who cater to wealthy clients said
that as of Friday, they had not lost any business.
</P>
<P>
   But the plunge seems to have hurt sales of at least one luxury
item. At the Wall Street Humidor, a cigar shop in lower Manhattan
that caters to wealthy traders and investment bankers, the owner,
Richard Hu, said business had been terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an absolute disaster,'' Hu said. ``The last thing they
want is a cigar. A cigar will kill them too slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, longtime bears like Seymour Rosen, 65, a cabinetmaker
from Monroe Township, N.J., remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said he had been warning for more than a year that the
runup in technology stocks was ``smoke and mirrors.'' He got really
worried when a waitress at the Prestige Diner in East Windsor,
N.J., boasted about her purchase of shares in ViroPharma, a
drugmaker that has lost more than 85 percent of its value in the
last month. ``I said you haven't made a nickel until you sell it,''
he recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to jump in and make a million dollars,'' Rosen
said. Now all he wants to do is jump out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does bounce back, I want to get out,'' he said, adding
that he would settle now for bonds that guarantee him a return of 6
percent a year. If the market continues to decline, he said, he
might sell anyway. ``It's better to lose some than to lose it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was displeased with Friday's action.
Short-sellers, who make money when stocks decline, said the
sell-off confirmed their warnings that many technology companies
were badly overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by most measures, technology stocks have been in a
bubble for years, with many priced at 100, 200 or even 300 times
their annual earnings. In less heady times, most stocks sport
price-earnings ratios of 30 or less, although technology bulls note
that many technology companies are growing at very fast rates.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's plunge was needed to wring excesses out of stock
prices, said Marc Cohodes, general partner of Rocker Partners,
which manages $600 million. Cohodes is a short-seller, a bearish
investor who borrows what he believes are overpriced shares and
then sells them, betting that their prices will decline and he will
be able to buy them back later for a lower price. ``Today was a day
I would like to see repeated a few more times,'' Cohodes said. ``I
think what this is, it's the start of a change that's going to
happen in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohodes said that change would be healthy for both Wall Street
and the economy as a whole, by keeping capital out of the hands of
money-losing dot-com businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who burn cash and have no business model _ that game is
over,'' he said.

 &HT;    Hall of Fame pays tribute to swimmers
 &HT;    who were poetry in motion
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The Summer Olympics are several months
and half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Why wait for televised excitement in Sydney when you can visit
the International Swimming Hall of Fame right now?
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame complex has two Olympic-size pools and several
diving boards that are open to the public daily during certain
hours.
</P>
<P>
   And the pools are fast _ eight world records have been set at
the complex, two in one day in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, the Hall of Fame has aquatic memorabilia galore. An
original Olympic flag. The starting block that Mark Spitz used in
Munich. Swimsuits and warm-up jackets of former swimming stars.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it's home to three former Olympians _ in wax, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE KAHANAMOKU
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hawaiian won Olympic medals in 1912, 1920, 1924 and
1932. Because he helped introduce the rest of the world to surfing.
Because he descended from Hawaiian royalty, but was known for his
humble nature and easy charm. Because he appeared in 30 Hollywood
movies, served as sheriff of Honolulu for 26 years, and in between
worked for two years as a gas station operator. Because, when asked
who taught him the crawl, he said, ``No one.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHNNY WEISSMULLER
</P>
<P>
   Because he went from spindly boy to strapping young man after
taking up swimming. Because he won five gold medals at the 1924 and
'28 Olympics, and broke the world record in the
</P>
<P>
   100-yard freestyle five times in five years. Because he cut a
fine figure in a loincloth and simply was Tarzan to Jane, Boy,
Cheetah and generations of moviegoers. Because after 12 Tarzan
films, he became Jungle Jim for 16 more movies.
</P>
<P>
   MARK SPITZ
</P>
<P>
   Because he's the original Olympic golden child, winner of seven
gold medals in seven events at the '72 Games (to add to his two
golds, silver and bronze from Mexico City four years earlier).
Because his wax replica proudly wears his Olympic parade uniform,
which is so quintessentially early '70s. Because he attempted a
comeback, at the age of 40, by trying out for the 1992 Olympic
team. Because we love his 'stache as much as his smile.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They may never have set foot in New York, may have
little use for big-city notions and may harbor only a vague idea of
which vowel goes where in the last name of the Republican who wants
to be the state's next U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the people who have been showering Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's campaign with donations from far-flung ZIP codes, just
one fact matters: His opponent is Hillary Rodham Clinton. And she
must _ must! _ be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a brash, pushy woman,'' said Jocelyn Wallace of
Scottsdale, Ariz., one of thousands of out-of-state Republicans who
seem to have seethed their way through the long years of the
Clinton administration and are now looking for some payback. She
gave $250 to the Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In shattering the fund-raising record for a Senate candidate,
Giuliani appears to have tapped a vein of deep loathing for Hillary
Clinton, often more than for her husband, among people outside the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Several retirees in Florida, a construction executive in North
Carolina who is a regular visitor to the HillaryNo.com Web site, a
woman in Maine still bothered by the first lady's role in the
administration's failed health care plan _ all were lured into New
York politics by the prospect of a Senator Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who said she doubted that she would have contributed
had Giuliani run against a home-grown Democrat, was among more than
20 out-of-state Giuliani donors selected at random from the
campaign's disclosure records and interviewed by telephone last
week. Her criticisms of Clinton were actually tamer than most.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical response came from William Orthwein of St. Louis,
who said Clinton was ``out-of-this-world power hungry.'' What did
he think of the mayor? ``Not much,'' snapped Orthwein, a retired
McDonnell Douglas executive who donated $250 three times to the
campaign. ``I hope he beats her. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $19 million that Giuliani has already collected with
seven months to go before the election, roughly half of it is from
out of state. By contrast, when another nonincumbent, Charles
Schumer, then a Brooklyn congressman, defeated Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
of New York in 1998, Schumer raised a total of $17 million for the
entire campaign, only 25 percent of which originated out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with $12 million so far, has also done well with
out-of-state donors. But the mayor's startling success has prompted
her to assert that he is filling his coffers by embracing the far
right.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the archconservative senator from North Carolina,
Clinton said earlier this year that Giuliani ``learned from people
like Jesse Helms that you run some of these campaigns, these
negative campaigns, out of state so that you can go around saying
you're not doing it in-state and hope that nobody will catch you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the pattern,'' she said, ``and it's been a
pretty tried-and-true technique of the right-wing Republicans for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has responded by ridiculing Clinton, saying that she
attributes everything to a ``right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, some donors certainly voiced views more
conservative than those of the mayor, who supports abortion rights
and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware of that,'' said one, Hiram Groover, a retiree
from Mesa, Ariz., when informed of Giuliani's stance on social
issues. ``But what do you think about Hillary Clinton? What do you
think she stands for? She sure isn't pro-life. She'd probably do
anything to get a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these people would probably have sent money to the
Giuliani campaign without being asked. But the campaign, aided by a
prominent conservative Washington-based fund-raiser, Richard
Viguerie, has barraged the mailboxes of Republicans across the
nation with solicitations. The letters often describe Clinton as
the ``leader of the ultra left-wing Democrats,'' contending that if
she wins the Senate race, she will then run for president.
</P>
<P>
   The pitches work. Groover's only donation to any candidate on
the federal level since 1980 was the $250 he sent to the Giuliani
campaign, according to campaign records.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several donors characterized themselves as centrist
Republicans who favored abortion rights, though their moderation
did not extend to their feelings toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that I have a greater dislike for her''
than for President Clinton, said Fenton Hord, who said he backed
abortion rights. ``When I hear her speak, it's almost as if I hear
her speaking down to me _ as if she clearly has in her own mind the
answers to everything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hord, an executive of a building-materials company in Raleigh,
N.C., displays a banner on his computer screen _ ``Eight Years Is
Enough'' _ that he got from the HillaryNo.com site, which is run by
the Giuliani campaign. Hord has given two $250 donations to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain what exactly about Clinton is so troubling,
some donors cited her role in Whitewater and other inquiries during
the Clinton administration. Others said she was haughty, and
presumptuous in moving to New York to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that New York would be better served by someone from
New York,'' said Julia Moss of Yarmouth, Maine, who donated $2,000.
Moss later added that she was ``turned off by the fact that she was
going to be in a policy-making situation with health care, because
we didn't elect her.''
</P>
<P>
   A sizable percentage of the donors from out of state are
retirees, the Giuliani campaign says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a carpetbagger, pure and simple,'' said one retiree,
Grant Bakewell of Palm Desert, Calif., who donated $500. ``She is a
devious, self-promoting, selfish woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Others referred to her in almost apocalyptic terms. ``I will
tell you that she has been a very miserable kind of person,'' said
another retiree who gave $500, John Daly of Vero Beach, Fla.
``Everything that she has ever put her hand in has been a failure.
She was a communist and also a member of the KGB, or close to it.
She is a person who is very, very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign has amassed a list of more than 200,000
donors, which bodes well for its future fund raising because past
donors tend to give again. The campaign is receiving about 75
percent of its donations from direct mail _ an achievement,
considering that most candidates find they must personally solicit
most of their money, either on the phone or through fund-raising
events.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there is less pressure on Giuliani to attend
fund-raisers, which may be fortunate for the mayor, who sometimes
appears reluctant to leave the city to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national reputation has obviously also helped her fund
raising, and she has collected roughly 55 percent of her $12
million from people outside New York. But while Giuliani tends to
arouse strong passions in New York City, he is not nearly as well
known nationally, so he cannot be turned into the same kind of
direct-mail fund-raising vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That said, some of the Giuliani donors did praise his record in
New York, saying that they had visited the city and had been
impressed with the changes during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what Giuliani has done in New York,'' said Cary
Maguire, an oil-company executive in Dallas who donated $1,000 at a
fund-raising event there which was attended by Giuliani. ``I'm not
going to say anything negative about her. I just thought he was the
better candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hord, the North Carolina executive, said he admired Giuliani's
``straightforwardness and tenacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he had never before contributed to a New York
candidate. So why did he really donate? ``I just don't want any
more of my dinners being ruined by listening to her or her
husband,'' he said.

 &HT;    A relentless serving of Chicken Soup for the masses
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Admit you got a little sloppy over the
story with the puppy. Admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Admit you drove home through Los Angeles-style traffic after a
hideous Monday, watched mass graves and hurricanes on the news,
heard Allen Greenspan intone doom, picked the kids up from soccer,
skipped aerobics and PTA, swigged some Pepto-Bismol and locked
yourself in the bathroom with the book your mom gave you for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Admit you saw that limping puppy with no hip socket and the
little boy with the leg brace pulling $2.37 out of his pocket, and
you got a little misty. You can admit you laughed at yourself, but
you also wanted to shout, ``That puppy is just as good as everyone
else! So is the little boy!'' You wanted to hug them both and
scribble out a check to pay the pet store owner the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, admit it.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be the only one, you know, and that's OK. That's good.
That's what we call chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be chicken soup was presented in a ceramic bowl, laced
with noodles and vitamins, to the kid home sick from school.
Comfort food, we called it, easy to swallow, like Ben and Jerry's
except healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a phenomenon, therapy in 101 stories to open the heart
and rekindle the spirit. It's ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' and
readers of 50 million books in print in 33 languages are lapping it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Readers have spoken: Feed us.
</P>
<P>
   Give us what Oprah doesn't. Give us a commercial break, stories
where the plot doesn't hinge on infidelity or addiction or neglect
or kidnapped children. Don't make us slog through 300 pages before
we get to a possibly unsatisfying resolution. Make us feel good.
</P>
<P>
   Make us feel good now, while the microwave is zapping the Jiffy
Pop, when we have 10 spare minutes before setting the alarm for
5:30 a.m. and turning off the light.
</P>
<P>
   Feed us something lite _ like lite ice cream, Milky Way Lite.
Something that won't eventually make us feel guilty and stand
tip-toe staring over our shoulder into the bathroom mirror,
grimacing at the reflection of our butt.
</P>
<P>
   Give us a catalyst to cry and purge the pollution of life in
2000, and give it to us in eight pages or less. Give us Muzak in
true short stories. Not the kind that makes us shriek at the
customer service representative after we've been on hold for 11
minutes. Nice Muzak. Our favorite Enya song after a nap Muzak. We
want stories about goodness and surviving and triumph. And puppies.
We want puppies.
</P>
<P>
   Feed us chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   These books are popular in Iowa. They sell very, very well in
Iowa. And Wyoming. Perpetual best-sellers up there. And our very
own Colorado, and Arkansas, and Idaho, and Utah. They sell very
well in what coastal types condescendingly call the fly-over zone.
</P>
<P>
   Where they don't sell well is New York City and Los Angeles and
Miami. Places where black isn't so much a clothing color as a
lifestyle decision, where the espressos are double, the waiters are
really actors, the answering of cell phones a life-or-death
quick-draw.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about sophistication and cosmopolitanism in those
places, where everything's a statement and an accessory, including
books. In those places, books had better include frustrated
artists, suburban malaise, existential angst and questions about
sexual identity, and possibly a mime. If there's chicken soup
involved anywhere, it had better be free-range chicken and it
better be served at some dumpy little cafe that nobody knows about,
where all the patrons are 27 and working on their novels and are
there for some esoteric irony trip.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, stories about a limping puppy? A dying boy who wants
to be a fireman? How jejune. How provincial. Oh, you know, darling,
how common. We'll discuss it over creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Canfield, during a telephone interview, on people who
criticize the ``Chicken Soup'' books: ``We're not great literature.
We do as much editing as we can, but I don't claim to be a great
writer. I do claim to recognize a good story, and I do think we've
been able to see how to tell a good story. We're not out there
trying to deal with the forces of evil in a teleological,
theological level. We're saying, 'Look, here's this person who went
through this.' Just so people can be reminded that life is good,
it's a good feeling to be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the one who started all this, way back in the late 1960s
when he taught at an inner-city Chicago high school where most of
his students were black. He said he noticed the kids weren't
applying themselves. For a guy who grew up in white suburbia with
all kinds of straight-A, sports hero, editor of the yearbook and
onward to college expectations, that was a new _ and bad _ concept.
</P>
<P>
   So he started clipping stories out of Parade, Reader's Digest,
Guidepost, People, stories about black history, members of the
black community who were overcoming obstacles and achieving goals.
That was the beginning of it. Other teachers asked him to teach
them how to inspire their kids like he was inspiring his. His
secret for success was: stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize stories really are the vehicle for the
highest teachings,'' he said. ``Christ taught in parables, Buddha
told stories. What do we do every night? We watch TV. And what's on
TV? Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was doing teacher inservices to tell them stories about
telling stories. Then he was teaching seminars and doing public
speaking. During his presentations he told some of the stories he'd
clipped and collected for years. Often people approached him
afterward and asked him in what books they could find certain
stories he'd shared.
</P>
<P>
   Blink went the light bulb over his head. This was the early
1990s, remember, and books of short stories just didn't sell well,
especially nonfiction stories. But with his friend Mark Victor
Hansen, Canfield began compiling the uplifting stories they both
had collected for more than 20 years into one book of 101 stories
``to open the heart and rekindle the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   As Canfield explains it on his Web site, the title came about
like this: ``When we were almost finished with the book, we still
didn't have a title. Mark and I decided to meditate and pray for an
answer. I use a receptive meditation process in which I ask God to
give me an answer to my question, and then I sit in silence and
wait to see an answer on a blank screen in my mind or to hear the
answer. I did that every day for a week. On the third day, I saw
the words Chicken Soup written on the screen. ... I began to
reflect on its meaning, I remembered that when I was a child my
mother always made chicken soup when we were sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to think that although our bodies weren't that sick,
America's spirit was sick. There was so much hopelessness,
resignation, cynicism and despair in America. So, I figured, we
needed chicken soup for our spirits. By the end of the week it had
evolved into 'Chicken Soup for the Soul.' Everyone we told the
title to got goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   The publishers in New York City didn't get goose bumps. They got
the glassy-eyed and vaguely bored look that precedes a rejection.
Canfield and Hansen got it 33 times, ``this doesn't meet our needs
at this time'' or ``this is great, but ...'' or just plain ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Canfield and Hansen went to the American Booksellers
Association convention in Anaheim, Calif., and tried peddling their
101 stories to booksellers who smirked bemusedly at the nice
stories. At least the people from Health Communications Inc.,
agreed to take the book back to Florida and read it. The company
mainly publishes self-help and inspirational books, and had their
first big seller in 1983 with ``Adult Children of Alcoholics.'' A
week later the small company's owner called Canfield and said he
loved the book and wanted to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   To say that readers like these books is to say, ``John Grisham.
Is he the one who writes those nice stories about lawyers?'' People
love these books. They LOVE them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicken Soup'' tsunami started with word-of-mouth
advertising when the original ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' was
published in 1993, said Larry Getlin, public relations specialist
for Health Communications Inc. Things didn't pick up until two
years later, when word-of-mouth had mushroomed into an
international bellow. The stories struck a collective cord,
Canfield said, a need for simple reassurances of goodness in a
world where 6-year-olds have guns.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon there was ``A Second Helping of Chicken Soup for the
Soul,'' then a third serving, a fourth course, a fifth portion, a
sixth bowl. Each time it was 101 stories to open the heart and
rekindle the spirit. People wrote to Canfield and Hansen asking for
certain sorts of stories, stories about coping with the loss of a
loved one, stories about living well with physical handicaps,
stories about being a good mother when life goes crazy.
</P>
<P>
   The books began specializing, branching out. Now there is
chicken soup for women, teen-agers, pet lovers, mothers, golfers,
couples, Christians, Christian families, survivors, little souls,
golden souls, country souls. When the third volume of ``Chicken
Soup for the Teenage Soul'' is published April 25, there will be 30
``Chicken Soup'' books in print, more than 50 million copies in 33
languages _ ``Sopa de Pollo para el Alma.''
</P>
<P>
   In the works are chicken soup for so many kinds of souls:
laughing, golfing, Jewish, single, man, college, divorced,
grieving, writer, parent, global, unstoppable, entrepreneur,
doctor, emergency worker, nurse, Canadian, prisoner, expectant
mother, rock `n' roll, sports fan, adopted, traveler, Celt and
physically challenged. There will be low-fat chicken soup with
stories about weight loss. There will be chicken soup for the
Greek, Pakistani, Indian, South African soul.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``Chicken Soup'' calendars, ``Chicken Soup'' CDs with
uplifting songs, ``Chicken Soup'' magnets and mugs and games.
Companies that make products that relate to the spirit of ``Chicken
Soup'' approach the company that handles ``Chicken Soup'' marketing
and ask to be associated with the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is simple: Make a difference in the world, possibly do
something toward world peace and sell a billion books by 2020.
That's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a goal that seemingly was impossible, that would
force us to think in a way that we wouldn't think if we were just
writing books and sending them to publishers and going on book
tours,'' Canfield said. ``To reach a billion people you're reaching
one-sixth of the world's population.''
</P>
<P>
   They're having to think outside the bowl, as it were. Right now
about 80 percent to 85 percent of ``Chicken Soup'' readers are
women, so they're reaching out to men through just plain stories
that men can relate to, and through specialty books dealing with
professions.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of professions, did you know the woman who wrote
``Romancing the Stone'' flunked her first creative writing class?
That story will be in ``Chicken Soup for the Writer's Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicken Soup'' people are thinking globally, with stories
for people from different countries, stories about the tolerant
soul (about a person's transformation from being bigoted to being
tolerant), the global soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's forced us to get out of our American mentality,'' he
said. ``Stories for the global soul will show that a mother in
Pakistan is no different than a mother in Texas. They all want the
same things for their children. It'll show the universal human
desires to have our relationships work, to be respected, to
overcome obstacles. That transcends any cultural differences that
we seemingly go to war over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul'' will not be sold in
bookstores, but will be given free to 1.3 million of America's
prisoners. And a portion of the proceeds from every book is donated
to different charities. Like Canfield said, it's about making the
world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   Give peace a chance. Have some chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   Each new ``Chicken Soup'' that's released spikes up the New York
Times nonfiction best-seller list and literary purists cringe.
Critics sniff that the books pander to the very lowest in appetites
for the printed word. They might as well be comic books, critics
huff. They're too easy (though Canfield points out the stories
never preach at the end or moralize, so readers can draw personal
meaning from the stories). They're maudlin. They're sugary enough
to induce diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   True, all of it true. In these books there's always some little
boy named Tommy or Billy or Timmy who gets a disease and dies or
gets lost in the grocery store. There are injured athletes who give
it the old college try and throw the winning pass with a broken
arm. There are wise old next door neighbors who Teach Us Something
About Life.
</P>
<P>
   There are easy-to-swallow vignettes that make us feel good, as
opposed to Oprah's pick most months in which a child drowns in a
swimming pool and everybody falls apart. ``Chicken Soup'' stories,
even the ones on death and dying, ultimately are about redemption.
Who says life's literary lessons have to be shrouded in symbolism
and metaphor? Why can't they be short and sweet?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicken Soup'' message is: They can.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``Chicken Soup'' message is: Just because a puppy is
born without a hip socket doesn't mean it's not as good as the rest

 &HT;    Chicken Soup for the Chicken Soul
 &HT;    By ``Chicken Little''
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It was a beautiful summer day, one I'll
never forget. The sun was round and gold like a big bowl of creamed
corn. The sky was blue like Clean &AMP; Clear astringent face wash for
sensitive skin. Fluffy puffs of clouds that looked like Farmer
Brown's white hair where it sticks out the back of his baseball cap
floated along like they had nowhere to go. Come to think of it,
they probably didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Timmy and I were playing in the yard. Timmy was my best friend.
I'd known him my whole life: Our moms laid us on the same day, we
hatched the same day. When we were still yellow and fuzzy we
cheeped and scampered and frolicked together. Timmy couldn't frolic
as well as the rest of the chicks because he wore Coke bottle
glasses for far-sightedness, he lisped, he stuttered, he laughed
like this: ``henk-henk-henk.'' He was a conspiracy theorist and one
of his legs was an inch shorter than the other so he mainly went in
circles. But he was my best friend. We got our pinfeathers
together, we ``borrowed'' Farmer Brown's copies of ``American
Poultry Monthly'' and giggled over it out behind the henhouse, we
talked about our hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   On this beautiful summer day, Timmy and I were sitting on a
grassy knoll in the farmyard, talking about our hopes and dreams.
Timmy told me he wanted to be a fireman and then president. I told
him I wanted to be an astronaut or a pilot because that's the only
way I'd fly with these dumb chicken wings. We smiled happily.
That's when it happened: The sky fell. It wasn't the whole sky,
just a piece of it, and it landed on Timmy's head.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to do. I ran screaming into the chicken yard.
``The sky is falling! The sky is falling!'' The older chickens
ignored me _ I saw them huddled in tight circles muttering
something about Chick-Fil-A _ and the younger ones laughed.
``You're crazy, Chicken Little, go cluck somewhere else.'' I ran
back to Timmy, cradling his head in my wings. ``Rosebud,'' he
gasped, his eyes fluttering closed. ``What? Timmy!'' I cried.
``Don't leave me!'' He smiled weakly and whispered, ``Chicken
Little, someday we'll fly together.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he drew a deep, shaky breath and heaved himself up,
gingerly rubbing the goose egg on his head. Getting beaned by the
falling sky had cured his far-sightedness, stutter and lisp. After
that he got all the chicks and ended up going to MIT and designing
airplanes. He took me flying one time when he was home visiting his
mother. And I spend most of my time outside, staring up and hoping
the sky will fall on me, too. I have never forgotten that summer
day.

 &HT;    Communities work through emotional wounds
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ They're called ``trigger events'' _
sounds, sights or smells that can trip a wire in the memory and
take a person back to a certain time or event.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Miller and her advanced chemistry students experienced
one several weeks ago when drama students practicing a skit in the
hallway outside her classroom screamed. Almost in unison the
chemistry students gasped and blanched, she said, ``and there are
other things, too. I think all of us shiver when we hear
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   It may always be that way at Columbine High School. The faces of
students will change, the students who were there April 20, 1999,
will graduate and leave, the teachers who were there will retire,
but it's impossible to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Because for all the pop-psychology talk of closure, it's
doubtful such a concept is real. When Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
blasted through Columbine High School at about 11:30 a.m. April 20,
1999, killing 12 students, one teacher and themselves, the tragedy
became a part of the school's fabric, an elemental part of
Littleton's consciousness, a fundamental event in the memories of
the people of Colorado and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the grief that follows death and tragedy, ``I don't
think you really have closure,'' said Kerri Mosinski, a grief
counselor for Grand Valley Hospice and Palliative Care in Grand
Junction. ``A lot of people think about grief as there's a start
and there's a stop. But most people will tell you, if they've
really gone through it, that grief doesn't ever really stop. When
you have the grief experience, your life goes on but that
experience forever changes your life, it's with you until you
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of other American communities that have experienced
tragedy can attest to that fact. In Oklahoma City _ where on April
19, 1995, Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 individuals _ people still
mourn, still grieve, said Lauri Hanna, community relations
coordinator for the Oklahoma City American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   She said five years later the Red Cross still has 37 open cases
stemming from the bombing, including helping people with medical
bills from dozens of surgeries and referring people to counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen divorces, attempted suicides, a lot of depression
and drug and alcohol abuse, just post-traumatic stress disorder,''
she said. ``Some of the cases we have now are people we've had
since right after it happened. But we have people who are brand
new, who felt like they could deal with it on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragedies that happen in America's cities and towns have become
national tragedies _ the bombing in Oklahoma City, and school
shootings in Pearl, Miss., Jonesboro, Ark., Paducah, Ky.,
Springfield, Ore., and Littleton. People talk and talk and talk
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits 2,000 miles away tell the people in a city where tragedy
occurred what they should have done to prevent it. The media crush
becomes suffocating. Emotional wounds are re-opened daily, the
grief made fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult,'' said Andy Lowry, a Columbine High
School physical education teacher, during a media forum April 5.
``What's made it really hard is the media, irresponsible journalism
and not finding facts. I turn on the radio, turn on the news, and
there are all these experts on Columbine who've never even been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey White, a Columbine senior who was at lunch when the
shootings occurred, said it's been hard enough going to school
there every day knowing what happened and trying to persevere
through the daily memories, ``but then you get a tour bus full of
people pulling into the parking lot, people standing across the
street staring at us. That's really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, said Pearl (Miss.) Police Chief Bill Slade,
people make an effort to get life back to normal _ not to forget,
because the grief is still so much a part of the town, but to just
live life.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the police department closed the last case relating
to the Oct. 1, 1997, high school shooting _ a case in which one
person charged as an accessory in the shooting made a plea
agreement and now is in state prison _ and that has helped. Life in
Pearl is what might be described as normal, if there is such a
thing, but the town has changed in little ways, Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more alert,'' he said. ``If they hear anything,
they call us. I don't just attribute that to what happened here, I
attribute that a lot to Columbine _ the terribleness of their
tragedy has made people say, 'Hey, enough is enough.' The kids or
whoever, they don't want to be an innocent party, they are saying,
'Hey, if I hear it I'm going to say something because I don't want
something like that to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Slade said since 1997 rumors have flown rampant through Pearl,
which hurt more than helped people. For the first two months of the
investigation, he said, four investigators worked the case 16 hours
a day while two more investigators spent as much time tracking down
rumors ``because we don't have the luxury of saying, 'Well, this is
nonsense.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would say overall that we are doing pretty good. Our
kids have gotten back in the groove, and I think at the end of that
year they were back in the groove at school,'' Slade said. ``There
still are a lot of memories and every time something else would
happen somewhere else the media would call, visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids are dealing with it better than some adults. With
adults there's a lot of wondering, a lot of guilt. I know I look at
it from my viewpoint, 'OK, what could I have done?' I tend to take
it personal because of my job, still wonder and second-guess about
different things. The kids say, 'OK, this happened, this is what's
been done.' Adults still think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, guilt has compounded the grief for some. Rich
Long, a Columbine technology teacher, said, ``I had a college
professor say to me, 'You're in the place of a parent for those
eight hours.' I struggle with this because it happened on our
watch. I just hurt when I think about how one of (the parents')
sons or daughters lost their lives. And these lives lost, they were
not insignificant. We lost a colleague who was a tremendous person,
who had a lot more life to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Rodney Reeves, pastor of Central Baptist Church in
Jonesboro, Ark., said the town as a whole is dealing well with
grief resulting from the March 24, 1998, tragedy at Westside Middle
School where two adolescent boys killed four students and one
teacher, but the tragedy at Columbine High School renewed much of
the grief for some because it happened so close to the Jonesboro
first anniversary, ``and because you really hope that somehow
society or the world you share with others would learn from your
tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hoping evil can somehow be spent in a sacrificial way
so it doesn't happen again, so the deaths of these children in
Jonesboro, these beloved members of our community, their lives
wouldn't have been sacrifices. But even though the Littleton
tragedy was something so disappointing for us because we were
hoping our tragedy would be the end of it _ and I'm not in any way
discounting what happened in Oregon and other places, but there's
something about the timing of Littleton and how it re-opened wounds
for us _ at the same time it gave us a reason to seek healing more
permanently, more significantly. I think we're doing better as a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the grief journey, Mosinski said. She cited a
mother who lost a child several years ago and told her that at
first she thought about the loss every minute of every day, then
every hour, then many times every day, ``then you wake up and
realize you have gone a day without thinking about it. But it's
never gone. You don't ever get over it, but your life changes, you
have growth experiences because of that loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry said attitudes at Columbine and in Littleton have changed
in subtle ways: ``Tomorrow is not guaranteed to any of us,'' he
said, ``so let's take care of today.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said in Jonesboro, a deeply religious community, people
have found comfort in the concept of God's providence, ``how God
seems to invest in us everything we need to get through tragedy,''
he said. ``A lot of people think a desire for a healthy community
of faith will operate as preventative maintenance for tragedy, but
that's not altogether true. What God does is he resources us
knowing what we will face, so we're able to work through things and
be healthier for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the April 5 media forum, Columbine students said the same
thing. They noted how family, friends and the Littleton community
have surrounded and embraced them, and helped them return to school
and succeed, and have been there when they needed to talk about
their grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at each other in a different light now,'' said Jamie
Conwell, a Columbine sophomore. ``It's been really hard knowing I
got out and my friends had to go through so much pain, see so much.
But your friends and family help you get through the bad times and
we all have those. But the support we get is what helps us through
this. Every day I get asked by teachers, 'How is your day going?'
We're a lot more aware of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to focus on each day when you wake up,'' said
Columbine student body president Mike Sheehan, a senior.
``Something happened to our school and it's hard to move on, but
we've been given a second chance to live.''

 &HT;    Pain of Columbine still lives
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The jolt of gunfire that shattered the
halls of Columbine High School still splits the air over Colorado's
amber plains, roars over purple mountains, drowns the cacophony of
its crystal rivers and clatters down red canyons.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of 55 shots from a TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun,
bought illegally for $500, and blasts from a sawed-off shotgun
fired a year ago ricochet wildly through the memories of those who
were horrified from afar.
</P>
<P>
   They remember watching young men and women streaming in fear
from school. They remember witnessing a teen's foot drag a bloody
trail down the library wall as he was tugged to safety. They
remember as the body count heaved, trembled and, finally, stilled
at 12 students, a teacher and two killers.
</P>
<P>
   The killers were, by most accounts, outcasts whose rampage was
motivated by revenge against their tormentors. Their victims,
however, came from every caste of high school society.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the report of gunfire from April 20, 1999, shakes the
halls of Congress and the Colorado Legislature. It sends presidents
and would-be presidents scuttling for political cover.
</P>
<P>
   But the echo of Columbine booms most loudly in the tiniest
places, in the consciences of those who watched, who lived and who
fear it all could happen again. For them, the word ``columbine''
will forever be more than just the name of the state flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last April 20, as the news of the tragedy began to come over
the news media, I remember thinking that as terrible as it was, I
was not directly affected by it,'' wrote Ron Taylor of Grand
Junction, who soon learned the bullets struck more closely than he
first realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``That very evening, my sister Lila called to tell us that my
nephew Philip was safe and unharmed,'' Taylor went on, responding
to a request by The Daily Sentinel that readers write their
impressions, recollections and prescriptions for the Columbine
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from complacency to concern in a heartbeat,'' he wrote.
``Suddenly, a far-off, Front Range tragedy involved my youngest
sister's eldest son and was as close as my immediate family.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullets flew closer to Layne Newton, a Columbine graduate
now attending Mesa State College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard noises and gunshots and screams,'' Newton said in an
interview with The Daily Sentinel. ``I ran out the front doors. The
glass in the doors shattered as my friend Charlie was running past
them. I thought he'd been shot but the bullets only shattered the
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in Carolyn Burger's combined fourth- and fifth-grade
class at Lincoln-Orchard Mesa Elementary School felt the terror
just almost as palpably as did Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really scared because someone could come kill me some
day,'' wrote Kristie Herrera, who, like many of her classmates,
said she would feel more comfortable in a school with video
cameras, metal detectors and armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't understand how people have the heart to do
that,'' wrote Danielle Edwards, a sixth-grader at Bookcliff Middle
School. ``I don't feel very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine killings touched deep nerves from sea to shining
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
(www.people-press.org) listed the Columbine killings as the
sixth-most followed story of the decade, with 68 percent of
respondents saying they followed the story very closely. The
killings in suburban Littleton garnered more interest than the
return of veterans after the end of the Persian Gulf War, yet were
a percentage point short of the interest in a little girl who fell
into a well in Texas in October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in 1999 of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law, as well as the death in 1997 of Princess Diana, were
followed closely by 54 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those cases involved people known to millions. Columbine
involved teens previously known only to their friends and families.
</P>
<P>
   Not every family was touched by the Columbine killings, but for
many, family was the overarching theme that both explained what
happened and offered a shield against more Columbine gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem goes back to what our society has become,'' wrote
Lynn Vrany of Grand Junction. ``Mothers no longer raise children;
day care does. Kids have very few boundaries or consequences and
law has taken power away from parents and schools and given it to
the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need continual love, care, guidance and consequences as
well as rewards for behavior. If they have self-respect and like
who they are and feel secure and part of something they will not
feel as bitter or violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bambino runs Youth Alternatives (www.youthalternatives.com)
next to his to Dare to Car-e mechanic's shop. Prominently displayed
in each building are photographs of each Columbine victim and a
paragraph summing each too-short life.
</P>
<P>
   For Bambino, Columbine was the logical reflection of a society
that has forgotten its familial connections and interdependence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of Americans made sure that I had a pretty good
America to grow up in,'' he said. ``I think we owe kids today the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adult dedication to kids they do not know has got to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bambino said he hopes the trauma of Columbine will take a
positive turn for his hope of building youth centers throughout the
Grand Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in all the debate of the Columbine killings has been
the question of whether such an outburst was predictable and
whether repeats are preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Not hardly, said Dr. Bob Sammons, a Grand Junction psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   It's much easier to predict the outcomes of people whose lives
are on a trail of chronic violence and lawlessness. The Columbine
killers had criminal records, but their lawbreaking wasn't of the
frequency or extremity that would suggest the destruction they
actually caused, Sammons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single acts of violence are extremely hard to do something
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mental-health professionals are no closer to identifying killers
such as those who terrorized Columbine before they kill than before
the rampage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors and therapists
haven't been trying.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rakiecki, head psychologist for School District 51, said in
the past year, the district investigated more deeply threats,
gestures and comments made by schoolchildren to determine whether
they were made lightly or seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we are assessing more kids more vigorously
than ever before,'' Rakiecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the horror of Columbine, children are still safer in
school than they are in the car driving home or on the ski slopes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The district's watchful approach is appropriate, said a private
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think School District 51 is closing its eyes,'' said
John Sorrick, a Grand Junction psychologist. ''I have not found
School District 51 to be overreacting.''

   Charlie Traylor, a Grand Junction lawyery sige on Mount Caramel
</P>
<P>
   By Mark England
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ People from all over the world have come here for
the last seven years and made the 10-mile trip east to Mount Carmel
even though there wasn't much to see: slabs of concrete sticking
out of the earth like toppled tombstones, the rusted carcass of a
motorcycle owned by the late David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Destroy it and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the mantra emanating from the 1993 debacle that
saw 82 Davidians and four ATF agents die during a months-long siege
and ignited a backlash against the federal government that's still
not ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh anniversary of the fire that destroyed Mount Carmel
is Wednesday. Meanwhile, surviving Branch Davidians are preparing
for the June 19 start of the trial of their lawsuit against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant English Professor Robert Darden of Baylor University
has led numerous unofficial tours of Mount Carmel, largely because
he and journalist Brad Bailey wrote a book on Koresh, ``Mad Man in
Waco,'' the title based on a song penned by Koresh about onetime
rival George Roden.
</P>
<P>
   Darden recently took a group in town for an academic freedom
conference on a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, it's like people who slow down at a car crash,''
Darden said. ``They just want to see where it happened. For most,
it's an historic site. They get their picture taken on Koresh's
motorcycle. They look on the ground for expended shells or broken
glass. Others get real quiet and are careful where they step. The
Bible talks about the ground crying out, and some people seem to
actually feel that. They feel a real sense of depression because of
the loss of life there.''
</P>
<P>
   `IT'S NOT A PLACE OF REST'
</P>
<P>
   Darden said he's never felt comfortable at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going to cemeteries,'' Darden said. ``They're very
peaceful to me. I don't feel that at Mount Carmel. It's not a place
of rest. I'm not a mystic, just an old East Texas boy. But I don't
feel a sense of peace there.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoes of rumbling tanks and gunshots and screams are fading,
though, helped by a new church visible through a field of 76 young
crape myrtles _ planted to commemorate the Davidians who died on
the final day of the siege _ that speaks more about hope than death
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a statement on the part of those who
volunteered to build it,'' said Davidian Clive Doyle, who lost his
daughter, Shari, in the Mount Carmel fire he survived. ``It is
somewhat of a statement on our part, too, that we're still around.
We are still an entity. It is not just an abandoned piece of
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Argo of Austin last week began painting the inside of the
church, which won't be finished by its dedication on Wednesday. He
was decked out in white from his overalls to his hair and beard.
Argo volunteered his services after hearing about the
church-raising from Alex Jones, the libertarian radio host in
Austin who has spearheaded the project since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Argo looked shocked when asked why he had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it Wilford Brimley says? 'Because it was the right
thing to do,''' Argo said. ``Maybe I'm weird. There are so many
people willing to donate their time and money to build the church
that I don't believe we're all eccentric. There was an injustice
done here. This is our way of undoing some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Mount Carmel for the first time didn't initially produce
any emotional reaction, Argo said, adding that he's seen too many
``battlefields'' in America where authorities clashed with
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another place,'' Argo said. ``It just happens to
be the most recent place.''
</P>
<P>
   His first night camping out at Mount Carmel was eerie, however,
Argo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sleeping in a tent by the pond,'' Argo said. ``The
coyotes were doing their coyote thing. I was listening to them,
looking out over the pond when, I swear, the coyotes sounded like
children crying. That got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Argo and an Oklahoma City man, who would identify himself only
as Glen, were the only people at Mount Carmel on a wet and windy
April morning. Two more men later joined them. All of them, thrown
together, affably worked out details of a supply run to Lowe's,
where an account has been set up to buy materials and supplies for
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Glen said he was going to stay for a week before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know anything about these people, but what the
government did to them was wrong,'' he said. ``There was a better
way to bring them out. The government initiated all this.''
</P>
<P>
   He's found the atmosphere pleasant at Mount Carmel, despite its
troubled history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just had a good feeling about this place,'' Glen said.
``Maybe it's the people I met. They're good people, the type you'd
want as neighbors. If someone needs help, they're there.''

   Clive Doyle and his mother, Edna, are back at Mount Carmel. They
live in a mobile home near the entrance. There has been talk of
rebuilding Mount Carmel to resemble the huge, four-story structure
thents might be tempted to scold them and take the toy away.
Parents who instead reach into the problem-solving toolboxes to
accomplish their long-term goal of teaching their kids conflict
resolution, might acknowledge the children's feelings, state the
rule about property rights, put the ball in their court and see
what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we intervene, we want to teach these skills, so we can
eventually get to the point of saying, `Gee, I bet if you two put
your heads together you can come up with a plan that is respectful
and fair to both of you,' and they will,'' she says in the book.
</P>
<P>
   But that's easier said than done, Corley said. She said she is
often tempted to react emotionally when her children fight. But she
usually lets them work it out themselves first, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With five children, when they fuss and fight, very often
there's no way we can be there and know the exact situation,'' she
said. ``More times than not, it's not one person's fault. When the
problem escalates to the point that they need mom or dad, usually
both of them are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder said she agrees with Pawel that balance and consistency
are important to effective parenting. But, Wilder said, going with
gut reactions probably won't have any long-term consequences to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us as parents have to make fast decisions,''
Wilder said. ``We all will sometimes respond out of our gut
reaction. What we don't want is to respond in a childlike way.
Respond the way you'd handle it with another adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder said she thinks most parents have long-term goals in
mind, such as helping their children be self-disciplined, motivated
and with good self-esteem. She advises parents to think of such
long-term goals when they rear their children, as long as they
don't get weighted down with the stress of achieving those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is that every parent has those in mind from the
minute they know they're gonna be parents,'' she said. ``Then they
start worrying when they're young that the child is not going to
reach those goals because they don't have a history of watching
children grow up and seeing how children change. I see parents
carry this burden, and some become burdened by the responsibility
they feel for preparing the children for life, so they worry a lot
and don't trust themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Shamblin of Hewitt says she and her husband, Kirk, have
received so much advice since their daughter Isabel was born 16
weeks ago, that they are refusing to listen to any more for fear
they will start to think of parenting as a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten advice as far as when to feed the baby, when to
introduce solids, if I should breast feed; we've been told not to
pick her up when she cries, not to buy any newborn-to-3-month
clothes,'' Alicia Shamblin said. ``I really haven't taken much of
that advice mostly because we're going on our own instincts. I
guess I have what I feel like are maternal instincts, and the
15-and-a-half weeks I've had, I feel like I've done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wouldn't want to follow a universal blueprint for
parenting because she wants to develop her own parenting style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you have a good balance of love, discipline and
values, you need to have a mixture there. I think we'll do OK,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder said no amount of parental instruction compares to
parents' instincts about their own children. She, too, is a mother.
Her oldest son was born the same month she graduated with a degree
in child development 26 years ago. She said none of her instruction
prepared her enough for being a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think parents know much more about their child than anyone
else,'' she said. ``As professionals, we must respect the parent's
understanding of their child.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pawel says her program is easily adaptable to all
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a universal plan, but it can be applied in an
individual way,'' she said. ``I can only go so far in print. It's
only a formula because it's easier to learn that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Johnston, executive director of the Plano-based
instruction course Practical Parent Education, encourages parents
to explore different parenting advice but ultimately to come up
with a plan of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience working with families, I find that most of
them want the same thing for their children, but they will take
different road maps to get there,'' she said. ``We might all want
to go to New York, but there are different ways to get to New York.
It's the same with children. If you have the same goals, there are
different ways to get there.''

 &HT;    Get ready for the summer games: Swimsuit shopping
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In this Olympic year, we need suits that
go the distance. Gold, silver, bronze. Red, white and blue. Neons,
florals, racing stripes ...
</P>
<P>
   Olympic swimmers, divers, water polo players and synchronized
swimmers don't have much say about
</P>
<P>
   what they wear to the pool. Their primary considerations are
patriotic and athletic, but those aren't taken lightly. (Among
sprinters and distance swimmers, there's currently a controversy
brewing over the use of neck-to-ankle suits _ a look that is no
doubt as hard to tug on as it is to pull off.)
</P>
<P>
   We non-Olympians, free from all governing bodies but our own,
can choose from a spectrum of colors and a whole closetful of cuts
this summer. Lime greens and hot pinks hang from store racks, but
so do slimming black and fun tropical prints. Some suits are sliced
up to there, but just as many hit mid-thigh.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're really looking for coverage, tie on a filmy sarong
_ a flattering alternative to wrapping yourself in the flag.
(Particularly since our flag has horizontal stripes.)
</P>
<P>
   TAKE A BREATHER
</P>
<P>
   Diving requires concentration of Olympic proportions. Just ask
Greg Louganis. The legendary diver blamed jet lag after he thwacked
his head on a diving platform in a 1979 contest. Nine years later
at the Seoul Games, Louganis' head met springboard during the
prelims. His scalp was patched together with temporary sutures,
enabling him to qualify. After a good night's sleep, he medaled
easily, becoming only the second athlete to win double diving golds
in two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   STRETCH!
</P>
<P>
   Remember what your mother told you: Wait half an hour after
eating before jumping back in the pool. And if you're swimming
laps, by all means stretch. Alfred Hajos almost certainly did. The
19-year-old Hungarian won the 1200-meter freestyle at the first
modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. The contest began with a
boat dropping the competitors into the chilly waters of the
Mediterranean. Hajos was the first swimmer to reach shore. Said he:
``My will to live completely overcame my desire to win.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS
</P>
<P>
   Along with the requisite nose clip, synchronized swimmers rely
on waterproof hair gel, themed swimsuits and underwater speakers to
practice their sport, which made its Olympic debut in 1984. The
nose clip prevents a nasal cavity full of water during upside-down
movements, and some synchro swimmers even tuck a spare clip into
their suits. The gel creates a unified look regardless of team
members' hair cuts and colors and, frankly, it just looks a whole
lot better than matching swim caps or hair nets.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT YOUR TIMING
</P>
<P>
   In case you can't get enough of athletes performing in unison
during the synchronized swimming competitions,
</P>
<P>
   set your VCR for another event, new to
</P>
<P>
   the Olympics this summer: Synchronized diving. That's right _
two men or two women diving in unison from either the 10-meter
platform or 3-meter springboard. Judges will score teams according
to individual dives as well as the amount of synchronization.
Olympians have plenty of maneuvers to choose from: 345 dive
variations exist between springboard and platform.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE ELEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Water polo is no day at the beach. The aquatic equivalent of
rugby, water polo attracts the hardiest of Olympians. Over
</P>
<P>
   four quarters of seven minutes each, players cannot touch the
bottom or the sides of the pool. And physical contact is the rule,
not the exception. Fouls that result in a player being temporarily
sidelined include kicking and striking; deliberate face-splashing;
and holding, sinking or pulling back an opponent not holding the
ball. No wonder most players opt for swim caps fitted with ear
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   SIZE UP YOUR COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   Who looks good to gold in Sydney? It depends on who you ask, of
course, but here are some of the favorites ... Just last week, the
Russian team floated to the top in the synchronized swimming
trials. The Europeans have always dominated men's water polo, and
six teams will compete for the first women's gold. The United
States has typically placed well in swimming and in diving. Since
diving became an Olympic sport, the Americans have captured 46 out
of 75 golds, and 125 of 225 total medals. Get ready to hear ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''

 &HT;    Service to mark new church, honor 76 Davidians who died
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The church that volunteers are building for
surviving Branch Davidians will be dedicated Wednesday during a
memorial service on the anniversary of the fire that destroyed
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the seventh year that a service has been held to
honor the 76 Davidians, including their leader, David Koresh, who
died on April 19, 1993, at the end of a 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the victims will be read and a bell sounded afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The list of speakers is still up in the air, according to
Davidian Clive Doyle. It will include Ramsey Clark, the former U.S.
attorney general helping represent the plaintiffs in the upcoming
wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government by surviving
Davidians. Alex Jones, the Austin radio host who launched the
volunteer effort to build the church at Mount Carmel, also will
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said more than 200 people are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the volunteers want to see it, and the people who
have put (money) into it,'' Doyle said. ``But you have to consider
that it's on a weekday, and a lot of people will be at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said the Davidians still in prison on manslaughter and
weapons convictions will be foremost in his thoughts at the
service. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear their appeal April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ongoing sore point with all of us are those guys in
prison,'' Doyle said. ``It is just not about us. It's not just
about building a building. We are trying to get the truth out about
what happened and what is still happening. The fact that we built
the church is an optical reminder that we still exist. They didn't
get rid of us all. Perhaps they wished they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers began painting the inside of the new church last week.
It probably won't be completed in time for its dedication, with
plumbing and electrical work remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to the building, however, will be given to the
Davidians on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A supporter also will give church members a flag she's made
bearing the image of a winged serpent, Doyle said. A lingering
image for many is a similar Davidian flag, seared by the fire
devouring Mount Carmel, flying about madly and then diving into the
flames.

BATTLE LOOMS WHEN SUPREME COURT HEARS PLEA OF BOY SCOUTS TO BAR
GAYS  
 BY LINDA GREENHOUSE  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For anyone wanting a front-row seat at the next
battle in the culture wars, the place to be is the Supreme Court
later this month when the justices hear the case of Boy Scouts of
America vs. James Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Boy Scouts nor Dale, an Eagle scout and former
assistant scoutmaster whom the Scouts expelled after learning from
a newspaper article that he was gay, come into court alone.
</P>
<P>
   The case has galvanized the religious right, on the Boy Scouts'
side, and organizations like the American Bar Association and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on
Dale's. Religions have been split by the case: Orthodox Jewish
groups for the Scouts, Reform Judaism for Dale; the United
Methodist Church for Dale, a dissident group of Methodists for the
Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of organizations, including medical and education
professionals, bar groups and state and local officials, have filed
briefs. The dispute _ for the weight of its competing arguments,
the doctrinal challenge it presents for the court and its overall
cultural resonance _ is plausibly the most compelling case on a
docket already weighty with potential landmark rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts are appealing a decision last August by the New
Jersey Supreme Court that Dale's expulsion from the troop he had
served with distinction for half his life violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law. The 5 million-member organization argues
that what is at stake is the freedom of a private, voluntary
organization to ``create and interpret its own moral code'' _ in
this instance, by excluding avowed homosexuals _ and that without
such freedom, ``American society would be fundamentally
transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A society in which each and every organization must be equally
diverse is a society which has destroyed diversity,'' the Boy
Scouts assert in their brief, warning that the logical result of
the New Jersey court's ruling would be for a Croatian cultural
society to have to admit Serbs or for a gay rights group to be
unable to exclude a biblical fundamentalist. The argument is based
on the First Amendment right to freedom of association and its
corollary, the freedom to not associate.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed with the kind of arguments the Boy
Scouts are making _ sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Dale and his lawyers at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund are arguing that freedom of association has never been
regarded as an absolute free-floating right, but rather as a right
to associate for a purpose, to advance a cause or belief. Even
assuming that people have a right to come together for the purpose
of opposing homosexuality, his brief says, that is not a
description of the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The common interests that bring its millions of members together
``are not about homosexuality or sexual orientation,'' Dale says.
Consequently, he argues, New Jersey's ``vital government
interests'' in prohibiting discrimination outweigh any incidental
burden on the expressive interests of a major civic organization
that is chartered by Congress and stitched tightly to government at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed with the kind of argument Dale is
making _ sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an undeniable, inevitable tension between the right
of a private group to define who it wants as members, and the right
of the state to prevent invidious discrimination,'' David D. Cole,
a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, who filed a brief
on Dale's behalf, said in an interview the other day. ``There is no
easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   With no clear way to resolve the tension, Cole said, the Supreme
Court has dealt with it by establishing two categories of cases: On
the one hand, the court has rejected efforts by government to limit
what a private group can say, or to force a private group to yield
control over its message. This category was exemplified by a 1995
decision holding that the organizers of the Boston St. Patrick's
Day parade, the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, could not
be required, despite a state anti-discrimination law, to accept the
participation of a group whose members wanted to march under a
banner of gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Cole said, the court has held that exclusion
from an organization based simply on someone's group status or
identity, is not constitutionally protected. In a trilogy of cases
in the mid-1980s, the court rejected claims by all-male
organizations, including the Jaycees and the Rotary Club, to a
First Amendment right to continue excluding women.
</P>
<P>
   In all these cases, the St. Patrick's Day parade case as well as
the all-male club trilogy, the justices were unanimous, in outcome
although not necessarily in their reasoning. Unanimity on such
touchy issues is ``remarkable,'' Cole said, reflecting the court's
success in placing the cases in one analytical box or the other and
thereby avoiding the struggle of reconciling the tensions inherent
in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the court found that the clubs existed for a
commercial purpose and that the exclusion of women was not part of
their self-described mission.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, each side in the current case, Boy Scouts vs.
Dale, No. 99-699, to be argued on April 26, invokes the precedent
that supports its desired outcome. The Boy Scouts assert that the
case is controlled by the St. Patrick's Day parade case, Hurley vs.
Gay, Lesbian &AMP; Bisexual Group of Boston (GLIB). ``By donning the
uniform of an adult leader in scouting,'' the Boy Scouts' brief
says, Dale would ``celebrate his identity as an openly gay scout
leader in precisely the same way that the GLIB marchers wished to
conscript the parade to celebrate their identity'' and to claim
social acceptance within the Irish community.
</P>
<P>
   Dale asserts that the trio of all-male club cases, beginning
with Roberts vs. U.S. Jaycees in 1984, governs his case; just as
the clubs could not keep out women simply for being female, without
regard to any views they might hold on the clubs' mission, they
cannot exclude him simply upon learning his identity as a gay man.
The New Jersey Supreme Court found that under the state's Law
Against Discrimination the Boy Scouts were a ``public
accommodation'' to which the law could properly be applied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of Dale's sexuality was not connected to his Boy
Scout activities, but rather came in a newspaper article about a
gay students' group in which he was active at Rutgers University,
where he was an undergraduate. Within days after the article, with
his picture, appeared in The Star-Ledger of Newark, the Monmouth
Council of the Boy Scouts revoked his membership in Troop 73,
telling him that it was Boy Scout policy to ``specifically forbid
membership to homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the dueling precedents, the fate of the case may well turn
on whether the court sees a statement of gay identity as an
inherently expressive act, one that conveys a message beyond a
simple self-description. The Boy Scouts, looking to place Dale in
the position of the would-be St. Patrick's Day parade's marchers,
assert that being openly gay conveys not only an identity but a
built-in message of disaffection with the ``scouting values'' that
a troop leader is supposed to transmit.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, on the other hand, asserts that ``learning that someone is
gay tells you nothing about his or her political party, religious
beliefs, lifestyle, or moral code'' and that consequently his
exclusion amounted to the same discrimination based on status that
the court rejected in the all-male club cases. If reinstated, his
brief says, ``Dale is prepared to be bound by the same directives
and limitations placed on all scoutmasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the legal arguments is the fact that the case
concerns not just any mass-membership organization, not a
businessmen's dinner club, but the Boy Scouts _ described by Lord
Robert Baden-Powell, who founded the organization in England in
1907 as a ``character-factory.'' What impact will that have on the
justices?
</P>
<P>
   Both sides strive for the high ground. ``In an age when we laugh
and mock what we used to honor and venerate,'' the Family Research
Council, a conservative Christian organization, says in its brief,
``the Boy Scouts of America stands against a cultural tide'' and
should not be ``sacrificed on the altar of a civil right that
belies its name.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the American Public Health Association tells
the court that Boy Scouts' ``central role in so many communities''
makes it all the more important to make sure the organization does
not rely on ``discredited myths and stereotypes to justify
excluding gay scouts simply because of their status.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As thousands of protesters determined to stop the
World Bank meeting poured into Washington on Saturday morning, the
police shut down the demonstration's headquarters in a sudden
pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that the ramshackle warren of warehouse space known
as the ``convergence center'' was a fire hazard, the police evicted
more than 200 protesters shortly before 9 a.m. and sealed it off
indefinitely. The space was the nerve center for demonstrations
planned for Sunday and Monday as a repeat of the chaotic Seattle
protests against the World Trade Organization in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire marshals were concerned about the safety and
well-being of the people who are staying at that location,'' a
straight-faced Chief Charles H. Ramsey of the Metropolitan Police
Department told reporters at his post by the barricades around the
World Bank. ``It's a safety issue. We're concerned about the safety
of all people who come to D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an umbrella organization called Mobilization for Global
Justice, adherents of a number of causes plan two days of
demonstrations here against the annual spring meeting of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, beginning on Sunday. The
protesters contend that globalization and the financial
institutions' development policies are destroying the environment
and hurting poor people in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected shutdown of their headquarters threw their plans
in doubt, although many of the demonstrators were expecting to act
on their own in small groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters have vowed to block finance ministers and
other delegates from around the world from attending the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Striking in small, close-knit bands of five to 20 people called
``affinity groups,'' the protesters _ some of whom have been
training for months _ hope to close down the streets around the
global economic power's headquarters. A solid block along H Street
is already lined with television satellite broadcasting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finance ministers and international bureaucrats who shape
the world economy to make the rich richer and the poor poorer need
to know that Seattle was not just a bump on their road to global
domination,'' the mobilization declared on its Web site, one of the
demonstrators' primary organizing tools.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters will be facing an armada of at least 1,500
police officers from a half dozen city and federal agencies
determined to prevent any repeat of Seattle's chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Park Police, which patrols much of the federal land
here, has carried out training drills with its mounted units and
SWAT teams, said Sgt. Rob MacLean, who added, ``If a situation
occurs like the one in Seattle, we'll be prepared.'' Two fire
marshals, accompanied by two Metropolitan Police officers who said
they were with the Nuisance Abatement Task Force, appeared shortly
after 8:30 a.m. at the headquarters, where protesters had been
holding workshops in nonviolent tactics and making other
preparations. The officials said they were checking for possible
fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the area was sealed off by the officers of the
elite police Emergency Response Team. Shouting demonstrators
clutching their sleeping bags and backpacks were being escorted to
the streets, and ranking officers appeared to brief the media.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Assistant Chief Terrance W. Gainer told reporters that
the fire marshals had found ``numerous'' violations, including
clogged stairwells, propane cooking stoves and jury-rigged
electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that the shutdown was a tactical maneuver, saying,
``No, the real purpose was that these kids don't burn themselves up
in a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, clustered outside the police lines, differed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just indicates how the police are in league with corrupt
governments, the IMF and the World Bank,'' said Han Shan, a member
of the mobilization, calling the talk of possible conflagration
``spurious.''
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of mostly youthful demonstrators wandered the city's
streets this morning, many of them having organized protest groups
at their colleges in recent weeks. Gretchen Holzheimer, 20, a
junior at Hobart and Willam Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., came
with three cars full of friends on Friday night. ``We're all in
agreement that there are definitely issues that have to be dealt
with about the WTO, but we're not all in agreement on just what
those issues are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the IMF, police cars with lights and sirens escorted shuttle
buses full of perplexed-looking bankers through the barricades that
had been erected along Pennsylvania Avenue. Even the man delivering
a hand-truck full of pink Financial Times' had to clear security
before he was allowed past the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters for the protesters was a set of old warehouses
down an alley in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. In one corner
of the alley on Friday, young mechanics worked on donated bicycles
to be used by couriers during the demonstrations. Early arrivals
diligently painted banners, while another group practiced with
giant puppets dressed in bankers' suits, representing their
targets. To the beat of drums and muffled giggles, the
banker-puppets high-fived one another.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other puppets being assembled was a ``structural
adjustment mechanism,'' a reference to the strict budgetary
limitations the World Bank imposes to bail out troubled third world
economies. Reflecting the protesters' point of view, the
contraption has giant jaws that chew up forests.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was earnest _ lectures on a ``doomsday economy''
abounded _ and so determinedly democratic that protesters insisted
that no one was in charge. Decisions were reached by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we are organizing is creating the world we want to
live in,'' Patrick Reinsborough, one of the activists, said.
``There are no leaders, no hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eclectic gathering. There was Russ Davis, a
43-year-old unemployed electrical worker, who said he was laid off
in August when General Electric cut its work force in Lynn, Mass.,
to 2,000 from 9,000 and moved many of the jobs to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There was a guerrilla gardener clutching a sprig of rosemary,
who gave his name as Sasha Scatter and who grew up in Manhattan and
was among the squatters in Tompkins Square Park in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been no less diligent in their preparations.
Earlier in the week, the police intelligence unit and other
officers arrested seven people a few blocks from the convergence
center and charged them with conspiracy and ``possessing implements
of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The material seized by the police included 256 PVC pipes, 45
smaller pipes, two rolls of chicken wire, 50 rolls of duct tape,
gas masks, bolt cutters, heavy chains, an electrical saw and
locking devices used to link people together.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are instruments that are commonly used by demonstrators
to connect themselves to different objects, to hook themselves to
one another, to block traffic, to cause other kinds of disruptions,
and we were able to intercept a lot of the material,'' Ramsey told
reporters.

GORE'S PUZZLING MOVE TO TAKE BOY'S UNEXTENDED HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything was humming along fine for Vice
President Al Gore, until little Elian Gonzalez strayed into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was making a seamless transition from a
successful primary season. He had vanquished former Sen. Bill
Bradley and begun a highly competitive general election campaign by
catching and even surpassing Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican nominee, in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 30, prompted by no one, Gore thrust himself into
one of the most emotionally and politically charged cases in the
country. After months of saying that the fate of 6-year-old Elian
should be decided in the courts, Gore said the boy should be
granted permanent residency status.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fierce backlash, not because Gore seemed to
contradict himself _ he had spoken earlier in such code that it was
hard to discern what he believed. The concern was rather that he
had chosen a highly volatile moment in the case to break openly
with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of Democrats simply disagreed with his position. He
appeared to be saying that because of Fidel Castro's dictatorship
in Cuba, the Cuban boy should not be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Because his statement seemed so unnecessary, a number of people
in his own party denounced Gore as pandering to Miami's politically
potent Cuban-Americans in an overt play for Florida's 25 electoral
votes. To black lawmakers, it looked like favoritism over
foreigners who sought to enter the United States from poor
countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic but did not have
the power to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's involvement in the Elian case quickly ballooned into a
political crisis. Whether it will change votes in November is
probably unknowable; Gore advisers insist it will be a wash.
``There has been no erosion in the polls because of Elian,'' a top
Gore official said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Gore backers insist that the Elian case is just a bump in
the road to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to be voting on Elian in November,'' said
Edward G. Rendell, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's move seemed damaging in a fundamental way. It
reinforced his biggest weakness _ the perception that he is a
calculating opportunist, not a man of principle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not connected to the campaign,
gives Gore credit for achieving some milestones _ recharging his
campaign last fall and emerging from the primaries with his party
intact. But, Hart said, the Elian case provided an unfortunate
reminder that Gore is ``always trying to pounce on the issue of the
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People see a pattern of pragmatism rather than a pattern of
conviction,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian case highlighted another potential weakness in the
Gore candidacy. Rather than rally members of his party behind his
view, the vice president alienated them. The Elian statement came
on the heels of another declaration, on campaign-finance reform,
that was swiftly faulted as unworkable and that failed to stir a
following within his party. Together, the two statements raised
questions among some on Capitol Hill about Gore's ability to lead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Elian case also showed the Gore campaign suddenly losing its
footing. It was exactly the kind of situation that Gore, through
strict discipline and message control, had meticulously avoided, at
least since January, when he suggested and then retreated from the
idea that he would ensure that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff would favor allowing gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the vice president, by his moves in the Elian
case, seemed to undo much of the progress that he had made since
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent backing and filling only made the situation
worse, and Gore appeared weakened in at least one opinion poll.
Some of his top staff, including Tony Coelho, his campaign
chairman, and Monica Dixon, his deputy chief of staff, have been
trying to mend fences with angry Democrats, particularly blacks,
who had been among Gore's staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers said they had not been widely consulted, and the
spin that emerged was this: Gore was just being consistent, true to
his passions (a word they like because it conveys something that
voters think he lacks) and to his somewhat hawkish views on foreign
policy, which are generally to the right of the center of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   All of this culminated in the vice president's decision to forgo
a news conference planned for Thursday, as a human chain circled
Elian's house in Miami and the Justice Department negotiated with
his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's last news conference was on Feb. 19. His advisers said
that the risks of being pressed about Elian now and further
stirring the pot outweighed the advantages of capitulating to the
news media. ``Things were moving too fast,'' one said of the
negotiations. ``We couldn't assure him of any stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lingering problem is this: The Elian case underscored
the central challenge that the campaign had already pinpointed,
that Gore needs to counter the perception that he is more
preoccupied with tactics than with principle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backers do not deny a connection between Gore's
vulnerabilities and the campaign's long-term task _ to rid Gore of
his calculating air.
</P>
<P>
   The real worry in the campaign is that episodes like this cannot
be predicted, only managed after the fact. ``Both campaigns are
going into this with set pieces,'' said one Democratic strategist.
``It's these other wild cards, these pop quizzes, that always get
you.''

IF ELIAN RETURNS TO HIS HOMETOWN, HE'LL FIND LIFE LARGELY UNCHANGED
FROM WHEN HE LEFT

<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba _ If and when Elian Gonzalez returns with his
father from Miami, he likely will come home to this tattered city,
a place straining with unrealized potential and struggling toward
wherever Cuban society may be headed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, 6, would come back to a country still ruled by a
communist regime that is reviled by Cuban exiles and revered by
many Cubans still on the island.
</P>
<P>
   He would grow up in a society untouched by most of the changes
that have swept the globe in recent decades, in a threadbare
socialist economy still struggling for a return in a free-market
world.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, many here say, Elian would come home to his
own family. He would come back to where he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life will be much the same as it was before,'' says Fidel
Ramirez, 32, a co-worker and childhood friend of Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, whose own children sometimes play with Elian.
``And Elian lived very well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cardenas is among Cuba's better communities, the city
could also be ranked among its most dissatisfied. Many of the
Cubans leaving the island in small boats to Florida depart from the
mangrove swamps near here. The Gulf Stream sweeps past the island
just a few miles offshore, washing everything in it north toward
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Elian, his mother and 12 other people from
Cardenas boarded a patch-wood boat with a bad motor in a bid for
the U.S. coast. The boat sank off South Florida. Only Elian and two
others survived.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cuban demands for his return and the U.S. government's
efforts to comply, Elian remains in Miami, where he is staying with
his great-uncle and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Once Elian returns home, some here say, he will come back a
newly minted hero of Fidel Castro's revolution, which has ruled the
island since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be privileged in this country,'' says Raimundo
Garcia, a Protestant minister who heads a foreign-funded foundation
in Cardenas that teaches democracy and economic development. ``If
he needs a house, he's going to get a house. If he needs food,
he'll get food. If he needs psychiatric care, he'll have it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The family (of Elian) here is going to have all sorts of
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few in Cardenas, a city of 100,000 people about 90 miles
east of Havana, doubt that Elian would enjoy more material comforts
in Miami. Television images from there and years of visits and cash
gifts from relatives now living in the United States have left
little doubt here that Miami means money.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here argue that wealth isn't everything. And
their views seem guided as much by common sense as communist
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child needs to have discipline,'' says Ramirez, the Gonzalez
family friend who is a staunch member of the Communist Party. ``It
is not good to give children everything they want, to teach
children they can have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Cubans are poor, the country offers its children many
advantages. The government makes certain that every child has
enough to eat. Education is free, and university study is
encouraged. Sports are pervasive. Health care is universal.
</P>
<P>
   And, people will tell you, unlike those in Haiti, Mexico or
other Latin American countries, no Cuban child sleeps in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   People say they know this because they see no children in the
streets. They also know it because the government reminds them of
it.
</P>
<P>
   While no one may be starving in Cuba, few are doing better than
getting by. A revolutionary society that once boasted that it was
showing poor countries the way to a better world now brags about
simply holding its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children who are not Elian, what are we going to do for
them?'' asks Garcia, the minister.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few late-model cars navigating the streets and the
young men and women strolling the sidewalks in Lycra and shirts
emblazoned with U.S. sports teams logos, Cardenas seems caught in a
time warp.
</P>
<P>
   As across Cuba, many of the city's buildings have been in slow
decay since the 1959 revolution, most apparently unpainted for
decades. With buses few and regular taxis expensive, most people
get around either by bicycle or in horse-drawn wagons, creating
silent traffic jams in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The house where Elian's paternal grandparents live, where by all
accounts the boy has spent much of his young life, sits on a quiet
street a few blocks from a rusting factory that produces syrup, rum
and other sugar products.
</P>
<P>
   Thick, black smoke spews from the factory's high chimney,
drifting over the neighborhood. An odor of burnt sugar hangs in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everywhere else in Castro's Cuba, the Gonzalezes'
street is racially integrated, with white, black and mixed-race
families living easily next to one other. Neighbors walk into each
other's houses unannounced, share chores, lend a hand when people
are sick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
$$$
</P>
<P>
   The houses are mostly small, some tiny, with large families
often sharing just a few rooms. But there is running water and
sewers, and every house seems to have a television.
</P>
<P>
   Trash clogs the vacant lot a few doors down from Elian's
grandparents' house, but their street is paved. Those a few blocks
away are not. Even a brief spring downpour floods a few of the
neighborhood streets.
</P>
<P>
   Young children are everywhere, playing stick ball or soccer in
the streets and riding bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men who live in the Gonzalezes' neighborhood work at
the sugar plant or at the city's docks, also a few blocks away.
Others labor at a nearby oil refinery or at a factory in the city
that makes building supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But the luckiest _ perhaps as many as 7,000 people in Cardenas _
have landed jobs in the hotels, restaurants and tourist traps of
Varadero, the nearby beach resort where the currency is the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother, Elizabet Broton, worked as maid in a Varadero
hotel. His father mans a gate and works at a snack bar at a
tree-shaded theme park, a place where tourists eat in ethnic
restaurants, drink rum concoctions and watch ducks and geese frolic
in man-made ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and other park employees earn $60 a month or more in
tips, the workers say. Some Varadero jobs, such as waiter or
bartender in a big hotel, can bring tips of $300 or more a month, a
fortune in a country where the top official wage, earned by
physicians and other professionals, stands at just $30.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism jobs go to Communist Party members such as Gonzalez
or those with family connections. For everyone else, there are
regular jobs at Cuban pay. And many Cubans increasingly want no
part of those.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of idle young men fill the streets of Cardenas at
midmorning each weekday, standing on corners or sitting listlessly
in doorways and on curbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live here don't want to work in anything that isn't
attached to tourism,'' says Garcia, the Protestant minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people have started their own small businesses,
making and selling shoes, clothing and other items or operating
small mechanic's shops.
</P>
<P>
   That initiative, and the many millions of dollars sent back to
Cubans by relatives in the United States, is changing the mentality
here. Castro and his government might still talk of revolutionary
socialism, but many people have left it behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that in the future the government is going to have
to make some changes,'' Garcia says, ``because the economy is
changing, and the society is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be capitalism,'' he says. ``But it has to
be another type of socialism, more attached to Cuba's reality but
also to the changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elian would still be returning to a communist-run country.
And while the situation perhaps is not as dire here as Miami's
Cuban exiles paints it, this is a society that can still seem
stultifying to the outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and the other heroes of the 1959 revolution still hold a
favored place in popular culture. Billboards and graffiti across
the island extol the sayings of Fidel or thank the late Argentine
revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, an early Castro disciple,
for his ``teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Defiant slogans are everywhere, tying most everything to the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction is revolution!'' assure large signs at building
sites. ``We believe in Fidel, the revolution and socialism,''
proclaim others.
</P>
<P>
   While many Cubans, especially the young, have grown increasingly
bored with the struggle, millions more have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There continues to be a close relationship between the people
and the (Communist) party, of people and the government,'' explains
Garcia, the minister, who says he took part in Castro's rebellion
when he was a teen-ager but broke with the revolution after it
veered to Marxism. ``Despite all the errors and the economic
crisis, the revolution fulfilled a lot of expectations, and people
still feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to destroy what we have now,'' Garcia says of
himself and others seeking reforms, ``but to improve on what we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Elian, should he return, like the country's
other schoolchildren, will be drilled in reading, writing and
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child, where do you want to live?'' Amelia Cruell, 49, who
lives down the block from the Gonzalezes, asks the 9-year-old
grandson she is raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba!'' responds the boy, Rodolfo Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, child?'' asks the grandmother. ``This is my fatherland!''
the boy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who is Fidel?'' the woman asks, a pleased smile sweeping
her face. ``He is my `comandante!''' Rodolfo answers as if by rote,
his eyes fixed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' Cruell says, turning to a visitor. ``Who says Cuban
children want to leave?''
</P>

   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio _ For all the pop culture amusement in ``The
Sopranos,'' ``The Godfather'' and their welter of bang-bang, ha-ha
imitators, James B. Callen is decidedly not amused as he lives here
through the reality as opposed to the entertainment of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Callen, a 54-year-old lawyer, is rounding out two decades of
trying to rouse outrage against this city's endemic bedevilment by
organized crime. But he finds a benumbed citizenry all too casually
expecting another indictment, No. 79 in a series, this time of its
pugnacious and popular congressman, James A. Traficant Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people it's not a question of personalities; it's a
question of a community, its value structure, its culture,'' said
Callen, the director of Ohio Legal Services. He noted that
Traficant campaigned quite successfully against Democratic primary
challengers last month by positively predicting his own indictment
and portraying himself as the victim of a Justice Department
vendetta against this city and its people.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's success, in Callen's view, personifies the sorry
tale of Youngstown, where another judge was indicted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is a tired saga here that already includes a prosecutor
gunned down after being deemed unbribable; the racketeering and
murder-conspiracy conviction of Lenine ``Lenny'' Strollo, the local
godfather worthy of central casting; the conviction of Traficant's
late district manager as an admitted bagman for the mob; plus
assorted county commissioners and patronage appointees gone bad,
including a popular mob-busting prosecutor who was indicted on
suspicion of being a secret agent of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   And, most famously, there is the 1983 indictment of Traficant,
who was then county sheriff, after he was recorded accepting
$163,000 in bribes from organized-crime figures. A nonlawyer but a
potent orator, Traficant defended himself in court and was
acquitted as a folk hero who argued that he was secretly running a
sting to target organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of corrupted officials perennially vowing to root
out corruption in this Mahoning Valley city prompted a bleak
warning in 1997 from Thomas Moyer, the chief justice of the state
Supreme Court: ``The citizens of Mahoning County have reason to
question whether the legal system is working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that those who fight corruption put life and
career at risk. Two county building inspectors were turned in two
years ago by their superior, Stephen Berry, and he was soon
targeted in a counterinvestigation. It proved fruitless, but he
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't play ball with these guys and look what happened to
me,'' said Berry, who is suing for civil damages, presenting the
ultimate Youngstown argument that government here amounts to a
criminal enterprise. ``My kids are going to grow up here,'' he
said, articulating the outrage that Callen says is too often
missing in this city's scandal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can put a thousand people in jail, but unless we change
the culture in the community, the way we do business, it doesn't
matter,'' said Callen, who began grass-roots organizing 19 years
ago when he found the corruption of local government so pervasive
that it was barely commented on by a passive citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the community culture changes, this place will be like
`Groundhog Day,' endlessly repeating itself,'' Callen predicted.
The Citizens' League of Greater Youngstown, of which he is a
founder, is a tenacious group that continues to believe that this
dilapidated shell of a once-vital steel-mill city can someday shed
its notoriety as ``Crimetown USA.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been numbed by it all,'' said Bruce J. Beard, a business
executive and a proud native of Youngstown. Like other area
leaders, Beard now grieves for his city from the prosperous ring of
nearby suburbia. But he works to help by bolstering the troubled
Youngstown school system and volunteering through some resilient
church groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Youngstown as a vibrant city, with an orange crust
in the air from the open-hearth mills,'' Beard said of his youth 40
years ago. ``But it was on the wane even then, and now we have
written it off,'' he said of the city's failure to escape the mob
image and, judging by the evidence of the continuing indictments,
the mob itself.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Callen and other members of the Citizens' League fairly ache at
the gruesome cliche of this city's life imitating gangster
melodrama, down to the spates of car bombings and the car-bombing
jokes that signal the public's impotence. The fact that the only
obvious growth industry is in special federal task force
indictments underlines Youngstown's failure to share in the
suburban economic boom, which leaves it encircled like some
ossified European city-state caught in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   That Old World image is at the heart of the blunt alarm to the
city that has been delivered lately by Callen and his Citizens'
League colleague Mark T. Shutes, an associate professor of
anthropology at Youngstown State University.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the ones who support our values,'' said Shutes, a
specialist in the cultural ways of anachronistic hamlets in
Ireland, Greece and Italy where the values of organized corruption
in behalf of the powerless evolved as the antidote to despotic
government. He noted that those values were seeded here across a
century of immigration and blue-collar insularity, and when the
steel mills failed and no new opportunity arrived, the old ideas
stayed entrenched as a lucrative monopoly for organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``People here don't trust politicians who don't want to be
brokers for them,'' Shutes said of the waves of reformers who come
and go in this Democratic Party bastion. Some of them are
incrementally successful, he noted, but others are finally
corrupted in a pattern that reinforces the cynicism of the people.
``They expect their politicians to do their dirty work and take
their share in the bargain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of calls for reform in the political arena.
Traficant's chief primary challenger, state Sen. Robert F. Hagan,
made government corruption his main issue and went down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of dealing with this corruption,'' Hagan told
voters. ``I'm tired of people putting us down. I'm tired of the
media showing up every time there's an indictment, and I think
everyone here should be tired of it too.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traficant maintains that the Justice Department, smarting from
his earlier acquittal, is on a vindictive ``fishing expedition''
against him. He notes that task force investigators have been
subpoenaing 15 years of his office records with a persistence that
he predicts will find him indicted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to hide,'' he said during the primary, scrappy
as ever as he contended it was he, not the Justice Department, who
was Youngstown's anti-corruption champion. ``I have done nothing
wrong,'' he declared, complaining that newspaper leaks about the
investigation were efforts to influence the primary, which he won
with 50 percent of the vote in a four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   His critics find that relatively small percentage encouraging.
But Traficant's Republican challenger, Paul Alberty, a computer
consultant, ran against him on the corruption issue in 1998 and
says he learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Traficant is a daunting figure in Youngstown politics,''
Alberty said. ``This time out I'm emphasizing how the city has not
been a part of the economic recovery going on all around us in
Akron and other booming cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngstown has never seemed more jaded, in the view of Ray
Butler, a 50-year-old native who is working for a long-shot victory
by Alberty. ``This city can be humorous, laughable,'' he said.
``But after a while it's got to be seen as pathetic.''

 &HT;    Gore tries to put Texas on trial
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fifth-worst poverty rate. Second-worst hunger
problem. Second in the number of children without health insurance.
Forty-fifth in homeownership.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Texas statistics that Vice President Al Gore
trotted out last week when Gov. George W. Bush unveiled health-care
and housing proposals designed to cement his image as a
``compassionate conservative.'' Though not all of Gore's numbers
withstand scrutiny, Texas almost always fares poorly when it is
compared to other states on social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps saying he's a reformer with results,'' Gore said last
week in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
``Where are the results? They're not in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to challenge Bush on what he's done to improve health
and housing since he's been governor _ particularly since the state
has enjoyed budget surpluses during his tenure. But taxes,
demographics and even the Lone Star State's frontier past all play
a part in Texas' low rankings. Those factors predate Bush, and
they're likely to persist long after he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from a bootstrap mentality: Unless you're the poorest
of the poor or the sickest of the sick, help is not forthcoming,''
said state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, who's been at the
forefront of legislative battles for more social services money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe people should take care of themselves, or the
community should.''
</P>
<P>
   SELF-RELIANCE AND RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM
</P>
<P>
   The other women at the welfare office nod in recognition when
Lisa Anderson lifts up her sleeve to reveal scars from dozens of
blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   Each pin prick was worth $15, a critical supplement to the $168
monthly welfare check Anderson got from the state when her husband
left her and their two children for another woman _ taking the car
and the contents of their bank account with him.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare check, combined with the blood-donation money,
enabled Anderson to cover the camping fees she had to pay for
pitching a tent in a public park. For six months, that tent was
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to Dollar General, you buy everything on clearance and
you just go without,'' Anderson said of life on the Texas dole.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has increased its monthly welfare benefit since Anderson
relied on it several years ago. But it's still about half the
national average. That fact says a lot about Texas' social services
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you after answering 12 years of mail that the
people of Texas want people to be self-sufficient if they are at
all capable of doing so,'' said state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Ratliff
holds the purse strings in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public looks to us to only provide help to those
who truly can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many say Texas' approach to social services is connected to its
frontier past, when self-reliance and rugged individualism were
paramount virtues. In his book ``Lone Star,'' regarded as the
definitive history of Texas, T.R. Fehrenbach wrote that the state
carried its frontier ethos into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans were decent, Protestant people, but the concept of
public welfare beyond the starvation level violated every ancient
Protestant ethic they possessed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God helped them who helped themselves. Those who could not
cope deserved second class, or worse, status.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to subsist solely on state help, Anderson was forced to
find work. She did day labor _ unloading trucks, laying sheetrock,
cleaning work areas, she says _ and trained to become a dental
assistant. She no longer gets a monthly check, although her
children are enrolled in Medicaid and she receives food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, said ``there are basic questions of
subsistence'' when welfare benefits are as low as they are in
Texas. On the other hand, a low benefit level fulfills a social
purpose, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work will then pay much more than welfare, and that's a good
thing,'' Kharfen said.
</P>
<P>
   FEWER TAXES, LESS SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   But Texas' low social services spending has as much to do with
fiscal philosophy as it does social philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   State health Commissioner Reyn Archer, a Bush appointee,
admitted as much last week when he was asked why 600,000 Texas
children are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the Legislature knows that if we are
successful, and we got all those kids registered, they would not
balance their budgets any more,'' Archer told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is an anti-tax, anti-government spending state _ and it
always has been. It is one of six states without a state income
tax, and its constitution includes a balanced budget requirement, a
specific limit on welfare spending and a cap on the growth rate of
spending from certain taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the most recent year for which numbers are available,
Texas ranked 40th in state and local taxes, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau. It ranked 44th when the state's aggregate wealth was
factored in.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Texas ranked last among states in per capita state
spending, according to the Census Bureau. It was among the bottom
five in spending on public health, highways, police protection and
parks. With local spending included in the mix, Texas ranked 44th _
below all of the other states without an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have a history of low services, and there's a certain
inertia,'' said Dick Lavine, the tax expert at the Center for
Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based think thank that supports
more spending on social services. ``Other states have prospered
with higher taxes and higher levels of services.''
</P>
<P>
   When extra money is available _ as it was during the most recent
legislative session _ Texas lawmakers are more apt to return it to
the taxpayers or spend it on education than funnel it to health and
housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative pressure was to do a tax cut,'' said Coleman.
``Many times we make the budget fit through health and human
services.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S STATISTICS IN QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   So will Gore's rankings hurt Bush politically?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, being governor of Texas is not the same as being
governor of New Hampshire. Texas faces challenges that most other
states don't. It is diverse, with a rapidly growing population that
includes a large number of immigrants. It must deal with abject
poverty in its border region, and it has vast rural areas that are
difficult and expensive to serve.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, says attempts to boost social
services money usually meet political resistance because ``it's
always a big number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a minor change is a big number when you talk about a
state this big with this much poverty,'' Maxey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan says Gore is ``attacking and
distorting the governor's record in Texas.'' Many Bush supporters
question the numbers themselves _ particularly because some of the
statistics come from groups with a liberal political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in public life long enough to know that when someone
quotes statistics such as Texas ranks very low as far as its hunger
rate, I quickly in my own mind think, 'Who the heck determined
that? How does anyone go out and count hungry people?''' Ratliff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is possible to measure hunger. But some of the
rankings touted by Gore do seem to be open to manipulation. For
example, he has cited a study that named Texas the ``third-worst
place to raise a child'' _ but what factors should be part of that
ranking?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the numbers, particularly the health-care numbers, are
more difficult to dismiss. As Bush rolls out his presidential
health-care proposals, Gore will continue to accuse the governor of
doing little to improve health care in his own state. In five
years, Bush has given two speeches on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore attempts to drag down Bush by touting statistics
that portray Texas as some kind of third-world backwater, he'd be
wise to remember 1992, the last time a governor ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Because if there's one state that does worse than Texas is the
rankings game, it's Arkansas.

BRUISING RIDE AWAITS TOLEDO IN RUNOFF AGAINST FUJIMORI 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ A glance at Lima's pro-government tabloids last
week offered a glimpse of the bruising free-for-all that awaits
Alejandro Toledo when he tries to unseat President Alberto Fujimori
in a runoff election in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper ran a cartoon depicting Toledo, a former World
Bank economist, covered with snakes. Bold black headlines in
another proclaimed, ``Toledo the Liar.'' And still another claimed
that the former World Bank economist ``wants to send us all to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Although several opinion polls indicated that Toledo is running
neck and neck with Fujimori, who is seeking a third straight
five-year term, analysts say that Toledo must brace himself for a
high-octane, dirty-tricks campaign from the man who has built a
political dynasty in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, independent election monitors, foreign diplomats
and Peruvian political analysts are all demanding a level playing
field for the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   They are calling on the incumbent to agree to an overhaul of the
nation's election process. But there's not much time. The vote will
be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just firing some electoral officials won't be enough,'' said
Eduardo Stein, who heads a team of Organization of American States
electoral observers. ``This requires reconstructive surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, government ombudsman Jorge Santistevan offered a list
of suggestions, ranging from equal TV time for both candidates to a
housecleaning at the much criticized National Electoral Office, the
government agency that oversees the voting and ballot counting.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it take the election office four days to tabulate
last Sunday's results, critics point out, but several of its
members were implicated in a scheme to falsify more than 1 million
signatures allegedly used to get Fujimori's name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electoral office is in ruins,'' said one observer,
sociologist Julio Cotler.
</P>
<P>
   According to ombudsman Santistevan, the runoff ``has to be the
total opposite of what happened during the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to last Sunday's ballot, opponents and monitors say, the
Fujimori government engineered a partial TV blackout of opposition
candidates, unleashed a smear campaign in the tabloids and
mobilized vast state resources on behalf of the president.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, critics say, it ignored reports by the OAS and
other monitoring groups that a deeply flawed election was being
mounted.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Fujimori, 61, has been called Latin
America's most successful president _ and one of its most
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1990, he was credited with defeating the
Shining Path guerrilla movement and engineering an economic
turnaround. Re-elected by a landslide in 1995, he spent much of his
second term concentrating powers in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of the Congress, a rubber-stamp body for the
president, and the courts, Fujimori managed to skirt a
constitutional ban on sitting presidents running for three
consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
   But in last Sunday's first round, Fujimori failed to win a
majority of the vote. He received 49.84 percent, according to the
official count, compared with Toledo's 40.31 percent. Seven others
divided the rest of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori's people say that while their man did not go over
the top, he remains a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic and incredible that after 10 years in power,
Fujimori beats the entire opposition with almost 50 percent,'' said
Ricardo Marcenaro, the vice president of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, though, represents the biggest political threat that
Fujimori has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger was born into a working-class family 54 years
ago. As a child, he worked as a shoeshine boy to help his family
make ends meet. He did well as a student and eventually won
scholarships to a prestigious high school in Peru, then to Stanford
University in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With his indigenous background, he appealed to millions of
down-and-out Peruvians, many of whom are Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toledo's support has grown spectacularly,'' said political
scientist Joanna Drzewieniecki. ``Many people _ half the population
_ will stand behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such support, she said, puts the challenger in a much stronger
position to demand quick reforms in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, on the other hand, finds himself in a vulnerable
position, Drzewieniecki said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Fujimori and his followers ``are all trying to
pretend that nothing happened but a great deal has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that, in the short term, it
will be difficult to reform the election office and other electoral
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that some changes can be made, such as opening up
the airways to opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leveling the playing field means giving the opposition every
opportunity to take their case to the voters,'' he said. ``We think
there is plenty of time to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Toledo appears only sporadically on broadcast TV
stations, several of which are vulnerable to pressure from
Fujimori's government because of their outstanding tax debts.
</P>
<P>
   Only one small cable channel has provided extensive coverage of
Toledo's press conferences and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, a political science professor at Emory University
in Atlanta, said Fujimori seems to have been caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2000, the issue is change and Fujimori hasn't yet woken up
to that,'' Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   For Peruvians, he added, the issue ``is no longer can we elect
someone who can take on terrorists and fix the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether they will retain democracy or descend
into a new form of authoritarianism.''

 &HT;    Bush and Gore camps dispute polling dataBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week, while Al Gore was touting numbers he
believes show that George W. Bush is an under-achieving governor
who never should be president, the Bush campaign was shopping
numbers they believe indicate Gore never will be president.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded meeting room at Bush's downtown headquarters, top
campaign advisers endeavored to make their case by projecting their
survey of recent surveys onto a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very problematic for Al Gore,'' said a Bush staffer who,
under the ground rules of the event, can be identified only as a
``senior Bush adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers behind the rhetoric _ which forms the basis for the
Bush campaign strategy _ were compiled from the 27 polls published
since March 8, the Super Tuesday when Bush and Gore effectively
clinched the nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the ``pen and pad briefing'' was to counter
conventional wisdom that says Bush emerged battered and scarred
from his primary battle with Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was fueled by a Pew Research Center poll in
mid-March that declared Bush a primary season winner who lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore was clearly helped, and George W. Bush was just as
clearly hurt,'' the Pew Research Center said in its conclusions,
adding ``many people have come to dislike Bush personally,
especially former supporters of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire, said the Bush advisers armed with data from the
post-Super Tuesday polls. Though the results of many are within the
margin of error, the Bush officials are eager to note that Gore led
in only five of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is even more eager to note that Gore led in only
two of the 18 polls taken since March 14, the day both candidates
mathematically clinched nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And even more importantly, the Bush folks like what they see in
the trend. In the nine polls from March 8-13, Bush's average lead
was 1.4 percentage points. In the seven polls in April, the lead
had grown to 5.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we indicating the race is over? No,'' said a senior Bush
adviser. ``But there are a couple of things. There is a durability
that is pretty shocking. Second of all there is a consistency to it
that is pretty dramatic. There is a trend line here that is
positive for us and ought to be troubling for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gore headquarters in Nashville, there were no outward signs
of concern. Communications Director Kathleen Begala scoffed at
anyone who would read too much into springtime polls for a fall
election. Begala said polling data shows her guy prevails on the
issues likely to move votes this year _ education, health care and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at those issues. Al Gore is right and George W.
Bush is wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that many of the horse-race polls show a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The most important caveat about horse-race polls is the fact
that the presidential race is only tangentially about popular
votes. It's electoral votes that count.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is now working off a map, based on the most
recent state-by-state polls, that shows their candidate winning 280
electoral votes, 10 more than needed for victory. Gore leads in
states with 190 electoral votes, with toss-up states accounting for
68 more.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush advisers are not banking on the polls as irrefutable
evidence of pending victory, they are using the numbers to craft
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key point is that clearly Gore wants us to be involved in
a daily tit for tat that clearly deteriorates in quality and
increases in quantity. They want us to be in a mudbath where we're
tossing stuff at each other each day . . . that is making us look
like Gore and we're just another politician who won't bring about a
total change in Washington D.C.,'' said a top Bush adviser.

U.S. PUT PRESSURE ON PERU TO ANNOUNCE RUNOFF 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Huge anti-government protests at home and stinging
criticism from abroad may have played a key role in last week's
dramatic announcement by Peru's government that President Alberto
Fujimori will stand in a runoff election, according to analysts and
election monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials denied charges from opposition politicians
that they had discussed tampering with the returns cast during the
April 9 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But during the four days it took to count the ballots,
Fujimori's official vote total teetered on the verge of topping 50
percent _ the amount required to win without having to stand in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that the slow vote count was intentional
and that it gave Fujimori time to test the political winds. If the
outcry was muted, they said, the president would have claimed to
have won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   However, a handful of independent exit polls and ballot surveys
all indicated that Fujimori won just 48 percent of the vote _ short
of the 50 percent needed to declare outright victory over a field
of eight opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That information _ plus growing evidence of election-day
irregularities _ prompted U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the Organization of American States and European
diplomats to warn Fujimori in public that they expected a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress went so far as to pass a resolution raising
the possibility of an aid cutoff if Fujimori cooked the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to doctor the data, all they would have needed
was a small push,'' said a senior electoral observer who asked not
to be named. But, he added, ``there was such a formidable network
of pressure (on the Fujimori government) that it, in effect,
prevented something like that from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   After the polls closed, anti-government demonstrations mounted
with thousands of Toledo supporters eventually taking to the
streets in Lima and several other Peruvian cities to demand a fair
vote count.
</P>
<P>
   According to Daniel Mora, a former Peruvian army general and now
an opposition politician, electoral officials were artificially
inflating Fujimori's vote count, little by little, in order to test
the reaction of Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more than one million people mobilized,'' Mora said. ``For
any government, that's a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, election authorities announced that Fujimori's final
tally stood at 49.84 percent and declared that he would face a
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they announced a second round was a political
decision rather than a decision based on the actual vote count,''
said Joanna Drzewieniecki, a U.S.-born political scientist based in
Lima.

 &HT;    Bow-tied anchor of CBS Sunday A.M. news program is an affable
everyman
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walk down a street in Midtown Manhattan with Charles
Osgood, and you see smiles. Not stares, not whispers, not snickers
... smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood returns each one in kind. As the veteran broadcaster
strolls down West 57th Street on a mild spring afternoon, near the
anonymous building where he anchors CBS News' ever-classy ``Sunday
Morning,'' a man at a fruit stand nods to him pleasantly and Osgood
replies, in his mellow baritone, ``How are ya?'' And it's
impossible to tell whether the grocer is acknowledging Osgood as a
celebrity _ known 'round the world from the TV newsmagazine and his
``Osgood File'' on CBS radio _ or simply recalls him as the fellow
who, say, bought a newspaper and a navel orange from him last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the genius of Charles Osgood, broadcasting's most regular
guy. Every ``Sunday Morning,'' when he smiles into the camera with
his bow tie and mischievously arched eyebrow, and speaks through
vocal cords that sound as if they've been warmed with Irish coffee,
the 66-year-old brings to mind the hearty favorite uncle who used
to come to your house for holiday dinners. The uncle with the
stories to tell. Whether Osgood narrates his own ``Sunday Morning''
report or introduces another reporter's segment (he edits them all,
deftly), or delivers an ``Osgood File'' or one of his celebrated
poems on TV or radio, he's above all a storyteller. Osgood
convinces you so completely that he's telling the tale to you, now
_ as you stew in traffic, dress for church _ that you forget about
all the people at that moment who feel exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood binds America together in a million tiny audiences of
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about Charlie without using the word
`comfortable,''' says ``SM'' reporter Bill Geist, ``but he's more
than that. There's a sophisticated man under those little poems.
There's wit. Integrity. Charlie never hypes you or tries to sell
you any snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Rand Morrison adds: ``What you see on the
screen is exactly what you get with Charlie. Working with him is
beyond joy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Having lunch with him is pretty good, too. Osgood chooses a
quiet, unassuming French bistro a few blocks from the studio _ an
``old CBS haunt'' _ and recalls seeing Mike Wallace and Harry
Reasoner there at their ease. Osgood looks like a man who enjoys a
good meal, and does not disappoint. Pitching into a plate of calf
liver and onions with a glass of cabernet (no bean sprouts and
sparkling water for this celeb) he recounts an undying love affair
with radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember this, but my mother tells me that when I was
barely old enough to talk, I used to walk around the house banging
a frying pan and singing the theme song from `Omar the Mystic,' a
popular radio show of the time,'' says the New York native.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's first assignment as a reporter for ABC radio in New
York was a nightmare: interviewing Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr.
after the 1962 Paris air crash that killed dozens of Atlanta arts
patrons. Allen got on the phone and calmly began asking technical
questions about what kind of tape equipment the cub reporter would
use, etc. Finally, after a countdown, Allen went on-the-record with
a lightning switch to a tragic mood. Osgood relishes imitating the
mayor's bombastic tones: ``My heart ... is heavy ... tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   When Osgood started making up humorous rhymes to comment on the
news, at New York's ``Newsradio 88'' in the 1960s, an order came
from CBS chairman William Paley: ``Send me a tape of Osgood's
poem.'' The station's news director was so rattled at the presumed
displeasure of the big boss that whenever such a memo arrived, he'd
cancel Osgood's remaining segments for the day, even though it
always turned out that Paley loved the poems.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps to explain why Osgood rose to become a CBS star in
the 1970s, anchoring weekend newscasts on TV but spending more of
his time on radio. Even now he describes himself as ``a radio guy
who finally stopped being terrified of the camera.'' He produces
four ``Osgood Files,'' brief but entertaining, per day. Phil Chin,
his producer for more than 20 years, pulls story ideas off the wire
services and the Internet in the evenings and faxes them to Osgood
at his New Jersey home so that he can see them when he rises at
2:30 a.m. He gets to the studio at 4 and starts writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never fails to amaze me how that writing shines every
day,'' Chin says. ``Once, I gave him an idea about people mistaking
eye drops for glue, and Charles whipped up a poem with the phrase,
`Old Glue Eyes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since he also prepares ``Sunday Morning'' segments late in the
week and goes on the air live Sundays, it makes for a punishing
schedule. The payoff, Osgood says, is plenty of time at his
vacation home on the French Riviera, but even there he tapes radio
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I wear my bow tie at the mike,'' he cracks,
``and I tell them they'd be surprised what I don't wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood is proud that all five children he's raised with the
former Jean Crafton speak fluent French. Which is more than can be
said for Osgood pere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was in trouble the day I took my youngest son into a
French shop and he said, `Ehhhh, let me do the talking, Dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   While Osgood was still a rare sight on TV, in 1979 the network's
other Charles, Charles Kuralt, similarly beloved for his touch of
the poetic, helped launch CBS' ``Sunday Morning.'' It became one of
television's best magazines for feature stories _ certainly
commercial TV's best showcase for the arts. With its bracing
musical intro on classical horn, its visual signature of beaming
sun faces, ``Sunday Morning'' has the sunniest of dispositions but
plenty of hard news, too. It's an oasis of intelligence in a TV
landscape that's come to resemble Oz's description of the Tin
Woodman: a clinking, clanking collection of caliginous junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `60 Minutes' guys make all the money,'' ``SM'' reporter
Geist cracks, ``but we get all the time (the show is 90 minutes
long) to tell our stories, and that's another kind of gold.'' He's
joined by Rita Braver, Martha Teichner, Billy Taylor, John Leonard
and others in one of TV's finest reporter stables.
</P>
<P>
   When declining health forced Kuralt off his high anchor stool in
1994, ``There was a lot of consternation,'' Geist says. ``I mean,
would they hire Geraldo Rivera?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an immense relief when they brought in Charles Osgood,
and I say that personally because he and I share a sense of
humor,'' Geist continues. ``Evening newscasts avoid humor like the
plague. At `Sunday Morning,' we don't tell you about the latest
hatchet murder _ we like you to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Osgood had been named ``SM'' anchor that he
found out that Kuralt, who died in 1997, lobbied on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles was a very private man,'' Osgood says, on a day when
the papers carry news of the legal settlement between Kuralt's
widow and longtime Montana mistress over his estate. ``As much as
we respected his talent, I don't think any of us really knew him
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood cracks, ``Kuralt was a good predecessor for me _ not just
another pretty face.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, it's hard to imagine any other anchor donning the
Kuralt mantle as superbly as Osgood has done. He was lead reporter
in a show devoted entirely to the legacy of Ernest Hemingway, his
home in Cuba, the changes in that country. He visited a British pub
and played World War II-era songs so rousingly on the piano that
everyone came and sang along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even Osgood's narration of the sports highlights has his own
charming inflection (``There he goes again: slam-dunk!''), as if he
were on a small-town, low-watt station, bragging about the school
team to a few dozen of his neighbors. In an age where viewers' only
sense of ``community'' may be a subdivision behind locked gates,
Osgood is a great connector _ a rallying point for frayed nerves
and sagging optimism on a day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Geist says his only piece to be ``killed'' by Osgood was a
humorous take on O.J. Simpson, showing the editor's determination
to keep the show above the tide of TV tabloidization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no other show less pressured by ratings,'' Geist
declares. Still, ``SM's'' audience ``skews old'' in an industry
that lusts after ever-younger viewer flesh. Producer Morrison,
while cherishing ``the great traditions of the show,'' is making
gentle changes that he hopes ``will get us noticed more.'' One
couldn't help noticing that in a recent interview with Sophia
Loren, the Italian guest interviewer harped on the star's sex life
more than the show's regular correspondents would ever do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to get many teenagers tuning in at 9 a.m.
after a date night,'' Morrison says. ``But we may have a piece on
`body art' that brings in new viewers. We'll always have the great
piece on Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Osgood's final Sunday duty is to introduce the footage of
outdoor scenes, nature's beauty. Without inflicting any music or
narration (not even PBS is so generous), this hugely popular
segment leaves the viewer feeling restored by the chuckle of a
mountain stream, the eerie cry of an elk or the rustle of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to bring this real world into our homes than that
realest of hosts?
</P>
<P>
   Nudging his glass playfully back and forth across the tablecloth
_ so that the wine sloshes up to the lip but never quite out _
Osgood says, ``Most TV executives don't even hear what's being said
on the air. They look at their little monitors (he imitates them,
staring into space with mad-scientist intensity) and say, `Does it
have enough reds? Enough yellows? And is it moving?!'''
</P>
<P>
   He lets out a deep, ironic chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, `Sunday Morning' has beautiful pictures. The words
are pretty special, too. That's why we're a friend of the family.''

 &HT;    Hip-hop's contribution finding home in museums
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 16.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   True to hip-hop's origins in battles between competing artists,
there is not one group but two attempting to honor the music with a
hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, an organization in Manhattan formally introduced
itself as the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. Like the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon, it
plans to have annual induction ceremonies for artists before it
builds an actual museum.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Mayor Ernest Davis of Mount Vernon, N.Y., announced
that he is converting an old firehouse into a Hip-Hop Hall of Fame,
which will be unrelated to the Manhattan project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has been showing for
five months what it claims is the world's first major museum
exhibition on hip-hop culture. Through August, on three floors,
artifacts ranging from Run-DMC's signature hats, sunglasses and
Adidas sneakers to the handwritten lyrics of ``Tennessee'' by
Atlanta act Arrested Development will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   All of this for a genre that only turned 20 last year, when
pundits and fans alike marked the 1979 release of the first
commercial rap record, the Sugar Hill Gang's ``Rapper's Delight.''
It's a genre still very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hip-hop culture has a serious hold on American culture right
now,'' says Ramona DeBreaux, music director and midday announcer at
Atlanta hip-hop station Hot-97.5. ``To sell Pop-Tarts, people are
rapping. Sports network ESPN uses hip-hop terminology to talk about
sports. It's everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Chuck D, whose group Public Enemy brought blistering
politics to hip-hop and who contributed artifacts to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame's exhibit, thinks the recognition should have
come a long time ago. Establishing an infrastructure to recognize
hip-hop and chronicle its evolution is important: ``I wish the two
places in New York would put their heads together and consolidate
and maybe have branches all over,'' says the Atlanta resident.
``But there's more than 20 years of recorded hip-hop _ yeah, give
it the respect that it's due.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Manhattan, the spokesman for the ``official'' Hip-Hop
Hall of Fame says it will have its first induction ceremony of
artists _ voted on by fans _ by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard about other people with ideas,'' says Steven
Burns, ``but we own the rights to the name _ lock, stock and
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this is a big world,'' said Davis, who wants his museum,
which he expects to be under construction for a year, to be a
combination hall of fame, history exhibit and job training center.
``But we are the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound like fighting words?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounds like hip-hop.

MEMORIAL MAY GIVE OKLAHOMA CITY A NEW IMAGE 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The deadly April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Building followed by last year's devastating tornadoes have
left an image of Oklahoma City as a smoking ruin inhabited by a
doomed population.
</P>
<P>
   It is an image many in the city are itching to shed.
</P>
<P>
   ```We hope to be known someday for something other than
suffering,'' says Mayor Kirk Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   That day may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since terrorism put Oklahoma City in the public
eye, a massive infusion of federal recovery funds has turned a
section of downtown that was dying, even before the bombing, into a
neighborhood on the mend. The bomb, packed into a rental truck and
parked outside the federal building, killed 168 people, including
19 children, and mortified the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they were grieving, bombing survivors and family members
of the dead began planning a memorial at the site of the blast. The
project that some local business leaders feared would turn the area
into a tomb is, instead, a peaceful village green with water
running through it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the fifth anniversary of the bombing, families,
survivors, rescue workers and the rest of the city will dedicate
the Symbolic Memorial. An international conference on mitigating
terrorism will be held Monday in advance of the dedication. An
explanatory museum is scheduled to open adjacent to the memorial in
November. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Only a few blocks away from the memorial, which was built by a
private foundation, city tax dollars have funded a minor-league
baseball park and, of all things, a canal with paddleboats in a
thriving entertainment zone called ``Bricktown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view the memorial as a negative,'' Humphries said.
``It changes our traffic patterns (the memorial spans a section of
what was Fifth Street.) But how could you take that strip of land
where the truck sat and use it as a street?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we view it as a negative to be known as the place where so
many people suffered? I don't think so,'' Humphries said. ``We
didn't choose it, we certainly wouldn't want it if we had a choice,
but it is who we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it changed us, but it did reveal us,'' Humphries
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb blew the front face off the federal building, it
also devastated block after block of surrounding businesses to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wound up with three-quarters of a square mile that was just
a wasteland,'' Humphries said. ``I mean everyone moved out. We lost
the federal building, we lost the Journal Record Building, a pretty
large building, we lost the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what you lost was everything that supports that _ the dry
cleaners where they dropped their laundry off, the day-care
centers, the restaurants. We lost the whole fabric of life,''
Humphries said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the question comes, who will move in and take a chance?
Well, nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Claus, an outspoken Australian, took over as project
manager for the Murrah Revitalization Area in December 1996,
managing the distribution of federal reconstruction funds and
attempting to rekindle business in a neighborhood that was
struggling before the blast. Being an outsider helped him cut
through the emotion that local residents couldn't help but bring to
the table, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, $52.5 million in federal funds has been spent
rebuilding the area damaged by the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses destroyed by the blast were marginal, he said,
and many of those couldn't rebuild even with federal aid. People
are still significantly disturbed by the blast and the place where
it happened, Claus said, and redevelopment still suffers for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past five years, the country has been going
gangbusters, but this area has lost those five years because we
couldn't do anything until the memorial was completed,'' Claus
said. Some businesses were hesitant to try the area because they
weren't sure of the tone the memorial would set, others were
worried about the street closure.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor notes that the location of a new federal campus to
regroup the agencies forced to relocate after the Murrah Building
blast is still a missing piece of the redevelopment puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some concern on the part of many of those agencies
about moving back downtown,'' Humphries said. ``Some people (say)
hey, we're happy where we are now. Some people don't want to come
back because it will bring back bad memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The agencies once housed in the Murrah Building, including the
credit union and Social Security offices where so many of the
victims died, moved into whatever space they could find at the time
_ many finding offices in suburban strip centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's important to the city that we have this new federal
campus that will be about two blocks north of where the Murrah
Building was,'' Humphries said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Administration has the authority to force
the agencies to move into the new campus, ``but that's not our
goal,'' said regional GSA spokesman George Hozendorf. The GSA finds
itself caught between the reluctance of the federal workers, and
the determination of Congress and President Clinton to create a
symbol of resilience in the face of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the memorial is nearing completion, Claus thinks
potential private investors will be pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process is a difficult balancing act,'' Claus said,
``because at the one time you want to retain the sense of respect
that relates to the site, and at the same time there's the
pragmatic reality that they're expecting to draw between 300,000
and 500,000 people a year. We can look at this as people who go
just to that site and leave, as they have so far, or we can say ...
you've come to this site, here's other things in Oklahoma City you
may be interested in looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would be remiss if we didn't use that
opportunity,'' Claus said.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts if the memorial foundation, which gets kid-glove
treatment from the rest of the city, will have any objections if
the private sector elects to build, for example, restaurants around
the memorial to serve its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more concerned with blatant disrespect _ selling
trinkets, and the like,'' Claus said. ``I don't believe that will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't design it for tourism, but we certainly designed it
for people to come,'' said foundation director Kari Ferguson
Watkins. ``We don't use the word tourism, because we don't have to.
It's a historic site.''
</P>
<P>
   The local convention and visitor's bureau has a link to
information on the memorial on it's Web site, www.okccvb.org.
</P>
<P>
   It's clearly an attraction, but spokeswoman Sandy Pantlik makes
it clear she's treading cautiously. ``You're exactly right. It's a
fine line,'' Pantlik said. ``We're very sensitive to the victims
and the survivors.'' The best solution they've found is to provide
information about the memorial when it's requested, Pantlik said,
and there are no shortage of requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they'll find is it's no longer a hole. There's
a beautiful, symbolic memorial there,'' Pantlik said. And the
dedication of the memorial comes as Pantlik's agency is
aggressively trying to promote Oklahoma City as a whole new town,
promoting instead the new ballpark and overt tourist attractions in
Bricktown.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to redevelop downtown actually began before the
bombing, with a locally funded project known as ``MAPS'' that was
approved by voters in 1993. The mayor attributes the resurgence of
downtown to that effort and not the federal funding and national
attention that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about benefits,'' Humphries said, shaking his
head vigorously. ``People want to ask me the question, `Well, in
the long run will this be good for you?' You just can't go there.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 350,000 people a year have been coming to see the
site of the bombing for the past five years, Humphries said. People
who don't know he is the mayor routinely stop him in the street to
ask where it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is, how do they find it? How do they find
restaurants if they want it?'' Humphries asked, rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view it as crass commercialism if we give them what
they're looking for.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly five decades, America's role in the military coup
that ousted Iran's elected prime minister and returned the shah to
power has been lost to history, the subject of fierce debate in
Iran and stony silence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, participants have retired or died without revealing
key details, and the Central Intelligence Agency said a number of
records of the operation _ its first successful overthrow of a
foreign government _ had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But a copy of the CIA's secret history of the coup has surfaced,
revealing the inner workings of a plot that set the stage for the
Islamic revolution in 1979, and for a generation of anti-American
hatred in one of the Middle East's most powerful countries.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which remains classified, discloses the pivotal
role that British intelligence officials played in initiating and
planning the coup, and it shows that Washington and London shared
an interest in maintaining the West's control over Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, written by the CIA's chief coup planner and
obtained by The New York Times, says the operation's success was
mostly a matter of chance. The document shows that the CIA had
almost complete contempt for the man it was empowering, Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, whom it derided as a vacillating coward. And
it recounts, for the first time, the agency's tortured efforts to
seduce and cajole the shah into taking part in his own coup.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, code-named TP-Ajax, was the blueprint for a
succession of CIA plots to foment coups and destabilize governments
_ including the agency's successful coup in Guatemala in 1954 and
the disastrous Cuban intervention known as the Bay of Pigs in 1961.
In more than one instance, such operations led to the same kind of
long-term animosity toward the United States that occurred in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The history says that CIA officers orchestrating the Iran coup
worked directly with royalist Iranian military officers, handpicked
the prime minister's replacement, sent a stream of envoys to
bolster the shah's courage, directed a campaign of bombings by
Iranians posing as members of the Communist Party, and planted
articles and editorial cartoons in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night set for Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh's
overthrow, almost nothing went according to the meticulously drawn
plans, the secret history says. In fact, CIA officials were poised
to flee the country when several Iranian officers recruited by the
agency, acting on their own, took command of a pro-shah
demonstration in Tehran and seized the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the coup, the history discloses, CIA officials
funneled $5 million to Iran to help the government they had
installed consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the U.S. role in the coup were disclosed in Iran
at the outset and later in the memoirs of CIA officers and other
published accounts. But many specifics have remained classified,
and the secret history obtained by The New York Times is the first
detailed government account of the coup to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has been slow to make available the Iran files. Two
directors of central intelligence, Robert Gates and R. James
Woolsey, vowed to declassify records of the agency's early covert
actions, including the coup. But the agency said three years ago
that a number of relevant documents had been destroyed in the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA spokesman said Friday that the agency had retained about
1,000 pages of documents related to the coup, besides the history
and an internal account written later. He said the papers destroyed
in the early 1960s were duplicates and working files.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's chief historian said his office received
a copy of the history seven years ago but that no decision on
declassifying it had yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, along with operational assessments written
by coup planners, was provided to The Times by a former official
who kept a copy.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in March 1954 by Dr. Donald N. Wilber, an expert
in Persian architecture, who as one of the leading planners
believed that covert operatives had much to learn from history.
</P>
<P>
   In less expansive memoirs published in 1986, Wilber asserted
that the Iran coup was different from later CIA efforts. Its
American planners, he said, had stirred up considerable unrest in
Iran, giving Iranians a clear choice between instability and
supporting the shah. The move to oust the prime minister, he wrote,
thus gained substantial popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Wilber's memoirs were heavily censored by the CIA, but he was
allowed to refer to the existence of his secret history. ``If this
history had been read by the planners of the Bay of Pigs,'' he
wrote, ``there would have been no such operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time,'' he continued, ``I gave talks on the
operation to various groups within the agency, and, in hindsight,
one might wonder why no one from the Cuban desk ever came or read
the history.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup was a turning point in modern Iranian history and
remains a persistent irritant in Tehran-Washington relations. It
consolidated the power of the shah, who ruled with an iron hand for
another quarter century in close contact with to the United States.
In January 1979, he was toppled and driven from Iran in a
revolution led by Islamic militants. In November 1979,
demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, took diplomats and
other embassy personnel hostage and declared that they had unmasked
a ``nest of spies'' who had been manipulating Iran for decades. The
hostages were held for more than 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini supported
terrorist attacks against U.S. interests largely because of the
long U.S. history of supporting the shah. Even under more moderate
rulers, many Iranians still resent the United States' role in the
coup and its support of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in an address in March,
acknowledged the coup's pivotal role in the troubled relationship
and came closer to apologizing than any U.S. official ever has
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were
justified for strategic reasons,'' she said. ``But the coup was
clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is easy
to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention
by America in their internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The history spells out the calculations to which Albright
referred in her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, it says, initiated the plot in 1952. The administration
of President Harry Truman rejected it, but President Dwight D.
Eisenhower approved it shortly after taking office in 1953, because
of fears about oil and communism.
</P>
<P>
   The document pulls few punches, acknowledging at one point that
the CIA baldly lied to its British allies. Wilber reserves his most
withering asides for the CIA's local allies, referring to ``the
recognized incapacity of Iranians to plan or act in a thoroughly
logical manner.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE ROOTS: Britain Fights Oil Nationalism
</P>
<P>
   The coup had its roots in a British showdown with Iran, restive
under decades of near-colonial British domination.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was Iran's oil fields. Britain occupied Iran in World
War II to protect a supply route to its ally, the Soviet Union, and
to prevent the oil from falling into the hands of the Nazis _
ousting the shah's father, Reza Shah, whom it regarded as
unmanageable. It retained control over Iran's oil after the war
through Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Iran's Parliament voted to nationalize the oil
industry, and legislators backing the law elected its leading
advocate, Mossadegh, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Britain responded with threats and sanctions. Mossadegh, a
European-educated lawyer then in his early 70s, prone to tears and
outbursts, refused to back down. In meetings in November and
December 1952, the secret history says, British intelligence
officials startled their U.S. counterparts with a plan for a joint
operation to oust the nettlesome prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who ``had not intended to discuss this question
at all,'' agreed to study it, the secret history says. It had
attractions. Anti-communism had risen to a fever pitch in
Washington, and officials were worried that Iran might fall under
the sway of the Soviet Union, a historical presence there.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1953, an unexpected development pushed the plot
forward: the CIA's Tehran station reported that an Iranian general
had approached the U.S. Embassy about supporting an army-led coup.
</P>
<P>
   The newly inaugurated Eisenhower administration was intrigued.
The coalition that elected Mossadegh was splintering, and the
Iranian Communist Party, the Tudeh, had become active.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence,
approved $1 million to be used ``in any way that would bring about
the fall of Mossadegh,'' the history says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim was to bring to power a government which would reach
an equitable oil settlement, enabling Iran to become economically
sound and financially solvent, and which would vigorously prosecute
the dangerously strong Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, CIA officials identified a high-ranking officer,
Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, as the man to spearhead a coup. Their plan
called for the shah to play a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shah-General Zahedi combination, supported by CIA local
assets and financial backing, would have a good chance of
overthrowing Mossadegh,'' officials wrote, ``particularly if this
combination should be able to get the largest mobs in the streets
and if a sizable portion of the Tehran garrison refused to carry
out Mossadegh's orders.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the history, planners had doubts about whether
the shah could carry out such a bold operation.
</P>
<P>
   His family had seized Iran's throne just 32 years earlier, when
his powerful father had led a coup of his own. But the young shah,
CIA officials wrote, was ``by nature a creature of indecision,
beset by formless doubts and fears,'' often at odds with his
family, including Princess Ashraf, his ``forceful and scheming twin
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the shah had what the CIA termed a ``pathological fear''
of British intrigues, a potential obstacle to a joint operation.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1953 the CIA sent Wilber to Cyprus to meet Norman
Darbyshire, chief of the Iran branch of British intelligence, to
make initial coup plans. Assuaging the fears of the shah was high
on their agenda; a document from the meeting said he was to be
convinced that the United States and Britain ``consider the oil
question secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation at the meeting turned to a touchy subject, the
identity of key agents inside Iran. The British said they had
recruited two brothers named Rashidian. The Americans, the secret
history discloses, did not trust the British and lied about the
identity of their best ``assets'' inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials were divided over whether the plan drawn up in
Cyprus could work. The Tehran station warned headquarters that the
``the shah would not act decisively against Mossadegh.'' And it
said Zahedi, the man picked to lead the coup, ``appeared lacking in
drive, energy and concrete plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doubts, the agency's Tehran station began
disseminating ``gray propaganda,'' passing out anti-Mossadegh
cartoons in the streets and planting unflattering articles in the
local press.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOTTING: Trying to Persuade a Reluctant Shah
</P>
<P>
   The plot was under way, even though the shah was a reluctant
warrior and Eisenhower had yet to give his final approval.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, U.S. and British intelligence officials met
again, this time in Beirut, Lebanon, and put the finishing touches
on the strategy. Soon afterward, the chief of the CIA's Near East
and Africa division, Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore
Roosevelt, arrived in Tehran to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   The shah was a problem from the start. The plan called for him
to stand fast as the CIA stirred up popular unrest and then, as the
country lurched toward chaos, to issue royal decrees dismissing
Mossadegh and appointing Zahedi prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA sought to ``produce such pressure on the shah that it
would be easier for him to sign the papers required of him than it
would be to refuse,'' the secret history states. Officials turned
to his sister for help.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, President Eisenhower finally signed off on the plan.
At about the same time, CIA and British intelligence officers
visited Princess Ashraf on the French Riviera and persuaded her to
return to Iran and tell her brother to follow the script.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the unpopular princess unleashed a storm of
protest from pro-Mossadegh forces. The shah was furious that she
had come back without his approval and refused at first to see her.
But a palace staff member _ another British agent, according to the
secret history _ gained Ashraf access on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   The history does not reveal what the siblings said to each
other. But the princess gave her brother the news that CIA
officials had enlisted Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf in the coup
campaign. Schwarzkopf, the father of the Persian Gulf war
commander, had befriended the shah a decade earlier while leading
the U.S. military mission to Iran, and he told the CIA ``he was
sure he could get the required cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The British, too, sought to sway the shah and assure him their
agents spoke for London. A British agent, Asadollah Rashidian,
approached him in late July and invited him to select a phrase that
would then be broadcast at prearranged times on the BBC's
Persian-language program _ as proof that Rashidian spoke for the
British.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise did not seem to have much effect. The shah told
Rashidian on July 30 and 31 that he had heard the broadcast, but
``requested time to assess the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the CIA stepped up the pressure. Iranian
operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders
with ``savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh,'' seeking to
stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one
prominent Muslim was bombed by CIA agents posing as Communists. It
does not say whether anyone was hurt in this attack.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was also intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading
newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, ``in
the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shah remained intransigent. In an Aug. 1 meeting with
Schwarzkopf, he refused to sign the CIA-written decrees firing
Mossadegh and appointing Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army
would support him in a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, the document says, the shah was so convinced
that the palace was bugged that he ``led the general into the grand
ballroom, pulled a small table to its exact center'' and got onto
it to talk, insisting that the general do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting was to be followed by a series of additional
ones, some between Roosevelt and the shah and some between
Rashidian and the shah, in which relentless pressure was exerted in
frustrating attempts to overcome an entrenched attitude of
vacillation and indecision,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh had by now figured out that there was a plot against
him. He moved to consolidate power by calling for a national
referendum to dissolve Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Aug. 4 referendum were clearly rigged in his
favor; The New York Times reported the same day that the prime
minister had won 99.9 percent of the vote. This only helped the
plotters, providing ``an issue on which Mossadegh could be
relentlessly attacked'' by the agency-backed opposition press.
</P>
<P>
   But the shah still wouldn't move against Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Aug. 3rd,'' the secret history says, ``Roosevelt had a long
and inconclusive session with the shah,'' who ``stated that he was
not an adventurer, and hence, could not take the chances of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt pointed out that there was no other way by which the
government could be changed and the test was now between Mossadegh
and his force and the shah and the army, which was still with him,
but which would soon slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt told the shah ``that failure to act could lead only to
a Communist Iran or to a second Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still haunted by doubts, the shah asked Roosevelt if Eisenhower
could tell him what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``By complete coincidence and great good fortune,'' the secret
history says, ``the president, while addressing the governors'
convention in Seattle on 4 August, deviated from his script to
state by implication that the United States would not sit by idly
and see Iran fall behind the Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 10, the shah had finally agreed to see Zahedi and a few
army officers involved in the plot, but still refused to sign the
decrees. The CIA then sent Rashidian to say Roosevelt ``would leave
in complete disgust unless the shah took action within a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The shah finally signed the decrees on Aug. 13. Word that he
would support an army-led coup spread rapidly among the army
officers backing Zahedi.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE COUP: First Few Days Look Disastrous
</P>
<P>
   The coup began on the night of Aug. 15 and was immediately
compromised by a talkative Iranian army officer whose remarks were
relayed to Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, the secret history says, ``still might have
succeeded in spite of this advance warning had not most of the
participants proved to be inept or lacking in decision at the
critical juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh's chief of staff, Gen. Taghi Riahi, learned of the
plot hours before it was to begin and sent his deputy to the
barracks of the Imperial Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy was arrested there, according to the history, just as
pro-shah soldiers were fanning out across the city arresting other
senior officials. Telephone lines between army and government
offices were cut, and the telephone exchange was occupied.
</P>
<P>
   But phones inexplicably continued to function, which gave
Mossadegh's forces a key advantage. Riahi also eluded the pro-shah
units, rallying commanders to the prime minister's side.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-shah soldiers sent to arrest Mossadegh at his home were
instead captured. The top military officer working with Zahedi fled
when he saw tanks and loyal government soldiers at army
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the history states, the Tehran radio announced
that a coup against the government had failed, and Mossadegh
scrambled to strengthen his hold on the army and key installations.
CIA officers inside the embassy were flying blind; the history says
they had ``no way of knowing what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt left the embassy and tracked down Zahedi, who was in
hiding north of Tehran. Surprisingly, the general was not ready to
abandon the operation. The coup, the two men agreed, could still
work, provided they could persuade the public that Zahedi was the
lawful prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, the history discloses, the coup plotters had
to get out the news that the shah had signed the two decrees.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station in Tehran sent a message to The Associated Press
in New York, asserting that ``unofficial reports are current to the
effect that leaders of the plot are armed with two decrees of the
shah, one dismissing Mossadegh and the other appointing Zahedi to
replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and its agents also arranged for the decrees to be
mentioned in some Tehran papers, the history says.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda initiative quickly bogged down. Many of the CIA's
Iranian agents were under arrest or on the run. That afternoon,
agency operatives prepared a statement from Zahedi that they hoped
to distribute publicly. But they could not find a printing press
that was not being watched by forces loyal to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, prospects of reviving the operation were dealt a
seemingly a fatal blow when it was learned that the shah had bolted
to Baghdad, Iraq. CIA headquarters cabled Tehran urging Roosevelt,
the station chief, to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He did not agree, insisting that there was still ``a slight
remaining chance of success,'' if the shah would broadcast an
address on the Baghdad radio and Zahedi took an aggressive stand.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the tide might turn came with reports that
Iranian soldiers had broken up Tudeh, or Communist, groups, beating
them and making them chant their support for the shah. ``The
station continued to feel that the project was not quite dead,''
the secret history recounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mossadegh had overreached, playing into the CIA's
hands by dissolving Parliament after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 17 the shah finally announced from
Baghdad that he had signed the decrees _ though he had by now
delayed so long that plotters feared it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical point Mossadegh let down his guard. Lulled by
the shah's departure and the arrests of some officers involved in
the coup, the government recalled most troops it had stationed
around the city, believing that the danger had passed.
</P>
<P>
   That night the CIA arranged for Zahedi and other key Iranian
agents and army officers to be smuggled into the embassy compound
``in the bottom of cars and in closed jeeps'' for a ``council of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to start a counterattack on Aug. 19, sending a
leading cleric from Tehran to the holy city of Qum to try to
orchestrate a call for a holy war against communism. (The religious
forces they were trying to manipulate would years later call the
United States ``the Great Satan.'')
</P>
<P>
   Using travel papers forged by the CIA, key army officers went to
outlying army garrisons to persuade commanders to join the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the shah disappointed the CIA. He left Baghdad for
Rome the next day, apparently an exile. Newspapers supporting
Mossadegh reported that the Pahlevi dynasty had come to an end, and
a statement from the Communist Party's central committee attributed
the coup attempt to ``Anglo-American intrigue.'' Demonstrators
ripped down imperial statues _ as they would again 26 years later
during the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station cabled headquarters for advice on whether to
``continue with TP-Ajax or withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Headquarters spent a day featured by depression and despair,''
the history states, adding, ``The message sent to Tehran on the
night of Aug. 18 said that `the operation has been tried and
failed,' and that `in the absence of strong recommendations to the
contrary operations against Mossadegh should be discontinued.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE SUCCESS: The CIA and Moscow Are Both Surprised
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Americans were ready to quit, the mood on the
streets of Tehran shifted.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 19, several Tehran papers published the
shah's long-awaited decrees, and soon pro-shah crowds were building
in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed only leadership,'' the secret history says. And
Iranian agents of the CIA provided it. Without specific orders, a
journalist who was one of the agency's most important Iranian
agents led a crowd toward Parliament, inciting people to set fire
to the offices of a newspaper owned by Mossadegh's foreign
minister. Another Iranian CIA agent led a crowd to sack the offices
of pro-Tudeh papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news that something quite startling was happening spread
at great speed throughout the city,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA tried to exploit the situation, sending urgent messages
that the Rashidian brothers and two key U.S. agents should ``swing
the security forces to the side of the demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
   But things were now moving far too quickly for the agency to
manage. An Iranian army colonel who had been involved in the plot
several days earlier suddenly appeared outside Parliament with a
tank, while members of the now-disbanded Imperial Guard seized
trucks and drove through the streets. ``By 10:15 there were
pro-shah truckloads of military personnel at all the main
squares,'' the secret history says.
</P>
<P>
   By noon the crowds began to receive direct leadership from a few
officers involved in the plot and some who had switched sides.
Within an hour the central telegraph office fell, and telegrams
were sent to the provinces urging a pro-shah uprising. After a
brief shootout, police headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs fell as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Tehran radio remained the biggest prize. With the
government's fate uncertain, it was broadcasting a program on
cotton prices. But by early afternoon a mass of civilians, army
officers and policemen overwhelmed it. Pro-shah speakers went on
the air, broadcasting the coup's success and reading the royal
decrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stream of eager speakers came to the microphone,'' the
history relates. ``Some represented elements upon whom reliance had
been placed in TP-AJAX planning, while others were quite unknown to
the station.''
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy, CIA officers were elated, and Roosevelt got
Zahedi out of hiding. An army officer found a tank and drove him to
the radio station, where he spoke to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh and other government officials were rounded up, while
officers supporting Zahedi placed ``known supporters of TP-Ajax''
in command of all units of the Tehran garrison.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was caught completely off-guard. Even as the
Mossadegh government was falling, the Moscow radio was broadcasting
a story on ``the failure of the American adventure in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But CIA headquarters was as surprised as Moscow. When news of
the coup's success arrived, it ``seemed to be a bad joke, in view
of the depression that still hung on from the day before,'' the
history says.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Washington got most of its information from
news agencies, receiving only two cablegrams from the station.
Roosevelt later explained that if he had told headquarters what was
going on, ``London and Washington would have thought they were
crazy and told them to stop immediately,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA took full credit inside the government. The
following year it overthrew the government of Guatemala, and a myth
developed that the agency could topple governments anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran proved that Third World king-making could be heady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day that should never have ended,'' the CIA's secret
history said, describing Aug. 19, 1953. ``For it carried with it
such a sense of excitement, of satisfaction and of jubilation that
it is doubtful whether any other can come up to it.''

MOSSADEGH: ECCENTRIC NATIONALIST BEGETS STRANGE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is a sidebar with IRAN-SHAH. Other sidebars are
IRAN-PRESS and IRAN-WILBER.)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, father of its
revolution, no leader has left a deeper mark on Iran's 20th century
landscape than Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh. And no 20th century event
has fueled Iran's suspicion of the United States as his overthrow
has.
</P>
<P>
   An eccentric European-educated lawyer whose father was a
bureaucrat and whose mother was descended from Persian kings,
Mossadegh served as a minister and governor before he opposed Reza
Shah's accession in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   He was imprisoned and then put under house arrest at his estate
in the walled village of Ahmadabad west of Tehran. Eventually he
bought the village, growing crops, founding an elementary school
and beginning a public health project.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain and the Soviet Union forced Reza Shah from power in
favor of his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, in 1941, Mossadegh became
a member of Parliament. He was hailed as a hero for his fiery
speeches on the evils of British control of Iran's oil industry. In
1951, when Parliament voted to nationalize the industry, the young
shah, recognizing the nationalists' popularity, appointed Mossadegh
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In that job he became a prisoner of his own nationalism, unable
to reach an oil compromise. Even as the British negotiated with
Iran, they won the support of the major oil companies in imposing
an effective global boycott on Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the developing world, Mossadegh became an icon of
anti-imperialism. He was revered despite his odd mannerisms, which
included conducting business in bed in gray woolen pajamas, weeping
publicly and complaining perpetually of poor health.
</P>
<P>
   He amassed power. When the shah refused his demand for control
of the armed forces in 1952, Mossadegh resigned, only to be
reinstated in the face of popular riots.
</P>
<P>
   He then displayed a streak of authoritarianism, bypassing
Parliament by conducting a national referendum to win approval for
its dissolution. Meanwhile, the United States became alarmed at the
strength of Iran's Communist Party, which supported Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1953, a dismissal attempt by the shah sent Mossadegh's
followers into the streets. The shah fled, amid fears in the new
Eisenhower administration that Iran might move too close to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mossadegh did not promote the interests of the Communists,
though he drew on their support. Paradoxically, the party turned
from him in the end because it viewed him as insufficiently
committed and too close to the United States. By the time the
royalist coup overthrew him after a few chaotic days, he had
alienated many landowners, clerics and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial, he served three years in prison and ended up
under house arrest at his estate. In March 1967, in his mid-80s and
weakened by radium treatments for throat cancer, he died.
</P>
<P>
   When the revolution brought the clerics to power in 1979,
anti-shah nationalists tried to revive Mossadegh's memory. A Tehran
thoroughfare called Pahlevi Avenue was renamed Mossadegh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Khomeini saw him as a promoter not of Islam but of Persian
nationalism, and envied his popularity. So Mossadegh Avenue became
Vali Asr, after the revered Hidden Imam, whose reappearance
someday, Shiite Muslims believe, will establish the perfect Islamic
political community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Khomeini was careful not to go too far. Ignoring
Mossadegh, rather than excoriating him, became the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the Mossadegh cult has been revitalized by
resurgent nationalism and frustration with the strictures of Islam.
Mossadegh inspires the young, who long for heroes and have not
necessarily found them, either in clerics or kings.
</P>
<P>
   In campaigns for local elections in February 1999 and
parliamentary elections a year later, reformist advertising made
use of Mossadegh's sad, elongated face. And every year since his
death, his supporters have rallied at his estate.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy still stirs considerable debate. In August,
Parliament approved a bill to abolish a holiday marking the
nationalization of the oil industry in 1951. The decision set off
protests in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alas! Parliament ignored the most apparent symbol of the
struggle of the Iranian people throughout history against
colonialism,'' the reformist daily Khordad said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, legislators were forced to reinstate the holiday.

LONG FEUD OVER LOS ANGELES TAX IS SETTLED
</HEADLINE>
 
 refiling c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of heated conflict, the union that
represents screenwriters and the city of Los Angeles have reached a
truce over imposing local taxes on writers, artists and other
self-employed people who work at home.
</P>
<P>
   The union, The Writers Guild of America, has dropped opposition
to state legislation, sought by Los Angeles, that would allow
cities to examine state tax records to find people who file as a
business entity but do not pay local business license taxes.
Although the legislation stops short of an outright exemption for
writers and artists, it contains language taking ``artistic or
literary capacity'' into consideration in deciding whether to
impose the local tax. The guild, which represents about 5,000 film
and television writers who live in Los Angeles, succeeded in having
a previous version of the bill killed in the state Senate last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The guild, which sought its own bill seeking an exemption, has
agreed to add a 20-point test to determine whether a person should
be subjected to the tax. The City Council voted this week to
withdraw its opposition to the legislation sought by the guild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that, in most circumstances, our members will
easily meet these tests, as will other artists and authors,'' said
Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the guild.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders have long said they were losing tax revenue _
perhaps $60 million a year _ from businesses that do not pay local
business license taxes, and they pursued legislation they believed
would enable them to catch scofflaws. But that plan immediately
became anathema to much of Los Angeles' creative community in the
mid-1990s when the city said it would include home-based
screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the city imposed a requirement that writers and
artists working at home pay $25 for a city permit. The rule was
quickly rescinded in the face of fierce opposition and an opinion
from the city attorney that it might be unconstitutional. But until
now, the battle has continued over whether creative employment
should be subject to the same local business license taxes as more
commercial pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   The guild, comparing the permit plan to systems used in
Communist countries to monitor writers, opposed the idea as an
infringement on the First Amendment, though some elected leaders
dismissed that issue as a false premise. The guild filed suit to
block the plan, but an appeals court rejected the suit after
finding that the guild had not assembled the proper plaintiffs to
bring a case.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Feuer, a city councilman involved in brokering the
compromise, said the agreement alleviated ``enormous distrust and
suspicion'' that had built up between the city and the guild in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo,
cleared the tax committee this week and is expected to be voted on
by the full Assembly next month.

 &HT;    Winston Cup's Intimidator is back
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The life of a Winston Cup crew chief is a hectic one.
Even those who appear calm are churning inside. Kevin Hamlin,
laid-back as they come, takes a little yellow pill to keep his
ulcers under control.
</P>
<P>
   But he was looking for something stronger two summers ago when
his boss, Richard Childress, told him that there would be a switch
in their garage.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin would be leaving the newcomer, Mike Skinner, to team with
Dale Earnhardt. Intimidated by The Intimidator? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything I even cared about doing,'' Hamlin said.
``I said, `Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not me, Richard. That's not
what I want. I don't want to be involved in that limelight. I just
need to start out with a driver like Skinner, try to build a strong
team and win my first race with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was 62 races and many stomach pains ago. As Earnhardt
prepares to tackle the field in Sunday's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway, life has taken some happy twists for the men around
the No. 3 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Earnhardt's a contender with a competitive ride. He
has won one race and is fourth in the point standings. As an owner,
he suddenly has an identity crisis. When his son won for the first
time two weeks ago, he joked, ``When did I become Dale Sr.? I'm not
Dale Sr.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make Hamlin forget about the frustrating road the
No. 3 has traveled back to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wish I was in this situation quite a long time ago,
to tell you the truth,'' Hamlin said. ``I really do like working
with Dale Earnhardt. I feel like every time we come to the race
track we have a legitimate chance to win. That's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   If he has been burned by Earnhardt's competitive fire, Hamlin
hides his scars well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if he's playing race cars or playing
checkers or if he's playing tiddlywinks, Dale wants to win,''
Hamlin said. ``If you're walking from here to that yellow line, he
wants to be there before you do.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to go through that door, he wants to go through
there in front of you or two-wide. That's just Dale Earnhardt.
That's a good thing to have, especially in a race-car driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin doesn't have the nerve to challenge Earnhardt, even in
checkers. ``I don't want to compete against him; I want to compete
with him,'' he said. ``I've found that it's better to be on his
team than against his team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the turbulent 1998 season, when Hamlin and Larry
McReynolds traded uniforms within Childress' shop, that many people
began to question Earnhardt's skills. It was suggested that perhaps
his best years were behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time champion had gone winless in 1997 and except for
the season-opening victory at the Daytona 500 in 1998, that season
was a disappointing period of adjustment to a new crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt will be 49 Saturday. Already in 2000, he can celebrate
a victory at Atlanta, three top fives and four top-10 finishes. It
appears he'll be a factor in the championship. Did someone say
``too old''?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the guys laying the numbers on the board right now are in
their 40s, and it's pretty inspiring to see Earnhardt up there at
49 years old, kicking butt again this year and winning three races
last year,'' said Rusty Wallace, another ``geezer'' who is winning
in his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sport is a lot different than stick and ball, man,''
Wallace said. ``Stick and ball is how muscular you are and how fast
you are with your feet and arms and all that, but our sport it's
how much you know about the sport. It's how much you know about the
track and how much you know the setup is going to change or what
did you run here in the past. I think it's a neat deal to watch and
see what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said Earnhardt still has to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know _ he's been eatin' his Wheaties or something,''
Wallace said. ``I talked to him the other day and I asked him what
he was doin' different, and he said, `I'm just concentrating and
trying to get better.' He really thinks the new Monte Carlo has
given him a big edge over last year, and it looks like it has. I
don't think he ever thought he'd be this strong, but he is and
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, both Childress and Hamlin concede that the previous
problems were Earnhardt's cars, not the driver. As the new
Chevrolet Monte Carlo body continues its shakedown, Hamlin thinks
that putting his driver on a level playing field aerodynamically
with the Fords and Pontiacs will make a big difference this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be equal with them,'' Hamlin said. ``Look at
IROC. That's as equal as you can get things. You put Dale Earnhardt
in an IROC car and he shines. Just give him something to work with,
and he'll drive the wheels off of it. If we were racing the same
bodies every week, he'd beat their butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's revival has several explanations in addition to the
car. He's feeling better after offseason back surgery. And there's
the pride factor: He's working hard not to get beat by Dale Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was racing pretty much with a lot of pain and
stuff,'' Earnhardt said, ``but not as far as getting to the point
where I couldn't feel my hand. After I'd get out of the car, it was
that way. That aggravated me a lot. I would go to the chiropractor,
until I got smart and went to a doctor. We got through that.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that having his son in Cup races has invigorated
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm a little competitive with him, but we've always been
that way from the time he was a kid,'' Earnhardt said. ``I sort of
do that in raising him, I think, let him win sometimes. I just
haven't let him win on the race track yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Chevy teams were out of sorts from anticipating
a new Monte Carlo that wasn't rolled out on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we didn't build any new stuff to start with; we
were still running on old stuff from the year before, because we
were anticipating building new cars from May on with the new
Chevrolets,'' Hamlin said. ``But they never got introduced. So we
got behind at the beginning of last year and stayed that way. This
year, we've got the new stuff built up the way we want, and so far
it's been working all right.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Earnhardt is back on a superspeedway, where he's
considered the master at drafting. The team owner is still
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in the truck a couple of weeks ago watching an
IROC race he had won, and he told me what he was looking for and
how he was looking and what the guys racing around him were
doing,'' Childress said. ``He just has a natural knack, the ability
to know what's going on around him and watching the moves everybody
else is making.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it goes with the experience he's got in
restrictor-plate racing. I was one of the first persons who said,
`I think he can see air.' I've watched the moves and things. He was
one of the first guys I can ever remember see doing the side draft.
That goes back into the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   And, so it seems, does this season of rebirth for The
Intimidator.

CIA TRIED, WITH LITTLE SUCCESS, TO USE U.S. PRESS IN COUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is a sidebar with IRAN-SHAH. The other sidebars are
IRAN-MOSSADEGH and IRAN-WILBER.)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIA officials plotting the 1953 coup in Iran hoped to plant
articles in American newspapers saying Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi's
return resulted from a homegrown revolt against a Communist-leaning
government, internal agency documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were largely disappointed. The CIA's history of the
coup shows that its operatives had only limited success in
manipulating American reporters and that none of the Americans
covering the coup worked for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the press coverage shows that American
journalists filed straightforward, factual dispatches that
prominently mentioned the role of Iran's Communists in street
violence leading up to the coup. Western correspondents in Iran and
Washington never reported that some of the unrest had been
stage-managed by CIA agents posing as Communists. And they gave
little emphasis to accurate contemporaneous reports in Iranian
newspapers and on the Moscow radio asserting that Western powers
were secretly arranging the shah's return to power.
</P>
<P>
   It was just eight years after the end of World War II, which
left American journalists with a sense of national interest framed
by six years of confrontation between the Allies and the Axis. The
front pages of Western newspapers were dominated by articles about
the new global confrontation with the Soviet Union, about Moscow's
prowess in developing nuclear weapons and about congressional
allegations of ``Red'' influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the history indicates, the CIA was apparently
able to use contacts at The Associated Press to put on the news
wire a statement from Tehran about royal decrees that the CIA
itself had written. But mostly, the CIA relied on less direct means
to exploit the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran desk of the State Department, the document says, was
able to place a CIA study in Newsweek, ``using the normal channel
of desk officer to journalist.'' The article was one of several
planted press reports that, when reprinted in Tehran, fed the ``war
of nerves'' against Iran's prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   The history says the Iran operation exposed the agency's
shortcomings in manipulating the American press. The CIA ``lacked
contacts capable of placing material so that the American publisher
was unwitting as to its source.''
</P>
<P>
   The history discloses that a CIA officer, working under cover as
the embassy's press officer, drove two American reporters to a
house outside Tehran where they were shown the shah's decrees
dismissing the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kennett Love, the New York Times reporter in Tehran during the
coup, wrote about the royal decrees in the newspaper the next day,
without mentioning how he had seen them. In an interview, he said
he had agreed to the embassy official's ground rules that he not
report the U.S. role in arranging the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Love said he did not know at the time that the official worked
for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup succeeded, Love did in one article briefly refer
to Iranian press reports of U.S. involvement, and The New York
Times also published an article from Moscow reporting Soviet
charges that the United States was behind the coup. But neither The
Times nor other American news organizations appear to have examined
such charges seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1960 paper he wrote while studying at Princeton University,
Love explained that he ``was responsible, in an impromptu sort of
way, for speeding the final victory of the royalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a half-dozen tanks parked in front of Tehran's radio
station, he said, ``I told the tank commanders that a lot of people
were getting killed trying to storm Dr. Mossadegh's house and that
they would be of some use instead of sitting idle at the radio
station.'' He added, ``They took their machines in a body to Kokh
Avenue and put the three tanks at Dr. Mossadegh's house out of
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who left The New York Times in 1962, said in an interview
that he had urged the tanks into action ``because I wanted to stop
the bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Months afterward, Love said, he was told by Robert C. Doty, then
Cairo bureau chief and his boss, of evidence of U.S. involvement in
the coup.
</P>
<P>
   But Doty, who died in 1974, did not write about the matter, and
by the summer of 1954, Love decided to tell the New York office
what he knew. In a July 26, 1954, letter to Emanuel R. Freedman,
then the foreign editor, Love wrote, ``The only instance since I
joined The Times in which I have allowed policy to influence a
strict news approach was in failing to report the role our own
agents played in the overthrow of Mossadegh.''
</P>
<P>
   Love said he had hoped that the foreign editor would order him
to pursue the subject. But he never received any response, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let Freedman know that I knew there had been U.S.
involvement in the coup, but that I hadn't written about it,'' he
said. ``I expected him to say, `Jump on that story.' But there was
no response.'' Freedman died in 1971.

<P>
   For nearly five decades, America's role in the military coup
that ousted Iran's elected prime minister and returned the shah to
power has been lost to history, the subject of fierce debate in
Iran and stony silence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, participants have retired or died without revealing
key details, and the Central Intelligence Agency said a number of
records of the operation _ its first successful overthrow of a
foreign government _ had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But a copy of the CIA's secret history of the coup has surfaced,
revealing the inner workings of a plot that set the stage for the
Islamic revolution in 1979, and for a generation of anti-American
hatred in one of the Middle East's most powerful countries.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which remains classified, discloses the pivotal
role that British intelligence officials played in initiating and
planning the coup, and it shows that Washington and London shared
an interest in maintaining the West's control over Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, written by the CIA's chief coup planner and
obtained by The New York Times, says the operation's success was
mostly a matter of chance. The document shows that the CIA had
almost complete contempt for the man it was empowering, Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, whom it derided as a vacillating coward. And
it recounts, for the first time, the agency's tortured efforts to
seduce and cajole the shah into taking part in his own coup.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, code-named TP-Ajax, was the blueprint for a
succession of CIA plots to foment coups and destabilize governments
_ including the agency's successful coup in Guatemala in 1954 and
the disastrous Cuban intervention known as the Bay of Pigs in 1961.
In more than one instance, such operations led to the same kind of
long-term animosity toward the United States that occurred in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The history says that CIA officers orchestrating the Iran coup
worked directly with royalist Iranian military officers, handpicked
the prime minister's replacement, sent a stream of envoys to
bolster the shah's courage, directed a campaign of bombings by
Iranians posing as members of the Communist Party, and planted
articles and editorial cartoons in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night set for Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh's
overthrow, almost nothing went according to the meticulously drawn
plans, the secret history says. In fact, CIA officials were poised
to flee the country when several Iranian officers recruited by the
agency, acting on their own, took command of a pro-shah
demonstration in Tehran and seized the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the coup, the history discloses, CIA officials
funneled $5 million to Iran to help the government they had
installed consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the U.S. role in the coup were disclosed in Iran
at the outset and later in the memoirs of CIA officers and other
published accounts. But many specifics have remained classified,
and the secret history obtained by The New York Times is the first
detailed government account of the coup to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, along with operational assessments written
by coup planners, was provided to The Times by a former official
who kept a copy.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in March 1954 by Dr. Donald N. Wilber, an expert
in Persian architecture, who as one of the leading planners
believed that covert operatives had much to learn from history.
</P>
<P>
   In less expansive memoirs published in 1986, Wilber asserted
that the Iran coup was different from later CIA efforts. Its
American planners, he said, had stirred up considerable unrest in
Iran, giving Iranians a clear choice between instability and
supporting the shah. The move to oust the prime minister, he wrote,
thus gained substantial popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Wilber's memoirs were heavily censored by the CIA, but he was
allowed to refer to the existence of his secret history. ``If this
history had been read by the planners of the Bay of Pigs,'' he
wrote, ``there would have been no such operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time,'' he continued, ``I gave talks on the
operation to various groups within the agency, and, in hindsight,
one might wonder why no one from the Cuban desk ever came or read
the history.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup was a turning point in modern Iranian history and
remains a persistent irritant in Tehran-Washington relations. It
consolidated the power of the shah, who ruled with an iron hand for
another quarter century in close contact with to the United States.
In January 1979, he was toppled and driven from Iran in in a
revolution led by Islamic militants. In November 1979,
demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, took diplomats and
other embassy personnel hostage and declared that they had unmasked
a ``nest of spies'' who had been manipulating Iran for decades. The
hostages were held for more than 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini supported
terrorist attacks against U.S. interests largely because of the
long U.S. history of supporting the shah. Even under more moderate
rulers, many Iranians still resent the United States' role in the
coup and its support of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the history says, initiated the plot in 1952. The
administration of President Harry Truman rejected it, but President
Dwight D. Eisenhower approved it shortly after taking office in
1953, because of fears about oil and communism.

IN EARLY '50S, U.S. INTERESTED IN BRITISH PLAN TO OUST IRANIAN
PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: This is Part 2 of a five-part serialized version of the
4,500-word IRAN-SHAH. A sidebar that accompanies this installment
is IRAN-SHAH-SERIES-MOSSADEGH)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The military coup that ousted Iran's elected prime minister in
1953 coup in Iran had its roots in a British showdown with Iran,
restive under decades of near-colonial British domination. The deep
involvement of Britain and the United States in the events were
described in a CIA history of the coup report written in 1954. A
copy of that report, which remains classified, has been obtained by
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was Iran's oil fields. Britain occupied Iran in World
War II to protect a supply route to its ally, the Soviet Union, and
to prevent the oil from falling into the hands of the Nazis.
Britain ousted the monarch, Reza Shah, whom it regarded as
unmanageable, and replaced him with his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi.
The British retained control over Iran's oil after the war through
Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Iran's Parliament voted to nationalize the oil
industry, and legislators backing the law elected its leading
advocate, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Britain responded with threats and sanctions. Mossadegh, a
European-educated lawyer then in his early 70s, prone to tears and
outbursts, refused to back down. In meetings in November and
December 1952, the secret history says, British intelligence
officials startled their U.S. counterparts with a plan for a joint
operation to oust the nettlesome prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who ``had not intended to discuss this question
at all,'' agreed to study it, the secret history says. It had
attractions. Anti-communism had risen to a fever pitch in
Washington, and officials were worried that Iran might fall under
the sway of the Soviet Union, a historical presence there.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1953, an unexpected development pushed the plot
forward: the CIA's Tehran station reported that an Iranian general
had approached the U.S. Embassy about supporting an army-led coup.
</P>
<P>
   The newly inaugurated Eisenhower administration was intrigued.
The coalition that elected Mossadegh was splintering, and the
Iranian Communist Party, the Tudeh, had become active.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence,
approved $1 million to be used ``in any way that would bring about
the fall of Mossadegh,'' the history says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim was to bring to power a government which would reach
an equitable oil settlement, enabling Iran to become economically
sound and financially solvent, and which would vigorously prosecute
the dangerously strong Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, CIA officials identified a high-ranking officer,
Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, as the man to spearhead a coup. Their plan
called for the shah to play a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shah-General Zahedi combination, supported by CIA local
assets and financial backing, would have a good chance of
overthrowing Mossadegh,'' officials wrote, ``particularly if this
combination should be able to get the largest mobs in the streets
and if a sizable portion of the Tehran garrison refused to carry
out Mossadegh's orders.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the history, planners had doubts about whether
the shah could carry out such a bold operation.
</P>
<P>
   His family had seized Iran's throne just 32 years earlier, when
his powerful father had led a coup of his own. But the young shah,
CIA officials wrote, was ``by nature a creature of indecision,
beset by formless doubts and fears,'' often at odds with his
family, including Princess Ashraf, his ``forceful and scheming twin
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the shah had what the CIA termed a ``pathological fear''
of British intrigues, a potential obstacle to a joint operation.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1953 the CIA sent Dr. Donald N. Wilber, a coup planner
and the author of the secret report on which this article is based,
to Cyprus to meet Norman Darbyshire, chief of the Iran branch of
British intelligence, to make initial coup plans. Assuaging the
fears of the shah was high on their agenda; a document from the
meeting said he was to be persuaded that the United States and
Britain ``consider the oil question secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation at the meeting turned to a touchy subject, the
identity of key agents inside Iran. The British said they had
recruited two brothers named Rashidian. The Americans, the secret
history discloses, did not trust the British and lied about the
identity of their best ``assets'' inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials were divided over whether the plan drawn up in
Cyprus could work. The Tehran station warned headquarters that the
``the shah would not act decisively against Mossadegh.'' And it
said Zahedi, the man picked to lead the coup, ``appeared lacking in
drive, energy and concrete plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doubts, the agency's Tehran station began
disseminating ``gray propaganda,'' passing out anti-Mossadegh
cartoons in the streets and planting unflattering articles in the
local press.
</P>
<P>

the ouster of his prime minister.

IN '53, U.S. PERSUADED SHAH OF IRAN TO HELP OUST HIS PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: This is Part 3 of a five-part serialized version of
IRAN-SHAH)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A classified CIA report on the 1953 ouster of Iran's prime
minister, Iran, which has been obtained by The New York Times,
indicates that U.S. and British intelligence officials began
planning the action even though Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi was
reluctant to cooperate and President Dwight D. Eisenhower had not
yet given his final approval.
</P>
<P>
   In early June 1953, U.S. and British intelligence officials met
again, this time in Beirut, Lebanon, and put the finishing touches
on the strategy. Soon afterward, the chief of the CIA's Near East
and Africa division, Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore
Roosevelt, arrived in Tehran to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   The shah was a problem from the start. The plan called for him
to stand fast as the CIA stirred up popular unrest and then, as the
country lurched toward chaos, to issue royal decrees dismissing
Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and appointing Gen. Fazlollah
Zahedi, hand-picked by the CIA, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA sought to ``produce such pressure on the shah that it
would be easier for him to sign the papers required of him than it
would be to refuse,'' the secret history states. Officials turned
to his sister for help.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Eisenhower finally signed off on the plan. At about
the same time, CIA and British intelligence officers visited
Princess Ashraf, the shah's influential sister, on the French
Riviera and persuaded her to return to Iran and tell her brother to
follow the script.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the unpopular princess unleashed a storm of
protest from pro-Mossadegh forces. The shah was furious that she
had come back without his approval and refused at first to see her.
But a palace staff member _ another British agent, according to the
secret history _ gained Ashraf access on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   The history does not reveal what the siblings said to each
other. But the princess gave her brother the news that CIA
officials had enlisted Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf in the coup
campaign. Schwarzkopf, the father of the Persian Gulf war
commander, had befriended the shah a decade earlier while leading
the U.S. military mission to Iran, and he told the CIA ``he was
sure he could get the required cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The British, too, sought to sway the shah and assure him their
agents spoke for London. A British agent, Asadollah Rashidian,
approached him in late July and invited him to select a phrase that
would then be broadcast at prearranged times on the BBC's
Persian-language program _ as proof that Rashidian spoke for the
British.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise did not seem to have much effect. The shah told
Rashidian on July 30 and 31 that he had heard the broadcast, but
``requested time to assess the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the CIA stepped up the pressure. Iranian
operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders
with ``savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh,'' seeking to
stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one
prominent Muslim was bombed by CIA agents posing as Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was also intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading
newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, ``in
the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shah remained intransigent. In an Aug. 1 meeting with
Schwarzkopf, he refused to sign the CIA-written decrees firing
Mossadegh and appointing Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army
would support him in a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, the document says, the shah was so convinced
that the palace was bugged that he ``led the general into the grand
ballroom, pulled a small table to its exact center'' and got onto
it to talk, insisting that the general do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting was to be followed by a series of additional
ones, some between Roosevelt and the shah and some between
Rashidian and the shah, in which relentless pressure was exerted in
frustrating attempts to overcome an entrenched attitude of
vacillation and indecision,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh had by now figured out that there was a plot against
him. He moved to consolidate power by calling for a national
referendum to dissolve Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Aug. 4 referendum were clearly rigged in his
favor; The New York Times reported the same day that the prime
minister had won 99.9 percent of the vote. This only helped the
plotters, providing ``an issue on which Mossadegh could be
relentlessly attacked'' by the agency-backed opposition press.
</P>
<P>
   But the shah still wouldn't move against Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Aug. 3rd,'' the secret history says, ``Roosevelt had a long
and inconclusive session with the shah,'' who ``stated that he was
not an adventurer, and hence, could not take the chances of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roosevelt pointed out that there was no other way by which the
government could be changed and the test was now between Mossadegh
and his force and the shah and the army, which was still with him,
but which would soon slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt told the shah ``that failure to act could lead only to
a Communist Iran or to a second Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still haunted by doubts, the shah asked Roosevelt if Eisenhower
could tell him what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``By complete coincidence and great good fortune,'' the secret
history says, ``the president, while addressing the governors'
convention in Seattle on 4 August, deviated from his script to
state by implication that the United States would not sit by idly
and see Iran fall behind the Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 10, the shah had finally agreed to see Zahedi and a few
army officers involved in the plot, but still refused to sign the
decrees. The CIA then sent Rashidian to say Roosevelt ``would leave
in complete disgust unless the shah took action within a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The shah finally signed the decrees on Aug. 13. Word that he
would support an army-led coup spread rapidly among the army
officers backing Zahedi.

1953 IRAN COUP GOT OFF TO A ROCKY START
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: This is Part 4 of a five-part serialization of
IRAN-SHAH.)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. inspired coup against the prime minister of Iran began on
the night of Aug. 15, 1953, and was immediately compromised by a
talkative Iranian army officer whose remarks were relayed to
Mossadegh. These and other details emerge from a secret CIA report
on the operation, which remains classified but which has been
obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, the secret history says, ``still might have
succeeded in spite of this advance warning had not most of the
participants proved to be inept or lacking in decision at the
critical juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh's chief of staff, Gen. Taghi
Riahi, learned of the plot hours before it was to begin and sent
his deputy to the barracks of the Imperial Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy was arrested there, according to the history, just as
pro-shah soldiers were fanning out across the city arresting other
senior officials. Telephone lines between army and government
offices were cut, and the telephone exchange was occupied.
</P>
<P>
   But phones inexplicably continued to function, which gave
Mossadegh's forces a key advantage. Riahi also eluded the pro-shah
units, rallying commanders to the prime minister's side.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-shah soldiers sent to arrest Mossadegh at his home were
instead captured. The top military officer working with Gen.
Fazlollah Zahedi, the CIA's choice to become the new prime
minister, fled when he saw tanks and loyal government soldiers at
army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the history states, the Tehran radio announced
that a coup against the government had failed, and Mossadegh
scrambled to strengthen his hold on the army and key installations.
CIA officers inside the embassy were flying blind; the history says
they had ``no way of knowing what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Kermit Roosevelt, the CIA station chief, left the embassy and
tracked down Zahedi, who was in hiding north of Tehran.
Surprisingly, the general was not ready to abandon the operation.
The coup, the two men agreed, could still work, provided they could
persuade the public that Zahedi was the lawful prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, the history discloses, the coup plotters had
to get out the news that the shah had signed the two decrees.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station in Tehran sent a message to The Associated Press
in New York, asserting that ``unofficial reports are current to the
effect that leaders of the plot are armed with two decrees of the
shah, one dismissing Mossadegh and the other appointing General
Zahedi to replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and its agents also arranged for the decrees to be
mentioned in some Tehran papers, the history says.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda initiative quickly bogged down. Many of the CIA's
Iranian agents were under arrest or on the run. That afternoon,
agency operatives prepared a statement from Zahedi that they hoped
to distribute publicly. But they could not find a printing press
that was not being watched by forces loyal to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, prospects of reviving the operation were dealt a
seemingly a fatal blow when it was learned that the shah had bolted
to Baghdad, Iraq. CIA headquarters cabled Tehran urging Roosevelt,
the station chief, to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He did not agree, insisting that there was still ``a slight
remaining chance of success,'' if the shah would broadcast an
address on the Baghdad radio and Zahedi took an aggressive stand.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the tide might turn came with reports that
Iranian soldiers had broken up Tudeh, or Communist, groups, beating
them and making them chant their support for the shah. ``The
station continued to feel that the project was not quite dead,''
the secret history recounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mossadegh had overreached, playing into the CIA's
hands by dissolving Parliament after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17 the shah finally announced from Baghdad that he had
signed the decrees _ though he had by now delayed so long that
plotters feared it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mossadegh let down his guard. Lulled by the shah's
departure and the arrests of some officers involved in the coup,
the government recalled most troops it had stationed around the
city, believing that the danger had passed.
</P>
<P>
   That night the CIA arranged for Zahedi and other key Iranian
agents and army officers to be smuggled into the embassy compound
``in the bottom of cars and in closed jeeps'' for a ``council of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to start a counterattack on Aug. 19, sending a
leading cleric from Tehran to the holy city of Qum to try to
orchestrate a call for a holy war against communism.
</P>
<P>
   Key army officers went to outlying army garrisons to persuade
commanders to join the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the shah disappointed the CIA. He left Baghdad for
Rome the next day. Newspapers supporting Mossadegh reported that
the Pahlevi dynasty had come to an end, and a statement from the
Communist Party attributed the coup attempt to ``Anglo-American
intrigue.'' Demonstrators ripped down imperial statues.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station cabled headquarters for advice on whether to
``continue with TP-Ajax or withdraw.'' TP-Ajax was the code name
for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headquarters spent a day featured by depression and despair,''
the history states, adding, ``The message sent to Tehran on the
night of Aug. 18 said that `the operation has been tried and
failed,' and that `in the absence of strong recommendations to the
contrary operations against Mossadegh should be discontinued.'''
</P>
<P>
   NEXT: Both the CIA and the Soviets are surprised by the coup's
success.

CIA AND MOSCOW WERE BOTH SURPRISED BY SUCCESS OF '53 IRAN COUP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In the summer of 1953, just as U.S. intelligence officials were
ready to abort an attempt to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh of Iran, the mood on the streets of Tehran shifted. These
and other events are described in a classified CIA report obtained
by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 19, several Tehran papers published Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi's long-awaited decrees, and soon pro-shah
crowds were building in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed only leadership,'' the secret report says. And
Iranian agents of the CIA provided it. Without specific orders, a
journalist who was one of the agency's most important Iranian
agents led a crowd toward Parliament, inciting people to set fire
to the offices of a newspaper owned by Mossadegh's foreign
minister. Another Iranian CIA agent led a crowd to sack the offices
of pro-Tudeh papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news that something quite startling was happening spread
at great speed throughout the city,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA tried to exploit the situation, sending urgent messages
that the Rashidian brothers and two key U.S. agents should ``swing
the security forces to the side of the demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
   But things were now moving far too quickly for the agency to
manage. An Iranian army colonel who had been involved in the plot
several days earlier suddenly appeared outside Parliament with a
tank, while members of the now-disbanded Imperial Guard seized
trucks and drove through the streets. ``By 10:15 there were
pro-shah truckloads of military personnel at all the main
squares,'' the secret history says.
</P>
<P>
   By noon the crowds began to receive direct leadership from a few
officers involved in the plot and some who had switched sides.
Within an hour the central telegraph office fell, and telegrams
were sent to the provinces urging a pro-shah uprising. After a
brief shootout, police headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs fell as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Tehran radio remained the biggest prize. With the
government's fate uncertain, it was broadcasting a program on
cotton prices. But by early afternoon a mass of civilians, army
officers and policemen overwhelmed it. Pro-shah speakers went on
the air, broadcasting the coup's success and reading the royal
decrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stream of eager speakers came to the microphone,'' the
history relates. ``Some represented elements upon whom reliance had
been placed in TP-Ajax planning, while others were quite unknown to
the station.'' TP-Ajax was the code name for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy, CIA officers were elated, and the station chief,
Roosevelt, got Gen. Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, the agency's choice to
become the new prime minister, out of hiding. An army officer found
a tank and drove him to the radio station, where he spoke to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh and other government officials were rounded up, while
officers supporting Zahedi placed ``known supporters of TP-Ajax''
in command of all units of the Tehran garrison.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was caught completely off-guard. Even as the
Mossadegh government was falling, the Moscow radio was broadcasting
a story on ``the failure of the American adventure in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But CIA headquarters was as surprised as Moscow. When news of
the coup's success arrived, it ``seemed to be a bad joke, in view
of the depression that still hung on from the day before,'' the
history says.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Washington got most of its information from
news agencies, receiving only two cablegrams from the station.
Roosevelt later explained that if he had told headquarters what was
going on, ``London and Washington would have thought they were
crazy and told them to stop immediately,'' the history states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA took full credit inside the government. The
following year it overthrew the government of Guatemala, and a myth
developed that the agency could topple governments anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Iran proved that Third World king-making could be heady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day that should never have ended,'' the CIA's secret
history said, describing Aug. 19, 1953. ``For it carried with it
such a sense of excitement, of satisfaction and of jubilation that
it is doubtful whether any other can come up to it.''

CIA TRIED, WITH LITTLE SUCCESS, TO USE U.S. PRESS IN COUP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CIA officials plotting the 1953 coup in Iran hoped to plant
articles in American newspapers saying Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi's
return resulted from a homegrown revolt against a Communist-leaning
government, internal agency documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were largely disappointed. The CIA's history of the
coup shows that its operatives had only limited success in
manipulating American reporters and that none of the Americans
covering the coup worked for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the press coverage shows that American
journalists filed straightforward, factual dispatches that
prominently mentioned the role of Iran's Communists in street
violence leading up to the coup. Western correspondents in Iran and
Washington never reported that some of the unrest had been
stage-managed by CIA agents posing as Communists. And they gave
little emphasis to accurate contemporaneous reports in Iranian
newspapers and on the Moscow radio asserting that Western powers
were secretly arranging the shah's return to power.
</P>
<P>
   It was just eight years after the end of World War II, which
left American journalists with a sense of national interest framed
by six years of confrontation between the Allies and the Axis. The
front pages of Western newspapers were dominated by articles about
the new global confrontation with the Soviet Union, about Moscow's
prowess in developing nuclear weapons and about congressional
allegations of ``Red'' influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the history indicates, the CIA was apparently
able to use contacts at The Associated Press to put on the news
wire a statement from Tehran about royal decrees that the CIA
itself had written. But mostly, the CIA relied on less direct means
to exploit the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran desk of the State Department, the document says, was
able to place a CIA study in Newsweek, ``using the normal channel
of desk officer to journalist.'' The article was one of several
planted press reports that, when reprinted in Tehran, fed the ``war
of nerves'' against Iran's prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   The history says the Iran peration exposed the agency's
shortcomings in manipulating the American press. The CIA ``lacked
contacts capable of placing material so that the American publisher
was unwitting as to its source.''

MOSSADEGH: ECCENTRIC NATIONALIST BEGETS STRANGE HISTORY

   (Eds: This is a sidebar with IRAN-SHAH-SERIES-II, which is a
five-part serialization of the 4,500 word IRAN-SHAH. A longer

<P>
   Except for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, father of its
revolution, no leader has left a deeper mark on Iran's 20th century
landscape than Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh. And no 20th century event
has fueled Iran's suspicion of the United States as his overthrow
has.
</P>
<P>
   An eccentric European-educated lawyer whose father was a
bureaucrat and whose mother was descended from Persian kings,
Mossadegh served in government posts before he opposed Reza Shah's
accession in the 1920s. For a time, he was imprisoned and then put
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain and the Soviet Union forced Reza Shah from power in
favor of his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, in 1941, Mossadegh became
a member of Parliament. He was hailed as a hero for speeches
denouncing British control of Iran's oil industry. In 1951, when
Parliament voted to nationalize the industry, the young shah,
recognizing the nationalists' popularity, appointed Mossadegh prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   In that job he became a prisoner of his own nationalism, unable
to reach an oil compromise. Even as the British negotiated with
Iran, they won the support of the major oil companies in imposing
an effective global boycott on Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the developing world, Mossadegh became an icon of
anti-imperialism. He was revered despite his odd mannerisms, which
included conducting business in bed in gray woolen pajamas, weeping
publicly and complaining perpetually of poor health.
</P>
<P>
   He amassed power. When the shah refused his demand for control
of the armed forces in 1952, Mossadegh resigned, only to be
reinstated in the face of popular riots.
</P>
<P>
   He showed authoritarianism in bypassing Parliament by conducting
a national referendum to win approval for its dissolution.
Meanwhile, the United States became alarmed at the strength of
Iran's Communist Party, which supported Mossadegh.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1953, a dismissal attempt by the shah sent Mossadegh's
followers into the streets. The shah fled, amid fears in the
Eisenhower administration that Iran might move too close to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mossadegh did not promote the interests of the Communists,
though he drew on their support. Paradoxically, the party turned
from him in the end because it viewed him as insufficiently
committed and too close to the United States. By the time the coup
overthrew him after a few chaotic days, he had alienated many
landowners, clerics and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial, he served three years in prison and ended up
under house arrest at his estate. He died in March 1967.

A `GENTLEMAN SPY' AT THE HELM

   Dr. Donald Wilber, who planned the 1953 coup in Iran and wrote
its secret history, was old-school CIA, a Princetonian and a Middle
East architecture expert who fit neatly into the mold of the
``gentleman spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of wandering through Middle Eastern architectural sites
gave him the perfect cover for a clandestine life. By 1953, he was
an obvious choice as the operation's strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The coup was the high point of his life as a spy. Although he
would excel in academia, at the agency being part-time was a
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never requested promotion, and was given only one, after the
conclusion of Ajax,'' Wilber wrote of the Iran operation.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day, ``I was ushered down to the lobby by a young
secretary, turned over my badge to her and left.'' He added, ``This
treatment rankled for some time. I did deserve the paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilber died in 1997, at the age of 89.

GOP IN THE SOUTH LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ It took all of a day for Margaret Gamble and
Mickey Whatley to learn what life would be like as Democrats in the
Republican-controlled South Carolina House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the two representatives startled the Southern
political world this month as the first Republicans in the state to
become Democrats since the end of Reconstruction, they were
stripped of their positions on two prestigious committees and moved
to the Military, Medical, Municipal and Public Affairs Committee,
which has so few responsibilities that not a single Republican
serves on it.
</P>
<P>
   The House speaker, David Wilkins, said he was sending them there
to achieve party balance on their former committees, not as
punishment. But the treatment of the two defectors, and the angry
ridicule heaped on them by Republican leaders, made it clear what a
painful and possibly pivotal moment this was for the state party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two have been voting with the enemy for years,'' said
Henry McMaster, the chairman of the South Carolina Republicans.
``We've got a big tent, but some folks had been wondering whether
they were in or out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two have been members of an increasingly isolated
species in the South these days: moderate Republicans, who often
feel at odds with their party's hard line.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats regain their footing in statehouses from South
Carolina to Mississippi, the Republican Party in many states has
found itself dominated by religious conservatives desperate to
retake control. Suburban Republicans like Gamble and Whatley are
often caught between popular programs proposed by Democratic
governors and the demands of Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's been Republican since Strom Thurmond switched in
the '60s,'' said Gamble, an administrator at the University of
South Carolina. ``This was a very emotional and very difficult
decision for me. But I've been very disappointed in the House
Republicans _ they just seem to have lost touch with people on the
important things like education and senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans say the two legislators switched parties only
to escape tough primary fights, and point out that there has not
exactly been a stampede to the Democratic side. So far this year,
two Minnesota officials have switched, along with a Maryland state
senator, and last year, U.S. Rep. Michael Forbes of New York
changed sides.
</P>
<P>
   But the long exodus of white Southern Democrats to the
Republican Party that began in the 1960s appears to have halted,
and many Democrats say they now have the momentum. While 15
Democratic state legislators in South Carolina became Republicans
in the early 1990s, none have switched in the last three years. The
same is true in Alabama, which had 50 major defections to the
Republicans from 1994 through 1997, but has had only three since
then.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats now control 24 of 30 legislative chambers in the
South, and with the most recent defections they are just four seats
away from controlling the South Carolina House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, no one was talking about switching to the
Democratic Party, but now we're starting to see it pick up,'' said
Kevin Mack, executive director of the Democratic Legislative
Campaign Committee, the arm of the national party that works at the
statehouse level. ``As we see more of a schism between moderate and
conservative Republicans, more are coming our way.''
</P>
<P>
   More neutral observers are also starting to see the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second generation of Republicans now coming of age just
isn't bound to the party the same way,'' said Bill Moore, a
political science professor at the College of Charleston who
closely follows state politics. ``The first generation was more
hard-core, but there's a change in attitude going on in a lot of
suburban districts that they just haven't recognized yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoff at this notion, of course. Wilkins said the
two legislators were not even moderates, noting that Gamble voted
recently against creating a holiday to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., and that both have opposed moving the Confederate
battle flag off the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   But Gamble and Whatley pointed to two significant policy
differences that persuaded them to break ranks with the
Republicans. One was over Gov. Jim Hodges' request for an extra $10
million for his ``First Steps'' preschool program, which
Republicans blocked. Gamble said the Republicans believed mothers
should be taking care of preschoolers, although party leaders said
the request was simply too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The other was a Democratic request for more money for programs
for the elderly, particularly prescription drugs and homestead tax
exemptions, which Republicans also cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ordered me not to vote for these programs, because it
would make the governor look good,'' said Whatley, a longtime
law-enforcement officer who was the police chief of North
Charleston. ``But these are programs that young people and elderly
people in my district wanted. The Republicans have forgotten about
people like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatley represents a coastal district that has become
increasingly Democratic, fueled by newcomers from the North and the
growing participation of black voters, who represent over a third
of the district. Although he said he was not motivated by practical
considerations, other legislators say he will have an easier time
winning as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's suburban Columbia district is still primarily
Republican, but it has a large number of the swing voters who made
Sen. John McCain such a strong candidate in the February
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of district where you're seeing a reaction to
the party being taken over by Christian conservatives,'' said Neal
Thigpen, a political science professor at Francis Marion University
in Florence and a Republican. ``They're conservative on tax and
spending issues, but they just can't abide the hard-core right
wing. I think it tells you something that she is not frightened to
death to run as a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble acknowledged the possibility that she could be defeated
in November because of her switch, but said she felt more loyal to
her district than to her old party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my family and friends what I was doing, they said,
`You did what?''' she said. ``But when I explain it to them, they
understand. It's the party that changed, not me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly five decades, America's role in the military coup
that ousted Iran's elected prime minister and returned the shah to
power has been lost to history, the subject of fierce debate in
Iran and stony silence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said a number of records of the operation _ its first
successful overthrow of a foreign government _ had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But a copy of the CIA's secret history of the coup has surfaced,
revealing the inner workings of a plot that set the stage for the
Islamic revolution in 1979, and for a generation of anti-American
hatred in one of the Middle East's most powerful countries.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which remains classified, discloses the pivotal
role that Britain played in plotting the coup, and it shows that
Washington and London shared an interest in maintaining the West's
control over Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, written by the CIA's chief coup planner and
obtained by The New York Times, says the operation's success was
mostly a matter of chance. The document shows that the CIA had
almost complete contempt for the man it was empowering, Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, whom it derided as a vacillating coward. And
it recounts, for the first time, the agency's tortured efforts to
seduce and cajole the shah into taking part in his own coup.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was the blueprint for later CIA plots to foment
coups and destabilize governments _ including the successful coup
in Guatemala in 1954 and the disastrous Cuban intervention known as
the Bay of Pigs in 1961. Such operations have led to the same kind
of long-term animosity toward the United States that occurred in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The history says that CIA officers orchestrating the Iran coup
worked directly with royalist Iranian military officers, handpicked
the prime minister's replacement, sent envoys to bolster the shah's
courage, directed a campaign of bombings by Iranians posing as
Communist Party members, and planted articles and cartoons in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But on that night in August 1953 that was set for Prime Minister
Mohammed Mossadegh's overthrow, almost nothing went according to
the meticulously drawn plans, the secret history says. In fact, CIA
officials were poised to flee the country when several Iranian
officers recruited by the agency, acting on their own, took command
of a pro-shah demonstration in Tehran and seized the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the coup, the history discloses, CIA agency
officials funneled $5 million to Iran to help the government they
had installed consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the U.S. role in the coup were disclosed in Iran
at the outset and later in the memoirs of CIA officers and other
published accounts. But many specifics have remained classified,
and the secret history obtained by The New York Times is the first
detailed government account of the coup to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Two directors of central intelligence, Robert Gates and R. James
Woolsey, vowed to declassify records of the agency's early covert
actions, including the Iran coup. But the CIA said three years ago
that a number of relevant documents had been destroyed in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA spokesman said Friday that the agency had retained about
1,000 pages of documents related to the coup, in addition to
besides the history and an internal account written later. He said
the papers destroyed in the early 1960s were duplicates and a
portion some of the working files.
</P>
<P>
   The secret history, along with operational assessments written
by coup planners, was provided to The Times by a former official
who kept a copy.
</P>
<P>
   It was written in March 1954 by Dr. Donald N. Wilber, one of the
leading planners.
</P>
<P>
   Wilber's subsequent memoirs were heavily censored by the CIA,
but he was allowed to refer to the existence of his secret history.
``If this history had been read by the planners of the Bay of
Pigs,'' he wrote, ``there would have been no such operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup was a turning point in modern Iranian history and
remains a persistent irritant in Tehran-Washington relations. It
consolidated the power of the shah, who ruled with an iron hand for
another quarter century in close contact with to the United States.
In January 1979, he was toppled and driven from Iran in in a
revolution led by Islamic militants. In November 1979,
demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, took diplomats and
other embassy personnel hostage and declared that they had unmasked
a ``nest of spies'' who had been manipulating Iran for decades. The
hostages were held for more than 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini supported
terrorist attacks against U.S. interests largely because of the
long U.S. history of supporting the shah. Even under more moderate
rulers, many Iranians still resent the United States' role in the
coup and its support of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in an address in March,
acknowledged the coup's pivotal role in the troubled relationship
and came closer to apologizing than any U.S. official ever has
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were
justified for strategic reasons,'' she said. ``But the coup was
clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is easy
to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention
by America in their internal affairs.''

BUSH TRIES TO HOLD THE FAR RIGHT WHILE COURTING THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When George W. Bush emerged from his meeting last week
with a group of gay Republicans, what mattered was style, not
substance. By appearing with a group shunned by many conservatives,
Bush signaled a measure of independence. He even reminded
conservative Republicans to judge gays by their heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback to 1994: The candidate for governor, George W. Bush,
found himself in a ticklish spot. Ultraconservatives in his Texas
Republican Party had adopted a contentious platform that included a
plank for teaching creationism in schools. Bush could not afford to
alienate social conservatives but he needed Democratic crossover
votes to win. The platform? When asked, he said he had not read it.
</P>
<P>
   Two elections, same candidate, seemingly the same dilemma: Hold
on to right-wing conservatives but keep enough of a public distance
from them to court the political middle. In his two governor's race
victories, Bush performed this balancing act. In Texas, he has
cultivated a bipartisan, above-the-fray image that has earned him
many Democratic friends even as he has held on to the religious
right and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have lost his effectiveness had he been a
religious-right champion,'' said state Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, a
conservative, ardently anti-abortion Republican who supports Bush.
``I think he has been very wise politically.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are perils. In Texas, Bush has had a complicated and
occasionally contentious relationship with conservative leaders.
Some consider him a true believer; others are among his loudest
critics. His courtship of conservative groups has often been quiet
and behind the scenes. He has feuded with some leaders and wooed
others, particularly religious conservatives like the outspoken
Fort Worth televangelist, James Robison. But he has infuriated some
Republican hard-liners by refusing to campaign against Democratic
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's comfortable in the middle, but they've gone out
of their way to woo certain religious leaders on the right,'' said
Tom Pauken, the former chairman of the Texas Republican Party who
has feuded with Bush. ``It's worked to a degree, in that there
isn't strong opposition on the right to Bush. But there isn't
strong enthusiasm on the right for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Bush has enjoyed a charmed life in Texas in
winning over conservatives. Before the 1994 election, he was
untested in statewide races and his appeal to conservatives was
uncertain. But after Bush announced his candidacy, his two likely
primary opponents withdrew. He essentially then inherited a
conservative vote without a fight and focused on the Democratic
incumbent, Gov. Ann Richards, whose sassy social liberalism
incensed the Texas right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do anything we could to get rid of her,'' said
Cathie Adams, president of the Texas Eagle Forum, the state chapter
of the group founded by Phyllis Schlafly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was surprisingly emphatic, but his honeymoon with
some Republican conservatives was surprisingly short. Before his
election the state party had undergone a revolution at its 1994
convention. The longtime party chairman, Fred Meyer, a Bush family
friend, resigned under pressure from social conservatives. The
grass-roots activists who dominated the convention elected Pauken,
who became an irritant to Bush and his chief political strategist,
Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and other Bush supporters describe Pauken as a polarizing
figure. ``Pauken has very, very few friends,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension meant that the new Republican governor and the new
chairman of the Republican Party barely spoke. During his four
years as party chairman, Pauken said the governor refused to meet
with him or to allow the party to place a liaison in the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's personal with him,'' Pauken said. ``Once you're an enemy,
you stay an enemy. Same with Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, said the governor did
initially hold a couple of meetings with Pauken. But he
characterized the relationship between the men as ``distant,'' and
the meetings quickly ended.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservatives also were becoming disenchanted with Bush.
Adams of the Eagle Forum said that she and others felt ignored and
taken for granted. She described Bush's relationship with
grass-roots conservatives in Texas as ``very tepid'' and ``arm's
length.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reaching out, and the real, `I want to work with
you,' has been for Democrats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The strained relations surfaced publicly at the 1996 party
convention in San Antonio. Religious conservatives again adopted a
very conservative state platform. But the larger controversy arose
over the voting on delegates to the national convention in San
Diego. Delegates proposed by the campaign of the Republican
presidential nominee, Bob Dole, were repeatedly voted down as
ultraconservatives supported other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And in a symbolic slap at Bush, delegates voted for Pauken as
chairman of the Texas delegation to the national convention, a post
traditionally held by the party's highest elected official. To the
surprise of some, Pauken did not turn down the job. A year later,
when Bush sought to overhaul the state's outdated tax code, Pauken
and other conservatives called his plan a thinly disguised income
tax, which is prohibited under Texas' constitution, and lobbied
successfully to defeat it.

</P>
<P>
   Bush found himself prevailing in a fight with conservatives on
the state Board of Education. Six Christian conservatives had won
seats on the obscure 15-member board and waged a high-profile
effort to change textbooks and loosen federal and state control.
They criticized Bush's state education standards and accountability
system as too soft and urged the dismissal of the state education
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Ballard, a member of the board from Houston until she
moved to West Texas, became so disenchanted with Bush that she
campaigned for Steve Forbes in the early presidential primaries.
She said the governor expanded, rather than reduced, the role of
federal programs in local schools, and she contended that
grass-roots conservatives, not Bush, were responsible for
toughening education standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are that he has not been a friend to conservatives
in the state of Texas,'' said Ballard, a minister's wife.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist,
said that even in a conservative state like Texas, many of Bush's
critics are regarded as extremists. Buchanan said that Bush
succeeded in positioning himself as a moderating force toward
hard-liners and staking out positions in keeping with broader
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no leverage over him because the rest of the state
is more moderate than them, in part, and because they have not
gotten elected,'' Buchanan said. In 1998, Pauken, who had resigned
as party chairman, lost his bid to be state attorney general to a
Republican, John Cornyn, reportedly recruited by Rove. Ballard and
Bob Offutt, another Bush critic on the education board, were
defeated this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, one of Texas' three members on the Republican
National Committee, said that Bush had been adept at appealing to
more moderate voters, but he said he considered the governor a true
conservative. Lambert said he considered Bush's aggressive
courtship of religious conservatives in the South Carolina primary
as a true indication of his political compass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he moved to the right,'' Lambert said. ``I don't
think he moved to the right. I think he articulated positions he
always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Above any conservative group in Texas, Bush has most openly
curried favor with religious conservatives, particularly groups
like the Christian Coalition. ``They have to like him a lot because
this is a religious guy,'' Meyer said. ``They'd be crazy not to
like George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Anderson, executive director of Texas Christian Coalition,
which represents about 200,000 people, said that Bush delivered on
the organization's three most important concerns during the 1999
legislative session: a parental notification law for minors seeking
abortions, passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also praised Bush's earlier appointment of Dr. William
R. Archer III, an opponent of abortion, as state health
commissioner. Archer has sought to curtail school-based health
clinics, which many conservatives believe provide abortion
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``On most every issue,'' Anderson said of the governor, ``we've
had pretty much the same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition
and now a Bush adviser, said the governor had appealed to religious
conservatives with the openness with which he talks about his own
faith. In return, many Texas ministers have rallied behind him,
even if his position on abortion is more tepid than they might
like. Last November, The Dallas Morning News reported that a
network of Texas religious leaders was contacting conservatives in
crucial political states to assure them that Bush shared their
convictions and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has an influential ally in Robison, the televangelist
and host of the nationally syndicated program ``Life Today.'' When
the influential televangelist, James Dobson, criticized Bush and
talked of renouncing the Republican Party, Robison rallied support
for the governor. In February 1999, on Presidents' Day, Bush even
appeared on Robison's program, startling some in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a Methodist governor wander into the televangelist's
domain, where stern sermons are spliced between money requests and
crackpot Y2K warnings,'' Bud Kennedy, a Fort Worth Star-Telegram
columnist, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Robison said he had often prayed or spoken with
Bush, including on the day the governor decided to run for
president. ``He said when he called me that I was the sixth person
he had told,'' Robison recalled. ``He said, `I've heard the call. I
believe God wants me to run for president.'''

TRACING GORE'S ROOTS AS SUPPORTER OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore declared in late March
that he would devote himself to remaking the system of political
finance, he conceded that he was an ``imperfect messenger'' for
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows that his 1996 fund-raising exploits, including
cadging cash at a Buddhist temple and dunning contributors from his
White House office, make his new campaign finance reform mantra
subject to skepticism and a few snickers. Also, all the while he is
proclaiming the need for a campaign finance overhaul, including a
ban on soft money, the vice president is busily raising these
unrestricted donations to keep up with George W. Bush and the
Republicans. This very weekend he is helping the Democratic
National Committee sweep up more than $4 million from rich donors
in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Since his March 27 speech proposing radical changes in the way
politicians finance their campaigns, Gore's aides have taken pains
to show that he is not a late and cynical convert to a crusade
popularized in the presidential primaries by Republican Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, they say, has supported campaign reform legislation since
his earliest days in Congress. He has sponsored or co-sponsored
bills to limit contributions from political action committees, to
restrain spending in House and Senate campaigns, to provide for
public financing of congressional elections and to grant free
television time to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, supporters and critics of Gore agree that he has been,
since first elected to Congress in 1976, a steady if largely
invisible supporter of measures to change the political finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to say he certainly was a supporter but an
exaggeration to say he was an activist or a crusader,'' said former
Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., a longtime sponsor of legislation to
clean up campaigns. ``I don't say that as a criticism, because
every vote and every co-sponsor we got was crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren, now president of the University of Oklahoma, said that he
could count on Gore's signature on campaign bills and on his vote,
but that Gore was not an ally who would make sacrifices for the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Gore, like McCain, had become a committed proponent
of campaign reform because of the criticism he had endured for
zealously exploiting the system's flaws. Gore said in his speech in
March that he and President Clinton (with their Republican
opponents) had ``pushed the system to the breaking point'' and
fueled public cynicism about politics and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional advocates of campaign revisions speak
similarly of Gore during his eight years in the House and eight
years in the Senate: he was a reliable vote and co-signer, but his
heart was elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Quinn, Gore's communications director, said that it was
difficult to discern his motives or the depth of his feelings after
so much time. But she conceded that as a member of Congress, hehad
devoted far more effort to arms control, the environment and
technology policy than to election law. She added that there was
considerable evidence that Gore early on recognized the value of
campaign finance as both a substantive and a symbolic issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 newspaper column, Gore, then a representative, wrote
that changing the campaign finance system was ``one of the most
important steps we can take to return government to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he co-sponsored legislation introduced by Rep.
Abner J. Mikva, D-Ill., to impose limits on spending in House
campaigns in exchange for partial public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also co-signed a bill in 1979, sponsored by Rep. David R.
Obey, D-Wis., to limit the amount of money that a political action
committee could give to a candidate and the total amount of PAC
money a candidate could receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mikva and Obey bills went nowhere. But Gore can now
justifiably claim he was an early proponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Gore, by then a senator, sponsored a bill to provide
public financing for Senate campaigns. In 1988, he introduced
legislation to give presidential candidates free television time,
to cut the cost of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment was early and consistent, and he is clearly
convinced from his own experience that this is essential to his
success as president and is desperately needed now to steady the
course of the country,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikva, who since leaving Congress in 1979 has been a federal
judge and White House counsel under Clinton, said that he had
little recollection of Gore's support for his political fight to
finance congressional campaigns with public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not at the top of his agenda,'' Mikva said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikva's 1979 legislation was a precursor of the centerpiece of
Gore's proposal this year. It would have created a fund to pay for
general election campaigns of candidates who agreed to limit their
spending. Gore's more ambitious proposal, which he calls the
Democracy Endowment, would create a $7 billion fund to pay for
campaigns of candidates who agree not to take any outside money.
Both measures aimed to break the link between those who write the
checks and those who write the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mikva agreed with Gore's acknowledgment that he was an
``imperfect messenger'' for campaign reform, having exploited every
available loophole in his campaigns for Congress and the vice
presidency and fashioned a few new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Gore was wise to adopt the cause of reform now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased when he made a big issue of campaign finance
reform,'' Mikva said. ``The consequences of 1996 are going to
plague him anyway. If he's going to try to pretend it didn't happen
and say nothing, he's worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal would provide public financing of campaigns from
a $7 billion fund to be filled with tax-deductible contributions
from many of the same interests and individuals who now fuel
campaigns _ but without the direct contributions to candidates. It
would also outlaw so-called soft money, the unlimited contributions
from corporations, unions, interest groups and wealthy donors,
require greater disclosure of independent expenditures and provide
free television time for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But until such laws are enacted, Gore intends to aggressively
employ the current system to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told contributors at a $500,000 soft-money luncheon in
Washington on Wednesday that he had no intention of taking a
high-minded vow of poverty in his combat with Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight fire with fire,'' he said.

<P>
   FULTON, Texas _ Along the harbor docks of this windswept village
of 1,000 on the Texas coast where several dozen shrimp boats rock
on their moorings in a steady southeasterly breeze, shrimpers are
facing two unwelcome changes _ declining shrimp stocks and the
likelihood of tougher government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the shortage of shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico, the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is considering stringent new
measures for an industry already reeling from decades of government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to preside over the death of a fishery,'' said
Hal Osburn, director of the department's coastal fisheries program,
noting that an 18-month study shows that shrimp have dwindled to 30
percent of their historical levels and may soon reach a point that
makes it impossible for the remaining shrimp to reproduce fast
enough to replenish the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, the entire fishery collapses and everyone
loses, the shrimpers, the sports fishermen and the public,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures being contemplated by the agency are
increased regulation of net mesh sizes, reduced catch limits, and
seasonal and area closures of some fishing grounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many shrimpers, more regulations of the industry only
mean more problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much laws already,'' Haun Nguyen, a 32-year old Vietnamese
shrimper lamented. Working aboard his battered 42-foot wooden
vessel, the Saint John, Nguyen said: ``Somebody in Austin need a
job, so they make up rules. They make it too hard to make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, a father of three who works 12 hours a day seven days a
week fishing alone in the waters of Aransas Bay, says that there
are plenty of shrimp in the bay if only the government would allow
shrimpers to harvest them.
</P>
<P>
   Any perceived shortages, he says, are the result of
environmental pollution from pesticides off farmlands draining into
the bay, or more likely, he says, an increase in trout and redfish
resulting from restocking programs managed by area fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   But Osburn said two major changes over the last 20 years have
made increased regulatory efforts necessary: an influx of primarily
Asian refugees like Nguyen seeking a livelihood from the shrimping
industry, and the invention of ``peeler technology,'' which created
a market for extremely small shrimp that would otherwise be
unprofitable to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Texas bay and Gulf shrimpers harvest about 70 million pounds of
fish annually, worth nearly $160 million, with a total $500 million
impact on the state's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout most of a shrimp's life, there is a fleet of
commercial vessels out there in active pursuit,'' Osburn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 1,400 bait shrimp vessels target the small shrimp in the
back bays. As shrimp grow and move into the primary bays, a bay
shrimping fleet of another 1,400 vessels seeks them. Finally, as
the shrimp reach maturity and move out to the Gulf, they are hunted
by a fleet of 2,300 licensed Gulf shrimping vessels, plus many
out-of-state boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrimping industry obviously doesn't like increased
regulation, but you can't keep doing that forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Jackson, 68, said he retired after 41 years of
shrimping in the bays and out in the Gulf of Mexico because ``I
just couldn't make a living at it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson said shrimpers face a bewildering tangle of state and
federal regulations and licensing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some times of the year you can only fish from sunrise until 2
in afternoon, sometimes you can't fish at night, sometimes you can
only catch certain sizes and only so much of that,'' he said. ``In
the Gulf, if you catch the wrong size at the wrong time of year,
you have to throw them back even though they're already dead. It's
a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Osburn says another program, buying back licenses from fishermen
while limiting new entries to the industry, offers the best hope
for future regulation. Despite the possible new rules, Nguyen has
no intention of quitting the shrimping industry, though he says he
would never let his children enter the business. ``It's too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulations are only part of the many difficulties feeding
Nguyen's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, who says he makes about $10,000 a year shrimping, says
rising fuel costs have soared to $100 of his average daily earnings
of $150. And without warning, the owner of the docks at Fulton
Harbor notified him on April 1 that slip rentals would double from
$50 to $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, a key pulley that hoists his nets from the water
broke. As he climbed up among the nets to replace it, he pointed to
the shiny new pulley he had just bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty bucks I pay for this. No money for me today. No milk for
my kids. Tell somebody in Austin about that,'' he said.

   Dr. Donald Wilber, who planned the 1953 coup in Iran and wrote
its secret history, was old-school CIA, a Princetonian and a Middle
East architecture expert who fit neatly into the mold of the
``gentleman spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of wandering through Middle Eastern architectural sites
gave him the perfect cover for a clandestine life. By 1953, he was
an obvious choice as the operation's strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The coup was the high point of his life as a spy. Although he
would excel in academia, at the agency being part-time was a
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never requested promotion, and was given only one, after the
conclusion of Ajax,'' Wilber wrote of the Iran operation.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day, ``I was ushered down to the lobby by a young
secretary, turned over my badge to her and left.'' He added, ``This
treatment rankled for some time. I did deserve the paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilber died in 1997, at the age of 89.

   MIAMI _ With the showdown over Elian Gonzalez on hold pending a
court ruling, hundreds of Cuban-Americans still turned out Saturday
at the Little Havana home of the boy's Miami relatives, praying,
singing and showing their determination to keep the 6-year-old in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time here,'' said Adolfo Jimenez(cq), 36, a
soft-spoken attorney who brought his young daughter in a stroller
and stood for several hours in a broiling South Florida sun to
protest government plans to turn Elian over to his father. ``I've
never seen the Cuban community unified like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After a week of tension and drama, both sides in the controversy
were awaiting a ruling by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which last week issued a temporary ban on removing Elian
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The court is considering whether to leave the ban in place until
it hears arguments at a May 11 hearing on a lawsuit stemming from
the case. Its ruling could come at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives are asking the court to overturn a
decision in March by a Miami federal judge who sided with a
decision by federal officials to send the boy back to his father.
Government officials have asked the court to order the boy reunited
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, until the court case is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff reached a crisis last week after Attorney General
Janet Reno came to South Florida and met with Elian and his Miami
relatives in an 11th-hour bid to resolve the dispute. But her
efforts failed, and Reno issued an order telling the family they
must turn Elian over.
</P>
<P>
   The family refused, angrily vowing to hold the boy as long as
possible. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, said he would stand
aside if federal agents came to his home, but would not take the
boy elsewhere to be turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Cuban exiles surrounded his home Thursday as Reno's
2 p.m. deadline approached, but no agents came for the boy. The
situation went back into a holding pattern a short time later when
the Atlanta court issued its temporary ban on removing Elian from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Miami relatives opened another legal front,
asking a Washington, D.C. federal court to block Elian's removal to
Cuba until the government certifies that his human rights won't be
violated there. A judge set a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Justice Department sent a letter to Lazaro
Gonzalez officially revoking Elian's immigration status and telling
Gonzalez that he is in violation of the law for continuing to
``exercise control over Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno apparently still hopes the family might resolve the crisis
on its own, and has offered to provide a secure retreat where the
two sides can live separately for a week or two, sharing time with
Elian while they negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami relatives will agree to such a deal only if they
aren't required to turn the boy over permanently to his father,
while Juan Miguel Gonzalez has insisted he get custody of his son
at any reunion. Gonzalez has promised to remain in the United
States pending the outcome of the case in the Atlanta court, but
that apparently has not been enough for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if any further negotiations were taking place
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has made it clear that she wants the boy reunited with his
father, and federal officials have been working on a plan to
extract Elian from the Little Havana house if the family continues
its refusal to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors have vowed to block any removal, saying they will
form a human chain around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sit in the street,'' said Eliseo Rodriguez(cq) , who
said serving time in an American jail would be easy compared to the
9 years he spent in Cuban prisons in the 1960s for opposing Fidel
Castro. ``I will put out my hands and let them arrest me, but
others won't. There will be trouble if they try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two sides of the Gonzalez family have
turned bitter, with both sides trading angry rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father reportedly is deeply hurt and angry over the
Miami family's actions, which have included parading the boy before
television cameras and the cheering crowd. The family also made a
videotape of Elian in which he addresses his father directly and
says he does not want to go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Miami relatives released an affidavit by a
Cuban man who said he is a friend of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Rodriguez _ who survived the boat crossing that left
Elian's mother and 10 others dead _ claims Gonzalez beat his wife
and inflicted his ``violent nature'' on Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's Washington attorney, Gregory Craig,
blasted the allegations Saturday, saying they showed the Miami
family's desperation.

COUPLE GIVES WELLESLEY $25 MILLION, RECORD FOR A WOMEN'S COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the largest donation ever to a women's college, a New York
couple has given $25 million to Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   The gift from Lulu Wang, a Wellesley alumna, and her husband,
Anthony, will pay for the design and construction of a campus
center, and was announced as the college began a five-year campaign
to raise $400 million, the most ambitious fund-raising goal ever
set by a women's college.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the campaign will be used to increase funds
available for scholarships, expand academic and internship
programs, and restore the landscaping on the college's 500-acre
campus in suburban Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Since women have traditionally lagged behind men in charitable
giving, women's colleges have had less success than coeducational
institutions in fund-raising; it is no longer rare for a coed
university to succeed in a $1 billion campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley's president, Diana Chapman Walsh, said the gift from
the Wangs ``shattered that shibboleth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This says women are loyal, and they care, and they care about
causes that have to do with women and the institutions that help
women to make a difference in the world,'' she said. ``When we pull
this campaign off, it will say that women are every bit as capable
of raising money to support an institution they love as men are. We
don't have to think of them as any less capable in that realm any
more than we have to think of them as less capable in any other
realm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wangs, prominent collectors of American art and furniture,
have made quieter donations to several New York institutions over
the years, Walsh said. They decided to announce this gift publicly,
she said, to ``raise everyone's sights'' as the campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Wangs declined to be interviewed, but in a statement, Lulu
Wang said, ``We are delighted to help create a building that will
facilitate the creation of the strong bonds among students,
faculty, colleagues and alumnae that are one of the hallmarks of
Wellesley College.''
</P>
<P>
   Lulu Wang is the founder of Tupelo Capital Management, a name
chosen tongue-in-cheek with reference to one of Wellesley's more
girlish traditions. If a student walks her ``young man'' around the
school's large lake three times, and by the third loop he has not
proposed marriage, she is allowed _ and encouraged _ to push him
into the lake at the point on the shore where the tupelo tree
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has been a member of Wellesley's board of trustees since
1988, and is the first woman to head the board's investment
committee, which is in charge of investing the college's endowment,
valued at about $1 billion. She also heads the finance committee of
the New York Community Trust and serves on a number of other boards
in New York, including the Rockefeller Family Fund, WNYC and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Wang, a Yale alumnus, retired in 1992 as president and
chief operating officer of Computer Associates International, a
software company.

<P>
   ASTANA, Kazakhstan _ At the start of a five-day visit to Central
Asia, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Saturday renewed
American criticism of Kazakhstan for its sale of some 40 MiG
fighter jets to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev reproached Albright, too _
for, in essence, not minding her own business.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of remarks, at a news conference after a meeting at
the presidential palace, stemmed from the recent appointments of
two senior government officials whose dismissal last year helped
persuade Albright not to impose sanctions on Kazakhstan over the
MiG sale last June.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is on a visit to three former Soviet republics in the
Caspian Sea region, where the United States has sought to increase
its influence in recent years because of the region's enormous
reserves of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also coincides with a time of rising Western concern
about the flow of weapons and narcotics through the area. For
example, Uzbekistan authorities seized a shipment from Kazakhstan
this month that they said contained radioactive material.
Kazakhstan has denied the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan's sale of the 1960s-era MiG jets, which experts say
are effective in the Korean region despite their comparative
technological backwardness, severely strained relations with the
United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has tried to discourage weapons sales to
several countries that it considers dangerous, like Iraq, Libya and
North Korea. Countries that carry out such sales are subject to a
range of sanctions, including a possible cutoff of American foreign
assistance. Kazakhstan has received $550 million in American aid
since the Soviet Union came apart in 1991, according to
Kazakhstan's figures.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the sanctions threat, Nazarbayev dismissed his
closest aide, Chief of Security Nurtay Abykaev, and his defense
minister, Mukhtar Altynbaev, last fall. In recent weeks, however,
Abykaev was named deputy foreign minister, and Altynbaev was
appointed chief of the air force.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kazakhstan courts have acquitted one Kazakhstani
who was charged in the case, and awarded an amnesty to the only
remaining defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks, Albright praised Nazarbayev for tightening
controls on the flow of conventional weapons abroad since the sale.
The Kazakh leader, too, thanked the United States for its advice on
how to prevent illegal transfers of conventional arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the two officials dispensed with niceties regarding the
recent appointments. ``I expressed our disappointment and
surprise,'' Albright said, sitting next to Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that U.S. officials were
particularly angry over Abykaev's return to government this month.
``Coming so close to Albright's visit, we look at it as in our
face,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev said that Abykaev and Altynbaev had been ``punished
enough,'' arguing that their new jobs were ``three levels junior to
what they previously held.'' Nazarbayev blamed the sale of the MiGs
on private citizens, who he said doctored government documents so
the planes could be diverted to North Korea. He said two suspects
were being pursued abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to reprove Albright, saying it was ``not the place
of the secretary of state to decide'' the fate of Kazakhstan
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is also to visit Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state has had to approach the republics
delicately. While the United States considers Kazakhstan and, to a
lesser extent, Uzbekistan strategically important, the entire
region has essentially jettisoned earlier democratic pretensions in
the last two years and conducted blatantly rigged elections.

 &HT;    POLICE MAKE PRE-EMPTIVE RAID AS NATION'S CAPITAL BRACES FOR
SUNDAY PROTESTS
 &HT;    By BOB DART and ALEC SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police seized materials that they said could be
used to make firebombs and closed the training center for
protesters Saturday as the nation's capital braced for mass
demonstrations against the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of activists, bearing backpacks and bravado,
gathered in the rain and vowed not to be deterred from shutting
down the meetings of the world trade organizations on Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, they've made us more passionate,'' said Katie, a
friendly Wittenberg University student from Springfield, Ohio, who
had a phone number written prominently on her arm in indelible ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the legal team _ in case I get thrown in jail,'' she
explained, adding she didn't want to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   The drizzly day began with police and fire officials entering
the protesters' ``convergence center'' _ a brick warehouse across
town from the World Bank, which is located several blocks from the
White House and has been blocked off by crowd-control barricades
for days.
</P>
<P>
   The fire department had been warned of possible code violations
in the building, said Capt. Brian Lee. They closed the warehouse as
being ``immediately dangerous to life and health'' after finding
propane stoves and other hazards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant chief Terry Gainer said police also found rags,
bottles and jars and flammable liquids that he said could be used
in making ``Molotov cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters scoffed at the notion that they were making bombs.
What the police seized was paint remover and other materials to
make banners and placards, said Patrick Reinsborough, a spokesman
for the Mobilization for Global Justice, the umbrella organization
for scores of groups including, labor unions to environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even took our puppets,'' he said. ``It was clearly an
effort to silence us.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters promptly moved their ``action prep'' and other
activities to a community center and sidewalks several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a decentralized movement without leaders. This was just
one physical space, so closing it isn't going to change what is
happening,'' said Reinsborough. ``It just makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have made at least 20 arrests since demonstrators began
arriving in the past week _ several for allegedly possessing
ammunition and plastic pipes and chains used to link protesters
together into human barricades. Police Chief Charles Ramsey said he
expected 10,000 or more protesters to be here for the annual
meeting of financial ministers and world bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of protesters are united in their accusations
that international financiers are destroying the environment
through improper development in Third World countries and imposing
monetary policies that hurt poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor in
the world,'' said Art Gish, who has been a social activist for 40
years. ``World trade organizations help cause it. I'm part of a
global movement that is determined to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gish is an organic farmer who looked the part with his white
beard and broad-brimmed straw hat. He grows vegetables near Athens,
Ohio, and came to the protest with a group of students from Ohio
University.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters came in all ages and attire. Some had florescent
hair and pierced nostrils, lips and tongues. Others appeared to be
outfitted by L.L. Bean. They sipped bottled water and ate bread and
bean sprouts and dispersed for activities ranging from a ``Cinema
of Resistance Filmfest'' to a ``Save the Redwoods'' teach-in to a
protest outside a Gap store.
</P>
<P>
   Starlene Rankin, a gray-haired Green Party activist from Ames,
Iowa, talked earnestly with the row of stern men and women wearing
bright orange raincoats and white helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling those officers that they don't have to do
this. They can take off those uniforms and not be robots for the
police state,'' she explained. ``I'm trying to appeal to their
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   She was undeterred by her failure to find converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be in the streets tomorrow with or without
puppets,'' she vowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a loser high school dropout who doesn't like the way
this country is going and wants to change it,'' said Chris, 21, who
came with a New Jersey group called ``Food Not Bombs'' and didn't
want to give his last name. ``The more people who protest to show
that we're unhappy with the way the system is, the harder it is to
ignore us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were still stirred by the spirit of Seattle, where
sometimes violent protests disrupted world trade talks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct action is the tactic that we have to use,'' said David
Hill, a labor organizer who graduated last spring from the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason we're getting so much attention here _ the
only reason that you're talking to me now _ is because of what
happened in Seattle,'' said Hill, who works for a union in New
York. ``Labor is a big part of the movement, but the union didn't
order me to come here. I'm doing this on my own. We're going to try
to shut down the city.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the protesters have promised non-violent
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been saying all the time that it will be peaceful, I
just hope they honor that. We don't want trouble here. We hope the
demonstrators don't resort to that type of activity,'' Chief Ramsey
told reporters. He said police had confiscated large plastic pipe
sections used to connect ``sleeping dragons'' _ human chains _ as
well as gas masks, chains, chicken wire, duct tape and rope.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, police raided a house and found small-caliber
ammunition and firebomb instructions, Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said two people were arrested on Saturday morning for
refusing to obey police orders to leave the ``convergence center.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, about 20 protesters staged a dawn protest outside the
home of World Bank President James Wolfensohn. On his way to work,
Wolfensohn listened to the reading of a protest letter and saw
signs saying ``Wake Up World Bank'' before leaving.

 &HT;    Hollywood gives generously to Democrats
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood and the entertainment industry have
become one of the biggest and most reliable sources of political
money for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Gore and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for a New York Senate seat, are reaping the biggest
dividends from Hollywood. The Democratic Party as a whole is
benefiting even more, taking in millions in unregulated ``soft
money'' donations from film moguls like the DreamWorks SKG
triumverate comprised of David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey
Katzenberg, among other Hollywood celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the DreamWorks trio, whose film credits include the
Academy award-winning ``American Beauty,'' threw a fund-raiser for
the Democratic Party, raising about $2 million, much of it in soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties all have their soft money troughs,'' said Don
Simon, a consultant for Common Cause. ``The Democrats have
Hollywood and the trial lawyers and the Republicans have a lot of
other business groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``From now until the election, we are going to see a
spectacle of extraordinary proportions in terms of the presidential
candidates going around the country sucking up soft money. It's
really going to dwarf what happened in 1996, which in itself was a
depressing spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws restrict the amount individuals can give to
candidates. But their are no restrictions on soft money donations
to the parties, which can use the funds to finance expensive
television advertising in support of the party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The soft money chase puts Gore in an awkward position
politically. Gore has vowed to make campaign finance reform,
including a ban on soft money, the first piece of domestic
legislation he submits to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem to talk about ending the soft money system at
the same time you are participating in the soft money system.,''
Simon said. ``He has to demonstrate his credibility on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal streak that runs through Hollywood and the
entertainment industry has long translated into an affinity for the
Democratic Party and Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship blossomed under the Clinton administration.
State dinners at the White House routinely include well-known
actors and actresses, some of whom have been overnight guests at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When the White House planned ``America's Millennium Gala,'' the
light and music extravaganza on the Mall to ring in the New Year,
Clinton turned to Spielberg to produce an 18-minute movie for the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Jones and George Stevens Jr. were tapped to produce the
gala. Jones himself has contributed $10,000 in soft money to
Democrats this election cycle, and Stevens has contributed to Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Spahn, a spokesman for DreamWorks who formerly worked on
Gary Hart's presidential campaign, said Hollywood feels both a
generational and intellectual affinity for the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very creative, passionate community and this is a
very brilliant, compassionate president,'' Spahn said. ``There were
a lot of very real relationships established.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Mrs. Clinton are now benefiting the most from the
strength of those ties. Walt Disney Co. employees are the largest
group of contributors to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mrs. Clinton has raised more
than $321,000 from television, music and entertainment
personalities, according to the center, and that does not include
contributions to a separate New York Senate fund that has been
established to help her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore outraised Gov. George W. Bush among entertainment industry
people by more than two to one, according to the Campaign Study
Group in Virginia, which analzyed figures for the Los Angeles
Times. Gore raised almost $500,000 and Bush raised just over
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's celebrity contributors include Nicolas Cage, Chevy Chase,
Kevin Costner, Robert DeNiro, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Jerry
Seinfeld, Candice Bergen, Muriel Hemingway and Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's backers, only actor Chuck Norris, who lists an
address in Texas, stands out. Bush has also received some money
from Terry Semel, the former chairman of Warner Bros., and producer
Jon Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Horowitz, who lives in Los Angeles and is an active
Republican, said Republicans in Hollywood are fearful that their
political views will hurt their careers in a culture that is
dominantly liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of political McCarthyism that reigns in
Hollywood,'' Horowitz said. ``There are Republicans in Hollywood,
but the reason you don't see numbers there is because the (Federal
Election Commission) will disclose any contribution you make and
you'll get punished....It's like giving money to Nazis because
that's the way they think of Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Horowitz also said that Republican presidential candidates
and GOP leaders in Washington have hurt their image in Hollywood by
blaming the industry for violence among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle and Republican nominee Bob Dole
both attacked Hollywood in well-publicized remarks about what they
perceived as the negative moral content of Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have helped this along,'' said Horowitz, who has
joined with liberals to fight government intrusion in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Columbine massacre last year, both Clinton and Gore
have adopted tougher rhetoric on Hollywood, calling on studio
executives to exercise more restraint in producing movies with
sexual and violent content.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clinton ordered the Federal Trade Commission to
conduct an inquiry into how the entertainment industry markets
sexual or violent material to young people. Hollywood executives
were not happy about the inquiry, set to be concluded this summer,
but are voluntarily cooperating with the FTC, said FTC spokesman
Mitch Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn, the DreamWorks spokesman, counted the FTC inquiry among
the few ``differences'' Hollywood had with the Clinton-Gore
administration. But he said that issue paled in comparison to gun
control, abortion rights, the environment and other issues that
Hollywood cares about and that Clinton and Gore support.

SPORTS COLUMN: DOES NO. 1 PICK FIND HIS WAY TO CANTON? NOT
USUALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At noon on Saturday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue opened the
National Football League's annual draft of college talent by
announcing that the Cleveland Browns were ``now on the clock'' with
the No. 1 choice. Within 15 minutes, the Browns had to select what
they projected to be an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a partition adorned with photos of past No. 1 choices in
the Theater at Madison Square Garden, Courtney Brown, a massive
defensive end from Penn State, soon heard Tagliabue announce his
name. Brown is touted as ``the next Bruce Smith,'' the longtime
Buffalo Bills pass rusher now with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But will Brown provide enough impact to sculpt a bronze bust in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   According to the impact rate of the overall No. 1 choices since
1936, it's possible but unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype each year that surrounds the very first choice
in the draft as if he were some sort of superman in shoulder pads,
only nine No. 1 selections are enshrined in Canton, Ohio: Earl
Campbell, Lee Roy Selmon, Terry Bradshaw, O.J. Simpson, Buck
Buchanan, Paul Hornung, Chuck Bednarik, Charley Trippi and Bill
Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Three loom as Hall of Famers when they are eligible for
election: John Elway, Bruce Smith and Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Four others have already displayed enough Hall of Fame potential
in their early NFL seasons to be projected as possible inductees at
Canton barring an injury that would diminish their career: Drew
Bledsoe, Orlando Pace, Keyshawn Johnson and Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   At best, that adds up to only 16 out of the previous 70 overall
No. 1 choices, counting the six years from 1961 through 1966 during
the NFL's war with the American Football League when each league
had a No. 1 choice before the merger agreement created a common
draft in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 out of 70 is a .229 average, little more than one out of
five, not very good considering that the team selecting No. 1 each
year has the pick of the litter.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage is better lately. In the 17 drafts that began
with Elway's selection in 1983, seven No. 1 choices are either sure
or projected Hall of Famers, more than one out of three. That's
much better than the nine from the first 44 years that are already
enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   Of those nine, five were running backs _ Campbell, Simpson,
Hornung, Trippi and Dudley _ and only one was a quarterback,
Bradshaw. Selmon was a defensive end, Buchanan a defensive tackle,
Bednarik both a center and linebacker who was the NFL's last
two-way player.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 49 players chosen for the NFL's 75th anniversary team
in 1994, only one was an overall No. 1 choice _ Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   So the moral is that most of the NFL's best players were not
overall No. 1 choices; sometimes nowhere close to being the No. 1
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Montana, the best quarterback of the last two decades, was a
third-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Starr, the quarterback on Vince Lombardi's five NFL
championship teams in Green Bay, was the Packers' 17th-round choice
in 1956. Both are in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, but occasionally, the No. 1 choice turned into his
team's worst nightmare, a bust who never made any impact at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest bust was Aundray Bruce, an all-American
linebacker at Auburn who was chosen by Atlanta with the very first
pick in 1986. After four seasons with the Falcons, only the first
two as a starter, he played for the Raiders as a backup and
special-teams player through the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was what pro football people call a ``tweener,'' lacking
either a linebacker's speed or a pass-rushing defensive end's size.
But more than anything else, he was a wasted No. 1 choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the unluckiest choice was Ki-Jana Carter, the Penn State
running back hounded by injuries, especially a damaged knee in his
first exhibition game after being chosen by the Cincinnati Bengals
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Not that most No. 1 choices didn't turn out to be established
players, if not deserving of All-Pro or Pro Bowl honors, like the
Heisman Trophy running backs Bo Jackson, George Rogers and Billy
Sims, as well as such feared pass-rushers as Ed (Too Tall) Jones,
John Matuszak and Bubba Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But as history shows, just because a team has the No. 1 overall
choice doesn't mean that its pick will have enough impact to be
elected eventually into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  &QL;

<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ Here in the heart of tranquil, suburban
Connecticut, there is loud and angry strife over a plan to renovate
the field behind a local elementary school so it can be used by
adult softball leagues. In Chappaqua, N.Y., residents have been
fighting a small civil war over where to build a much-needed middle
school and which grades to put in it.
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, a recent battle raged for
more than eight months over where in Riverside Park to put a new
dog run. In Port Washington, on Long Island, homeowners' groups
have blocked a nature trail from being built on bluffs overlooking
the rocky North Shore. Every neighborhood has its factions, every
faction has a lawyer, every planning board has a headache.
</P>
<P>
   NIMBY, the overcooked acronym for ``not in my backyard,'' once
referred to disputes about garbage dumps and hazardous waste sites.
In the 1980s, it came to symbolize a backlash against affordable
(read: lower income) housing and social service sites like halfway
houses and homeless shelters _ virtually anything seen as a
potential threat to property values. In many cases, it still refers
to all of these.
</P>
<P>
   But in wealthy communities across the New York region, the
pitched battles are now over ball fields and libraries, school
buildings, churches and housing for the elderly _ projects once
seen as pillars of an upright community. Instead of pitting
citizens against big developers or government, they often pit
neighbor against neighbor in ugly feuds, dividing parts of the same
town, for example, or homeowners and a local Little League.
</P>
<P>
   With so many battles underway, there is now an arsenal of
acronyms. Added to NIMBY and LULU, for ``locally unaccepted land
use,'' there is NIMTOO, the elected official's retort, ``not in my
term of office,'' and NIMBL, the budget director's cry, ``not in my
bottom line.'' Hard-liners can try NIABY, ``not in anybody's
backyard''; NOPE, ``not on planet Earth''; or BANANA, ``build
absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, particularly in the New York area, according to
politicians, planners and academic experts, is a combination of
much wealth, little open space and a culture permeated by what many
say is a heightened sense of entitlement. Add in stricter
environmental laws and society's increasingly litigious tendencies,
and the result is NIMBY defined down so that almost any irritant is
a fair reason to tie a community in knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally in this era, people are thinking of smaller and
smaller backyard issues,'' said Rosalyn Baxandall, a professor of
American studies at the State University of New York in Old
Westbury. ``People are fighting for these little perks,'' she said,
noting that wealth breeds a sense of entitlement. ``People of a
certain class think they have these rights and that they have
earned them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, there are serial complainers. The Beresford
cooperative on Central Park West, home to numerous celebrities,
fought for the better part of two years to stop construction of the
American Museum of Natural History's new planetarium, saying that
it would draw more noise, crowds and pollution and that it was just
plain ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits failed, the new planetarium is open and the
Beresford is now protesting plans for a monument honoring Alfred
Nobel on West 81st Street, saying the block is already too crowded
with a hot dog stand, newspaper boxes, a subway station and a bus
stop to also accommodate tourists gawking at a 19-foot statue.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such heightened civic discord, marked by crowded zoning board
hearings, petition drives, angry letters and bitter lawsuits, poses
a thorny question: whether there are legitimate reasons for people
to feel so beleaguered or if the long bull market has spawned a
comfort class of adults even more spoiled than their charge-card
carrying children.
</P>
<P>
   Some NIMBY combatants clearly think it is the latter. ``I am
astounded at the xenophobic rantings of my neighbors,'' Alan
Neigher, a lawyer, wrote to Fairfield's planning and zoning
commission about the ball field dispute here. ``There is an
underlying, whispered sentiment among too many of my neighbors that
Greenfield Hill is somehow exempt from the ordinary travails of
civic life. It is argued that because we pay more taxes, we should
have more privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood battles can help address legitimate concerns.
On the Upper West Side, for instance, safety issues emerged over
putting a dog run in Riverside Park where pets and their owners
would have to cross a running track, creating the possibility of
collisions with joggers. But such points are typically overshadowed
by emotional arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our neighborhood, people come out objecting to anything for
all kinds of reasons,'' said Eric M. Nelson, the chairman of an
Upper West Side community board. ``Some of the reasons you can't
even fathom until you hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The battles have become so prevalent in the suburbs, where
people feel besieged by sprawling development and exponential
population growth, that several local officials said residents must
reconsider their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reconcile why we are here in the suburbs and how do
we retain what we love about them without sacrificing other parts
of it,'' said Marion S. Sinek, the town supervisor of New Castle,
which includes Chappaqua. ``Everybody wants the amenities that
belong to a municipality, but at the same time they would like to
retain the rural look, and something has got to give.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is perhaps best summed up in what may be the most
common land-use dispute in the region: the opposition to cellular
telephone signal towers. As ubiquitous as cell phones are in
suburban households, it is almost impossible to find a town within
75 miles of New York where someone is not fighting an antenna
installation.
</P>
<P>
   While the specifics of each feud differ, the basic ingredients
are the same. One side advocates a project purportedly for the
betterment of the entire community. The other side, concerned
primarily with protecting quality of life and property values,
counters with any number of reasons _ environmental issues, local
government finances, zoning regulations, public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenfield Hill Village Improvement Society hired a
hydrologist to study water runoff effects of the expanded field.
Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington hired engineers to
disprove claims that the bluffs could not support a nature trail.
The Chappaqua Alliance for the Respect of the Environment used
naturalists to show the new school's impact on wood frogs and box
turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A NIMBY concern can be very legitimate,'' said Susan Pender,
president of Citizens for Responsible School Planning, which helped
kill a proposal to build a middle school on the grounds of the high
school in Chappaqua. ``The people who live right around there were
ultimately proved right by the traffic study. Their NIMBY
reasoning, which is you can't do this because of the traffic, was
absolutely correct.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, residents near the 43-acre site ultimately
selected by the school board are still battling what they see as an
effort to despoil valuable open space. And Pender and other critics
of the original site are back circulating outraged petitions over
plans for the new middle school and the existing one to operate as
separate schools, each serving grades five through eight. They
advocate that the town use one middle school building, for grades 5
and 6 and another for grades 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aggrieved parents say the board's plan, which is overwhelmingly
supported by educators, would be unfair to residents whose children
attend one elementary school and then would be split up after
fourth grade and sent to both middle schools. Students at the other
two elementary schools in town would graduate as a group to the
same middle school.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it looks like a nasty family feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``People there care more about that school district than almost
anything; it is such an important part of their community value
structure,'' said Peter Liebowitz, of the White Plains office of
Allee, King, Rosen and Fleming, a planning and environmental firm
that represents the homeowners opposed to the current site for the
school. ``It's very distressing to watch. It was almost
uncomfortable, like you were sitting in someone's personal living
room listening to them have an argument.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Fairfield, the fight is also bitter. As Gretchen Hauser sees
it, the faded, rock-strewn ball field behind the Timothy Dwight
elementary school is the perfect place to address the town's
growing need for recreational space. Surrounded by mostly
town-owned woodlands, it could easily be expanded to accommodate
adult regulation softball as well as Little League baseball and
boys' and girls' soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But to Al Merric and other members of the Greenfield Hill
Village Improvement Society, expanding the field poses
environmental hazards and its use by adult teams would harm the
quality of life in a neighborhood that contains Fairfield's most
expensive homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move to this area because of its rural character,''
Merric, the group's president, said. ``It is extremely important to
us that we preserve the character.'' Merric said that adult teams
would increase traffic and noise.
</P>
<P>
   Merric's group has filed a lawsuit challenging a wetlands permit
granted by the town conservation commission and may also sue to
fight a variance for the project granted last week by the planning
and zoning commission. ``They feel we are just taking a
not-in-our-own-backyard attitude,'' Merric said. ``But really we
would do anything for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, a member of the town's parks and recreation commission,
thinks the opposition's position is ludicrous. She said other parts
of town carry the bulk of Fairfield's civic burden, including most
ball fields, the garbage dump, the sewage treatment plant and the
dog pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about people playing games,'' she said. ``You
are talking about people having fun. You are talking about your
fellow neighbor, your town neighbor using the neighborhood. We are
asking for two and half acres. They are talking about their
property values and their children's inheritance being destroyed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emotional toll runs high. In more traditional development
fights, like the effort by the town of Mamaroneck, N.Y., to prevent
the construction of a huge Ikea furniture store in neighboring New
Rochelle, it is easy to demonize the opposition _ a faceless
corporate entity. But for those in the more local fights, often the
opponent is someone they may bump into at the grocery store and
have to look in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Washington, Daniel Donatelli, the president of the
Highfield Estates Civic Association, which opposes the nature
trail, goes out of his way to praise Myron Blumenthal, the
president of the beautification group, for his work on other
issues, and to point out that the civic association has supported
two other segments of the trail and simply does not want
development on the bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, experts say, is to negotiate as much as possible,
keeping residents well-informed, and to remind individuals to
balance their needs against those of the community at large.
Planners say fights are inevitable. ``You can't put pen to paper
without worrying what the community reaction is going to be,''
Liebowitz, from the White Plains environmental firm, said. ``It's
very difficult to try to do something kind of quantitatively
objective or neutral when the counterargument is emotional and
heartfelt.''

 &HT;    Miami's Cuban community strengthens its position
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Joe Carollo was furious. The Miami mayor heard that
Geraldo Rivera had just blurted out on network television that a
``mob'' was outside the home of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, Carollo rushed back to the round-the-clock
TV network encampment outside Elian's home to refute the latest
slap at the city's Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is a peaceful community, Carollo said for the hundredth
time. The crowds are nonviolent and legally assembled, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   While relatively adept on live television, the mayor and other
political leaders may find damage control in a post-Elian Miami to
be a bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   National polls show a huge majority of Americans favor returning
the boy to Cuba. And, perhaps more seriously, the uproar over Elian
has deepened the already gaping divisions between racial and ethnic
groups in Miami-Dade County itself. None of Miami's other major
ethnic groups seems able to even remotely see the Elian saga as
Cuban-Americans see it. In fact, they often seem to resent the
Cuban community's attachment to the young boy.
</P>
<P>
   University of Miami professor Juan Carlos Espinosa likens it to
the gulf between white and non-white reactions following the
not-guilty verdict in the 1995 O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to be living on different planets,'' said
Espinosa, assistant director of UM's Institute for Cuban and
Cuban-American Studies. ``For a lot of people, this became another
excuse for Cuban bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Local polls show the rift. A survey conducted by The Miami
Herald and NBC-Channel Six a week ago showed non-Hispanics in Miami
were less sympathetic to Elian's plight than non-Hispanics in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa says the poll may have simply offered non-Hispanics an
opportunity to vent their frustration after years of watching
economic and political power shift to an immigrant population that
often prefers Spanish over English.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has changed demographically, and there are people
who have great resentment,'' Espinosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Hispanics saw Cuban-Americans using Elian for purely
political reasons while ignoring the father's rights to claim his
own child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single argument about why Elian should stay begins and
ends with Fidel Castro,'' said Joe Oglesby, an associate editor of
The Herald. ``There is no sympathy and not much empathy for that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The least sympathetic was Miami's black community, whose own
long-standing civil rights issues don't command equal attention
from Cuban-American political leaders. American and Haitian-born
blacks can only dream of the political clout and media-drawing
powers of the Cuban-Americans, who number about 800,000 in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   So sure is the Cuban community of the righteousness of its
cause, so sure is it of its own might, that it has been able to
stare down the full might of the federal government for months,
including Miami-born Attorney General Janet Reno, who has a
reputation as one public official who cannot be pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   But many Cubans and non-Cubans alike were astounded when 22
mayors stood in front of the federal courthouse on March 29 and
said they would not help federal authorities carry out an order to
pick up Elian from his Little Havana home. Miami-Dade County Mayor
Alex Penelas said he would blame Reno and President Clinton for any
outbreak of rioting. An editorial in The Herald the next day called
Penelas' remarks ``incendiary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban-American businesswoman, Maria Elena Torano, said she was
disappointed by such shrill threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of Havana in 1959 and 1960 when 'Yankee go
home' was heard all over,'' said Torano. ``We left Cuba because we
didn't want to listen to those kinds of refrains.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cuban-American leadership fails to understand is that
they are the majority political power behaving as a minority, said
H.T. Smith, a Miami attorney and activist in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't feel that our mayor was speaking for our
community,'' Smith said. ``He was speaking for his
'confederation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees Miami broken into a half-dozen major ethnic
``confederations'' that seldom interact. The Elian controversy has
further hardened the boundaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to fix that or move to a real big
confrontation in the future,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is no newcomer to Miami's ethnic battles. He led a boycott
of hotels when a half-dozen local mayors in 1990 denounced a visit
to Miami Beach by South African leader Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's crime? He said some nice things about Fidel Castro,
one of the voices around the world against South African apartheid.
The 3-year boycott cost the county about $30 million in lost
conventions and, many say, increased old enmity between the blacks
and Cuban-Americans here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Cuban leaders have an idealized view of their
brothers-in-arms links to the black community. Some protest leaders
justify their own acts of civil disobedience by quoting Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles don't apologize for their successes. In fact, they
are quite publicly proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around here for 41 years and have learned how the
system works,'' said Jorge Escala, 57, one of the thousands who
have demonstrated outside the Little Havana home where Elian is
staying. ``Other groups can do the same thing we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian touched the Cuban community like nothing before. Earlier
ideological battles _ the downing of Cuban-American light plane
pilots who had entered Cuban airspace in 1996 and last year's
protests over an orchestra from Cuba playing in downtown Miami _
saw divisions from within the Cuban community.
</P>
<P>
   Not Elian. Most Cubans see themselves in his innocent face. He
represents the struggle thousands have endured to escape Castro's
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for Americans to understand the position of the
Cuban community, unless you have experienced the cruelty of the
Castro regime,'' said Rafael Penalver, a Miami attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, for his part, says he doesn't see any urgent need to
mend fences with the city's other racial and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will be protecting Elian, and Miami will survive,''
Carollo said, wrapping up his final interview at Camp Elian, the
name given to the row of news media tents in front of Elian's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we haven't been hit by a nuclear bomb.''

FOR TOP PICKS IN NFL DRAFT, THEIR BIGGEST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-DRAFT, FBN-NOTEBOOK, FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Each year the National Football League invites a
handful of projected top picks to its draft. The players are
whisked through Manhattan streets from news conferences to
luncheons. They shake more hands than they have probably caught
footballs. At every destination, cameras await and questions from
reporters are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is the predraft drill.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours, their lives are shaped. Their new cities.
Their new teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was all unfolded for them Saturday in the Theater at Madison
Square Garden, where the draft was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Brown, LaVar Arrington, Chris Samuels, Peter Warrick
and Thomas Jones were among the top picks. On Friday, none of them
knew his destiny. But together they epitomized all of the hope and
anxiety, anticipation and emotion that the draft brings.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Brown
</P>
<P>
   Defensive End, Penn State
</P>
<P>
   After his senior season at Penn State, Brown was considered a
definite first-round pick, easily among the top 10. But then scouts
viewed his private workout on March 16 and left mesmerized. The
word was out. Brown was a can't-miss at defensive end, one of the
most difficult and important positions to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns made him the top pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Brown said: ``To be the first player picked would be
a real honor, a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at Bruce Smith and Reggie White and tried to learn
from them at my position,'' he said. ``But I don't compare myself
with any of them. Right now, that is not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is humble. He is a complete package in character and in
talent. Scouts say he will be a dominant NFL edge rusher. They love
his instincts. He is a natural.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   LaVar Arrington
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker, Penn State
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is an imposing player in size (6 feet 3 inches, 250
pounds) and in attitude. He talks intensely. He exudes confidence.
He is a pure football player, one who can roam from sideline to
sideline and leap over blockers to make Herculean plays.
</P>
<P>
   He has often been compared to Lawrence Taylor, the Hall of Fame
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington and Brown, his Penn State teammate, jostled for the
No. 1 spot in the draft. Cleveland chose Brown but was enamored of
Arrington, who went to Washington as the second overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just proud to be in the situation I'm in,'' Arrington
said. ``I'm a student of the game. My athleticism and leaping in
the air sometimes to make plays has never been an issue. I can make
the big play or the routine play, and it doesn't matter how you get
there as long as you can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whom his former coach, Joe Paterno of Penn State,
would choose if he were forced to choose between him or Brown as
the draft's top choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has a lot of respect for both of us, and I know he is
proud of us,'' Arrington said. ``But he would probably take
Courtney because Courtney plays defensive end. And the way Joe
plays football, that's the way he would see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Brown is the better player?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that question will be answered,'' Arrington said.
``Under the right circumstances, I can make a huge impact right
away. But anywhere I go, I'm going to be able to fit.''
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Chris Samuels
</P>
<P>
   Offensive Tackle, Alabama
</P>
<P>
   While Arrington was drafted by Washington with the No. 2 pick,
Samuels went to Washington, too, at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins absolutely adore Samuels at offensive tackle. He is
6-5 and 325 pounds. He explodes at the snap of the ball; his
opponent rarely gains the first step. He is excellent in motion,
sweeping left or right, to block defenders. His agility and his
foot quickness are exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very athletic for a big man, I run well, I'm a smart
player and I'm a good person,'' Samuels said, smiling. ``On and off
the field I handle business, and I won't do anything to hurt the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite NFL player is Jerry Rice. An offensive tackle who
patterns himself after a receiver? ``He is a class guy,'' Samuels
said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels said that he should often be eligible to catch passes
for his new team. He said he would find the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels certainly knows how to create a path for others to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick
</P>
<P>
   Receiver, Florida State
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Warrick steps into a room, eyes quickly follow him.
Warrick can feel everyone looking him over.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the guy who blew the Heisman, some are thinking. Who ran
into trouble at Florida State. Who returned and finished his senior
season in a blaze in the national championship game. Who slipped in
the draft from the top spot to the fourth, where he was chosen by
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of negativity around me sometimes,'' Warrick
said. ``People are very quick to judge me by something that
happened in college that I did wrong. But I know I can't please
everybody. I can only be what I am _ God's gift.''
</P>
<P>
   With flair. With drama.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was by far the best receiver in the draft, and many
believed he was the top player in the draft. Elusive. Exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick said his game is like that of the former Detroit Lion
Barry Sanders, though Sanders was a running back. Warrick can stop
and start, juke and spin, do all of the things with a football that
make him a special player.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to be in the NFL, not the top pick,'' Warrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   And how about revenge against the teams that passed him over?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got that in me,'' he said Friday. ``I want to make it to
take care of my mom, and I've got a 3-year-old girl. I want them to
have the best things in life. A lot of people say that if I'm
picked in the No. 4 position and wind up in Cincinnati that I won't
like it there. Right now, I'm nowhere. I can't complain. I'm going
from nothing to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jones
</P>
<P>
   Running Back, Virginia
</P>
<P>
   Jones was selected out of Virginia by Arizona at No. 7. In a
draft with backs with bigger, more well-known names (Wisconsin's
Ron Dayne, Tennessee's Jamal Lewis), he surfaced as the scouts'
favorite as the best back.
</P>
<P>
   Jones graduated as a junior but stayed at Virginia to play his
senior year. He was a three-time class president. And he knows
plenty about commitment. He flew to New York for Friday's predraft
activities, returned to Virginia on Friday night to speak to a
group of incoming freshmen _ not football players _ and headed back
to New York for the draft.

REAL ESTATE: IN NEW YORK, A SCATTERING OF NEW HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last few years have been good for New York City
hotels. Occupancy rates have been consistently near or over 80
percent, compared with 63 percent to 65 percent for the rest of the
country. Room rates have been rising, with the cost of a night in
the city last year averaging $213 before taxes, according to Ernst
&AMP; Young, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strong business, developers have found lenders
willing to finance new hotels. As a result, from 3,200 to 4,000 new
hotel rooms are set to open in Manhattan this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest number of new hotel rooms to open in the
city as long as I have been keeping a list, which is back to
1985,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF
Consulting, a hospitality specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The projects _ some new construction, some the renovation of
existing buildings _ are spread across Manhattan, from the southern
tip of the island to the Upper West Side, rather than concentrated
in the traditional midtown and downtown business districts. Some
real estate executives said this is a reflection of how Internet
start-ups and related companies have rejected the high rents and
perceived stuffiness of traditional business centers for places
like the Flatiron District and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   With a base of about 60,000 rooms already available, the influx
of new rooms is expected to trim occupancy rates only slightly. And
the new rooms may provide some good news for travelers by limiting
the rise in room rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect will be to probably reduce the occupancy rate by
one half to a full percentage point and limit room-rate increases
to $10 to $15 a night in calendar 2000,'' Fox said. Nevertheless,
New York will remain a pricey location compared with the rest of
the nation, where the average daily rate is estimated at $81 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts argue that additional hotel rooms cannot be added
fast enough. ``The New York hotel market is not one of the largest
in the nation,'' said Sean Hennessey, manager of the New York
hospitality practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and
consulting firm. ``Las Vegas and Orlando have about 120,000 rooms.
It could be that we are underserved rather than on the brink of a
glut.''
</P>
<P>
   The new offerings include both the luxurious and the
budget-minded: the return of the Ritz-Carlton brand to Manhattan
after an absence of two years, the advent of the Regent brand _
with a basic room rate of $545 a night _ and the arrival of a Red
Roof Inn, with rates starting at $89 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest hotel developer this year is Bruce C. Ratner,
the president of Forest City Ratner Companies, which plans to open
more than 900 rooms in hotels attached to entertainment and retail
complexes in Battery Park City and Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Embassy Suites Hotel in Battery Park City will have 463
rooms in a 383,000-square-foot complex facing North End Avenue that
will also include a 16-screen, 4,000-seat Regal Cinema, a
20,000-square-foot sports club and several restaurants and stores,
including a 6,500-square-foot Kinko's.
</P>
<P>
   The 444-room Hilton hotel on 42nd Street has been built atop a
335,000-square-foot development that is to include a 25-screen AMC
Entertainment motion picture theater, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum,
an HMV music store and assorted restaurants and stores. Both Ratner
hotels are expected to open this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said the addition of the entertainment, food and other
retail uses to the two projects improved the economics of the
hotels to the point where he could obtain financing.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz Mountain Industries, which
operates the SoHo Grand hotel and is due to open the 203-room
TriBeCa Grand, at Avenue of the Americas and Walker Street, next
month, said that finding financing for hotel projects is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels are the last asset class the lenders warm up to and the
first one they go cold on,'' Stern said. ``You can get hotel
financing for about 18 to 24 months in any 10-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said that when he took over the Battery Park City project
three years ago, the hotel business was rebounding from a sluggish
time in the early '90s and financiers were still skittish. ``This
is a good example of mixed-use development,'' he said. ``Another
developer had this site and could not make it work. When we took it
over we doubled the amount of retail to absorb more of the cost of
the land and taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since retailers typically pay a far higher rent per square foot
than do other tenants, devoting the lower floors of the two
projects to stores, restaurants and movies made the projects
bankable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, putting entertainment and retail stores in
the same building as the hotel improves the quality of a visit to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to New York they don't want to just stay at a
hotel,'' Ratner said. ``Putting the retail and the entertainment in
direct proximity to the hotel benefits both.'' Most of the rooms in
the Embassy Suites open to a central atrium, eliminating the long,
gloomy corridors common in large hotels. One wall of the atrium is
decorated by what the company said is New York's largest painting,
an 80-foot-high by 130-foot-wide work by Sol LeWitt titled ``Loopy
Doopy (Blue and Purple).''
</P>
<P>
   At the 42nd and 41st Street entrances for the Hilton, which is
between Seventh and Eighth avenues, there will be sculptures by Tom
Otterness of figures trying to topple clocks from the marquees.
Original art, sculpture and historic photographs will be in the
public spaces and guest rooms of both hotels. The value of the art
commissioned and purchased for the two hotels is put at $4 million
by the Public Art Fund, Forest City Ratner and Hilton Hotels, which
were partners in the art program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new hotels opening are much smaller than the Embassy
Suites, the Hilton and the Sofitel _ the other big, newly
constructed hotel, which is to open in June on West 44th Street,
between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, with 398 rooms.
Some emphasize a theme to differentiate them from hotels that
simply offer a room for the night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Few will be more highly themed than the Library, which is due to
open with 60 rooms by the end of May. It is being developed by
Henry Kallan, who recently opened a similar theme hotel, Giraffe,
at Park Avenue and 26th Street. He also owns the Casablanca Hotel
on 43rd Street just off Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Giraffe incorporates balconies in many of its guest rooms to
emphasize a European style. The Library, at Madison Avenue and 41st
Street, is named for its proximity to the New York Public Library
at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Library will have a restaurant on the first floor and a
library on the second. The library theme will be carried throughout
the renovated office building, with room numbers using the Dewey
decimal system and a ``library card'' instead of a room key.
</P>
<P>
   Kallan said that each floor would have a different subject, such
as social science, geography or Slavic languages. The rooms
themselves will be stocked with books on the theme subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are interested in a subject, you can book a room and
read up on it,'' said Kallan, who added that he expects to attract
guests from the publishing, fashion and cosmetics industries. He
said he was exploring the possibility of staging special events
with literary trappings, including one with a book-of-the-month
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Kallan said he would try to capitalize on the hotel's location a
block from Grand Central Terminal by developing the 14th floor as a
kind of clubhouse. Suburban spouses who wanted to come into the
city early to shop before meeting a working spouse for dinner or a
show would have a place to rest and store packages and would be
entitled to the corporate rate if they decided to stay the night.
</P>
<P>
   Rates at the Library are to range from $245 to $325 a night,
with the corporate discount lowering that to $195 to $225, Kallan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across 41st Street, Morris Moinian is preparing to open the
Dylan Hotel in late June or early July. Housed in a building that
was once home to the Chemists Club, the 108-room hotel is the
product of a complete renovation that added four stories to the
existing 10-story structure.
</P>
<P>
   Moinian, who owns Jordan, a woman's fashion company, and the
300-room Wyndham Sugar Bay Hotel in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands,
said he was convinced that there is a place for boutique hotels
that can attract people who prefer not to stay at mass-market
properties, such as the big hotels operated by Hilton and Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be attractive to creative people from the
fashion and advertising industries who want a small hotel but one
that is business-friendly as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moinian said he had spent $30 million to renovate the 1903
building, whose exterior is designed in the beaux-arts style. Of
that, more than $1 million was devoted to restoring the facade,
ornate plasterwork and other architectural details. The former
ballroom, with its six-foot stone fireplace and 20-foot ceilings,
is being converted to a restaurant that is being called, in
deference to the building's origins, Rx.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of mahogany and stained glass, and we
preserved as much as we could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this sensitivity to the past, the guest rooms are fully
wired for high-speed Internet access, with fax capability and two
or three telephones in each room. There are two conference rooms on
the third floor that can be combined to seat up to 75 people, and a
two-bedroom grand suite with a 2,000-square-foot balcony. Room
rates at Dylan will range from $295 to $395, with suites priced
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Moinian said he believed there were still opportunities to
develop boutique hotels in Manhattan neighborhoods that were
largely neglected manufacturing areas but that have been
rejuvenated as the shortage of office space in traditional
locations has brought an influx of new tenants from Internet and
related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he said, he is looking in Chelsea for a suitable
property. ``Chelsea appears to be a continuation of SoHo,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern of Hartz Mountain said the key to putting a hotel in a
nontraditional area was that the area have a vibrant business
community in addition to attractive living and trendy retail
spaces. ``Nontraditional businesses are spreading into areas like
SoHo and TriBeCa,'' he said, ``and they will generate demand for
hotel rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The downtown business district is also attracting hotel
development. In addition to the Embassy Suites project, a high-tech
Holiday Inn Wall Street opened last year at 15 Gold St., and a
Ritz-Carlton is being built on Battery Place near the southern tip
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The 311-room hotel at Battery Place is part of a mixed-use
project being developed by Millennium Partners, which is also
renovating the old St. Moritz Hotel, at Central Park South and
Avenue of the Americas. When complete late next year, the former
St. Moritz will also be branded a Ritz-Carlton and be managed by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Marriott International.
Twelve condominium units, each a full floor of the building, will
also be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Battery Park project will also include 120 condominium units
in addition to the hotel rooms. Matthew Hall, an executive with
Millennium, said that the sale of the condominiums would improve
the economics of the $175 million project. ``Revenues from
condominium sales will help cover infrastructure costs,'' he said.
``It helps spread the risk and provides a different source of
income.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regent Hotel, in the column-encrusted building at 55 Wall
St., has gradually been opening since last December, and executives
expect it to be fully ready for business by May 1. (Hotel
developers say that these so-called soft openings, in which only a
few floors are ready to receive guests, are a way of getting some
cash flowing early and are a means of training staff.)
</P>
<P>
   The 156-year-old building, which has been home to a stock
exchange and a customs house and had been the headquarters of
National City Bank, has undergone an $80 million renovation and has
144 guest rooms plus a restaurant and lounge. Aimed at affluent
business travelers _ presumably visiting their investment bankers _
the rooms have the typical array of technology features, such as
Internet connections and multiple telephone lines for voice mail
and fax.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the hotel said that no decision had been made
about what to do with the dozen jail cells that are a legacy of the
building's use as a federal building during the draft riots of the
Civil War. They are being used as storerooms, the spokeswoman said,
but some thought is being given to converting them to wine cellars
or a cigar bar.

<P>
   Suites at the Regent can cost as much as $1,600 a night, but
there are places to stay in Manhattan that do not require a bank
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Core Hotels is converting an office building at 6 West
32nd St. to a 172-room Red Roof Inn, that brand's first entry into
Manhattan. It is expected to open in early May, with room rates
ranging from $89 to $199 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Dandapani, Apple Core's chief operating officer, said the
Red Roof Inn project, like the company's other four hotels in
Manhattan _ the brands include Best Western and Quality Inn _ is
focusing on hotel basics rather then themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most customers want a nice lodging experience,'' he said.
``They want a comfortable bed and a quiet room.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the 17-story former office building had a
50-by-80-foot footprint that made it ``ideal for conversion.'' And
Apple Core knew something about the location. It operates a Best
Western across the street, at 17 West 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is aimed at travelers on a budget, but guests will
find amenities not always available at lower-priced hotels. The Red
Roof will have an exercise room, a meeting room and a business
center with computing, copying and fax facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Another facility aimed at budget travelers has been announced by
Ian Schrager, a hotel developer associated with upscale, trendy
projects, who has said he plans to convert the 960-room Henry
Hudson Hotel on West 57th Street to a hotel with rates starting at
$75 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another group is taking aim at the budget traveler by
converting once-dowdy single-room-occupancy hotels in good
locations to transient lodgings with room rates as low as $75 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Citylife Hotel Group has converted the old Allerton House at
57th Street and Lexington Avenue into Habitat, which has been
marketed mostly to European tourists. The hotel is on a popular
shopping street, and the first floor is to house a Kenneth Cole
fashion store, with the hotel's lobby on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   The old Broadway American hotel at 77th Street and Broadway in
the heart of the Upper West Side has been transformed by Citylife
into On The Ave (for ``avenue,'' although Broadway is not an
avenue). And by this summer the former Martha Washington Hotel at
30 East 30th St. is to be be relaunched by Citylife as Thirty
Thirty.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a total of about 1,100 rooms in the three hotels,
but not all will be available for transient rental, because some
permanent residents remain. In each case all the rooms have been
renovated and equipped with new furnishings and linens. Amenities
include alarm clocks, color television sets, Internet access and
free continental breakfast in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concept was to be the low-cost provider,'' said Kevin
Maloney, a partner in Citylife. Maloney said that each property is
distinctive and intended to appeal to different segments of the
budget market.
</P>
<P>
   At On The Ave, where the basic rate is $155 a night, the stress
is proximity to the West Side's cultural institutions, such as the
American Museum of Natural History, the Rose Center for Earth and
Space and Lincoln Center, as well as the area's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At Habitat the emphasis is on midtown, including Rockefeller
Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Disney Store. There is one
other detail at Habitat _ to get the $75 rate you have to accept a
room with the toilet and shower down the hall and in separate
rooms. For a room with an attached bath, the rate is $105 for a
single and $125 for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said the baths down the hall had been an obstacle to
European tour groups, particularly those from Scandinavia. He said
he hoped to encourage repeat business by showing that budget
lodgings can be acceptable. ``The idea is if they come and stay in
the city and feel they have not been ripped off, they will come
back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Budget travelers may be tight with a dollar, but that does not
mean they are technically unsophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said Citylife had been focusing most of its marketing
efforts on the Internet over the last few months, and that it seems
to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty to 25 percent of our bookings are coming directly
through the Internet,'' he said. ``People in the budget range shop
the Internet. We are getting over 200,000 hits on our site a
month.''

REAL ESTATE: VOTING FOR BOARDS IN A CO-OP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elections for board members in a co-op can be as
combative and controversial as those for public officials. And
co-op elections, with complex rules that often allow such things as
proxies and cumulative voting, can also be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many issues to address when running a co-op
election that if I don't do everything exactly right, there's a
good chance I'll end up in court,'' said Maralin Falik, executive
director of the Honest Ballot Association, a not-for-profit
organization in Queens, that conducts elections for trade groups,
special-interest organizations, unions and, with increasing
frequency, housing corporations. ``More and more elections are
being run by organizations like ours, because the rules are so
confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   One potentially perplexing issue in a co-op's annual election,
Falik said, is proxy voting. People taking part in elections of
public officials generally must cast their own vote, either in
person or by absentee ballot. That is not the case in co-op
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most votes in co-op elections are proxy votes,'' she said.
``And proxy votes can drive you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A proxy vote is cast by someone other than the individual or
individuals entitled to vote. In most co-op elections, Falik said,
a shareholder who does not intend to attend the annual meeting is
allowed to give permission to a third party to cast votes on that
shareholder's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And while that may sound simple, she said, proxy voting can get
complicated and even contentious.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic types of proxies: directed proxies and
discretionary proxies. With a directed proxy, the shareholder tells
the proxy holder to vote for specific candidates. With a
discretionary proxy, the proxy holder can vote for whomever he
chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we run an election we use directed proxies,'' Falik said.
She said that the proxy forms her organization mails to
shareholders contain the names of all the candidates. Shareholders
who vote by proxy indicate on the form the candidate or candidates
of their choice and then name the Honest Ballot Association as the
proxy holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, the shareholders get to vote directly for the
candidates of their choice with the assurance that no one can
change their vote and no one will know whom they voted for,'' Falik
said.
</P>
<P>
   No such assurances, she said, apply with discretionary proxies.
With such proxies, she said, the proxy holder can vote for whomever
he wishes, even if there was an understanding between the
shareholder and the proxy holder that the shareholder's votes would
be cast in a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A discretionary proxy basically disenfranchises the
shareholder,'' Falik said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's Business Corporation Law permits shareholders
to use whichever form of proxy they wish, she said, and it is not
uncommon to see large numbers of discretionary proxies used in
co-ops. That, she said, is because most shareholders who vote by
proxy give the proxy to people they believe will vote in a manner
consistent with the shareholder's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with proxies, she said, is that there is nothing to
prevent a shareholder who has given a proxy to one individual from
giving a subsequent proxy to another. ``It sounds crazy, but
shareholders can give out as many proxies as they want,'' she said.
``My all-time record was 15. We had a guy in one building who was
giving out proxies to everyone in sight.'' By law, she said, the
proxy dated closest to the date of the election is the only one
that counts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, to ensure the legitimacy of an election,
it must be clearly established that the person who has given the
proxy is legally entitled to do so. ``We've had court-ordered
elections where half the proxies in the previous election were not
signed by the real owners,'' Falik said, adding that she has seen
many instances in which the shareholder's signature on the proxy
clearly does not match the signature on the proprietary lease.
</P>
<P>
   Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that such
incidents are not always accidental or even innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there proxies that are forged?'' he said. ``Absolutely.
Some of these buildings don't even check signatures, even though
all the signatures are on file.''
</P>
<P>
   Falik said that occasionally, the spouse of a shareholder tries
to give a proxy even though that spouse is not listed as an owner
of the apartment. And there are even cases, she said, in which two
people are owners of record of one apartment and each gives a proxy
to a different proxy holder. In such cases, she said, the proxy
dated closest to the election is the one that counts.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said that if proxy voting seems confusing, cumulative
voting is even more vexing. ``Cumulative voting is hugely important
in buildings where sponsors still own a lot of apartments,'' Brett
said. ``And many shareholders have no idea what cumulative voting
is or how to use it to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, he said, a co-op's bylaws determine whether
board members are elected by direct voting or cumulative voting.
With direct voting, Brett said, each shareholder is permitted to
vote his total number of shares for each open seat on the board. A
shareholder with 1,000 shares in the co-op would be able to cast
1,000 shares for each open position.
</P>
<P>
   With cumulative voting, each shareholder starts with his total
number of shares multiplied by the number of board seats available
and can cast them any way he desires. If a shareholder owns 1,000
shares, and there are five board seats available, the shareholder
has a total of 5,000 votes to cast. He can vote all 5,000 for one
candidate, or divide the shares among two or more candidates any
way he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play your cards right, that means that even a minority
group of shareholders can elect at least one board member using
cumulative voting,'' Brett said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results of co-op elections, lawyers say, can be difficult to
predict and even more difficult to control. ``Election strategies
can be devious and they can be sneaky,'' said James G. Samson, a
Manhattan co-op lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be at all unusual, Samson said, for a board
candidate to ask a shareholder who has already submitted a proxy
vote for another candidate to submit a superseding proxy to a
different proxy holder. Indeed, he said, it would not be unusual
for the shareholder to agree to such a request to avoid hurting
anyone's feelings. Such tactics, however, can result in fierce
displays of partisanship at the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to meetings where there have been chairs thrown
across the room,'' Samson said. ``When people are fighting over
their homes, they can do some really weird things.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AT INDIANA U., TRUSTEES CAN'T HANDLE COACH KNIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They won't dare.
</P>
<P>
   They've got the tape, but they won't dare.
</P>
<P>
   They've got the evidence that Bobby Knight puts his hands _ or
even one hand _ on the throat of a player during practice.
</P>
<P>
   They have the evidence that Bobby Knight uses vile tactics to
``motivate'' _ that is, bully, threaten, intimidate _ his players.
</P>
<P>
   They have more than two decades of behavior so crude, so
grotesque, that it would get anybody else fired. But they won't
dare.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Frederick Eichhorn and John Walda, the two
Indiana University trustees in charge of the Bobby Knight
investigation, but they will not dare recommend dismissal because a
generation's worth of compliant administrators has created the
800-pound gorilla, too big, too mean, too entrenched. The safe path
in Indiana will be to find some middle ground, deliver a slap on
the wrist, slip a letter of warning into Knight's dossier, to keep
him in charge of the Indiana basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   This a man who thinks it is acceptable to wave soiled toilet
paper at his players to make them play better, presumably out of
disgust rather than pride. Coach Charmin.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages identify with the captor. This is well known from
airline hijackings. After a while, the people cower in a corner and
decide their captor isn't such a bad guy after all because he
hasn't killed them, and he actually smiled once or twice. That's
what goes on in the state of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   It must be embarrassing to Eichhorn and Walda, who were
confronted with a CNN/SI documentary in which one former Indiana
player who later transferred, Neil Reed, claimed Knight had choked
Reed in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the previous Indiana officials during Knight's rule,
the trustees seemed perfectly prepared to label this as outside
agitation designed to hurt the state and its basketball program _
and besides, look at the graduation rate, look at the three
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Knight himself set the tone with a public filibuster. Right
after the charges were broadcast on CNN/SI in mid-March, Knight
appeared at the mandatory news conference at the regional
tournament, delivering a seething, rambling discourse on his
graduation rates and how he had raised $5 million for the
university library.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not teaching kids to play canasta,'' Knight said. ``This
is a game where kids get bloody noses and get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   He never addressed the specifics. He talked and talked, and
basically dared anybody to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a movie, it would have been the scene where the
demagogue finally goes too far, starts babbling in public, until
finally everybody realizes just how far along he is. However, this
was Indiana basketball, so Knight just glared out at the world. The
next night, his players reacted like automatons who had long lost
the will to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came more evidence from CNN/SI _ a videotape of a
1997 practice, showing the great man putting his hand on Reed's
throat. If it was not the two-handed Sprewell throttle, with
assistants pulling Knight away, as Reed had claimed, it was surely
the act of a man far out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trustees are stuck with it. The tape is public.
</P>
<P>
   There is also testimony from other former players that Knight
behaved in such an odious manner that they either transferred or
wished they had. You don't get these testimonies from the former
players of John Wooden or Mike Krzyzewski or Dean Smith or John
Chaney or Lou Carnesecca. Coach Charmin is one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   Most former Indiana players, well placed in the adult world,
speak highly of Knight. But there are also more than a few former
Indiana players who have regrets about their association with
Knight, and this seems to be as important as the graduation rate or
the three championships.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, in the state of Indiana, a huge segment of
residents _ perhaps still a majority _
adore/respect/admire/support/accept Coach Knight. Or they look the
other way. It's their state and their team and they are entitled to
their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But from outside the state, it looks bad, real bad. The face of
Indiana is a man on a dais, talking and glowering, his eyes darting
around the room, as if to say: ``Come and get me. See if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to do it peacefully. One university president
after another has passed on Bobby Knight. So he behaved like a
buffoon during the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico. So he
stuffed a heckler into a garbage can. So he head-butted a player.
So he kicked a player. So he tossed a chair. So he flung a
telephone and intimidated a referee and got himself a victory over
Louisiana State to get to the 1987 Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   It is getting worse. Apparently, after the Ohio State game on
Feb. 19, Knight had an incident with the Indiana athletic director,
Clarence Droninger, that was so tempestuous that Droninger reported
it to a school vice president. The sad fact is that Knight has been
bullying people for decades. Tony Soprano's analyst has a better
chance of locating the source of his anger than anybody in Indiana
has with Coach Knight.
</P>
<P>
   These two trustees live in Indiana. They work in Indiana. They
report back to the state of Indiana. They're going to want to get
along. Indiana has not been embarrassed yet, apparently. By June,
they will write a report saying Knight needs to change a few of his
ways in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Take him off the job? They won't dare.
</P>
<P>
   It will take something worse than one hand on the throat of a
player to end the career of Coach Charmin. Maybe it will be like
Woody Hayes, the blustery football coach at Ohio State, finally
losing it and trying to tackle a foe near the sideline. Or maybe it
will be even worse. And that's scary.

REAL ESTATE: IN WEST SEATTLE, CONSTRUCTING ROOMS WITH A VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET KING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The economic boom is visible in the new housing seen
in many older neighborhoods here, among them West Seattle, the
birthplace of the city, where high-density housing is rising along
the Puget Sound in the area where the first settlers landed in
1851.
</P>
<P>
   On Alki Beach across Elliott Bay from downtown, a 10-minute
drive away, developers have constructed 21 buildings in the last
decade or so, with a total of about 440 condominiums. About half of
them have been built in the latest development spurt in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two developers are framing two luxury buildings, with 15
more luxury condos. The apartments have sweeping views of the water
or the downtown skyline and are replacing ramshackle
turn-of-the-century cabins that were summer homes for city
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like this area because there is not a lot of beachfront
around the downtown,'' said Mark Pryde, a vice president of Pryde
Corp., which sold the last of its 20 apartments at Point Nautica
last year. Pryde has built six buildings in the last six years at
Alki Beach, with a total of 140 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condominiums have water views that will never be blocked,
and Alki Beach has a resort-town feel, with restaurants and pastry
shops,'' he said. ``We're seeing the rebirth of older cities all
across the country, and this is happening in West Seattle now.''
</P>
<P>
   With 96,000 residents, a mix of blue-collar and professional,
West Seattle was annexed by the city of Seattle in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, West Seattle was a thriving community when
the Luna Park amusement park was built on the tide flats.
Initially, it drew crowds that arrived by train or ferry from
downtown Seattle to ride the roller-coaster, but its popularity
dwindled, and under pressure from prohibitionists, the park closed
in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Its remains burned down in 1931, and Alki Beach became neglected
and blighted. Many people considered West Seattle the boondocks,
because the Duwamish River, its eastern boundary, cuts it off from
the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   West Seattle's fortunes began to change in 1983 when a high-rise
bridge was built over the river, connecting with Interstate 5. At
Alki (pronounced with a long i, like bike) Beach, the city invested
in a four-mile-long promenade, boathouse and fishing pier. By the
late 1990s, new condominiums and single-family homes were going up,
and restaurants and a bakery were thriving. In December, Starbucks
opened a branch.
</P>
<P>
   Now housing prices are heating up. In 1999, the average price
for 154 condominiums sold was $272,288, compared with $229,730 for
the 227 sold in 1998 and $191,999 in 1997. In 1999, 1,403 homes
sold at an average price of $237,779, compared with $209,115 for
the 1,323 homes sold in 1998 and $184,248 in 1997. West Seattle is
still more affordable than Seattle as a whole, where the average
sale price in 1999 was about $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   As land becomes scarcer in the Alki Beach area, prices for the
new condos are rising. At Point Nautica, the latest Pryde
development, prices ranged from $450,000 to $1.8 million for
apartments with 1,500 square feet to 4,000 square feet. At Pryde's
first building in 1994, prices ranged from $250,000 to $400,000 for
the same amount space.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold about half of its condos before construction
even began at Point Nautica. But the high prices make the
developers nervous. ``Higher land costs create a thinner market,''
Pryde said, ``as more people can afford $250,000 units than
$500,000.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on the eastern side of Alki Beach, Sabey
Corp. is completing the shell of a five-story building, called
Duwamish Head. Each condo will occupy a single floor, with 4,000
square feet plus 700 square feet of patio or terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Sabey has sold the top three floors at about $2 million each,
and buyers will hire their own designers to install the kitchens
and to complete the decorating. Joe Wang, the development manager,
said the first- and second-floor units are unsold, priced at $1.4
million for the shell and $1.8 million if Sabey completes the
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, construction crews for Seagulf Group are
framing the third floor of a six-story building containing 10
condominiums with 1,681 to 1,880 square feet priced at $599,900 to
$786,000. Two 3,750-square-foot penthouses will be priced at $2
million each. Gerald Potter, the sales agent for the project, said
the smallest unit is sold _ to the banker that financed the
project. ``The lower units have a 35-foot span of windows,'' he
said, ``and the penthouses 70 feet, to capture views.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roth, a Prudential Northwest Realty salesman, said:
``Construction on Alki will continue for some time as a number of
sites are still left. A lot of units will soon go into areas by the
beach that do not have views. People want to be by the salt water
and where things are booming.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rising prices at Alki Beach are causing Matt Vaughn to delay
construction until he sees how the market evolves. He has another
reason to delay development of his site, which includes three
quaint 1920s houses. ``It's hard to tear down the homes, especially
since I live in one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About three miles inland from Alki Beach, the 30-year-old
Westwood Village shopping mall is in the middle of a $10 million
expansion, adding 50,000 square feet to its 350,000 square feet.
Tom Sroufe, the senior vice president of Wesbild Inc., the mall's
owner, said that plans include a new 12-screen movie theater with
2,200 seats.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the mall, the nonprofit Delridge Neighborhood
Development Association has just begun selling 17 two-bedroom town
houses. The 1,000-square-foot units, priced at $150,000, are part
of the Brandon Court mixed-use project that also houses the
association's headquarters, a Gai's Bakery and city offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard to keep the town houses affordable as part of
our goal to create a thriving neighborhood,'' says Paul Fischburg,
Delridge's director. The group's next project will be a
6,500-square-foot building with a Seattle Public Library branch on
the first floor and 19 low-income apartments above. A few blocks
away, Jefferson Properties will develop 15 acres, a former sand and
gravel pit, into 141 homes priced from $180,000 to $230,000 for
1,200 square feet to 1,800 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest vacant residential land parcel left for
development in Seattle because it has environmental problems from
contaminated soil that was dumped long ago,'' said Ray Stevenson,
the developer. He plans to clean up the site this summer and start
construction next year. ``Unfortunately, these are the types of
sites for homes that are left in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson added, ``West Seattle is a great area and appeals
to people who are so tired of the traffic bottlenecks on the
freeways and no longer want long commutes to the suburbs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The doorbell rang deep in a pristine enclave of Westchester
County, N.Y., and a petite lady with a heavy accent peeled back the
foyer curtain to take a peek at her visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, her eyes grew to the size of poker chips as they took
in 6-foot-11-inch Marcus Camby and his muscular buddy. She finally
cracked the door, listened to their pleas and quickly shooed them
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure she was like, `I'm not opening the door to these
guys,''' Camby said, smiling, one afternoon last week. ``I was
like: `Ma'am, we don't want no trouble. I play for the Knicks.
Really. We're looking for a FedEx letter.' I told her: `It was
delivered here by mistake? You signed for it?' She said, `Uh, uh,
check the trash.' She closed the door. I mean, like, bam.''
</P>
<P>
   That was how, last summer, the county's newest homeowner found
himself staring over a neighbor's garbage can like a wishing well.
He paused, took a deep breath and plunged right into the milk
cartons, soup cans and sticky bottles in search of a letter
delivered to the wrong suburban cul de sac.
</P>
<P>
   He found it. Inside the envelope _ which had not been opened _
Camby found his $100,000 endorsement check. Panic attack over.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of dramas that unfold in Camby's life now.
And he could not be more pleased. There are junk fliers in his
mailbox, a neighbor's casserole dish in the fridge and peace in his
life. He has a girlfriend who teaches kindergarten, who can whip up
a delicious lamb chop and who has made sure the furniture in his
new home is not out of a bachelor's shop of horrors. Not a
wagon-wheel coffee table in sight.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's really a good time for me,'' said Camby, whose voice
echoed through the grand parlor in his new home. ``It's like
finally, after everything that has happened, all the stuff in the
past, I can stop holding my breath and exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Camby was living in a rambling old estate as a
renter. He lost a security deposit of sorts the day general manager
Ernie Grunfeld was abruptly sacrificed by the Madison Square Garden
president, Dave Checketts. A year ago this week, Grunfeld _ who
made a move unpopular with coach Jeff Van Gundy when he traded a
rugged folk hero like Charles Oakley for Camby _ was cast aside
when the dysfunctional Knicks were on the verge of missing the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, Ernie was about the only guy who talked
to me,'' Camby said. ``I talked to Ernie more than I talked to
Jeff. He was like the only guy who extended out a hand and seemed
like he wanted me here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the only guy you think you have in your corner is not
there anymore, it's like: `Oh, boy. Am I gone next?' No one knew
what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when the most unlikely finish unfolded. With injuries to
Larry Johnson and Patrick Ewing, Van Gundy had no choice but to
trust Camby. When given the chance, Camby rose out of anonymity as
swiftly and gracefully as a dolphin breaks the ocean's surface. He
was free to make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, he was adored. On the June night the Knicks patched
together their makeshift roster and advanced to the NBA finals,
Camby felt the full force of the public's affection. As he exited
the ramp leading from the Garden garage, fans began shaking his
Range Rover like a bottle of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was like, `Whoa, are we getting `jacked?''' Camby
said. ``They were just so excited. So I was like, `Please, Marcus,
don't hit anyone.' It was pretty wild. Never forget it. That's what
you love about New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby has reveled in the acceptance. And he has been genuinely
moved by it. After he missed 17 games this season with a knee
injury, he walked to the sideline to check into the Houston game on
March 14 and saw the Garden fans come to their feet. In response,
he swiped his fist through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Camby is going a step further. While some athletes detach
themselves from the public by tinting their windows and building
bigger fences, Camby decided to spend about $10,000 to give a free
party on Sunday for the first 600 fans to show up from 3:30 to 6
p.m. at the Park Avenue Country Club in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an appreciation party,'' Camby said. ``I just wanted
to say, thank you. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two seasons, if there are a few traits that have
become clear in Camby's development, it is his desire for positive
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In his first months as a Knick, he did not respond well to Van
Gundy's tough love approach. Even now, as they begin to enter their
second playoff run together, there is still an uneasiness to their
relationship. For Camby, it is more about the lingering sting from
his embarrassing 19-second debut in last year's season opener than
the contract negotiations last March that were based on his limited
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have said that Jeff cost me like $30
million,'' said Camby, who signed a six-year, $40 million extension
when the maximum was $79 million. ``And I won't lie to you. I was
kind of frustrated at the time. But I knew the consequences of
signing and have security for my family. I'm fine about that.
Everything with Jeff went deeper than money. We're cool now. We'll
never be best friends, but we have a working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes I reflect back and wonder: What if Patrick
didn't get hurt? What if I'd remained the ninth or 10th man?
Thankfully, I got an opportunity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This season, his minutes are steadier but there are still games
when his playing time is inconsistent. He averages 26 minutes a
night, puts up an average of 10.1 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2
blocked shots a game, but he can disappear under foul trouble or
get lost on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things you have to have to be a great player:
consistency and durability,'' Van Gundy said. ``Those are two of
the keys to stepping up to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Van Gundy mean Camby is fragile or has fallen short of
expectations this season? Probably not. And in some sense, the only
thing that matters is how Camby takes Van Gundy's criticisms. The
feeling-out process between the two continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out over time how certain guys react,'' Van Gundy
said. ``Some guys need to have a foot in their pants all the time.
And it depends on how you do it, too. I think Marcus is on the more
sensitive side of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with Marcus, he needs to feel good about what he's
doing. And the more upbeat you can keep him, the better off he
responds.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camby is nothing but upbeat these days. A year ago, before the
playoff run, he would exit the Garden for silent rides home with
his girlfriend, Eva Piper, and his friend Percell Oliver. Now,
Camby's sixth-man role is secure. His days end with his pulling up
in his own driveway and settling into the overstuffed sofa in the
back room of his own house. And then talking all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Eva talk a lot,'' Camby said. ``We met two years ago
and were really just friends for a long time. It's like, you spill
your guts, she spills her guts and you just really learn about
someone else. It's cool. We really connect. I don't meet many new
people, but it's been cool getting to know her.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps his circle of friends very tight. Once the trade for
Camby was made in the summer of 1998, there were concerns that he
would allow some of his questionable associations from his nearby
hometown to distract him in New York. There were plenty of fast
friends who knew him from the Bellevue Square Housing projects in
Hartford, Conn., enough faces from the past to cause trouble if
Camby let them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mainly had to cut people out of my life,'' Camby said. ``I
used to wonder why Rick Mahorn and guys like that who made it out
of Hartford didn't go back home. Now, being in the NBA, you see why
people don't go back. There's a lot of hatred and jealousy back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   He cannot turn away from the children there, though. He has
started reading programs and helped pay for classes at schools in
Hartford for the same kind of kids that often ended up in his
mother's tidy apartment when Camby was in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was a family advocate,'' Camby said. ``She'd bring kids
home when their parents didn't pick them up. We didn't have a lot.
But then you'd see kids that were a lot worse off. Just to see how
kids were dressing _ some of them had holes in their shoes and
holes in their socks and their clothes were ragged _ I never...it's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, gathers his emotions and continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing was,'' he added, ``they always had a smile on their
face. Kids are like that, very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby has had to do some bouncing back, as well. From the agent
scandal at the University of Massachusetts, from his troubled years
in Toronto, from his invisible start to his Knick career. After all
that, he has found comfort in the very normal rhythm of the suburbs
and acceptance from the fans in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Camby said. ``When I first moved in, I guess the
neighbors felt like we didn't ever go to the grocery store. All the
neighbors came over with dishes. We had six dishes in our fridge.
And everyone would say: `Oh, don't worry about it. You can keep the
dish.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I was injured, I was getting all kinds of things.
Kids would come by and ring the doorbell, have cookies in their
hands for me. They'd want to see my cars and see how tall I was and
stuff. A few times I was here to answer the door. And some of the
kids would be in shock. They'd say, `Whoa, I didn't really expect
you to be here.' But there I was, answering the door, like, `What's
up, neighbor?'''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TAKING A LITTLE REST (WHEN TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE

 By ROBERT LIPSYTEx   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a week when the Jets unaccountably jettisoned Keyshawn
Johnson (was the new owner, a Johnson, afraid he might be confused
with his wide receiver?) and the Rangers flirted with the
possibility of fulfilling my wildest dreams and bringing back Mark
Messier (but without his evil twin, Coach Mike Keenan, they will
never make the pay-offs), a cybersports fan called Marcojcaputo
questioned the decision of Mets Manager Bobby Valentine to ``rest''
Mike Piazza and Rey Ordonez during the first week of a season when
it costs a family of four nearly $175 to attend a major league
game. The first week? How had they exhausted themselves? Would they
come out of the dugout in their robes and give the family its money
back?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the more reason,'' declared Marcojcaputo, ``that moms and
dads should be the heros, and not the players. When was Cal Ripken
rested? I can understand injuries. I remember Johnny Bench being
rested, at either third base (or left field?) and Yogi was rested
in the outfield as well. Valentine lost that game. Fitting?''
</P>
<P>
   I love this e-mail. It feels like wandering outside the glass
booth of the press zoo and sitting in the sun of the grandstand.
The first week of TheLipsite(AT)aol.com there was little response,
many readers apparently thinking it was yet another lame joke from
this corner. Who could blame you? But by the second week, the
response was overwhelming. Keep writing, please, but don't be put
off if some weeks I take the column back. It's mine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main threads of response have been to a magazine
writer's suggestion that testosterone is the reason men usually
beat women in most sports and to the manifesto from the academics
of the Drake Group calling for an end to the ``student-athlete''
sham. Personally, I think the two threads may cross somewhere;
college presidents drive the semipro sports show, and it takes as
much he-hormone to hustle big bucks as it does to buck the line.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Bayly of New York, who describes herself as a competitive
runner and a sponsored triathlete, writes: ``Many women can run
faster/lift more weight/throw farther/aim better/use more skillful
stick-work/balance longer and defend more tenaciously than many
men. How come, when they have LESS testosterone?
</P>
<P>
   ``How come?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you how come: through hard work, through education,
through desire, through experience, through talent, and through
self-application towards fulfilling goals, that's how. Lots of
sweat involved; lots of brain, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Karin Winegar, a member of the Frances Willard Society, a group
named in honor of the author of ``How I Learned to Ride the
Bicycle: Reflections of an Influential 19th Century Woman,''
writes: ``I'd like to point out that there are two sports where
women compete equally with men: sailing (where men dominate,
largely, because of economics), and riding (where women dominate,
largely, because of passion for the sport). When we have horses or
boats, the testosterone discrepancy is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Only money is considered more powerful than testosterone these
days, and money is what college sports seem to be about. ``Just
license them!'' cries Robert Britton of Richardson, Texas. ``If
colleges and universities license their names, logos and the like
to apparel and other manufacturers, it's not a great leap to extend
the concept to the teams. Let some corporation acquire rights to
the Duke Blue Devils or whatever, and let the schools focus on what
they're supposed to be doing _ educating people.''
</P>
<P>
   The idealism of the likes of Britton astounds me. Who says
schools are supposed to educate people? If that were the case, why
would Bob Knight, Jerry Tarkanian, John Thompson (add your own
favorite student-coach) have been hired in the first place? In
fact, toss in Coach K and JoePa, those saints of the sidelines (if
you don't know who they are, write me privately).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kannerstein, associate dean of Haverford College and
director of athletics, has few illusions along with a certain
Division III arrogance. He writes: ``There's nothing wrong with the
term `student-athlete,' except the way it's been used as a cosmetic
device in some Division I circles to cover up the presence of some
athletes who are anything but students. The experience of a student
who plays intercollegiate sports at any college is qualitatively
different than that of a nonathlete and there's no reason to deny
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than blaming the victims _ in this case, the alleged
student-athletes, the Drake Group ought to go after the real
culprit, the desire of many colleges to use athletic recognition
for institutional prestige instead of focusing on its faculty,
students and academic programs. Athletics is a convenient target
but `reform' will never succeed unless the mind-set which
identifies Duke or Georgetown as teams, not colleges, and which
seeks to evoke financial support for the institution through
athletics no longer dominates.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the problem is not with the athlete but with students
such as ARIZJOE, who overwrites: ``We are on the precipice of the
Internet acting as a superego or a filter which will identify
competitive sports as a fetish born of androgen and an antiquated
vicarious pastime. This foofaraw was the etiologic agent in my
matriculation to Ohio State University. In the dorm, I heard of the
suppression of evidence in the case of a footballer who had
committed a felony. When I questioned this aloud, an all-Big Ten
defensive end lectured me, in his own way, that I had no standing.
He bid defiantly, `Athletes are better people than you.' His manner
was unmistakenly truculent and threatening. He told me to shut up.
At that moment I felt like I did when I learned there was no Santa
Claus. Then the mantra of `God is Dead' hit me. An epiphany of
gridiron existentialism demeaned my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   As well it should.

   ELIAN-CUBANS _ The legendary clout of Miami's exile community
has never been so obvious as during its spirited, unified standoff
against the U.S. government and Janet Reno, a former Miami hero. Is
this the last hurrah of the exile community as a political force or
the beginning of something even more powerful? The buzz has been
that since the death of long-time power broker Jorge Mas Canosa and
the arrival of more moderate rivals to his Cuban-American National
Foundation, the community clout had begun to wane. The Clinton
administration has managed to play the different groups off against
each other more than once. But now even the naysayers are taking
notice of what a motivated exile community can do when truly
aroused. Elian has united this often never-quite-so-monolithic
community as never before. And so far, they've managed to thumb
their nose successfully at the full might of the federal
government. Whither the storied Miami exile enclave? (Douthat, Palm

   SCHOOL-SAFETY-1STLD _ WASHINGTON _ Some 3,000 students at

building. It was all part of a three-hour drill on how to escape
shootings or explosions, part of a national trend toward
protectiveness unequalled since the 1950's, when millions of school
children took part in ``duck and cover'' drills designed to help
them survive nuclear attacks. Experts talk about what else has

Columbine High School nearly one year ago. (Mollison, Cox News

Gore presidential campaign, want to develop a shopping center on 90
acres of wetlands in the Meadowlands here. But the mall project is
opposed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a prominent environmentalist who
has endorsed Gore as ``the strongest environmentalist running for
the White House since Teddy Roosevelt.'' The Meadowlands Mills
project has thus become a possible litmus test for Gore's

   OSCILLATE _ WASHINGTON _ Now that it's becoming clear that the

Pacific seem to be switching from ``North Pacific Oscillation 1''
to ``North Pacific Oscillation 2.'' And what that shift lacks in
colorful Spanish terminology, it more than makes up for in bad

   ESSAYIST-PROFILE _ YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. _ For 20 years, Steve
Harvey, a professor at Young Harris College in North Georgia, wrote
poems before finding his real voice in the personal essay. In two
collections, ``A Geometry of Lilies: Life and Death in an American
Family'' and ``Lost in Translation,'' he writes with fluent ease
about love and marriage, about change and loss. His tone is by
turns winsome and reflective. ``People ask me what my books are
about,'' he says. ``It's very hard to say.'' He will write of his
kids ganging up on him (``I marvel at the transparent guile of
their planning huddles, the determined looks as they gather courage
for the synchronized assault, their reckless confidence as they
throw their bodies at their father.'') or of discovering he is
perfectly happy living without a television (``Our mind connects
the dots, lending depth and perspective, and ultimately, meaning to
the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube. And yet, the experience
sedates us, engaging just enough of our senses to lull us into a
stupor.''). He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind
always seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what
might be called the universal. (Skube, Atlanta

OUTDOORS: HUDSON PROJECT SOLVES LONG-RUNNING MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. BOYLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trout fishermen ``read'' a stream to locate their
quarry, and largemouth bass fishermen seek ``structure'' in a lake
to find theirs. But the tidal Hudson River, which reaches from the
Battery in New York City to the Troy dam, has forever been an
entrancing mystery to anglers and anyone else who ever wondered
what the bottom actually looks like.
</P>
<P>
   This 154-mile length of the Hudson is not really a river, but an
estuary, a super protein factory, where fresh water meets salt
water and the tides help trap nutrients that would otherwise
quickly flow to the ocean. In a sense, the Hudson is a shoestring
version of Chesapeake Bay, historically the most productive estuary
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the wide, shallow Chesapeake has been troubled.
Its flushing rate is not as dynamic as that of the relatively
narrow and deep Hudson, which has the distinction of being the only
major East Coast estuary _ and one of only a handful in the entire
North Atlantic basin _ that retains all of its original fish
species.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, navigation charts of the Hudson note the depth (as
much as 200 feet) and kind of bottom (soft, hard or rocky), but the
ceaseless tidal action and the sediment loads that the estuary
receives render it perpetually murky and generally limit visibility
to 6 feet at best. It has been easier for NASA to send back
detailed pictures of the Martian surface than for New Yorkers to
see what lies at the bottom of the Tappan Zee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, thanks to the Hudson River Action Plan, a project
underwritten by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation, it is at last possible to look at images of the
Hudson's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Using advanced remote sensing instruments, a team of scientists
from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University,
the Marine Sciences Research Center of State University of New
York-Stony Brook, and Queens College, have so far probed four
reaches of the estuary, totaling 40 miles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key instruments, a Chirp sonar profiler, evolved from
the prototype devised by Dr. William Ryan, a senior scientist at
Lamont-Doherty, who is putting together the project database. In
1980, Ryan used the prototype to take the first sonar pictures of
the wreck of the Titanic, 12,000 feet down in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The project coordinator, Dr. Robin E. Bell, a geophysicist at
Lamont-Doherty who has made five trips to Antarctica, said that the
goal is to depict the different types of Hudson habitats that serve
as home for benthic (bottom-dwelling) invertebrates, such as worms,
crustaceans and insects, and are thus likely to attract fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, researchers from the Boyce Thompson
Institute and the Department of Environmental Conservation examined
sediment samples hauled from the bottom and found the richest
fauna, up to several thousand invertebrates per square meter, in a
mixture of silt, clay and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic sturgeon appear to favor such an area, while another
bottom feeder, the endangered shortnose sturgeon, occurs over
different types of bottom. Knowledgeable anglers have long known
that striped bass like rocky areas, which accounts for their other
common name, rockfish.
</P>
<P>
   And what have the project scientists found? Just north of the
Tappan Zee Bridge toward the Tarrytown shore, Bell said, they
discovered a 100-foot-long barge on the bottom and the wreck of a
150-foot schooner off Hook Mountain. Wrecks like these, along with
other objects that stand out from the bottom, generally attract
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Between the bridge and Ossining are belts of oyster reefs,
alternately buried and exposed, that extend across the river. Bell
guessed the reefs to be 2,000 to 6,000 years old, but well into the
19th century the waters around New York City remained celebrated
for oysters, so much so that Napoleon III of France dispatched a
naval lieutenant named DeBroca here to take back some for
cultivation. DeBroca returned home with the choicest of all. They
were from the East River.
</P>
<P>
   Just above the Bear Mountain Bridge and hard by the western
shore are three railroad freight cars that tumbled into the river
sometime in the past, while the wrecks of so many small vessels
litter the bottom of Newburgh Bay that the scientists stopped
counting them. Interestingly, the footings of the Newburgh-Beacon
Bridge, a favorite fishing ground for stripers, have also made
their mark on the bottom; sediment ridges a mile and a half long
are behind the downriver side of each footing.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five feet down off Bannerman's Island, the scientists
discovered four chevaux-de-frise, relics from the Revolutionary
War. Each cheval-de-frise originally consisted of sharpened wooden
poles pointing toward the surface and affixed in a rectangular rock
base. American troops sank them to stop British warships from
moving upriver. Although never realized, the British grand strategy
was to seize the Hudson River Valley, divide the colonies in two
and subdue them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Below Bannerman's Island is what Bell described as ``a strange
structure that looks like a pair of stone walls, 50 feet apart and
200 feet long, in 20 feet of water.'' Its purpose is unknown, and
Bell called it ``the biggest historical mystery we've
encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Off New Hamburg, Diamond Reef looms up from the bottom.
Traditionally one of the best fishing spots for striped bass, white
perch and snapper bluefish, the image reveals how the reef was
named. It is, Bell said, ``shaped like a diamond, with the rock
trending northeast-southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Kingston and Saugerties, the bottom resembles the Sahara
Desert, with rank upon rank of 10-foot-high dunes of sand and silt.
They are formed by the current that is gradually moving sediments
downriver, but in a few places, Bell said, the incoming tides may
be moving dunes upriver.
</P>
<P>
   Between the cities of Hudson and New Baltimore lie glacial lake
sediments, bricks from abandoned brickyards and coal from long-gone
steamboats. This reach of the Hudson may be the least exciting to
anglers, but to Bell: ``The river is as exciting as anything in
Antarctica, and compared to Antarctica it has wonderful
ramifications in more directly recording human activities.
Understanding your own back yard can be just as important as
understanding the remote corners of the earth.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Cleveland Browns have spent weeks scrutinizing,
analyzing and agonizing over two players from Penn State,
linebacker LaVar Arrington and defensive lineman Courtney Brown.
Back and forth the Browns went, sometimes in heated discussions.
Arrington possesses explosive athletic ability, but Brown is the
kind of player who can dominate a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns ended up actually rating Arrington a small percentage
higher than Brown on their draft board, but then visions of last
season danced in the heads of the Cleveland brass. They remembered
opposing quarterbacks sitting comfortably in the pocket and picking
apart their defense, which had a league-low 25 sacks. Suddenly the
answer became crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland chose Brown Saturday with the first overall pick of
the National Football League draft, and in doing so selected a
player who could be a defensive anchor on the Browns' line for
years to come. They picked him only a matter of minutes after
reaching agreement on a six-year contract with the 6-foot-5-inch,
265-pound player who has a chance to be the next Bruce Smith. In
fact, Brown is the first defensive end picked No. 1 overall since
Smith was selected first by Buffalo in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long, healthy discussion about both players,''
Cleveland coach Chris Palmer said. ``Basically what it came down to
was that we really needed a pass rusher, and Courtney is just such
a great football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not have to wait long to see the destination of his
excitable teammate. The Washington Redskins, as expected, selected
Arrington with the second overall pick, making it the first time
that two players from the same university were drafted 1-2 since
1984.
</P>
<P>
   `For Courtney to go No. 1, there's no disappointment from me,''
Arrington said. ``I mean, I couldn't be picked after a better guy.
Courtney, I think he deserved it. I just feel like I was the
natural pick for the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington used its third selection to pick Alabama offensive
tackle Chris Samuels. There is no question that the Redskins,
already loaded with talent, should be favored to represent the
National Football Conference in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With the 11th selection, the Giants boosted a weak running game
by picking Ron Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Wisconsin, a
power back whose brutal running style fits their desire to pound
the football.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had four selections in the first round, met their
need for help on the defensive line by picking Tennessee defensive
end Shaun Ellis at No. 12 even though some teams had rated him
lower in the first round. With the 13th pick, the Jets selected
linebacker John Abraham from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After making the most trade noise of almost any team in the
draft, Cincinnati made Peter Warrick the fourth selection. The
Bengals had thought seriously of trading down. While they were on
the 15-minute deadline clock, the Bengals fielded calls from teams
including the Jets. In the end, Cincinnati decided Warrick's
play-making ability was too enticing to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that the Baltimore Ravens might trade the
fifth pick _ the Giants recently inquired about it _ but they
decided to take Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis. Most scouts
rated Lewis as the best running back in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a handful of surprises in the top 10.
Philadelphia took Florida State defensive tackle Corey Simon with
the sixth pick despite recent shoulder operations, Arizona selected
the speedy Virginia running back Thomas Jones with the seventh
pick, Pittsburgh took Michigan State wide receiver Plaxico Burress
with the eighth pick, and Chicago selected New Mexico linebacker
Brian Urlacher ninth. Urlacher has moved rapidly up some team's
draft boards because of his exceptional workouts in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, with the 10th pick, again helped its offense by
picking Florida's Travis Taylor, known for his speed and work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   There were some definite shocks in the first round. First,
several personnel men said they were stunned by the lack of trades.
But teams, on draft day, were reluctant to give up picks to make a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington, a possible
franchise quarterback, went lower than expected, with the Jets
grabbing him at No. 18. And by far the most surprising selection of
the day _ and maybe of the last five drafts _ was the Oakland
Raiders' picking Florida State kicker/punter Sebastian Janikowski
at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, who weighs 260 pounds, was rated a third-rounder by
some scouts. One of the reasons was his arrest in an attempt to
bribe a police officer. A native of Poland, Janikowski faces
deportation because of those charges, though the Raiders must be
convinced that his situation will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The days before the draft were among the most hectic ever.
Several times the Browns considered trading the first pick and
acquiring multiple picks to address their numerous needs.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance last week, they talked with the Jets, which
Cleveland general manager Carmen Policy confirmed in a television
interview. The Jets offered three of their four No. 1 picks to the
Browns; the Browns, in turn, requested all four of the Jets'
first-round picks. The Jets said no.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cleveland held on to the pick because it felt that
Brown was a rare commodity _ a dominant defensive lineman who could
be among the best for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All of the teams in the top five seriously considered making
major trades. In fact, one league executive maintained that of the
31 teams, at least 20 explored trades in the first round alone. The
Eagles heard from at least three teams: the Jets, Green Bay and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme in this draft was character. The NFL has urged its
teams to draft as much for character as for talent. A number of
teams, including the Denver Broncos and the Giants, either removed
troubled players from their draft boards or dropped them
significantly in their rankings.
</P>
<P>
   One player who dropped on the boards of some teams, perhaps
unfairly, is Burress. He missed a scheduled appointment with
several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles, because he wanted
to attend the college basketball Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles began to spread the word that Burress had a bad
attitude _ as well as other unsubstantiated information _ and his
stock began to drop. To some team scouts, the league's emphasis on
drafting players with good character had gone too far in this case.
The Steelers are not concerned about any off-field problems and
think Burress' 6-5 stature can overwhelm most cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick might have been the first overall selection had it not
been for an arrest while at Florida State after paying $21.40 for
$412.38 worth of clothing at a department store. He also ran
several lackluster times in the 40-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are judging me by what I did,'' Warrick said. ``It was
something that happened. What I did was wrong, but I'm a better
person than that. Don't judge me by what I did. I can't please
everybody. I can't be what somebody else wants. I can only be
myself.''

ROBINSON'S DEVILS HAVING FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't work out the way it was supposed to for Larry
Robinson, but now he has this second chance, like a rebound in the
slot with the goalie sprawled out of position. Will he bury this
one in the net or misfire on his next and possibly best shot?
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson left the New Jersey Devils after their Stanley Cup
of 1995, he was a highly regarded assistant coach on the way up.
With his Montreal pedigree as a player and his apprenticeship under
Jacques Lemaire in New Jersey, Robinson went to the Los Angeles
Kings as a can't-miss candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And he missed. The Kings made the playoffs only once in
Robinson's four seasons and were swept in four games. Robinson
developed a stress condition that caused patches of skin to fall
off his arms and hands. He became known as a nice guy and a good
teacher whose players took advantage of his good nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were aware of it when he returned to New Jersey this
season as an assistant to Robbie Ftorek. ``He had a young team in
L.A. and maybe the message didn't come across as good as it's
coming toward us right now,'' the veteran goalie Martin Brodeur
said. ``Hopefully we'll be able to keep that respect towards him.
He's got a lot to teach us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson became their headmaster late in the season when Ftorek
was fired. Although he maintains friendly relations with the
players, Robinson put them through unusually long and strenuous
practices before the current playoffs opened against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That paid off as the Devils defeated the Panthers by 4-3 in the
opener on Thursday night. Since then, Robinson seems to have a
jaunty bounce in his step. His chipper mood has spread through a
roster that often seemed grim under Ftorek. The series resumes
Sunday night at Continental Arena, and Robinson is eager.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I look forward to, I love the playoffs,''
Robinson said. ``This is what it's all about. You know who you're
going to be facing, the same team for at least a week. Everybody
seems to be more focused. The guys are more intense. This is like
the start of a long journey. It's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens, the captain, said Robinson is ``very positive,
very confident, very approachable'' and ``very much a players'
coach.'' They all know he is in the Hall of Fame as a star
defenseman whose 20 years in postseason play are tied with Gordie
Howe for the National Hockey League record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells us to play with confidence and have fun,'' Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   That word ``fun'' is uncommon around the Devils. ``You don't
really associate fun with the playoffs,'' Stevens said, ``because
it's usually a dog fight and a long, hard road. But it does make
sense. You've got to enjoy the game. Work hard and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Robinson senses that the Devils' early exits in recent
seasons happened in part because the players were mentally
exhausted by the rules and pressure from General Manager Lou
Lamoriello and his coaches. When two Florida goals late in the
first period Thursday cut a Devils lead from 3-0 to 3-2, some
Devils expected anger from Robinson. He maintained his composure,
and this impressed Scott Gomez, the rookie star, who went out and
scored the winning goal.

   ``He was upbeat and he lit a fire under everybody in a positive
way,'' Gomez said. ``Nothing negative was said.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Gomez added: ``With Larry, it's fun coming to the
rink. I'm not saying anything against Robbie, but every coach
brings something different. Larry's always positive. He's always
joking around. If you do your job, he's going to let you know you
did a good job. If you're not doing what you're supposed to, he's
going to tell you in a positive way.''
</P>

   Robinson played on six championship teams in Montreal. His
teammates from that dynasty have flourished. Ken Dryden is the
president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, a vastly improved team under
his regime. Bob Gainey is the general manager of the Dallas Stars,
the defending champions. Lemaire is a consultant with the
Canadiens. They were not only the best as players but also among
the brightest, a group of hockey sophisticates whose influence now
guides the league.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach in that 1970s era, Scotty Bowman, is with Detroit,
seeking his third Red Wings championship in four seasons. Like many
players from that group, Robinson carefully chooses his words when
asked about the old coach who sometimes motivated players with
psychological ploys that mixed fear with humiliation. What did
Robinson learn from Bowman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember that far,'' Robinson said, dodging the
subject the way a player might dodge a body check. ``Short-term
memory.'' Perhaps this spring, in his short-term assignment,
Robinson will fashion something memorable for the long term.

HINDSIGHT SHOWS THAT NFL DRAFT IS NEVER A SURE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also FBN-DRAFT, FBN-DRAFT-ASSESS, FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To demonstrate just how much a game of chance the
National Football League draft is, these were the top 10 players
picked in 1992: Steve Emtman, Quentin Coryatt, Sean Gilbert,
Desmond Howard, Terrell Buckley, David Klingler, Troy Vincent, Bob
Whitfield, Tommy Vardell and Ray Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Busts, busts and more busts. Thus the following phrases,
overused by various draft geeks, should be banned from the English
language: ``destined to be great'' and ``future NFL star.''
Because, in fact, no one knows. For goodness' sake, Emtman was the
first pick in the draft and played only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this draft and the talk centering on two Penn
State players, defensive lineman Courtney Brown and linebacker
LaVar Arrington. Many analysts believe they are guaranteed to be
stars in the NFL, but as history has proved, there is a fine line
between success and failure, and only time will tell how good both
players become.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, draft debates have centered on two players, as
when personnel officials argued whether Rick Mirer or Drew Bledsoe
was the better quarterback, the same way there are now heated
discussions about whether Brown or Arrington was the better
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past three years, the Indianapolis Colts have been
in the middle of these kinds of arguments. Two years ago, they had
to decide between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. Then
last year, the debate was which running back was better, Edgerrin
James or Ricky Williams?
</P>
<P>
   No one would question the Colts' selections now, though at the
time many did, especially in the case of James and Williams, with
many league executives believing that Williams was by far the
better player. But teams and the news media forgot the lesson
learned from 1992: that the draft is as much about luck as it is
about thorough preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are intangibles you cannot account for,'' Denver coach
Mike Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened with the Colts shows how one pick can change the
fortunes of a franchise, either taking it to the next level or
hurting it.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the NFL believed that Leaf, out of Washington State, was
the best quarterback in 1998, and maybe the best player in the NFL
draft. Some were saying Leaf would be a quarterback for 10 years,
break passing records and win Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts weren't buying it. General manager Bill Polian thought
Manning's maturity gave him an edge. The inner strength, or
maturity, of a player is something that no test can measure, and
thus Polian went by his gut. Indianapolis had the first pick in the
draft in 1998 and chose Tennessee's Manning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had wanted to pick Leaf all along and ended up dead
wrong. Manning is a Pro Bowler and Leaf has been a tremendous
disappointment. Leaf has been through two shoulder operations, and
just last month he was called fat and ``out of shape'' by a
teammate, Fred McCrary.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's quarterback situation is so messy that the team
worked out the free agent Todd Marinovich, who spent three months
in jail in 1998 after pleading guilty to charges that he grew
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Colts were faced with another tough decision.
Many NFL scouts as well as members of the news media had Williams
rated ahead of James, mainly because Williams had both bulk and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   But again the Colts followed their instincts. They thought that
James was a better pass receiver and that he was more mentally
prepared to make an immediate impact. They turned out to be right.
</P>
<P>
   James is a hard worker who is respected in the locker room,
while Williams, selected by New Orleans, has proved to be immature
and injury prone and is disliked by many of his teammates who
believe he is lazy and a complainer.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts leave very little to chance while preparing for the
draft. Months before, they make contact with every football school
in the country, asking for thoughts on their players. The Colts
usually view more than 100 players either on tape or in person, and
each must submit to personal interviews and psychological tests.
Indianapolis' examinations are similar to those of other teams, but
Polian adds his personal touch, his brilliant instincts.
</P>
<P>
   But the line is thin. One pick can ruin a franchise for years.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka traded the entire Saints draft last year for
Williams. Ditka was fired and ended up leaving the organization in
disarray. The Chargers' decision to select Leaf may end up being
one of the more disastrous ones in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington and Brown may both be great players, but there was a
time when the Chargers thought the same thing about Leaf. That is
the most intriguing _ and frustrating _ part of this inexact
science known as the draft.

JETS GET TWO ON DEFENSE, THEN A QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets, coming off one of the most controversial and
shocking trades in franchise history, indicated that while they
insist they want to make an immediate run at a title, they are also
building for the future. They failed to trade up in the early part
of Saturday's National Football League Draft to grab a top-rated
receiver and instead used two of their first-round picks to fill a
desperate need for a pass rush _ defensive end Shaun Ellis and
linebacker John Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Al Groh talked before the draft about extending the
Jets' ``cycle of success,'' and he is apparently looking for a
long-term cycle. With the third selection of the first round, the
18th overall, the Jets again passed on a receiver in a
receiver-rich draft.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps harkening back to the dismal days after quarterback
Vinny Testaverde went down in the season opener last season, the
Jets chose a bit of a project, plucking quarterback Chad Pennington
of Marshall, who had fallen from a top-10 pick into the Jets' laps.
</P>
<P>
   When Testaverde, 36, was injured last season, it became obvious
the Jets did not have a quarterback prepared to step in. But Ray
Lucas emerged as a suitable backup during the second half of the
season, and the acquisition of Pennington calls Lucas' future with
the team into question.
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he was surprised that Pennington, who passed for 4,006
yards as a senior, had dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at ourselves for the long range and we'll have
two very good quarterbacks in place,'' Groh said. ``Ray has proven
he can win for our team. When Vinny chooses not to play anymore,
we'll still have a 1-2 circumstance, however those two work it out.
He keeps us from getting into a position where everything else is
in place and we don't have a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was the second-rated defensive end in the draft, and he
and Abraham, a former defensive end who shifted to linebacker in
his senior year, provide the pass-rush for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in the wake of the Jets' trade on Thursday with San
Francisco to move up to the 12th pick centered on the Jets wanting
to get Ellis before Green Bay could. And their commitment to Ellis
became obvious when the Jets let just 2:10 go off the clock before
making their pick.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Abraham was a surprise not so much because he
was not projected as a first-round pick but because the Jets'
offensive needs _ they also were looking for a tight end _ seemed
so pressing.
</P>
<P>
   In Ellis (6-4, 285 pounds), the Jets get a likely immediate
starter who combines size and speed. Last season, only Cleveland
had fewer sacks than the Jets had last season and the defensive
ends had just four sacks. Ellis had eight and a half sacks, 14
quarterback pressures and 11 tackles for lost yardage after
recovering from a 1998 car accident in which he fractured a hip _
and nearly ended his career _ after falling asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham (6-3, 251) was projected by some scouts as a defensive
end but is a pure pass rusher. He had six sacks and 12 quarterback
pressures last season and five stops for losses of 18 yards. But in
10 games, he showed his versatility, with 60 tackles and five
fumbles caused.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our first two players we were looking for players with
power and speed,'' Groh said. ``Both should develop into three down
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the draft, the Jets' needs were obvious: a receiver to
replace Keyshawn Johnson, a pass-rushing linebacker or defensive
lineman, and a tight end. In the days leading up to the draft, it
was thought that the Jets had focused on trying to acquire Plaxico
Burress, the Johnson-like receiver from Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the trade speculation surrounding the Jets had centered
on how far they would have to move up to take Burress. And when the
Jets made the deal with San Francisco to move up to the 12th
overall selection, it was inferred that they were hoping to get
Shaun Ellis, the Tennessee defensive end, before Green Bay could
grab him.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the early part of the draft unfolded,
surprisingly, according to order. The Jets could not pull off a
trade with Baltimore, with the fifth pick or with any of the other
teams between fifth and eighth. And when Pittsburgh was on the
clock with the eighth pick, the Jets had their last chance to move
up to secure Burress.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh was believed to be choosing between Burress and
quarterback Chad Pennington of Marshall. When the Steelers pulled
off a mild surprise and went with Burress, and Baltimore completed
their ideal first round by selecting Travis Taylor of Florida with
the 10th pick, the Jets had lost out on the three best receivers in
the draft and had lost the chance to make a high-profile pick to
replace Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets came the hard way by the unprecedented bounty of picks
that they started the day with. The 18th pick is theirs because
they finished a disappointing 8-8 last season. The 12th pick was
received in a trade with San Francisco for the Jets' 16th pick
(packaged with a second-round pick), which they acquired as
compensation when they lost their second head coach in two days,
Bill Belichick. And the 13th and 27th picks are, of course, Tampa
Bay's parting gift for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Al Groh spoke in the week before the draft _ and in the
days before the Johnson trade _ about his hope to extend the Jets'
``cycle of success.'' By that he meant that he did not want to see
the Jets subjected to the same fate as San Francisco and, to a
lesser extent, Dallas: the dramatic dropoff in results when age and
salary-cap restrictions limit the team's ability to restock with
young talent.
</P>
<P>
   That was a veiled reference that suggested the Jets would not
gut the rest of the team to restructure Johnson's deal. Later, Groh
added that he thought Johnson could be replaced, likening the
situation to how Indianapolis successfully replaced the departed
Marshall Faulk with Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson's trade was completed Wednesday, and after he had
finished dumping the blame for his departure squarely in Groh's
lap, the Jets did their best to boost their long-distance carrier's
profits.
</P>
<P>
   They worked the phones furiously, talking to almost everyone
ahead of them _ and several teams behind them _ in the draft
pecking order about a trade. They let their ears perk up, albeit
briefly, at the mention of Carl Pickens, the disgruntled Bengals
receiver. They inquired about the Browns' first overall pick, the
Bengals' fourth pick, the Ravens' fifth overall pick, the Steelers'
eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   If this is, as expected, the final draft of Bill Parcells'
career, he earned the rest this week. But, as teams maneuvered
throughout the league for what was expected to be a chaotic round
of draft-day deals, the Jets made just one move before the draft
began: the trade with San Francisco that gave them the 12th pick
Saturday, which they acquired, some league executives felt, because
they were concerned Green Bay would take defensive end Shaun Ellis.

EARLY-SEASON CLEMENS HAS ENOUGH TO GET BY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens keeps teasing the New York Yankees, pitching the
way they hope that he will in some spurts and then disappointing
them in others. They always want to believe that Clemens can
dominate, and sometimes he does. But there are other puzzling
starts in which Clemens is ordinary and the Yankees become
exasperated. On Friday night, Clemens was barely ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   A botched pop fly helped the Yankees score two important runs
and defeat the Kansas City Royals, 7-5, as Clemens lasted six
innings to win. The Yankees can preach about how Clemens battled on
a chilly night when his fastball was inconsistent and when he
needed to rebound after slogging through the first two innings. The
Yankees can dig for positives with Clemens because it is only
April.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens did not offer an artistic effort in becoming the
first Yankee starter other than Orlando Hernandez to win a game
this season. He gave up five runs and seven hits in six innings,
walking four, hitting one and throwing one wild pitch that scored a
run. So what were the positives? Well, Clemens never lost a lead,
although the leads felt perilous, and he won despite unleashing 116
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I pitched well,'' Clemens said. ``I was in bad counts.
I've got to stay away from bad counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said that he had good velocity on his fastball and that
his split-finger fastball was jumping. He forgot about the slider
that did not break and he overlooked the inconsistency that he
displayed too often. Clemens kept saying that the only problem he
had was falling behind batters, but those bad counts were caused by
his wayward pitches, so the pitches that led to the counts, not the
counts, were the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're throwing far too many pitches,'' Manager Joe Torre said.
``A lot of 3-2, 2-1, 3-0. You can't pitch like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another ugly game for the Yankees, another game in which
they did not play too crisply and still won. The Royals rumbled
into Yankee Stadium as the most dramatic team in the major leagues
after winning four straight games in their last at-bat. The streak
died Friday night and Mariano Rivera bagged the final four outs to
erase Kansas City's chance for more drama and mercifully end a
three-hour-48-minute affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was long and ugly,'' Torre said. ``It's just nice to be
able to get away with games like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees moved their games to 7:05 p.m. from 7:35, but that
early start was forgotten as some players left the Stadium close to
midnight. ``Maybe we're going to have to start them at 6 now,''
Jeff Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens began the second by drilling Mike Sweeney in the right
forearm with a fastball, a pitch that he said flew out of his hand.
One out later, Clemens walked Mark Quinn. A groundout pushed
runners to second and third with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fired two quick strikes past the No. 9 batter, Rey
Sanchez, setting up an enviable situation where he could pump a
fastball past Sanchez or get him to bite on a splitter. But
Clemens' splitter never dived and Sanchez lashed it to center for a
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada's two-run homer into the right upper deck in the
second and Ricky Ledee's run-scoring double in the third put the
Yankees ahead, 3-2. The Yankees received two breaks in the fourth.
Derek Jeter's tapper to second went for an infield single to
prolong an inning when replays indicated that he was out. Bernie
Williams hit a pop-up to shallow left field with the bases loaded
that inexplicably dropped in for a two-run double and a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clemens bounced a splitter to bring in Kansas City's
third run and, after Jeter's two-run single made it 7-3, Clemens
gave up a bullet of a two-run homer to Gregg Zaun to keep the
Royals close. Two batters later, Clemens trudged to the dugout
after finishing the sixth and finishing his night. Clemens got the
victory. He just left some unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Torre said, ``he's not in a groove.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scenario is ripe for a recurring nightmare. Darryl Kile
escapes from Colorado after being trapped there for two grueling,
punishing, agonizing years. Just when he begins to flourish in his
new home, he finds himself back in Colorado and again spends a
grueling, punishing, agonizing night.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Kile, it was not just a nightmare. After
winning his first two starts for St. Louis, he pitched against the
Rockies on Thursday night and did not survive the second inning.
The team with which he struggled the past two years pummeled him
for 11 runs (8 earned), including 10 in the second. He gave up two
consecutive home runs, hit three batters and threw two wild
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he went into that game with some apprehension,'' said
Dave Duncan, the Cardinals' pitching coach. ``Even in the first
inning it looked like he was trying too hard. I think he was
affected by being back in Colorado. You can't get distracted like
that. Being in that ballpark and trying to do so good, he lost his
concentration. I talked to him after the game. He was pretty
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile is one of Duncan's two pet projects this season. Pat
Hentgen is the other. How successful the Ph.D. of Pitching is could
determine how far the Cardinals go in the National League Central
race.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's goal is to return Kile and Hentgen to their better
days, when Hentgen won the American League Cy Young award (1996)
with Toronto and Kile won 19 games (1997) with Houston. With the
lusty hitting the Cardinals have unleashed on the league, they
could win the division title if their pitchers do their part.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Rocky Mountain nightmare, the Duncan developments
seemed promising. Although Kile and Hentgen did not pitch shutouts,
each won his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kile had been throwing the ball real good, and I think he'll
continue to throw the ball real good,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen, he said, has improved steadily. ``He still hasn't
picked up that velocity that I think he has a chance of
regaining,'' the coach said, ``but he's been getting himself into a
better position to throw the ball, a more powerful position. In two
or three more starts I think he'll be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said Hentgen had steadily altered his delivery to the
point that it affected the speed of his pitches. A study of
videotapes from better years showed that Hentgen, a right-hander,
was leaning toward first base and not moving directly toward home
plate when he prepared to throw his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring that delivery back into balance,''
Duncan said. ``If we can do that, I think what we'll see is Pat
pick up some velocity. There's no reason he should have dropped off
in velocity. He's as physically strong as he's ever been. But his
delivery was not enabling him to take advantage of his strength,
putting him in a position where he can have his maximum arm speed.
If we can get him back into balance, then everything else is going
to fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile had a different problem, Duncan said. It is the free-agent
syndrome. A player moves to a new team with a lucrative contract
and thinks he has to justify the contract by doing more than he had
done to warrant the money. Instead, he winds up performing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl may have varied off the path of success simply because
he tried to do more than he had done before when he pitched good,''
Duncan said. ``He tried to add to his game and it probably took him
away from the things that he had done consistently before. The
whole thing is to get him back on a more narrow path doing things
that he has a lot of confidence in and he knows he can execute. I
didn't do anything major other than talking to him about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile has two poor seasons to overcome, two seasons in which he
compiled a 10-12 record with a 6.76 earned run average at Coors
Field. A trade to the Cardinals freed him from that nightmarish
park, but the schedule and the Cardinals' pitching order brought
him right back to it.
</P>
<P>
   Home Run Ho-Hum
</P>
<P>
   The National League's Home Run Central has not taken off the way
it was expected to. Mark McGwire has a bad back, and Sammy Sosa and
Ken Griffey Jr. have started slowly, although Griffey hit his first
three home runs in three consecutive games last week.
</P>
<P>
   The big hitter in the Central Division has been Jim Edmonds.
Rumors in the winter and spring had him heading from Anaheim to the
Yankees or Seattle or any number of other places, but he wound up
in St. Louis. In the team's first 11 games he amassed 16 hits in 35
at-bats, slugged five home runs, walked 13 times and compiled a
1.000 slugging percentage (same number of total bases as at-bats)
and .612 on-base percentage to go with his .457 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Starts Fast
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas was probably the most maligned player of the
spring, receiving critical comments from former teammates and
undergoing unusually close scrutiny in news media reports. It did
not help that his performance the past two years did not live up to
his production in his first seven full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to get back to those All-Star seasons and silence his
critics, Thomas is off to a dazzling start for the Chicago White
Sox. In the team's first 11 games (through Friday night), he had 22
hits in 46 at-bats for a .478 average, three home runs and 10 runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Starts
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Mike Hampton, pitching for Houston, lost only four
games and Rey Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop, committed only four
errors. In the same game last week, Hampton, now a Mets pitcher,
lost his third game of this season and Ordonez made his third
error.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan holds the unenviable record of having lost games for
more teams (11) than any other pitcher in major league history. But
Morgan, a 40-year-old right-hander pitching for his 12th team, has
found a new career. Filling in for Matt Mantei, the Diamondbacks'
injured closer, Morgan relieved three times and earned three saves
in a span of six Arizona victories. In the first 18 years of his
career, Morgan gained three saves in his 71 relief appearances. He
has not added the Diamondbacks to the lengthy list of teams with
which he has lost games.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Double Duty
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza needed extra innings, but he kept this season's most
intriguing streak alive Friday night by hitting his second home run
of the Mets' game in Pittsburgh in the 12th inning. Each day since
the season really began (that is, excluding the two games in
Japan), at least one player entering Saturday's schedule had hit
two home runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was the 31st player to perform the double (Kevin Elster
is the only one of the group who hit three in a game). In the
corresponding period last season, 16 players had done it.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was the 17th in the National League, which had 11 a year
ago. The huge leap has been in the American League, 14 as against
five a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ball of Fire
</P>
<P>
   With home runs flying out of parks more frequently than ever,
commissioner Bud Selig has directed that the baseballs be tested
again. They have been tested the past couple of seasons, officials
have said, and found to be no different from their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Selig does not expect the results of the new tests to show
anything new but wants to be in position to answer the charges that
the ball is more potent. He is not necessarily looking to defuse
the bombs that are falling on the poor pitchers. Fans like home
runs and high-scoring games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with pleasing your customers,'' Selig
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Houston Astros and the San Francisco Giants
seemed to have had in mind when they built their new parks. Fans
like home runs? Okay, keep the fences close. The distance down one
foul line in each park is shorter than the minimum 325 feet the
rules call for. But both clubs say they had other reasons for the
abbreviated distance.
</P>
<P>
   The right-field line at the Giants' Pacific Bell Park is 309
feet. ``It wasn't a matter of wanting to do it that way,'' said Bob
Rose, the team's vice president for communications. ``It was a
matter of what's behind it, which is water. Literally they couldn't
go any farther.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros said their 315-foot distance down the left-field line
at Enron Field stemmed from an economic decision. They said a
greater distance would have required the span across the
retractable roof to be longer and therefore cost significantly
more.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had approval of the commissioner's office for the
shorter lines. The Astros nevertheless defended their left-field
line by saying the rule book provides only a guideline on
distances. The wording, however, is stronger than a guideline. Rule
1.04 states that any park built after June 1, 1958, ``shall provide
a minimum distance of 325 feet from home base to the nearest fence,
stand or other obstruction on the right and left field foul
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming Events
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker is eligible to return from his two-week suspension
Tuesday night when the Atlanta Braves play at home against
Philadelphia. The Braves hope he will concentrate on his pitching,
believing that his fastball is so much more eloquent than his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The owners will meet in Houston Monday and Tuesday but will not
vote on realignment. That step is expected to come at their June
meeting. However, John Harrington of Boston and David Montgomery of
Philadelphia will make a presentation on realignment. Barring an
unforeseen development, Arizona will move to the American League
West, Tampa Bay to the National League Southeast and Texas to what
will become a six-team AL Central.

RED BULLET AIMS TO BREAK A 118-YEAR STREAK IN KENTUCKY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a Philadelphia native who has borrowed European training
techniques and endorses a practice most horsemen consider
blasphemous: Sundays are a day of rest for both him and his stock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Joe Orseno wants to upend another bedrock of horse racing:
he is hoping to win the Kentucky Derby with a colt who did not race
as a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that was done America was barely a century old and
the Derby, now the nation's oldest continuously held sports event,
was in only its eighth running: it was done in 1882 by Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed,'' Orseno said. ``This is the year 2000.
Things are done differently. My colt doesn't know he didn't run as
a 2-year-old. He doesn't know how many races he has run.''
</P>
<P>
   The colt is Red Bullet, a son of Unbridled. His competitors in
the Wood Memorial Saturday knew he had looked formidable in winning
all three of his previous races, especially last month's Gotham
Stakes with Alex Solis aboard. Even Neil Drysdale, the trainer of
Fusaichi Pegasus, the odds-on favorite, tried to deflect attention
away from his $4 million colt at Thursday's post-position draw by
pointing out what many have marveled about. ``Let's see,'' Drysdale
mused, ``we have an undefeated horse in here and my horse has been
beaten. Maybe I shouldn't be the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno, 44, wasn't always sure his way was the right way. He
saddled his first winner in 1977 and notched training titles in the
1980s in the big time's satellite circuits of Atlantic City, the
Meadowlands, Garden State Park and Delaware Park. But in 1993, when
he showed up at the Meadowlands with 10 very ordinary horses,
Orseno realized he was on the verge of becoming a free-thinking
former trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my way out,'' he said. ``I was working hard, but no
one was coming to me with horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful owners had been watching him, it turned out.
First, Leonard Green offered him the trainer's job for DJ Stable,
which brought him to the attention of another free-thinker who
wanted to make a larger impact on horse racing: Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Stronach, a Canadian businessman, sent six of his
second-string horses to Orseno at Monmouth Park. The next year
Stronach doubled that number, and in 1998 he signed Orseno to a
five-year contract to handle 35 to 40 of his top horses. Last year,
Orseno was the third-leading trainer in New York and Stronach
Stables topped the owners list with 58 victories and $2.29 million
in purses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Orseno has received an education in how experimentation
and expansion breeds success. Stronach recently purchased several
tracks, including Gulfstream and Santa Anita, increased his racing
and breeding operation and won the 1999 Eclipse Award as America's
leading owner. ``He has a vision of things and it includes getting
people in place and trusts his people,'' Orseno said. ``He lets
them do what works.''
</P>
<P>
   What works for Red Bullet and the rest of Orseno's stock is a
fitness method borrowed from Europe but tailored to American
horses. Instead of relying on fast workouts of four to seven
furlongs, Orseno gets his horses fit in what he calls ``controlled
gallops.'' In Europe, trainers sometimes gallop their horses on
trails through the countryside, but Orseno keeps them on the track
and varies their pace and distance from day to day. One day, he'll
ask Red Bullet for a mile in 2 minutes 20 seconds, another in 2:15
and some days as low as 2:00.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was claiming horses, I noticed that they'd come out of
a race that they just won but barely could get around the track in
an easy gallop,'' Orseno said. ``What I'm trying to do is give them
stamina and fitness every day without hurting them. When I ask them
to go fast, I know they're ready to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Red Bullet has demonstrated not only sturdy fitness but
also a racing savvy that belies the fact that he had only three
races before the Wood. In his brief career, the colt has been
bumped and blocked and has stumbled out of the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet and Orseno will rest Sunday because the trainer
believes both humans and horses need their rest. Monday? Red Bullet
is scheduled to fly to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby. His
trainer has yet to attend one even as a spectator.

 &HT;    Freaknik is now Freaknot
 &HT;    By Jack Warner and Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leaden skies and cold winds gave way to sunshine in
downtown Atlanta Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik, which grew from a little picnic in 1982 to what many
saw as a planned disaster in the mid-'90s, did not survive the
millennium. The question was whether it was slain by city officials
or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, ``It's time to go ahead and just call the
eulogy for Freaknik,'' said George Hawthorne, an event planner who
advised city officials on ways to control it. ``It is definitely
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne is certainly not the first to announce the death of
Freaknik. Every year, visitors upset by the increasing police
presence said ``it's dead'' and vowed never to return. This year,
they kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police, put on the usual 12-hour shifts for Freaknik
weekend, reported no trace of anyone getting their freak on.
Barricades hauled out in case streets needed to be blocked off sat
unused on street corners. What is now officially known as Black
College Spring Break was reported alive and well this weekend on
the beaches of Texas, a resort area better prepared to deal with
it.
</P>
<P>
   The sole remnant of the celebration was its most positive; more
than 50,000 people came to the World Congress Center looking for
work at the National Job Fair.
</P>
<P>
   An offshoot of Freaknik, the job fair attracted 239 companies
looking for everything from security guards to high level
executives. Kenneth Wimberly of KW Productions, the organizer of
the job fair, said he hopes to get jobs for at least 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the happening is this weekend,'' said Wimberly,
referring to the demise of Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Huey, who moved to Atlanta about two months ago from
Charlotte, NC, was taken aback when asked about Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaknik? We are all here looking for jobs,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's leaders blew hot and cold over the years on Freaknik.
Attempts to provide some organization for the event, including
scheduled events at different venues, proved fruitless. As violence
became more and more a part of the party, the city began to get
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne was chairman of the mayor's 1998 committee to look
into ways to control the event. The committee advised the city not
to issue permits or offer support for any Freaknik-related events.
It recommended asking black colleges to discourage their students
from attending. And it endorsed strict policing, including shutting
down roads, towing cars and making arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The city followed the committee's advice. Actually, crowds had
dwindled steadily from the estimated 200,000 who brought Atlanta to
a standstill in 1994, but as the crowds went down, arrests went up.
Freaknik recorded only one fatality _ a visitor from Ohio killed by
local thugs in a 1996 robbery attempt _ but violence, especially
against women, got worse until last year, when few black college
women showed up.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the real death knell for Freaknik. A Spelman
freshman reported last year that ``There were 10 to 20 guys to
every girl, and they were really rude and disrespectful.'' That was
an improvement from the previous year, however, when at least two
women were raped and others had their clothes ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the women there is no event,'' Hawthorne said. He
contended that Freaknik ``stopped being a college event years
ago.'' Indeed, police usually reported that many if not most of
those arrested were not students, and many were local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik is a prime example of a nice little idea that got out
of hand with an unexpected, even unintended, boost from the media.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1982, when Morehouse and Spelman students from the
Washington, D.C. area _ members of a little group called the D.C.
Metro Club _ decided it would be a nice idea to have a picnic just
before final exams. Soon they added a pajama party on Friday that
tended to overshadow the picnic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Growing slowly, it was usually a few hundred students in John
White Park having a cookout, playing touch football and listening
to D.C.-style music. ``It was very wholesome,'' recalls 1989
Morehouse grad Jim Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, however, the media plug came along and the celebration
``blew up,'' Shelton said. It was on ``A Different World,'' the NBC
sitcom on black college life, that ``somebody actually mentioned
that they were going to Freaknik. All of a sudden it went from
three or four thousand to 20,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Atlanta was still unaware of Freaknik and city
officials, wanting to keep it that way, stopped granting permits to
the D.C. Metro Club. But Freaknik took on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik finally hit the headlines and the airwaves of Atlanta's
major news outlets in 1992, when 80,000 people showed up and
started the annual traffic snarl.
</P>
<P>
   It began getting out of hand in a big way in 1993, when police
severely underestimated the crowd, 120,000 or more. City officials
agreed that authorities needed to get control of it, but their
attitudes were divided along racial lines, which was usually the
case with Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Mary Davis, saying her constituents in Midtown
complained loudly of traffic jams, lewd displays and partiers
relieving themselves in residents' yards, demanded Freaknik be
outlawed. ``We are not a resort city,'' she said. ``We are a
convention city, but this was not a convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-Councilman Bill Campbell, however, described the partiers
he encountered as ``innocent as those in 'Beach Blanket Bingo'
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Campbell was mayor, and Freaknik reached its
watershed. Despite events planned at various venues, police
blockades around midtown and a tougher attitude, the city was
overwhelmed by more than 200,000 visitors. It was hard, sometimes
impossible, for workers, wedding parties, doctors and even
ambulances to get from here to there. Police arrested 143 people
and towed 706 cars. Businessmen, who never seemed to lose hope that
they could make money off the event, began to complain that it was
costing them money.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers were down by half in 1995, but the ugliness grew. Police
managed to protect the Midtown area, but other area roads were
gridlocked tight, and white motorists stranded in the traffic said
they were terrified by threats and overt gestures from blacks in
nearby cars. Looting broke out downtown, forcing shopkeepers to
close their doors, and crowds surged out to a local mall, where to
the dismay of black residents in the area, a major department store
was trashed and looted.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 509 people and confiscated 53 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The city was gearing up for the Olympics in 1996, and Freaknik,
according to Mayor Bill Campbell, was ``the best ever. We made
great strides in eliminating the tension and divisiveness. We have
come a long way from last year to this year. It is a tremendous
victory for us. There is a degree of harmony we did not have last
year.'' The harmony may have been aided by the fact that only about
60,000 people showed up, and 683 of them were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the crowd estimate was up to 75,000, and arrests down
to about 300, and officials declared it an even nicer party than
1996. Police Chief Beverly Harvard, however, complained about the
continuing ``lewd and inappropriate behavior,'' and businessmen
groused that they still weren't making any money off Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seemed that 1998 spelled the beginning of the
end. Florida and Texas beaches began drawing partiers; Atlanta
crowds were down to 50,000, 64 weapons were confiscated and arrests
soared to nearly 500. The lewdness turned to violence. Two
18-year-old women reported they were raped. Others were groped and
some were partially stripped by anonymous hands reached through
open car windows and ripping their clothes off. In one incident,
four men intervened to rescue a woman being manhandled by a crowd
of men.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was under 50,000 last year, and the vast majority were
men, prowling disconsolately in search of agreeable women. Police
enforced tough regulations, and this time, the vows never to come
back were kept.

 &HT;    Braves fall back into losing ways
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Temperatures fell back into the 40s, wind off Lake
Michigan picked up, and the Braves started back into their
week-long freeze Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After snapping a three-game losing streak Friday night, the
Braves had the tables turned on them by the Brewers in a 6-3 loss.
A three-run eighth inning off John Burkett spoiled a two-run
Quilvio Veras game-tying home run in the top of that inning,
handing the Braves their fourth loss in five games on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   And this was supposed to be the easy part of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They'll try to get themselves turned back in the right direction
today with struggling fourth starter Terry Mulholland facing the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a win here (Sunday) and get back home,'' Bobby
Cox said. ``It hasn't been a good trip so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Veras had just tied the game at 3 with his first home run with
the Braves when they loaded the bases with one out for Javy Lopez.
But he bounced into a double-play, continuing the team's pattern of
missed scoring chances on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sinking fastball,'' Lopez said. ``I hit it well, just
bad luck. Unfortunately, I hit it on the ground rather than a fly
ball. (David Weathers) made a good pitch on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves take solace in knowing they have only one more game
until they return home to warmer Turner Field, where John Rocker
will rejoin them Tuesday, Brian Jordan will return on Wednesday and
Rudy Seanez won't be far behind. Burkett will work into the
rotation, where it looked Saturday afternoon like he'd be a better
fit than in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I neve think that,'' Burkett said of not being comfortable as
a reliever. ``I try to do the best job at whatever job I have.
Pitching is pitching. You either you do your job or you don't, and
I didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett had leadoff hitter Mark Loretta 1-2 before giving up a
double on a fastball inside for Loretta's third hit of the game.
Andres Galarraga then let a Jeromy Burnitz grounder scoot under his
glove, allowing a run to score, and Geoff Jenkins launched a
monster homer off the scoreboard in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Braves bullpen fell to 1-4 with a 5.00 ERA to go
with two blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup without Jordan and Chipper Jones (sore elbow), didn't
offer much of a fight for LaGrange native Jimmy Haynes, who retired
13 in a row in one stretch. Before this no-decision, he had won his
first two starts after coming over from Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody in here is worried,'' said Kevin
Millwood, who has yet to get a decision in three starts. ``With the
team we've got in here, we'll be able to bounce back and play some
good baseball.''

ROBERT EMMETT, 78, WROTE `THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Emmett, an actor and writer for the stage and
screen whose credits include the 1960s satirical television news
show ``That Was the Week That Was,'' died April 8 at St. Vincent's
Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett died after surgery for acute appendicitis, said his
daughter, Kathryn Emmett.
</P>
<P>
   Born Robert McMenamin in Monterey, Calif., he legally adopted
his father's given name, Emmett, as his own surname for the stage.
He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1943,
then he enlisted in the United States Navy. After his discharge, he
headed to New York to pursue acting.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in various Broadway and Off Broadway productions,
including the 1953 production of ``Mid-Summer,'' starring Geraldine
Page; and the 1953 Phoenix Theater production of ``Madam, Will You
Walk,'' with Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn.
</P>
<P>
   It was while touring with Melvyn Douglas' 1950 production of
``Two Blind Mice'' that Emmett got to know his future wife, the
actress Kim Hunter. The couple had met two years earlier at the
Westport Country Playhouse where Emmett was working as an
apprentice and Hunter was performing. Hunter and Emmett were
married in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Emmett expanded his theater career by writing
for television and, in 1967, the stage. He turned out segments for
dramatic shows and specials for entertainers including Jack Jones,
Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. As head writer
for ``That Was the Week That Was,'' Emmett was nominated for an
Emmy for outstanding writing in 1964 and 1965. In 1965, he
collaborated with Jule Styne and Bob Merrill on an ABC musical,
``The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood,'' with Liza Minnelli
and Cyril Ritchard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in his final performance, Emmett appeared opposite
his wife in ``On Golden Pond'' at the New Jersey Repertory Theater
in Long Branch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, and his daughter, of Stamford, Conn.,
he is survived by a son, Sean, also of Stamford, and six
grandchildren.

 &HT;    Falcons select Claridge with top pick
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Travis Claridge is not about to dazzle anyone with
footwork, and he wasn't the fastest or most agile offensive lineman
available in this year's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-time All-Pac-10 selection from Southern Cal has the
mean streak Falcons coach Dan Reeves likes in his blockers. And the
Falcons have lost three offensive linemen since last season, so
Saturday they selected Claridge in the second round, 37th overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons didn't have a first-round pick, and it took more
than six hours for the 6-foot-5, 305-pound Claridge to become the
fourth offensive linemen drafted. He won't have to wait long to get
in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Art Shell believes Claridge would be good
at guard, but Reeves said Claridge's first shot with the Falcons
will come at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like he was the best choice for us to come in and
compete at the right tackle position with (starter) Ephraim
(Salaam),'' Reeves said. ``He's got to prove that he can't play
tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Claridge started every game in his college career, the first
three years at right guard, then at right tackle as a senior. He
was chosen the Pac-10's outstanding offensive lineman of the year
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who will have one selection today in each of rounds
three through seven, drafted for need on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, who in 1998 became just the fourth player in NFL history
to start every game of his rookie season, including a Super Bowl,
regressed in '99.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of coaches, Salaam _ a seventh-round choice in '97
_ gained weight in the hope he would become a more prototypical,
power-blocking right tackle. Instead, his footwork suffered, and
his confidence took a beating as he didn't play as well as in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge, a high school All-American from Vancouver, Wash., was
first team All-Pac-10 his past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His best time in the 40-yard dash was 5.16 seconds, which for
his weight is average. But he's strong, bench-pressing 225 pounds
29 times, and can push defensive linemen around.
</P>
<P>
   His pass protection skills trail his run-blocking skills,
however, and Claridge had arthroscopic surgery after the '97 and
'98 seasons to clean debris out of his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulders are fine,'' Claridge said. ``I can play heavier
if they want me to, and ... play whatever position they want me to.
I feel ecstatic.''

SO FAR, STONEMAN LOOKING LIKE A GENIUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- The outfield fence at Edison Field this season has a
mural honoring the members of the Angels' all-time team. There are
the usual suspects, like Reggie Jackson, Bobby Grich and Doug
DeCinces.
</P>
<P>
   And there are others who left Anaheim in a huff. Rod Carew was
bitter after being let go as a player in 1985, and a bit perturbed
when it happened to him again as a coach after last season. Brian
Downing vowed never to return to the ballpark after the Angels cut
him loose following the 1990 season. He finally showed up on
opening night this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nolan Ryan was allowed to leave via free agency after going
16-14 in 1979. Then-Angels GM Buzzie Bavasi reasoned that he'd just
go out and sign two 8-7 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to present day. There are three players still
playing today that grace the wall, but only one -- Troy Percival --
is with the team. Jim Edmonds and Chuck Finley are up there, a
testament to their popularity with the fans, who voted for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the irony of it all is that Edmonds and Finley aren't
with the team anymore, Edmonds having been traded to St. Louis, and
Finley signing as a free agent with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those moves -- or lack thereof -- was new general manager
Bill Stoneman.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman took on what many might consider an impossible job --
turning around the fortunes of a club that hit rock-bottom last
season. And having to do so under the watchful eyes of that big
mouse in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Being the guy that oversaw the departure of two of the
franchise's most popular players is not the legacy Stoneman would
like to have. And early in his tenure with the club, the criticism
was endless.
</P>
<P>
   It came from everywhere. Of course, the radio talk-shows joined
the fray when Stoneman-bashing became trendy. But it started with
Finley, who was not offered a contract after 14 years with the
club. It continued with talk that agents and general managers
around the league were annoyed with Stoneman, because he wouldn't
budge on his demands for Edmonds in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Stoneman is still standing, and the Angels are off to a
relatively good start, considering expectations for the team. With
Finley, Stoneman explains, the parting of the two sides was of
Finley's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman was told by Finley's agent, Tim Shannon, that Finley
was seeking a three-year deal worth at least $25 million. That
didn't fit under Stoneman's budget, but he still wanted to speak
with Finley face-to-face and get a ``feeling'' for what Finley
really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Would Finley take less to stay with the Angels or not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall one phone conversation,'' Stoneman said. ``I had left
messages and he did finally get back to me. I asked if we could get
together that week and he said he couldn't do it, that he'd
definitely call next week and we'd definitely get together. That
call never came.''
</P>
<P>
   With Edmonds, there were the constant rumors. When nothing
happened, Stoneman was criticized. But when he finally did make a
trade, he filled two needs the club had -- starting pitching (Kent
Bottenfield) and second base (Adam Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff, whether it was all the media pressure over the
winter in terms of trades, or people not having a good outlook for
the team ... I've seen that before,'' said Stoneman, who spent 17
years in the Expos organization. ``It wasn't anything that
surprised me or caused me to change anything. It really isn't a
surprise the team has come together like it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on clubs that were very disappointing. You can
correct things very quickly. The important thing is don't change
your plan. If you have a good plan and you believe in your plan and
the people around you believe in it, it's going to work. The
important thing is to have discipline to stay with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did trade Jim Edmonds, but we had opportunities early. Had
we followed through on one of those, it wouldn't have worked out
nearly as well as it did. Sometimes you've just got to be patient
until the right thing does come along. One thing I've learned over
the years, if you exercise patience and good judgement, you'll be
rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels fans have waited 40 years. Is that long enough?

 &HT;    Browns think Brown
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first round of the NFL draft stayed pretty much
true to form Saturday _ until the Ravens and Raiders pulled some
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Browns drafted Penn State defensive end
Courtney Brown with the No. 1 pick. Brown, from Alvin, S.C., beat
out Nittany Lions teammate LaVar Arrington for that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 6 feet 4 and 270 pounds, is the first defensive end
drafted No. 1 since Bruce Smith was taken first by Buffalo in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, an All-America linebacker, was drafted second by the
Redskins, making it the first time since 1984 that teammates went
1-2. Irving Fryar and Dean Steinkuhler of Nebraska were the top two
choices that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long, healthy discussion about both players,'' Browns
coach Chris Palmer said. ``Basically, what it came down to is that
defensive ends are involved in rushing the quarterback. They're
both outstanding players. We couldn't have gone wrong selecting
either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins became only the fifth team in 30 years to make two
picks in the top five. After selecting Arrington, Washington
drafted Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels with the third
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Washington obtained the No. 2 pick from New Orleans in last
year's Ricky Williams trade, and the Redskins got No. 3 from San
Francisco in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to please the whole war room,'' Redskins
coach Norv Turner said. ``But once we got Arrington for the
defense, and Samuels for the offense, everybody was happy. We're
facing lofty expectations now, but I think we're going to be a
really good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bengals drafted Florida State receiver Peter Warrick
with the fourth pick, the Ravens surprised a lot of people by
drafting Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis struggled last season after missing most of the '98
campaign with a serious knee injury. But he seemed to temper
concerns during his offseason workouts for NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concerns about repercussions from the previous
injuries,'' Ravens coach Brian Billick said. ``Anytime you draft a
player, you're concerned about injuries. Jamal was the key to our
draft, whether we got him at No. 5 or No. 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who vaulted himself into the top 10 after running the
40-yard dash in only 4.34 seconds at a workout last month, said he
didn't know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything was going to be a surprise to me,'' Lewis said. ``I
talked with the Ravens and kind of felt like they wanted to take a
running back. I didn't know if it was going to be me, (Virginia's)
Thomas Jones or (Alabama's) Shaun Alexander.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 6 feet and 240 pounds, said Ravens general manager Ozzie
Newsome called him only minutes before NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue announced the selection on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to run well and prove to everybody that the knee
is fine and I'm healthy,'' Lewis said. ``That's what I wanted to do
going into the draft. I think that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens acquired the fifth pick from the Falcons last year.
Atlanta received Baltimore's second-round pick in the `99 draft and
selected tight end Reggie Kelly of Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   The draft's biggest surprise came from the Raiders, who selected
Florida State kicker Sebastian Janikowski at No. 17. It was the
first time a kicker went in the first round since New Orleans
selected Russell Erxleben of Texas with the 11th pick in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, a native of Poland, has one of the strongest legs to
ever enter the draft. But he also faces a bribery charge for
allegedly offering a police officer in Tallahassee, Fla., $300 to
release his roommate from custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like this pick will help our entire football team,''
Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. ``He'll help our defense and he'll
put points on the board for our offense. ... We did a lot of
research on this young man. We feel we have an environment with our
veteran players and our coaching staff for this young man to
flourish.''

FOR CUBAN BOY'S UNCLE, REVERENCE AND SCORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For four months now, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle of
Elian Gonzalez, has zigzagged his way through a phalanx of lawyers
and government officials, Cuban-American leaders and politicians,
calling the shots as he sees fit, day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   He lurches from defiance to conciliation, relying on his
instincts to guide him, friends say, not on any coherent legal
strategy. When he wants to send a warning shot Washington's way, he
inflames the army of people that stands only steps outside his home
in Little Havana, then allows others to calm the crowd with
exhortations of prayer and patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazaro! Lazaro!'' one woman in the crowd shouted again and
again the other day as he strode toward the hundreds of
well-wishers pressing in on the metal barricades. ``You are our
hero,'' the woman shouted. ``The community is with you. Stay
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a no-nonsense 49-year-old Cuban refugee, appears to
have single-handedly confounded Attorney General Janet Reno again
and again, to the point that an exasperated Justice Department
seems poised to take action and force Gonzalez to hand Elian over
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Lazaro Gonzalez has been the leader in all of
this,'' said Spencer Eig, one of Gonzalez's lawyers. ``He has been
the true paterfamilias. He is the decision-maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Miami's Cuban-American community, Gonzalez is viewed
harshly, often with derision, as a villain who is shamelessly
exploiting a young child to score political points, without concern
for the boy's well-being. But here, in his front yard, he is hailed
as a hero, a humble car repairman who sacrificed privacy and
normalcy to save a little boy from the clutches of communism and
now from the grip of a father the Miami relatives accuse of being
unfit.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and lawyers paint a picture of a man who inside his own
home is beset by conflict, emotionally spent and haunted by one
idea: that Elian will someday blame him _ not for keeping him from
his father, but for turning him over without a tough enough fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has two different sets of loyalties,'' said Jose
Garcia-Pedrosa, the lawyer who is closest to Gonzalez, ``a loyalty
to the law and a loyalty to the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who is having trouble reconciling the fact that
fate and the INS gave him this boy,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said. ``He
formed a bond of trust with him. Now he is being demanded, under
the threat of prosecution and persecution, to breach that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Gonzalez has slept little, preferring to
sit on the back porch, smoking cigarettes and, on occasion,
praying, said Armando Gutierrez, the family's round-the-clock
spokesman. His nerves are frayed, Gutierrez said. ``He's afraid any
night they will come through the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the crowd tries to buck him up, but few would want to
trade places. ``I wouldn't want to be in his shoes,'' said Silvia
Iriondo, the director of Mothers Against Repression.
</P>
<P>
   Before Elian was picked up at sea on Thanksgiving, Gonzalez
fixed dented cars for a living and rarely gave politics a passing
thought. His brother Delfin worked in the Florida Keys as a
fisherman, tending lobster traps. Lazaro Gonzalez's daughter,
Marisleysis, 21, processed loans at a bank, and his wife, Angela,
drove to her factory job every morning, as she still does on
occasion despite the hubbub around them.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Gonzalez plays to the stereotype of the Latin
macho. Gruff and rash, he is known to have drunk too much at times;
twice he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.
He has clung steadfastly to traditional roles both at home and
outside. But Elian's arrival shook up his world.
</P>
<P>
   He argued with one brother, Manuel Gonzalez, over what to do
with Elian. Manuel wanted Lazaro Gonzalez to let the boy go home.
Gonzalez disagreed, and the two have not spoken since.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Elian's arrival, Gonzalez found himself
surrounded by powerful politicians and a legion of lawyers, all of
them advising him on what course of action to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone and his uncle in Miami thinks they know how to handle
the case better themselves,'' said Jose Basulto, the leader of
Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban-American organization. Lawyers
involve Gonzalez in every decision, distilling the legal work to
the minimum so he can see his way through the thicket of laws.
Advisers counsel him on how to deal with the crowd. Sometimes he
listens; sometimes he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has been Gonzalez, in consultation with Marisleysis
and Delfin, who has made some of the most controversial decisions.
Early on, his lawyers say, it was Gonzalez who decided not to
publicly accuse Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, of being an
unfit parent and husband, something Gonzalez has said he learned
from Elian. He and his family even praised Juan Miguel for being a
good father. Then, when the federal government adopted a tougher
stance, Gonzalez took a different approach. Now his lawyers, who
say they respected his decision, say it is more difficult for
people to believe him, since the accusations come so late.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived from Cuba nine days ago and is
staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md., has said
the accusations are false and has characterized them as a desperate
ploy by his Miami relatives to keep the boy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, after Reno flew to Miami to try to persuade
Lazaro Gonzalez to back down, he decided instead to dig in deeper.
He appeared abruptly in front of the television cameras late in the
night and said he would not turn Elian over to the authorities.
Soon after, he allowed Elian to be videotaped on his bed, defiantly
telling his father he did not want to go back to Cuba. The
videotape was broadcast across the nation. It was a last-ditch
attempt by Lazaro Gonzalez to try to show people that Elian was
speaking truthfully, and from the heart, about his wishes, lawyers
and relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was imminent, that the marshals were going to
come,'' Jorge Mas Santos, the leader of the influential
Cuban-American National Foundation, said. ``It was done out of
their frustration that they were not being heard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the most recent glaring example of the gap between
the Cuban-American community and the rest of the country. In Miami,
the videotape was viewed by many as an affirmation of Elian's
legitimate feelings and people wondered why the family did not make
the tape sooner. Elsewhere, it served only to bolster arguments
that the boy was being coached and turned against his father.
According to surveys, most Americans believe Lazaro Gonzalez is
breaking the law and exposing Elian to further emotional damage by
possibly spurring a confrontation with federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Lazaro Gonzalez has let Elian's wishes guide his
course of action, lawyers and friends say. ``Psychologists have
told him that it would be better for Elian if they came here, and
Lazaro handed him over, than for Lazaro to put him on a plane,''
Gutierrez said. ``It would be like putting him on a raft again.''
</P>
<P>
   The two _ great-uncle and boy _ have formed a close bond, the
lawyers and friends say. Not a day goes by, they say, that Elian
does not remind his great-uncle that he does not want to return to
Cuba and that he is afraid of his father. Gonzalez believes the
boy, they say, and feels obligated to protect him, a view with
which the Justice Department, and most of the country, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno seems to think that a person would have to be
brainwashed to prefer not to live in Cuba,'' Eig said. ``His mother
told him to feel that way. She obviously felt that way. I think he
learned it a long time before he came to Little Havana. Most people
in Cuba feel that way. That's why the traffic on the Florida
Straits is all one way.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, people crowded around Gonzalez's block to get a
glimpse of Elian and say a prayer for him. Now they are also
coming, some of them for the first time, to honor Gonzalez in his
time of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has behaved magnificently,'' said Milagros Bauza, 58, who
said that she and her husband were in solidarity with Gonzalez,
whom they described as ``a simple man of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this, there is no privacy,'' Bauza said, waving toward
the house. ``They have been mocked. Their lives are in danger. He
could go to jail. To me, he is a hero. He's acting out of good
conscience, and nothing else.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Clinton and Gore together again
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton were to appear
together at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills, Calif., late Saturday _
the first time the two have been seen in public together since last
year. The Democratic National Committee event was expected to bring
$2.5 million and attract a variety of Hollywood actors, directors
and producers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the duo appeared together in public was Dec. 9 for
a firefighters' memorial in Massachusetts and a DNC fund-raiser in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore headlined a DNC fundraiser near San Jose,
Calif., that raised $2.6 million _ shattering the DNC's previous
Silicon Valley record of $1.5 million. At the same event, Gore
renewed his call for a ban on unlimited ``soft money'' _ the very
kind of money he was raising Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH WAR CHEST TOPS $80 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has broken the $80 million mark in his Republican
presidential campaign, adding to his own fund-raising record while
replenishing his war chest after an expensive primary effort. The
campaign raised about $7 million between March 1 and April 6,
spokesman Scott McClellan said Friday. That is three-quarters of
the $10 million goal Bush is trying to raise by the end of this
month. The campaign expects to raise an additional $550,000 next
week with events in North Carolina and Michigan. Bush's camp also
is increasing its push for online contributors, and has raised $1.6
million via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to rebuild his war chest after spending a record
$63.3 million earlier in the year in his bid to defeat former
Republican presidential opponent Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AND TIPPER DONATED $15,000
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential contender Al Gore and his wife Tipper
contributed about $15,000 to charities in 1999 _ the same as in the
previous year _ two years after Gore earned the sobriquet of ``Vice
President Scrooge'' for his meager giving of $353.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gores declined to disclose the charities publicly,
the White House said in releasing their 1999 tax returns that the
contributions went to religious organizations, educational
institutions, public service entities and groups set up to combat
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The returns showed that the Gores had an adjustable gross income
of $240,930 in 1999, including $175,400 from his salary as vice
president, and paid $62,051, or almost 26 percent, in federal
income taxes. By comparison, they earned $504,109 in 1998 and paid
$89,951 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who aides say will seek an extension
for filing his income tax return, on Monday is expected to make a
payment to cover any money he might owe the government. He also
said that on Monday he will release how much money he gave to
charities in 1999, Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. He said he
needs the extension because he still has not received information
from a blind trust that manages his assets.
</P>
<P>
   TIT FOR TAT BETWEEN GORE AND BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore presidential campaigns are crunching some
serious numbers as each scolds the other for ducking separate
issues: Democrat Al Gore, the media, and George W. Bush, a debate
with his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore today cancelled a scheduled news conference, which
would have been the first in 54 days,'' the Bush camp said Thursday
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Gore aides released their own statement
showing off some math as well: ``George W. Bush has managed to bob
and weave away from debating Gore for 30 days in a row,'' the
release said, referring to an e-mail challenge sent last month to
the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns failed to mention the most important number: 205.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many days until Nov. 7 _ Election Day.

THE TRUE HEROES OF NBA SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Our regularly scheduled, season-ending Valentine
of NBA achievement will not be seen in order to save the Shaquille
O'Neal-related MVP metaphor and simile for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you will receive (at no extra charge) a list of
citizens who ``done good'' in categories the league has refused to
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   -- The first award is presented to one of the few players who
could stare down an allowance-packin' third-grader at a candy
store. For remaining loyal to his plan of losing games rather than
weight, Cleveland's Shawn Kemp is the recipient of our first M&AMP;MVP
Award.
</P>
<P>
   -- While Elton Brand and Steve Francis stimulate debate over
first-year superiority, publicists for Minnesota's Wally Szczerbiak
have deployed his merciless mug shot just frequently enough to
secure the Rookie of the Yearbook Award.
</P>
<P>
   -- For disguising himself as a victim, our award for Best
Costume Design goes to Boston Celtic emperor Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   -- Atlanta hired him as its go-to guy, but our next honoree
parlayed that presumption into the role of go-to-hell guy. For such
versatility, J.R. Rider receives the league's Citizenshipwreck
Award.
</P>
<P>
   -- To secure our Sixth Man-iac Award, Seattle super-sub Vernon
Maxwell tossed a 10-pound weight at Gary Payton's head. He is
alleged to have missed.
</P>
<P>
   -- For hiring more assistant coaches than Jerry Jones,
dispatching limos to drive players to games when the streets of
Dallas are icy and not being run out of the country by Janet Reno,
our Best New Rich Rascal Award will be e-mailed to Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   -- For having the chutzpah to think he can balance a budget in
Washington, our Michael Jordan Award will be given to ... Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   -- The award for Best Sound Effects goes to Tyrone Nesby, who
was rescued from the CBA by the Clippers but now whines about how
they ruined his career by matching San Antonio's three-year
contract offer sheet.
</P>
<P>
   -- He isn't employed by the Magic, but does get paid for
disappearing, and that makes Sherman Douglas of the Nets (we think)
the first winner of the Ike Austin Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Steve Javie was a unanimous choice for our Most Defensive
Referee Award after assessing technical fouls for the crime of
exhaling.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another landslide was tallied by Dennis Rodman, who
campaigned hard for his Comeback (To Earth) Player of the Year
Award.
</P>
<P>
   -- Our Lifetime Achievement Award goes to the late Wilt
Chamberlain, who according to rumor just finger-rolled over Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Minor adjustment
</P>
<P>
   The recent NBA Board of Governors meeting supplied league owners
with the semi-official and expected news of Commish David Stern's
proposed minor league.
</P>
<P>
   An age limit for players was proposed to eliminate participation
by high school refugees and create public perception that the NBA
respects the sovereign turf of college basketball. And, ahem,
higher education. But several league sources believe that without
providing sanctuary and a controlled environment for players who
insist upon bypassing college, the ``NBA-minus'' has little merit.
</P>
<P>
   Many personnel bosses would prefer Stern in partnership with CBA
owner Isiah Thomas, whose growing stable of game-ready franchises
eventually could provide a farm team for each NBA club.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ego would have to be reeled in - from both sides -
for that to happen,'' one source said, ``but I still don't think
you should shut the door on Isiah. And without a legit farm system
or a place for players who truly aren't ready, they might as well
keep the CBA system the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   According to a witness at Staples Center, the recovery time for
injured University of Cincinnati star and No. 1 draft-pick threat
Kenyon Martin may have been cut in half. Martin, who broke his leg
in the Conference USA tournament opener last month, reportedly ran
screaming from the arena Tuesday night after watching the Clippers
lose to Phoenix. ... A source close to the LSU coaching staff
reports that reality may be biting Stromile Swift. After learning
he could be a top three NBA pick this June, the Tigers' remarkably
springy sophomore forward is having second thoughts about his
commitment to stay in school. ... Iowa State junior Marcus Fizer,
who's not expected to last beyond the first two picks, said he
would keep open his option of returning to school, but reportedly
has hired agent Henry Thomas. ... The early star of this weekend's
pre-draft camp at Phoenix is Oklahoma State's Desmond ``40-Inch
Vertical'' Mason. The 6-foot-6 Mason's potential - known in
roundball's patois as ``up side'' is vast enough to have attracted
a representation approach from the mighty David Falk. ... Reviews
of last week's pre-draft festival at Portsmouth, Va. have been
mixed, ranging from ``weak'' to ``pretty terrible.'' The official
MVP was 6-8 stringbean Mike Smith of Louisiana-Monroe, who provided
frequent glimpses of keen 3-point marksmanship (65 percent) and the
bottoms of his sneakers. Other prospects who demonstrated signs of
becoming live second-round bait were Samford small forward Reed
Rawlings and Colorado point guard Jaquay Walls. ... Don't panic,
Grizzlies fans. The Dickie V and B. Knight from Indiana reportedly
heading your way are coach Dick Versace and Pacers vice president
Billy Knight. ... Clippers center Michael Olowokandi recently
purchased a computer company in England. When the Clips visit
Dallas next season, the Kandi Man probably will know how to get
re-booted.

GERALD GARVEY, 64, EXPERT ON POLITICAL SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gerald Garvey, who wrote extensively on the inner
workings of government as a professor of politics at Princeton
University, died on April 9 at Princeton Medical Center. He was 64
and lived in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey focused on American politics, public policy, public
administration and political theory, writing about these subjects
in 11 books and numerous articles.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago, he graduated from the United States Air Force
Academy in 1959. While in service as an officer, he studied Russian
at Columbia University and earned a doctorate from Princeton in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   He taught political science at the Air Force Academy before
joining the Princeton faculty in 1968 as an associate professor; he
rose to full professor in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent book titles, as author or co-author, include
``Public Administration: The Profession and the Practice'' (St.
Martin's, 1996), ``Facing the Bureaucracy'' (Jossey-Bass, 1993),
and ``Improving Government Performance: An Owner's Manual''
(Brookings Institution Press, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Garvey is survived by his wife of 34 years, Lou Ann Benshoof
Garvey; three sons, Edward, of St. Paul, Minn., Gregory, of
Rochester, N.Y., and Scott, of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Sarah
Garvey, of San Francisco; two brothers, David, of Rhinelander,
Wis., and George, of Silver Spring, Md.; three sisters, Noni Thomas
and Judy Alexander of Chicago, and Margaret Cox of North Canton,
Ohio; and two granddaughters.

AROUND LEXINGTON, BATTLE CALL SOUNDED YET AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROLINE LOUISE COLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Just as they did 225 years ago, British
Regulars, 200 strong, marched into Lexington at dawn Saturday on a
``secret'' mission to find hidden munitions. Instead, they
encountered a rag-tag band of 77 musket-toting Colonials ready to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   And just as they did 225 years ago, the British ordered their
fellow countrymen to lay down their arms as the sun rose over
Lexington Green. But instead, a single shot rang out, that
mysterious shot heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   The British, imposing in their red coats and tight lines of
battle, charged the poorly clad and poorly organized Patriots, some
of whom returned fire before they fled into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared, eight civilians lay dead and nine were
wounded. But on this day, the casualties rose to their feet again
at the end of the event. And the crowd of about 10,000 on-lookers,
many them also wearing Colonial costumes, made it clear that
Saturday's battle was not a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a celebration of liberty. This year's
anniversary of the opening clashes of the Revolutionary War on
April 19, 1775, is a four-day affair, which began Friday and runs
through Monday. It's expected to draw up to 100,000 spectators and
several thousand reenactors, including 600 from England and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, this was awesome,'' said Jeffrey Kiggins, 10, as he
watched the recreation of the Battle of Lexington get under way on
a crisp spring morning. Kiggins, a fourth-grader from South
Hampton, N.H., had dragged his mother out of bed at 2:30 a.m. to
ensure their front-row seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until I can join up, even if it means I have to
start out as a fife or drummer,'' Kiggins said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Colonials would later claim the day and
eventually wrest independence from Britain, but not until these
British Regulars regrouped and pushed onto Concord and then
retreated back to Boston. History records the day's casualties as
73 dead and 174 wounded for the British, 49 dead and 40 wounded for
the Colonials.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Robert Allegretto of Woburn drew sneers in the
garb of His Majesty's 23d Royal Welsh Fusiliers when he heckled the
Colonial militia making fun of their dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won here but we do encourage you to fight back,'' he told
the crowd following the 15-minute reenactment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to watching the replays of several key battles along
the 2.5 mile stretch of highway now known as Battle Road,
spectators could tour a Colonial encampment and visit with
interpreters displaying Colonial crafts and gear.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early morning crowd in Lexington were Dorothy
McCormack and Janet Rigazio and their class of fifth-graders from
Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to learn history than to see it in action
right in our own backyard?'' McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   Also there was Jim Brown, a retired federal worker, who drove up
from Jacksonville, Fla., for the reenactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this year was going to be special and I haven't been
disappointed,'' he said as he straightened his tricorn hat,
purchased for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Battle Green show, he and his son Nick hoped to
catch the action at Merriam's Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Bursting with satisfaction was Bob Marrigan of Bedford, who
hatched the idea of celebrating American liberty with live players
back in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see this kind of interest because when I first
suggested replaying the Lexington battle 30 years ago, it was a
pretty unpopular idea, Vietman being on everyone's minds,'' said
Marrigan, dressed in a blue wool coat and linen breeches for his
adopted role of Colonial Lieutenant William Tidd.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Lexington Minute Men, sponsors of the event,
beefed up the initial engagement in Lexington by staging the
capture of messenger Paul Revere at midnight. And, to Kiggins's
delight, Revere showed up in Lexington, after escaping from the
Regulars, just in time to save John Hancock's precious trunk of
papers before the British arrived.

EDMUND ENGELMAN, 92, DIES; TOOK FREUD PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edmund Engelman, the clandestine photographer who let
the world glimpse the famous couch of Dr. Sigmund Freud (without a
consultation fee), died on April 11 at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 92 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Engelman, a native of Vienna and an engineer by training, was
asked by a friend of Freud's to make a pictorial record of the
birthplace of psychoanalysis. He succeeded in doing so in 1938,
days before the Freud family left Vienna for London after the Nazi
takeover of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Freud had lived in a nondescript four-story apartment house at
Berggasse 19 since 1891. Engelman surreptitiously took a series of
about 150 pictures of his offices and living quarters, using only
natural light for fear of alerting the Gestapo, which kept Freud
under constant watch.
</P>
<P>
   Engelman himself escaped Vienna months later. He reached the
United States in 1939 by a circuitous route but without the
negatives, which he retrieved from Freud's daughter Anna in London
after World War II. They became the material for a book,
``Berggasse 19'' (Basic Books, 1976).
</P>
<P>
   The historian Peter Gay, who wrote an introduction, said the
pictures ``let us walk through Freud's rooms, sit at his desk, and
contemplate, almost through his eyes, the objects he collected and
cherished.'' Engelman also took portraits of Freud, his wife,
Martha, and his daughter. The pictures are on view at the Freud
museums in Vienna and London. The Austrian government awarded
Engelman its Cross of Honor for Science and Art, first-class, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Engelman received his engineering degree at the Technical
University in Vienna in 1932 and founded a center for
experimentation in photography and cinematography. He was a
consultant to the Anatomical Institute at the University of Vienna
on the use of film in medical education.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States he worked during the war as an engineer for
International Telephone and Telegraph, helping to develop
electronic gear for combat aircraft. He owned a camera center in
New York from 1946 to 1958, after which he became a consulting
engineer for photographic technology.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Irene Lipnofska Engelman; two sons,
Ralph, of Brooklyn, and Thomas, of Newton, Mass.; and three
grandchildren.

IN THE STOCK MARKET, A SENSE THAT THE GAME HAS CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 11th and 12th grafs about Joseph Chung in 2nd
take.)  
 By ALEX BERENSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sweltering second-floor office of a midtown
Manhattan branch of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a discount brokerage, Sean M.
Mullin, a 23-year-old broker, tugged at his tie as he explained how
he had spent much of Friday afternoon. As the market plummeted,
Mullin was making ``margin calls'' on investors who had bought
losing stocks with borrowed money. Those investors now had to put
up more cash as collateral or sell their shares to pay off their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said he disliked making margin calls, although he had no
choice. ``You get people on the phone, and they're just upset,'' he
said. ``They'll call you and say, `How much do I owe?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own portfolio, ``I'm holding tough,'' Mullin said.
``It's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain was everywhere Friday as the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell almost 10 percent, capping its worst week
ever, and the Dow Jones industrial average was off more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other market declines over the past decade, investors have
been quick to follow experts' exhortations to buy on dips. That
buying has driven U.S. stocks, especially technology stocks, to
unprecedented levels.
</P>
<P>
   It may happen again when the market opens on Monday. But as
investors reviewed the damage wrought last week, their uncertainty
about the market's near-term prospects was palpable. And few of
them sounded eager to step up and buy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of shock among many investors on Friday, a
suggestion that the game had run its course, at least for a little
while.
</P>
<P>
   The selling, the crescendo of a week when the Nasdaq fell 25
percent and U.S. stocks lost $2 trillion in value, did not reflect
panic. It was worse, a steady and relentless decline that showed
few signs of letting up as the 4:00 p.m. bell finally rang to end
the action, closing a one-sided bout that finished several rounds
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual investors, panicked sellers were hard to find,
except for people who had to pay taxes or who faced margin calls.
Figures from Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in
Connecticut, confirmed the anecdotal evidence, showing that big
institutions, not individuals, accounted for most of Friday's
selling.
</P>
<P>
   But no one seemed to be bargain hunting either. The aggressive
buyers who drove technology stocks up to all-time highs last month
seem to be out of fresh cash, and more conservative investors still
think the highfliers are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic was clear Friday afternoon at Quick &AMP; Reilly. There,
clusters of investors were talking to brokers, making trades and
checking the stock prices displayed on computer monitors. Above
them, a muted television played CNBC, the business news cable
channel, as a series of pundits talked and the Dow skidded south.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a desk at the front of the branch, Dmitri Jones, a
Quick &AMP; Reilly consultant, said he did not expect the sell-off to
end soon. Despite sharp declines, technology stocks are still
overvalued, and many conservative investors will not be interested
in buying them until they fall much lower, he said. ``A lot of
people are waiting on the sidelines,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are too badly bruised to step up right now, he said.
``You look at people's accounts,'' he said. ``It's straight
carnage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he had bought 200 shares of Microsoft on Tuesday. ``I
thought I was getting a bargain,'' he said ruefully. Since then,
shares in the software company have plunged, costing Jones more
than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than I make,'' he said. ``I'm just looking at my
future getting smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinod Malhotra, another investor, said, ``It's very bad,'' as he
worriedly checked the ever-changing prices displayed on the
computer screens near the branch's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra said he owned shares in several of the Internet and
technology highfliers that have been hardest hit in the last month,
including Internet Capital Group, down from $147 on March 6 to
$52.0625 at Friday's close, and Exodus Communications, which has
fallen from $179.625 on March 23 to $85.5625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it has been a very expensive couple of weeks,
Malhotra said. He has accounts at several brokerage firms, and he
said his largest portfolio, at Prudential, had fallen from $1.8
million to under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malhotra has no plans to sell. ``I have no choice,'' he
said. ``I have to hold on until they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A few investors started unloading stocks before last week.
Norman Nouskajian, a San Diego lawyer, said the irrational behavior
of other investors drove him to sell most of his stocks six weeks
ago. ``When I saw some of my clients who were in businesses having
nothing to do with finance divert their time and money into the
market, to me that pointed to a type of excess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of keeping half of his assets in the stock market, as he
usually does, Nouskajian said he cut back to 20 percent. His
remaining stocks have lost half their value, erasing about 10
percent of his net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in no particular hurry to get back into the market.
``Next week, I might nibble a little,'' he said. ``I feel sorry for
people who have taken a lot of money and thrown it at the
overpriced tech stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald F. Zele, a retired auditor who lives in Farmington,
Conn., told a similar story. Zele said he had called his
stepdaughter on Tuesday and told her to sell her mutual funds, and
had then sold all of his own stocks and funds. ``Today's debacle
proved me right,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zele wants to get back in. But not yet. ``People are
panicking and getting out at all costs,'' he said. ``This thing
could get a lot uglier. I can't wait to get back in, but right now
I am not going to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The nervousness is hardly confined to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kim S. Fennebresque, president and chief executive officer of SG
Cowen, an investment bank that specializes in underwriting stock
issues for the health care and technology companies that have been
hardest hit over the last month, held a conference call Friday to
reassure his employees that Cowen's future remained bright. But
afterward, Fennebresque confessed that he was less sanguine about
the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who buy too soon may ``catch a falling knife,''
Fennebresque said. ``One cannot help but be a little sober about
the playing field in which we find ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fennebresque said he worried about a ``poverty effect'' as
investors who have lost money cut back on purchases. It is probably
too early for that, especially since both the Dow and Nasdaq are
still higher than they were even six months ago. Several real
estate brokers and travel agents who cater to wealthy clients said
that as of Friday, they had not lost any business.
</P>
<P>
   But the plunge seems to have hurt sales of at least one luxury
item. At the Wall Street Humidor, a cigar shop in lower Manhattan
that caters to wealthy traders and investment bankers, the owner,
Richard Hu, said business had been terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an absolute disaster,'' Hu said. ``The last thing they
want is a cigar. A cigar will kill them too slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, longtime bears like Seymour Rosen, 65, a cabinetmaker
from Monroe Township, N.J., remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said he had been warning for more than a year that the
runup in technology stocks was ``smoke and mirrors.'' He got really
worried when a waitress at the Prestige Diner in East Windsor,
N.J., boasted about her purchase of shares in ViroPharma, a
drugmaker that has lost more than 85 percent of its value in the
last month. ``I said you haven't made a nickel until you sell it,''
he recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to jump in and make a million dollars,'' Rosen
said. Now all he wants to do is jump out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does bounce back, I want to get out,'' he said, adding
that he would settle now for bonds that guarantee him a return of 6
percent a year. If the market continues to decline, he said, he
might sell anyway. ``It's better to lose some than to lose it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was displeased with Friday's action. Even some
investors with big losses expressed a certain relief. ``We've
certainly seen a lot of paper wealth disappear,'' said Joseph
Chung, chairman of the Art Technology Group, an Internet software
company that went public in July. Art Technology shares fell 46
percent last week, and Chung's net worth fell by more than $200
million. ``But I think it's healthy,'' he said from his San
Francisco office. ``I honestly do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung had been worried that investors and entrepreneurs had
become more focused on quick financial returns than on actual
business development. Now that the tar's been knocked out of the
market a bit, people may get back to some of the reasons why we're
actually here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Short-sellers, who make money when stocks decline, said the
sell-off confirmed their warnings that many technology companies
were badly overvalued.
</P>

   Indeed, by most measures, technology stocks have been in a
bubble for years, with many priced at 100, 200 or even 300 times
their annual earnings. In less heady times, most stocks sport
price-earnings ratios of 30 or less, although technology bulls note
that many technology companies are growing at very fast rates.

   Friday's plunge was needed to wring excesses out of stock
prices, said Marc Cohodes, general partner of Rocker Partners,
which manages $600 million. Cohodes is a short-seller, a bearish
investor who borrows what he believes are overpriced shares and
then sells them, betting that their prices will decline and he will
be able to buy them back later for a lower price. ``Today was a day
I would like to see repeated a few more times,'' Cohodes said. ``I
think what this is, it's the start of a change that's going to
happen in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohodes said that change would be healthy for both Wall Street
and the economy as a whole, by keeping capital out of the hands of
money-losing dot-com businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who burn cash and have no business model _ that game is
over,'' he said.

JOHN ALSOP, 84, GOP FIGURE IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John deKoven Alsop, a veteran of Connecticut
Republican politics, a gubernatorial candidate and a retired
insurance company president, died on April 6 at a health care
center in Old Saybrook, Conn. He was 84 and lived in Old Lyme,
where he had moved from Avon, his birthplace, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Alsop, who served two terms in the state legislature in the late
1940s, was allied with the liberal wing of his party. He came to
wider attention as an early backer of Dwight D. Eisenhower for
president, and was a state vice chairman for Eisenhower's campaign
in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He first sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1958,
but lost in a primary. He won the nomination in 1962 in a bruising
contest and lost the November election to the incumbent, Gov. John
Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   Alsop, a colorful figure, remained influential in party circles
for years. He represented Connecticut on the Republican National
Committee and held leading positions in various councils on the
state level.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1980 as president of the Covenant Group of
insurance companies in Hartford. The business was originally formed
by his father in the 1920s, and he had led it as chief executive
for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   John Alsop was born into a well-connected family. He was a
descendant of President James Monroe and was related to the Oyster
Bay, N.Y., branch of the Roosevelt family as a grandnephew of
President Theodore Roosevelt. His parents, Joseph W. and Corinne
Alsop, were both elected to the General Assembly, and his
grandfather, a Democrat, was lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   He was the younger brother of the Washington political
columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop. Joseph died in 1989 and
Stewart in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   John Alsop graduated from the Groton School in 1933 and from
Yale University in 1937, when he went to work at Smith, Barney &AMP;
Co. in New York. He enlisted in the Army in 1942 and served with
the Office of Strategic Services in Britain, France and China,
receiving a Bronze Star with cluster and rising to captain.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Augusta Robinson Alsop;
a son, John deK., of Cornville, Maine; two daughters, Mary Culver
of Guilford, Conn., and Augusta Alsop of Solon, Maine; and nine
grandchildren.

BOTTENFIELD LEADS ANGELS PAST WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Coming to a new team, Kent Bottenfield's goal was to
gain the respect of his Angels teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash, Mo Vaughn said. Bottenfield doesn't have to prove
anything. He had that respect, even before throwing seven shutout
innings in the Angels' 3-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox
Saturday afternoon before 14,135 at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox entered the game with the best team batting
average (.328) in the majors, but Bottenfield, acquired from the
Cardinals in the March 23 trade for Jim Edmonds, kept them off
balance all day with his array of off-speed pitches and pinpoint
control.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got five hits off him, but never more than one in
any inning and only one White Sox baserunner reached third while he
was in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to gain our respect,'' Vaughn said. ``He's a
professional. The way he goes about his business every day. We love
him over here. He's always had the respect, there's nothing he has
to show us. Just being out here with us and putting on the uniform
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored three runs off White Sox starter Kip Wells
(0-2) in the first inning on an RBI single by Garret Anderson and a
two-run double by Troy Glaus. But they didn't score again, getting
only one hit after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, they had Bottenfield (1-1) on the mound.
After 121 pitches, Bottenfield was replaced by Shigetoshi Hasegawa
to start the eighth. Hasegawa gave up a solo homer to Greg Norton
to lead off the inning, but got a big out when he struck out Frank
Thomas and handed the ball over to Troy Percival to start the ninth
with the 3-1 lead intact.
</P>
<P>
   Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about the hottest hitting club in all of
baseball right now,'' Scioscia said of the White Sox, who were
averaging 7.3 runs per game before Saturday. ``To do a job like
that for seven innings was tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield doesn't throw harder than 85-86 mph, but his pregame
preparation is intense. He studies 8-10 hours of videotape between
starts to learn hitters' tendencies. Combine that with the ability
to hit his spots, and it explains why Bottenfield won 18 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has talents, but most guys in the league don't have
his command,'' Scioscia said. ``Kent knows what his strengths are
and what his best chances are of getting hitters out. He has the
ability to create a gameplan that is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield faced trouble only once Saturday. It came in the
fifth inning after an error by Glaus at third base and a single by
Maglio Ordonez gave the White Sox runners at first and third with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko lined out to third for the second out, but
Bottenfield issued one of his two walks to Chris Singleton to load
the bases for Carlos Lee. Lee flied out to right to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't base my pitch-selection on counts all the time,''
Bottenfield said of keeping hitters off balance. ``I base it on
what a hitter might be looking for, and what I can be more
effective with, even if it's a 3-0 changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Bottenfield's first with the Angels as he lowered
his ERA to 2.41, best among the club's starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get that first one out of the way,'' he said.
``You don't want to wait until May to get the first one with a new
team. Building respect from my new teammates is very important to
me.''

 &HT;    POLICE ARREST HUNDREDS AS CAPITAL BRACES FOR MASS DEMONSTRATIONS
 &HT;    EDS: New top, with minor revisions throughout.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and ALEC SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After closing a training center for protestors
earlier in the day, police in riot gear arrested hundreds of
peaceful demonstrators late Saturday as the nation's capital braced
for mass rallies against the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were handcuffed and loaded onto yellow school
buses after a tense standoff with police near the World Bank and
IMF headquarters buildings, located just blocks from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we're finished I expect to have 500 arrests,''
said Police Chief Charles Ramsey. He said they would be charged
with ``parading without a permit and refusal to disperse, among
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came on the eve of planned mass demonstrations aimed
at shutting down the meetings of the world trade organizations on
Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's downtown area was quiet after the arrests, but a
heavy police presence remained. All told, nearly 50 blocks around
the World Bank and IMF buildings were off limits to demonstrators.
The area was cordoned off by metal crowd-control barriers that
prevented all but authorized people from passing.
</P>
<P>
   As those arrested were led away, others shouted to police to let
them go.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier raid on the training center, police seized
materials that they said could be used to make firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of activists, bearing backpacks and bravado,
gathered in the rain and vowed throughout the day to press ahead
with their planned Sunday and Monday protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, they've made us more passionate,'' said Katie, a
friendly Wittenberg University student from Springfield, Ohio, who
had a phone number written prominently on her arm in indelible ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the legal team _ in case I get thrown in jail,'' she
explained, adding she didn't want to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   The drizzly day began with police and fire officials entering
the protesters' ``convergence center'' _ a brick warehouse across
town from the World Bank and IMF buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The fire department had been warned of possible code violations
in the building, said Capt. Brian Lee. They closed the warehouse as
being ``immediately dangerous to life and health'' after finding
propane stoves and other hazards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant chief Terry Gainer said police also found rags,
bottles and jars and flammable liquids that he said could be used
in making ``Molotov cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters scoffed at the notion that they were making bombs.
What the police seized was paint remover and other materials to
make banners and placards, said Patrick Reinsborough, a spokesman
for the Mobilization for Global Justice, the umbrella organization
for scores of groups including, labor unions to environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even took our puppets,'' he said. ``It was clearly an
effort to silence us.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters promptly moved their ``action prep'' and other
activities to a community center and sidewalks several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a decentralized movement without leaders. This was just
one physical space, so closing it isn't going to change what is
happening,'' said Reinsborough. ``It just makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before last night's mass arrests, police had made at
least 20 arrests _ several for allegedly possessing ammunition and
plastic pipes and chains used to link protesters together into
human barricades. Chief Ramsey said he expected 10,000 or more
protesters to be here for the annual meeting of financial ministers
and world bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of protesters are united in their accusations
that international financiers are destroying the environment
through improper development in Third World countries and imposing
monetary policies that hurt poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor in
the world,'' said Art Gish, who has been a social activist for 40
years. ``World trade organizations help cause it. I'm part of a
global movement that is determined to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gish is an organic farmer who looked the part with his white
beard and broad-brimmed straw hat. He grows vegetables near Athens,
Ohio, and came to the protest with a group of students from Ohio
University.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters came in all ages and attire. Some had florescent
hair and pierced nostrils, lips and tongues. Others appeared to be
outfitted by L.L. Bean. They sipped bottled water and ate bread and
bean sprouts and dispersed for activities ranging from a ``Cinema
of Resistance Filmfest'' to a ``Save the Redwoods'' teach-in to a
protest outside a Gap store.
</P>
<P>
   Starlene Rankin, a gray-haired Green Party activist from Ames,
Iowa, talked earnestly with the row of stern men and women wearing
bright orange raincoats and white helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling those officers that they don't have to do
this. They can take off those uniforms and not be robots for the
police state,'' she explained. ``I'm trying to appeal to their
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   She was undeterred by her failure to find converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be in the streets tomorrow with or without
puppets,'' she vowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a loser high school dropout who doesn't like the way
this country is going and wants to change it,'' said Chris, 21, who
came with a New Jersey group called ``Food Not Bombs'' and didn't
want to give his last name. ``The more people who protest to show
that we're unhappy with the way the system is, the harder it is to
ignore us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were still stirred by the spirit of Seattle, where
sometimes violent protests disrupted world trade talks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct action is the tactic that we have to use,'' said David
Hill, a labor organizer who graduated last spring from the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason we're getting so much attention here _ the
only reason that you're talking to me now _ is because of what
happened in Seattle,'' said Hill, who works for a union in New
York. ``Labor is a big part of the movement, but the union didn't
order me to come here. I'm doing this on my own. We're going to try
to shut down the city.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the protesters have promised non-violent
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been saying all the time that it will be peaceful, I
just hope they honor that. We don't want trouble here. We hope the
demonstrators don't resort to that type of activity,'' Chief Ramsey
told reporters. He said police had confiscated large plastic pipe
sections used to connect ``sleeping dragons'' _ human chains _ as
well as gas masks, chains, chicken wire, duct tape and rope.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, police raided a house and found small-caliber
ammunition and firebomb instructions, Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said two people were arrested on Saturday morning for
refusing to obey police orders to leave the ``convergence center.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, about 20 protesters staged a dawn protest outside the
home of World Bank President James Wolfensohn. On his way to work,
Wolfensohn listened to the reading of a protest letter and saw
signs saying ``Wake Up World Bank'' before leaving.

RUSCH'S FIRST START IS A LOSS: PIRATES BEAT METS, 2-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Mets played a very quiet game Saturday, losing
to the Pirates, 2-0, in 1 hour 57 minutes. Glendon Rusch pitched a
complete game in his first start as a Met, but when he made a
mistake _ a changeup to Kevin Young that caught too much of the
plate and turned into a two-run homer _ he paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine was quiet as well, saying he has decided to stop
talking about the speech he gave this past week at the Wharton
School of Business in Philadelphia that ended with Valentine's
criticizing several players and front-office decisions to students.
Unlike Rusch, the Mets' manager will not be paying for his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips and the co-owner Fred Wilpon said
Saturday that ``the Wharton situation,'' as Valentine called it, is
a closed issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything's been addressed satisfactorily and we will
move forward today with putting this whole mess behind us,'' said
Phillips, who met with Valentine for an hour after Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's version is the version that I will take at face value.
I don't know what sort of credence to lend to some sort of posting
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips lent significance to the issue when he flew here
Friday, unscheduled, to meet with Valentine. Valentine said he
never believed his job was in serious jeopardy because of his
comments at Wharton, but according to a person familiar with the
club's operations, the idea of firing Valentine was discussed among
Mets executives. But without knowing what effect the controversy
might have on the players, it was decided that firing Valentine
would be rash.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's contract expires at the end of this year. If he were
to be fired, that decision would be made by Phillips, Wilpon said,
though Wilpon would expect to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is someone in the organization that wanted him fired,
that's someone I didn't talk to,'' said Wilpon, who added that he
has spoken only to Phillips about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the topic of firing Valentine arose in his
conversations with Phillips, Wilpon said: ``That was not the thrust
of the conversation that we had. The thrust of the conversation was
how do we go forward, how do you get the facts so that we know from
Bobby, and not from some anonymous person.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wilpon nor Phillips said they wanted to investigate the
issue further, despite the possible existence of a videotape of
Valentine's speech. Phillips said he hoped that if there is a tape,
it has been destroyed, and added that he would not watch it if it
existed; to do so, he said, would imply that he did not trust
Valentine's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine would not comment Saturday on a published report that
suggested he may have asked that a tape of his talk be destroyed.
Wilpon said neither he nor Phillips had first-hand knowledge of
that, though Phillips said it was his understanding that it may, in
fact, have happened.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it seems, Valentine's only crime is telling the 100 or
so students at the speech to keep his comments confidential. One
student posted the comments on the Mets' official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be naive to think that the words can be private,''
Wilpon said. ``We have to be realistic to know that whatever we
say, we're in the public arena and a public sport and people want
to know. It can't be private.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon reiterated that he has told Valentine _ just as he tells
everyone he works with, he said _ that a person must be responsible
for his or her actions and statements. Wilpon said he would talk
with Valentine the next time he sees him, but for now, he is going
through Phillips, leaving two very different people to sort through
an uneasy relationship.
</P>
<P>
   If Valentine remains as manager, controversies over comments he
makes will probably be recurring issues. Phillips said the core
group of Mets learned last year to deal with such distractions.
Valentine said he pulled aside each of the Mets individually _
except for Rusch, because he was Saturday's starting pitcher _ to
talk with them about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he wanted ``to alleviate confusion and to let
them know that if there ever is confusion, that I am here to
alleviate it, not to create it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were held to five hits by Pirates left-hander Jimmy
Anderson, who had pitched only a third of an inning against them in
his career. Several Mets sounded satisfied that Anderson would not
repeat such success the next time he faces them. ``Sometimes you
can deal with it,'' said second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo of his
0-for-3 day at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Todd Pratt called Rusch's performance
``Glavine-esque,'' referring to two-time Cy Young winner Tom
Glavine of the Atlanta Braves. Rusch said he has always admired
Glavine and tries to emulate the way he works the outside part of
the plate and uses his change-up so effectively. ``I'm ecstatic,''
Bobby Valentine said of Rusch's outing, in which he allowed four
hits and one walk. Rusch, the Mets' fifth starter, was pitching for
the first time in 11 days, since he worked in an exhibition game at
Class AAA Norfolk on April 4.

KINGS GO DOWN SWINGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT -- The Kings crashed the net and nearly crashed the
party.
</P>
<P>
   They came at the Detroit Red Wings with goals and fists and a
high octane passion that might one day make them the hunted ones.
But not Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings are still the Red Wings, and always stayed on top
no matter how hard the Kings tried to pierce the frenzy of a sold
out Joe Louis Arena during an 8-5 loss in Game 2 of this
best-of-seven series .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to be down two games, but there is no time for
frustration,'' said Ziggy Palffy, who scored twice. ``That was a
great game out there tonight. We took it to them. Now we go back to
L.A and we'll get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the button down 2-0 opener Thursday, this one was wide
open from the opening whistle.When they weren't scoring, both teams
were ringing shots off the cross bar. And unlike Game 1 when they
were the stars of the night, goaltenders Chris Osgood and Stephane
Fiset were punished for standing in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are showing them that we are not going to just fade
away,'' said a stern Kings coach Andy Murray, who pulled Fiset
after the Wings' fifth goal. ``Most people don't even know what we
are doing here, but we do. We are down 2-0, but we are not going to
slide away. Not with the energy we showed tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings and Red Wings, who continue the series Monday night at
Staples Center, combined for the fastest six goals (6:56) to open a
game since the NHL started keeping records during the 1943-44
season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Palffy, Luc Robitaille, Craig Johnson and Sean
O'Donnell had goals for the Kings, who outshot Detroit 44-43.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't a perfect game, not when turnovers by
defenseman Garry Galley and Jere Karalahti led to two Red Wings
goals in the first 93 seconds of the game. And the Kings were
annoyed with the ruthless play of Detroit strongman Darren McCarty,
who helped bottle them up after Palffy cut the lead to 6-5 with
1:11 gone in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But they also never had an answer for Martin Lapointe, who
scored three times, including the eventual game winner midway
through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Detroit's top guns Steve Yzerman and Sergei
Fedorov never joined the fun. Yzerman, back after missing the
opener with the flu and a tender knee, had two assists. Fedorov,
who played harassing defense and scored an empty netter in Game 1,
assisted on Lapointe's second goal. It came at the 6:56 mark of the
second period and gave Detroit a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Draper scored twice and Niklas Lidstrom added two goals in
the final 11 minutes of the third period, including an empty netter
after Jamie Storr was pulled for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   It was Draper's first goal, after a sprint up the right boards
and a blast near the Kings blue line, that got Fiset pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't mad at him,'' Murray said. ``His teammates let
him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset certainly wasn't to blame for the first two. On the first,
Galley fumbled with the puck behind the Kings net. Slava Kozlov,
who scored the Wings first goal Thursday, took control and took a
shot. Brendan Shanahan got the rebound and scored on the second try
55 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just 38 seconds later, Karalahti, who has been consistent since
joining the team in December, tried to send the puck off the
boards, but missed. Kirk Maltby picked it up and passed cross ice
to the slot where Lapointe was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a lot of television probably blinked off. ABC's
national telecast was 1:33 old and the tattered Kings trailed 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Murray called time out.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the game was looser than Thursday and he urged his
forwards to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty one seconds later, Robitaille scored the 46th playoff
goal of his career, on a rebound in front of Osgood. Robitaille did
not have a shot in the first two periods Thursday and just one
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timeout helped us regain our composure,'' Galley
said. ``We knew we could play with these guys, but the game was
quickly getting out of hand. After that it was pretty even. We just
came up a little short.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Cleveland Browns have spent weeks scrutinizing,
analyzing and agonizing over two players from Penn State,
linebacker LaVar Arrington and defensive lineman Courtney Brown.
Back and forth the Browns went, sometimes in heated discussions.
Arrington possesses explosive athletic ability, but Brown is the
kind of player who can dominate a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns ended up actually rating Arrington a small percentage
higher than Brown on their draft board, but then visions of last
season danced in the heads of the Cleveland brass. They remembered
opposing quarterbacks sitting comfortably in the pocket and picking
apart their defense, which had a league-low 25 sacks. Suddenly the
answer became crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland chose Brown Saturday with the first overall pick of
the National Football League draft, and in doing so selected a
player who could be a defensive anchor on the Browns' line for
years to come. They picked him only a matter of minutes after
reaching agreement on a six-year contract with the 6-foot-5-inch,
265-pound player who has a chance to be the next Bruce Smith. In
fact, Brown is the first defensive end picked No. 1 overall since
Smith was selected first by Buffalo in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long, healthy discussion about both players,''
Cleveland coach Chris Palmer said. ``Basically what it came down to
was that we really needed a pass rusher, and Courtney is just such
a great football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not have to wait long to see the destination of his
excitable teammate. The Washington Redskins, as expected, selected
Arrington with the second overall pick, making it the first time
that two players from the same university were drafted 1-2 since
1984.
</P>
<P>
   `For Courtney to go No. 1, there's no disappointment from me,''
Arrington said. ``I mean, I couldn't be picked after a better guy.
Courtney, I think he deserved it. I just feel like I was the
natural pick for the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington used its third selection to pick Alabama offensive
tackle Chris Samuels. There is no question that the Redskins,
already loaded with talent, should be favored to represent the
National Football Conference in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With the 11th selection, the Giants boosted a weak running game
by picking Ron Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Wisconsin, a
power back whose brutal running style fits their desire to pound
the football.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, who had four selections in the first round, met their
need for help on the defensive line by picking Tennessee defensive
end Shaun Ellis at No. 12 even though some teams had rated him
lower in the first round. With the 13th pick, the Jets selected
linebacker John Abraham from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After making the most trade noise of almost any team in the
draft, Cincinnati made Peter Warrick the fourth selection. The
Bengals had thought seriously of trading down. While they were on
the 15-minute deadline clock, the Bengals fielded calls from teams
including the Jets. In the end, Cincinnati decided Warrick's
play-making ability was too enticing to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that the Baltimore Ravens might trade the
fifth pick _ the Giants recently inquired about it _ but they
decided to take Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis. Most scouts
rated Lewis as the best running back in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a handful of surprises in the top 10.
Philadelphia took Florida State defensive tackle Corey Simon with
the sixth pick despite recent shoulder operations, Arizona selected
the speedy Virginia running back Thomas Jones with the seventh
pick, Pittsburgh took Michigan State wide receiver Plaxico Burress
with the eighth pick, and Chicago selected New Mexico linebacker
Brian Urlacher ninth. Urlacher has moved rapidly up some team's
draft boards because of his exceptional workouts in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, with the 10th pick, again helped its offense by
picking Florida's Travis Taylor, known for his speed and work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   There were some definite shocks in the first round. First,
several personnel men said they were stunned by the lack of trades.
But teams, on draft day, were reluctant to give up picks to make a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington, a possible
franchise quarterback, went lower than expected, with the Jets
grabbing him at No. 18. And by far the most surprising selection of
the day _ and maybe of the last five drafts _ was the Oakland
Raiders' picking Florida State kicker/punter Sebastian Janikowski
at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, who weighs 260 pounds, was rated a third-rounder by
some scouts. One of the reasons was his arrest in an attempt to
bribe a police officer. A native of Poland, Janikowski faces
deportation because of those charges, though the Raiders must be
convinced that his situation will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The days before the draft were among the most hectic ever.
Several times the Browns considered trading the first pick and
acquiring multiple picks to address their numerous needs.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance last week, they talked with the Jets, which
Cleveland general manager Carmen Policy confirmed in a television
interview. The Jets offered three of their four No. 1 picks to the
Browns; the Browns, in turn, requested all four of the Jets'
first-round picks. The Jets said no.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cleveland held on to the pick because it felt that
Brown was a rare commodity _ a dominant defensive lineman who could
be among the best for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All of the teams in the top five seriously considered making
major trades. In fact, one league executive maintained that of the
31 teams, at least 20 explored trades in the first round alone. The
Eagles heard from at least three teams: the Jets, Green Bay and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme in this draft was character. The NFL has urged its
teams to draft as much for character as for talent. A number of
teams, including the Denver Broncos and the Giants, either removed
troubled players from their draft boards or dropped them
significantly in their rankings.
</P>
<P>
   One player who dropped on the boards of some teams, perhaps
unfairly, is Burress. He missed a scheduled appointment with
several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles, because he wanted
to attend the college basketball Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles began to spread the word that Burress had a bad
attitude _ as well as other unsubstantiated information _ and his
stock began to drop. To some team scouts, the league's emphasis on
drafting players with good character had gone too far in this case.
The Steelers are not concerned about any off-field problems and
think Burress' 6-5 stature can overwhelm most cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick might have been the first overall selection had it not
been for an arrest while at Florida State after he and a friend
paid $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing in a scam at a department
store. He also ran some lackluster times in the 40-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are judging me by what I did,'' Warrick said. ``It was
something that happened. What I did was wrong, but I'm a better
person than that. Don't judge me by what I did. I can't please
everybody. I can't be what somebody else wants. I can only be
myself.''

ANGELS TRY TO DEFINE BULLPEN ROLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Manager Mike Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black
continue to try to figure out how to use a seven-man bullpen.
Getting all of them enough work to stay sharp and defining their
roles has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   One pitcher -- Derrick Turnbow -- has not pitched in a game yet.
Turnbow, 21, pitched in single-A last season and was selected in
December's Rule V Draft from the Phillies. Under normal
circumstances, he'd be pitching at double-A this year, but by rule,
the Angels have to keep him on the 25-man roster or offer him back
to the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbow warmed up Friday night when starter Ken Hill was
struggling early, but he never got in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're breaking him in slowly, he'll get in there,'' Scioscia
said. ``But we're not waiting for a game to get out of hand to get
Derrick in. We think Derrick's a functional pitcher on the staff,
not just someone you use in blowouts.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as getting everyone enough work to avoid becoming rusty,
Scioscia says it's a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing a good job of trying to slot 'em into
roles,'' he said. ``As we go on, it is much easier to get roles
defined. Of all the things that have happened to the club, the one
area we're coming up short is bullpen production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than (Troy) Percival, all of them seem to be having a
rough time at once. But I'm confident they'll come together as a
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Saturday's 3-1 victory, the starters are 6-3 with a
3.24 ERA; the bullpen is 0-2 with a 6.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon went 1 for 1 with three walks Saturday, but is still
hitting only .219. The three walks Saturday were a sign he might be
coming out of his early-season slump because he's being more
selective with pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning Saturday, Salmon batted with two on and two
out, worked the count full, fouled several pitches back, then
walked on the 11th pitch of the at-bat. It kept the inning alive,
allowing Garret Anderson (RBI single) and Troy Glaus (two-run
double) to give the Angels a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage it's very much a step in the right direction,''
said Salmon, who homered in his first at-bat of the season but
hasn't homered since. ``But he gave me too many pitches to put in
play and get that run in. It's not like I was trying to foul
pitches off. I took swings like I wanted to do something with 'em.
I just didn't hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher made a rehab start for single-A Lake Elsinore
Saturday night. Belcher, who had offseason surgery on his elbow, is
expected to return by early May.

start for Anaheim since his three-hit shutout of the Blue Jays last
week. Jim Parque (1-0, 9.00) will start for Chicago. After today's
game, the Angels fly to Toronto to begin a four-game series vs. the
Blue Jays starting Monday.

FISHER PROMISES TO BE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Derek Fisher's frustration was immediately evident
Saturday as he (almost) blew off a handful of reporters asking
about his sore ankle. It's a rare day that the talkative and
congenial Fisher gives a ``no comment,'' but it's rarer still that
an injury keeps the fourth-year guard from playing, so his
reluctance was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   An irritating bone spur has forced him to the injured list for
the first time in his career, and though Fisher is unhappy about
it, he's also adamant that he'll be back for the playoffs next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not any question in my mind,'' he said. ``I've been
dealing with it for a while and just trying my best to be as
effective as I could. That was getting harder and harder. So
everybody decided that this (the injured list) would be the best
thing at this point. I still didn't want to do it. I mean, I wanted
to keep playing, but I was limited, to say the least ....
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have done this earlier if it wasn't for my personal
beliefs and things that I just don't like to do. And being injured,
I just don't like it, and never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the team didn't reveal the injury until last week, Fisher
clarified that the ankle actually has been bothering him for at
least a month. But he kept playing until Friday, and though he
preferred just a short rest, coach Phil Jackson decided to make the
roster move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't run,'' said Fisher. ``Every step, everything
hurt. And a lot of my game is speed and power and being able to
explode, not just on offense, but on the defensive end. And it
really limited me. I wasn't using it as an excuse and I'm not using
it now. Whenever you suit up and go out there, you have to perform.
Hopefully, this week (off) will do me good.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition may eventually require surgery, but for now Fisher
hopes that rest, therapy and medication will decrease the
inflammation - at least to begin the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really has been able to knock it out for an extended
period of time,'' he said. ``It may feel great, but then a week
later, once we get through pounding and doing what we do on a daily
basis, it may come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher said he can play through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so. I was doing it before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   March on: The Lakers are 2-1 since clinching the NBA's best
record. But the starters continue to play into the fourth quarter,
and the intensity level has not noticeably waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been - I don't want to use the word admirable -
but I think it's been honest effort,'' Jackson said. ``And that's
the thing that's important for ballplayers to understand, is that
.... I think you have an obligation to your team and your fans and
to your principles of working hard and the right effort and all
that kind of stuff. And I hope that's a principle they've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 2:30 p.m., Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KNBC-Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (66-13) update: They are 35-5 at Staples Center as they
head into their last home game of the regular season. A victory
would give the Lakers no worse than a tie with Indiana for the
NBA's best home record. But it will leave them short of the
franchise high for home wins (37). The Lakers have won 10 of the
last 11 meetings with Minnesota, including all three this season.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves (49-30) update: They've won five of their last six
games but needed two overtimes to beat lowly Vancouver on Friday.
Minnesota is currently seeded sixth in the West, which would pit
the Timberwolves against No. 3 Portland in the first round of the
playoffs. But the Wolves are within striking distance of the
teetering No. 4 seed, San Antonio, and have three games to try to
catch them.

JOHNSON ENJOYS RIPKEN'S SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 3,000-hit countdown ended in Minnesota for Cal
Ripken, and some 2,000 miles away a former manager watched and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson skippered Ripken and the Baltimore
Orioles to the American League wild card in 1996 and to the AL East
title the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles faithful might remember Johnson more for wanting to move
Ripken to third base than anything else, but Johnson has just
positive memories of Ripken, who reached 3,000 career hits
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already in the Hall of Fame,'' Johnson said before
Saturday's Dodgers-Reds game. ``Three thousand hits isn't a
criteria for him. His accomplishments are second to none. Anything
Cal set his mind on, he was going to accomplish, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Ripken supporters, Johnson found the Baltimore icon
extremely gifted, even when it came to judging personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson privately talked with Ripken about moving him from
shortstop to third base. Ripken wasn't in favor at first but told
Johnson he would do what his manager asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Skip, whatever you want to do,' '' Johnson
recounted, `` `but I don't think that other guy can play short.' He
was talking about Manny Alexander - and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we picked up (Mike) Bordick, he moved.''
</P>
<P>
   The press caught wind of Johnson's discussions, and some
interpreted Ripken's hesitation as his attempting to usurp
Johnson's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way, shape or form did he try to manage or control the
ball club,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   When players would talk to Ripken, said Johnson, ``I told Cal to
pass them on to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal certainly held up his end in every way conceivable,'' said
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling homecoming: Dmitri Young, who attended Rio Mesa of
Oxnard, is in town with the Reds. Of course, that means family and
friends attend the series, including Young's brother, Delmon, a
Camarillo freshman who served as bat boy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For this trip, however, Young, has left just enough tickets for
his parents, three siblings and a handful of friends. That was in
stark contrast to 1996, when he made his major-league debut with
St. Louis. When the Cardinals first played here, Young left close
to 80 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The difference: The novelty of Young in the majors has worn off.
Plus, he only leaves tickets for the people who have shown an
interest in him or his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else, you want to see me, you've got to pay,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Know your players: Young often has been confused with St. Louis
reliever Lee Smith. This was an issue when Young was in the
Cardinals organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fans often handed him pictures of Smith to autograph. So he
would sign them - ``Dmitri Young.''
</P>

   DODGERS vs. CINCINNATI

</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; KXTA-AM (1150), KWKW-AM (1330

</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Right-hander Chan Ho Park (2-0, 4.50 ERA) opposes
right-hander Steve Parris (0-2, 10.00 ERA) in the final game of
this three-game series. Park is 2-2 with a 3.95 ERA against
Cincinnati. Parris is 1-2 with a 2.66 ERA against the Dodgers, but
he beat them last year with seven innings of one-earned-run ball in
his only start against them.

`THE AMAZON ARMY' MARCHED TO SUPPORT STRIKING COAL MINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIRARD, Kan. _ How many women marched on those freezing December
days in 1921 is unclear _ estimates ranged from 2,000 to 6,000,
almost all wearing ragged coats, run-down shoes, stocking caps and
dresses down to their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ wives and kin of striking miners _ tramped through
Crawford and Cherokee county coal camps: No. 23, Franklin, Camp 50,
Capaldo, Arma, Katy No. 2, Ringo, Chicopee and scores of others.
Their numbers grew each day.
</P>
<P>
   The only color amid the largely monochromatic mass came from the
American flags they carried.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time before strip mining became dominant; when coal
powered the nation and Kansas produced 2 million tons a year; when
most of the 517 mines in Crawford and Cherokee counties were
tunneled into the earth and miners usually worked lying on their
sides, hacking out the thin coal seams with laborious effort for
$1.25 a day. Living conditions were wretched, pay was arbitrarily
withheld, and more than 200 miners in southeast Kansas had been
injured or killed in 1921 alone.
</P>
<P>
   That winter most of the 8,000 miners here struck, and Alexander
Howat, the local union president, was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Strikebreakers were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   The women marched.
</P>
<P>
   But they did more than march. They hounded those they called
``scabs,'' blocked entrances to mines and pursued company men
through the slag heaps, beating on them with their trusty brooms.
They sang songs of solidarity and gave as good as they got in
invective. In several languages, too.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of days, the women had shut down the mines again.
At least for a while. But by the end of December, 49 of the women
had been arrested and jailed; shots had been fired at their feet in
an attempt to intimidate them; the panicked governor of Kansas set
up his command post at Pittsburg's Stilwell hotel; and the state
militia, including a machine gun company, had been activated.
</P>
<P>
   The nation had never seen anything like it. ``Near-anarchy,''
inveighed The New York Times, which gave the women the sobriquet by
which they would be known: ``The Amazon Army.''
</P>
<P>
   The press had raced here from all over the world. Breathless
dispatches spoke of the ``red sector of Kansas,'' ``Bolsheviks,''
``syndicalists,'' ``radicals'' and ``subversives.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the marchers were hungry, cold and angry.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrests, the local union leadership sent its miners
back to work; the ``scabs,'' many of them youths from Kansas
colleges, returned to their fraternity houses; the Kansas coal
industry started its long slide into oblivion; and The Amazon Army
was largely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. On April 30, a 10- by 12-foot mural of the women's
march and the miners' struggle will be unveiled at the John E.
Shireman Performing Arts Center at Girard High School.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, by Wayne Wildcat, a Lawrence artist, depicts the
miners, faces dirty and tired, and the marching women, erect,
determined, relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if we opened a Pandora's box,'' said Linda O'Nelio
Knoll, whose grandmother was one of the marchers. Knoll came across
the women's story while ruminating about a history project suitable
for the gifted junior high schoolers she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll had read the poems of the late Gene DeGruson, longtime
archivist at Pittsburg State University. He had dedicated one of
them, contained in a slim volume called Goats House, to his mother,
Clemence Merciez DeGruson, who had been a marcher. Part of that
poem:
</P>
<P>
   In '21, my mother still herself at seventeen marched for
Alexander Howat to bust the scabs who worked the mines in place of
the fathers and husbands of the women who marched with her carrying
their men's pit buckers filled with red pepper to throw in the eyes
of the poor scabs who cursed back in English to their Slovene,
German, French and Italian over the State Militia's rifle fire.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll's students dove into project, doing all sorts of research,
talking to old-timers, digging up bygone photographs and yellowing
news clippings. DeGruson's poem was the tip of an iceberg, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The students eventually wrote a 20-page play called ``The Army
of Amazons,'' which has been received with enthusiasm all over the
area. You can read it at www.digitalhistory.com by clicking on the
Pittsburg Middle School site. The play appeared about the same time
a grant sponsored by the PAACA//Pittsburg Arts Council, the Kansas
Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts became
available.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Wildcat, 45, a half-blooded Yuchi Indian and a former
winner of the Governor's Art Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Wildcat said, ``is one cool story.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, he added, it shows one of the first instances of
women's empowerment, something now taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has everything,'' he said. ``Those women, their husbands on
strike, broke, infants at home in a shack crying for milk. But they
didn't just sit. Instead they picked up their babies, brought their
young ones along, and went out and protested injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we think of protest as common. But it wasn't back then. It
was revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolly Smith Wildcat, the artist's wife, did research for the
painting, discovering old photographs of the marchers that have
been incorporated into the mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the grant,'' she said, ``I hardly knew Kansas had
coal. ... Once we got into it, everything opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Disparate facts about the march: Mother Mary Harris Jones, ``The
Miners' Angel,'' came here to support the women; the marchers laid
American flags across mine openings, daring anyone to step on Old
Glory; and a leader of the march was Mary Skubitz, whose fluency in
five languages helped communication among the ranks. Skubitz also
was the mother of a young boy named Joe who became a U.S.
congressman from southeast Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll said the play, mural and the other ancillary discoveries
had resulted in a new appreciation of the rich, tumultuous history
of this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, in the 1880s there was a mine disaster near
Frontenac,'' Knoll said. ``It killed 47 miners. They were buried in
a mass grave. No marker. No nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? I'll bet in a couple of years we have a
marker. Now people down here want to remember.''

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Hendrix took courses at Johnson County Community
College. Last semester, she carried a full load there at her
mother's urging but disliked the rigid schedule, sometimes skipping
morning classes.
</P>
<P>
   But she's sure she won't have trouble readjusting to classroom
life when she joins the other freshmen at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix scored well enough on the Preliminary Scholastic
Assessment Test to win a National Merit Scholarship. And she scored
a perfect 800 on the literature portion of the SAT II.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. colleges and universities accept homeschooled
students, and some even recruit them, said Christopher Klicka,
executive director of the National Center for Home Education. Many
colleges are attracted by the self-discipline and motivation of
their homeschooled applicants, Klicka said.
</P>
<P>
   His organization estimates there are about 200,000 homeschooled
students in college now, and that number will continue to rise as
the movement grows, Klicka said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homeschool movement is growing up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many church-affiliated colleges and universities have accepted
homeschoolers for years, and most state schools do, too.
Homeschooled students are among the undergraduates at KU, Kansas
State University and the University of Missouri-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Miller, though, will be heading east this fall to Earlham
College in Indiana to pursue a degree in music. And he'll pay for
his four years at the liberal arts college with the money he earned
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Kriss and Gary Miller, want their children's
education to be practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my kids can have a stock portfolio instead of an accounting
class, doesn't that make more sense?'' Kriss Miller asked.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy is why Ashley and his sister, Abbi, practice
their math skills by having checking accounts. That's why Ashley
does the maintenance on his car. And that's why Gary and Ashley
Miller last year built a recording studio in the basement of their
brick ranch home outside Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-channel recording studio lets Ashley Miller record his
original compositions, mixing the parts independently. He also
practices there with his punk band, Annie on My Mind.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says homeschooling has allowed him to ``evolve himself,''
although he suspects his interests would be the same even if he'd
been formally schooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little bit more of a personal route,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kriss Miller strives for as she guides the education
of her children. Life isn't divided into separate subjects, she
said. And because her children learn by doing, Miller thinks they
will retain more of what they're exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they leave this house to function in the real world, I
feel like they're going to be well equipped,'' Miller said.

EDWARD GOREY, 75, AUTHOR AND ILLUSTRATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Gorey, whose eerie black-and-white
cross-hatched drawings of hapless children and Victorian ministers
charmed and haunted readers, died Saturday in Hyannis, Mass. He was
75.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey, an artist and writer who lived in Yarmouth Port, Mass.,
suffered a heart attack on Wednesday and died in Cape Cod Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey was known for writing at least 90 books, illustrating 60
others, and designing sets for stage productions, including
``Dracula'' on Broadway and ``Amphigorey,'' an Off Broadway play he
wrote. He won a 1978 Tony award for costume design for ``Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   His best-known characters included the Gashlycrumb Tinies, one
woebegone child for each letter of the alphabet, from Amy, who fell
down the stairs, to Zillah, who drank too much gin. His work was
influenced by Ionesco and Buster Keaton, Goya and Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years he produced two books, ``The Haunted
Tea-Cosy: A Dispirited and Distasteful Diversion for Christmas,''
and ``The Headless Bust: A Melancholy Meditation on the False
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 book review of ``The World of Edward Gorey,'' Steve
Heller wrote in The New York Times that the artist's satires ``are
not mere commentaries on the manners and mores of a distant age;
they are inventive narratives about evil adults, mischievous
children, illicit lovers and improbable beasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey grew up in Chicago, served in the Army, and attended
Harvard University, where he roomed with the poet Frank O'Hara. He
graduated in 1950, then moved to New York, working in the art
department at Doubleday, where he would stay in the office at night
to create his own books. His first book, ``The Doubtful Guest,'' in
1957, won acclaim from Edmund Wilson in the New Yorker. In 1962 he
established Fantod Press to publish his works.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Cape Cod in the late 1980s.

EDITORIAL: IRAN'S DUBIOUS ESPIONAGE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 16:
</P>
<P>
   Iran's justice system is run by conservative Islamic clerics,
not the reform-minded government of President Mohammad Khatami. But
clerical control does not absolve Iranian courts of their
responsibility to provide fair, impartial and transparent justice
in the trial of 13 Iranian Jews that opens May 1 in Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 are accused of spying for Israel, charges that carry a
potential death penalty. Israel and all the defendants deny that
the alleged spying took place. Proceedings were set to start this
week, but they have now been delayed in honor of the Jewish holiday
of Passover. That could be an encouraging sign that intense
international concern is leading Iran to reconsider its offensive
handling of this case.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first arrests a year and a half ago, elementary
considerations of due process have been overridden. Conservative
Iranian news media have been unrestrained in whipping up public
animosity, though neither the formal charges nor any incriminating
evidence has ever been made public. The defendants were only
recently allowed to choose their own lawyers, who have not yet been
given adequate time to prepare. Court proceedings are being held in
secret, and requests by the Iranian Jewish community and
international human rights organizations to send observers have
been denied. These abuses have brought protests from the
governments of France, Germany, Britain, the European Union, the
United States and Israel, as well as private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Islamic Constitution grants legal tolerance to Jews. But
since the 1979 revolution the Jewish community has suffered
persecutions, prejudice and violence. Of the 80,000 Jews who lived
in Iran before the revolution, fewer than half remain.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in this case should not be punished for their
religion or to score points in the ongoing battle between clerical
conservatives and reformers. They are entitled to a fair and open
trial, and to acquittal if the charges against them cannot be
convincingly proved.

EDITORIAL: A WEAKENED IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 16:
</P>
<P>
   Years of pummeling by Congress have so weakened the Internal
Revenue Service _ eroding its budget, staff and spirit _ that the
agency has largely abandoned efforts to detect tax fraud among the
rich and powerful, or even among ordinary taxpayers. The threat
that the agency will audit an individual's tax form is shrinking
toward zero. The odds that the IRS, having caught you in a mistake,
will seize property or even levy a fine are also plummeting. Even
the threat that a diligent collection agent will pressure people
who owe back taxes is quickly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, the agency's priorities have been so distorted by
Congress that it is now more apt to audit a poor person than a rich
person, and a small business than a large corporation. Nobody knows
how much tax cheating is going on because Congress has also
eliminated the random audits once used to estimate the extent of
tax evasion. The sad result is that a tax system that has long
relied on Americans to calculate honestly how much they owe the
government _ and is the envy of other nations _ is at risk of being
subverted.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the problem is Congress, which has slashed the
agency's budget by almost 30 percent since the 1980s. As a result,
the number of IRS employees has dropped about 15 percent over the
past seven years, even though the number and the complexity of
returns are rising quickly, in part because soaring stock values
and a fast-rising economy have generated many more forms from many
more high-income families. The agency's job has also been made more
difficult by an explosion of clever new tax dodges designed by
corporations _ a problem that has grown large enough to qualify,
according to Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, as the agency's
primary enforcement issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration directed the agency to
spend a disproportionate share of its dwindling resources on
monitoring overpayment of tax credits to low-paid workers. It is
true that many recipients of the earned-income tax credit, out of
confusion or malice, claim more than they are truly owed. But that
is hardly a central tax collection issue. Meanwhile, Congress,
fired up by anecdotal reports of taxpayers being abused, passed a
bill in 1998 that requires the agency to fire agents who harass
taxpayers. Enforcement of that provision has left unclear the line
between harassment and diligence, causing some agents to say they
have backed off from vigorously collecting taxes out of fear of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The harm done by congressional cutbacks and antagonism can be
seen in data to be posted Sunday by researchers on a Syracuse
University Web site, and reported in Sunday's New York Times. The
poor are now more likely to be audited than the rich. One in every
74 taxpayers reporting income below $25,000 and filing an
uncomplicated return was audited last year. By contrast, 1 in every
87 taxpayers whose income was above $100,000 was audited. A dozen
years ago, one in every nine of those high-income taxpayers would
have been audited. The same skewed priorities have permeated
business audits. Proprietorships with small sales volume were
audited more frequently than those with high volume.
</P>
<P>
   Audits of the self-employed with gross receipts over $100,000
were cut by about 55 percent between 1988 and 1999.Only 1 in every
66 corporations was audited last year, the lowest rate in 86 years.
</P>
<P>
   Collection of delinquent taxes has also fallen precipitously.
Levies on bank accounts and other assets have fallen about 85
percent since 1992 and seizures of property have fallen 98 percent,
from 10,000 cases as recently as 1997 to just 161 last year. The
amount of money collected through enforcement actions has fallen 13
percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The question arises whether the drop in enforcement effort has
diminished compliance. Compliance is hard to measure. Congress
eliminated the program in 1995 by which the agency used to conduct
extensive _ and invasive _ audits on a large sample of taxpayers to
determine how well they complied with the tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner of internal revenue, Charles Rossotti, has
struggled hard to correct as many problems as his budget allows. He
has also provided the data that allows the academics at Syracuse
University and other outsiders to judge what is going on. The
commissioner himself warns that the lack of audits threatens to
``undermine our entire system of voluntary tax compliance.''

NONTRADITIONAL HOMESCHOOLERS CHERISH THE NONCONFORMITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For Amanda Hendrix, 10th grade looked
something like this: Language arts was a writing workshop at the
Coterie Theatre, social studies was a three-week trip to France,
and home economics was instruction on vegetarian cooking and
medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   For Ashley Miller, one junior year math exercise consisted of
investing in the stock market. Miller studied his pick and invested
$10,000 last summer. By the end of the year, he'd made $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix and Miller are products of homeschooling, but not the
traditional version, which is based on religious freedom. Theirs is
based on educational freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Homeschooling in all its forms has been gaining popularity the
past two decades. By some estimates, as many as 1.7 million U.S.
children forgo formal schooling to learn from their parents at
home.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Virginia-based National Center for Home
Education, Missouri has 30,000 to 35,000 homeschoolers and Kansas
15,000 to 17,500. The numbers are estimates only; although the
practice is legal in every state, most don't require homeschoolers
to register. And those that do, such as Kansas, don't enforce the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix and Miller, both 17, are the first members of a local
secular homeschooling group, LEARN, to finish their home studies
and head for higher education.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN, which stands for Let Education Always Remain Natural,
began in late 1995. Homeschooling parents Kelly Wilson of Kansas
City and Kriss Miller, Ashley's mother, felt like a minority within
their homeschooling support group, which was geared toward people
who homeschooled for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Miller wanted a support group of another kind. Both
had decided to teach their children at home because they believe
formal schooling breeds conformity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schooling can get in the way of trying to learn things,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN now has 68 member families across the Kansas City area.
All recognize, as LEARN's mission statement spells out, that
members' beliefs aren't necessarily the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care where you go to church,'' said Wilson, a mother
of two. ``It's just not an issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some LEARN members have traditional classrooms set up in their
homes, and children learn from formal curricula and textbooks.
Others, such as Miller and Wilson, favor ``unschooling,'' in which
children's interests guide their learning and school isn't an
activity separate from other family endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The group meets the last Monday of each month at All Souls
Unitarian Universalist Church in Kansas City, and throughout the
year members plan field trips, play days and family activities. On
March 31, six families left for the Grand Canyon. In May, LEARN
families will hold their annual prom.
</P>
<P>
   Miller thinks that having a group of people that understands
where you're coming from is paramount to homeschooling success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find people that homeschool, because we need to
feel supported,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When they start out, homeschoolers often encounter pressure and
misunderstanding from family and neighbors. One of the most common
criticisms is that homeschooled students are isolated socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a downside, what people say is kids that are
homeschooled don't have the same opportunities for interaction that
kids have in a school setting,'' said Judy Seltz of the American
Association of School Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson counters that LEARN families come from a variety of
backgrounds and the group's field trips expose children to all
sorts of experiences. Members plan outings to parks all over the
area, for example. Many students volunteer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Social isolation is not an aspect of homeschooling that worries
Gene Neely, president of the Kansas National Education Association.
Children whose parents are well educated and conscientious will
turn out much as they would have in school, Neely suggested: well
rounded and socialized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's too early in the homeschooling movement to judge how
well children perform as adults, Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I may think parents make the wrong choice, it's
really difficult to criticize the folks who do it and do it well,''
Neely said. ``What we don't hear about are the kids who don't do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   For Susan Myers, Hendrix's mother, LEARN was validation that she
wasn't making a mistake when she let her daughter quit high school.
</P>
<P>
   During her freshman year at Shawnee Mission East High School,
Hendrix picked up a copy of The Teen-Age Liberation Handbook by
Grace Llewellyn. Among other things, the book advocates teen-agers'
taking control of their education through homeschooling.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix found answers to what had been bugging her about school
since the third grade: She felt forced to learn things she wasn't
interested in, and she never had time to pursue in depth the things
that really mattered to her, such as writing and performing. And
she was stressed by the pressure she felt to maintain good grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't free to do what I chose to,'' Hendrix said.
``Whatever it was, it was all directed by the school. You had to go
to it all day, but you weren't even done when you got home.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she knew school was disturbing for her younger
daughter, it took some persuading for Myers to allow Hendrix to
leave East. She kept fretting over whether Hendrix was taking
enough classes to get into college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious and worried a lot that Amanda would miss out,''
Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix grinned and patted her upswept hair, stiff with hair
spray from a stint earlier in the day as a saloon girl in a Lyric
Opera production. ``That's backwards thinking,'' she said. ``I was
missing out in school.''
</P>
<P>
   So she left East after her freshman year. She spent the next
three years ``unschooling,'' reading books and exploring subjects
that caught her fancy. Although Myers continued to work, she kept
tabs on her daughter's activities and compiled transcripts at the
end of each semester as the two looked back over what Hendrix had
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix took French and Italian at a private school. She took
voice lessons. She performed in plays and musicals, such as the
Civic Opera of Kansas City's December production of ``Wise Women.''

HIGH YIELD'S BLUE GRASS SHOWS HE'S READY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ In his final dress rehearsal for the Kentucky
Derby three weeks from now, High Yield defeated More Than Ready by
a head Saturday to win the Blue Grass Stakes and position himself
among the leaders on the road to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, a son of Storm Cat who won the Fountain of Youth in
Florida last month and the Hopeful at Saratoga last September,
carried D. Wayne Lukas one step closer to another Derby as the most
successful trainer in modern racing. But before he did, he had to
put away an early challenge from the storybook horse, Hal's Hope,
who faded and finished last, and a late challenge from More Than
Ready, who brushed High Yield several times as they dueled down the
homestretch at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield lived up to his notices as a well-traveled warrior
who has raced from California to Florida to Kentucky, winning 4 of
his 12 starts and running in the money 11 times. He is now aimed
directly at the Derby on May 6 at Churchill Downs, where he will
tangle with Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier with a horse,'' said Lukas, who has won
the Kentucky Derby four times. ``He's got pedigree and speed, and
he fights back. There are so many good 3-year-olds this year that
the Derby will be a handicapper's nightmare. But we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the eight colts who ran in the Blue Grass suffered
unhappy trips with unhappy results. Mighty, who won the Louisiana
Derby last month for Claiborne Farm, brushed the side of the gate
at the start and eventually faded to seventh place. The only horse
he beat was Hal's Hope, who wrote a fairy tale saga in Florida by
racing into prominence for his 88-year-old breeder, trainer and
owner, Harold Rose.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a day when speed outran sentiment, and the early
speed was flashed predictably by High Yield, More Than Ready and
Hal's Hope. After half a mile, High Yield led by a head over Hal's
Hope while More Than Ready stalked them from third place. After
three-quarters of a mile, they were still locked in a speed match
separated by a few feet. As they turned for home, Hal's Hope
suddenly surrendered his place to More Than Ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Yield took control going into the turn,'' said Pat Day,
who rode the colt for the third straight time, ``and I was able to
secure room down inside. He was very relaxed at this point. Then,
turning for home, he fought back very gamely. It was a heroic
effort in the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The fractions probably told the story on Hal's Hope, winner of
the Holy Bull and the Florida Derby. He captured the public's fancy
with his owners, Rose and his 85-year-old wife, Elsie, and their
42-year-old jockey, Roger Velez, a recovering alcoholic who, like
Rose, had suffered a stroke in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The horse stayed the first quarter-mile in 23 1/5 seconds, the
half-mile in 46 seconds and three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 4/5.
When they hit the stretch with its final 1,174 feet, they had raced
one mile in 1:35 2/5, and the tiring Hal's Hope was no longer being
pushed by his jockey.
</P>
<P>
   But High Yield had to shake off the bruising drive of John
Velazquez and More Than Ready, who won his first five races last
year and chased Mighty home in the Louisiana Derby.
</P>
<P>
   As they crossed the line, Wheelaway, winner of the Tampa Bay
Derby last month, was third, three lengths behind More Than Ready.
He was followed by Deputy Warlock, Bare Outline and Settlement,
three long-shots, and by Mighty and Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The final time, before a Keeneland record crowd of 29,687, was
1:48 3/5. High Yield paid $5.80 for a $2 bet to win and headed for
Churchill Downs with $465,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crying about this by any means,'' said Todd Pletcher,
the trainer of More Than Ready. ``My horse ran as good as anyone
could run against the grain of this track. The inside speed has won
almost every race in the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, who trains Wheelaway for his father, Caesar Kimmel,
agreed that the Keeneland track paid off on inside speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheelaway ran a huge race,'' he said, ``especially when you
consider that the track was really playing to all the speed. I
think my horse ran his way into contention for the Kentucky
Derby.''

WE'RE SUCKERS FOR URBAN LEGENDS THAT THRIVE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The banana will not eat your flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen peroxide will not cure your cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There's no serious plan to tax your e-mail, to sell your census
specifics to strangers, or to ban Jesus from public television.
</P>
<P>
   And never-kidnapped Kelsey Brooke Jones, whose disappearance
story and digitized picture continue to circulate around the globe,
is home safely in the bosom of Faribault, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Arm us with unfathomable calculating power and fingertip access
to the world's great libraries and periodicals. We still, it seems,
make P.T. Barnum proud. Born every minute, we are suckered into one
urban legend or dubious conspiracy theory or not-quite-so yarn
after the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always bought into fanciful things,'' said Joe
Nickell of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims
of the Paranormal. ``The subjects always tap into people's basic
hopes and fears.''
</P>
<P>
   So fears of demons in the Middle Ages evolved to ghost sightings
in Victorian times and into alien abductions in the jet age, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, as Americans hunch over their keyboards for longer
periods, fears grow of about the vulnerability to the gargantuan
computer network known as the Internet. A recent virus hoax warns
of e-mail with ``Jesus'' in the subject line _ supposedly crafted
by a rabidly atheist professor _ that will devour your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are new to the Internet have been reading horror
stories in the media for years about these viruses that will
destroy everything,'' said Rob Rosenberger, who runs an anti-virus
hoax Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they get an e-mail warning from a friend who's been
duped, and in two seconds they hit the `send to all' button. It's
passed on to everybody in their (e-mail) address book...
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could come up with a virus, it would delete that `send to
all' button.''
</P>
<P>
   While there's no way to measure how often we're fooled by
fantastic tales, people who chart the urban legends we pass on, and
on, say the fiction moves faster today on the Internet's
speed-of-light transom. The stories also reflect our times: fears
of the incredible technology we rely on, hope for solutions or
excitements yet to visit our easy lives, suspicion of those in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the legends we tell are a reflection of current
societal concerns or a search for excitement,'' said Barbara
Mikkelson, who runs a Web site in Agoura, Calif., debunking urban
legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always been worried about their health. So today
you hear lots of things about needles in (play area) ball pits and
on movie theater seats. Today we worry about HIV and AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that, say Mikkelson and others who track the modern myth,
is a distrust of government. They say a post-Vietnam,
post-Watergate, post-Lewinsky America is conditioned to expect lies
from the highest authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of distrust in government,'' she said. ``It's a
standard feeling that if someone has power over your life, you
distrust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether bred of anxiety about government, technology or an
increasingly impersonal society, the stories grow. Some recent
examples:
</P>
<P>
   - ``Bananas from Costa Rica have been infected with ...
flesh-eating bacteria,'' reads a well-traveled e-mail. ``The
disease has been able to graft itself to the skin of fruit (and),
until this finding, scientists were not sure how the infection was
being transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Relax, implores the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the rare disease strikes fewer than one in 15,000
Americans a year. It is most often passed person to person, and
consumption of fruit would be ``an unlikely cause for necrotizing
fasciitis. ... The bacteria cannot survive long on the surface of a
banana.''
</P>
<P>
   - Last month Kansas City radio talk show host Chris Baker told
listeners that for $40 anyone could read the census forms the
government was ordering them to fill out. Producer Scott Voorhees
quickly had Baker qualify the statement to say the records were
open to anyone ``authorized by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, federal law makes individual census returns
confidential for 72 years. The rule is backed by penalties of a
$5,000 fine and a five-year prison term for sharing the forms with
the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out people ``authorized by the government'' are limited
to the parents of minor children, guardians of the mentally
incompetent and the relatives of a dead person. That exception is
made when a birth certificate isn't available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize we're making a stretch here,'' Voorhees said. ``But
it seems like a lot of the time the government can't be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``I have a five-year-old daughter named Kelsey Brooke Jones.
We are from southern Minnesota. She has been missing since pm Oct.
11, 1999. ... If anyone anywhere knows anything, sees anything,
pleeeeaaaase contact me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey was missing when her mother, Amy Wolkenhauer, wrote the
message. But she had only wandered off to play with a friend, and
was back in less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was true when she wrote the e-mail,'' said Taylor Wilcox, a
case manager for Missing Children Minnesota. ``But the plea for
help has lived on much longer than the case.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``I just heard recently,'' a Blue Springs woman wrote to The
Kansas City Star, ``that the Federal Communications Commission has
voted 3-2 to remove Christian broadcasting from all noncommercial
TV stations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where fact gets slightly fictionalized. In ruling on the
licensing of a public television station to a Christian
broadcasting firm in Pittsburgh, the FCC said the firm could air
religious shows. But, in a controversial vote, the commission ruled
that the company could not count ``religious exhortation,
proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs'' toward its requirement to fill more than half its time
with educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   - Pity The Washingtonian. One version of a recent rumor passed
on an editorial supposedly penned by its staff extolling a tax on
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never,'' the monthly magazine responded, ``wrote such an
article. ... The congressman quoted does not exist, the bill number
does not exist, the law firm which supposedly wrote this e-mail
does not exist. ... It is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be so easy to pick on the Internet, said Jamie Love,
director of the Consumer Project on Technology, as the bogeyman who
dupes us. But people have always fallen for tall tales. Cyberspace
only allows them to travel more quickly.  &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.: more quickly.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, there's so much crap floating around on the
Internet it just makes you more skeptical,'' Love said. ``My
experience is that when you put something wrong out on the
Internet, you're almost immediately bombarded by people trying to
point out your mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail rumor probably grew, he said, from people's love of
e-mail and their fear of having to pay by the message.
</P>
<P>
   Other times the engine behind a fantasy is profit. Indiana State
University chemistry professor John Allen wrote a recent article
for Skeptical Inquirer magazine debunking so-called oxygen therapy,
which often includes the drinking of hydrogen peroxide, as a way to
fight diseases such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has just enough science to fool people. But it's fraud and
charlatanism and snake oil sales at its worst,'' Allen said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   It's promoted by people preying on the desperate, he said, and
believed by people who can't find hope elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) are in
collusion with the drug companies to keep this quiet to make more
money,'' Allen said. ``People gravitate to conspiracy theories
because they reinforce a dislike for big institutions. ... Besides,
those explanations are so much more exciting than real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, is to understand the source of
information and the source's motives. Then, he said, favor the more
plausible over the fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something sounds outrageous,'' Allen said, ``it probably is
outrageous.''  &QL; 
(OPTIONAL INFORMATION FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   According to the urban legend-debunking site www.snopes.com,
maintained by amateur sleuths Barbara and David Mikkelson, these
are a few fresh phonies:
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: The glue on deposit envelopes at automated teller
machines is laced with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Lick away. This started in Canada, where someone
thought they heard it on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: Amazon.com gave a thumbs-up review to the anti-Semitic
tome The Protocol of the Elders of Zion.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: No attaboy to the author from the online bookseller,
although it does let cybersurfers post their reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: Forwarding a particular e-mail will get you a free
cellular phone (or computer company stock, or free cases of soda,
or ...).
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Wishful thinking only.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: The U.S. Postal Service is discontinuing its ``Black
Heritage'' stamp series.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: The stamps have been a popular issue for 20 years, and
the post office is still selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC because the government
says genetically modified poultry no longer counts as chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: It was the ``fried,'' not the ``chicken.'' It still
fries chicken; it just doesn't want to emphasize its deep-fat
cooking.

HUNDREDS ARE ARRESTED ON EVE OF BIG D.C . RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police corralled, handcuffed, and led away hundreds
of people protesting the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
Saturday night, as the capital braced for protests Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests of as many as 600 peaceful demonstrators was a
display of force. Officials have said all along they would not
tolerate the lawlessness that tore apart meetings of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, police here have been training since January, and
have spent more than $1 million on security preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest show of muscle came Saturday night, as police in
riot gear herded hundreds of activists, along with one tourist and
a news photographer, behind barricades, then arrested them for
demonstrating without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Police then transported the demonstrators away on school buses.
Demonstrators shouted ``shame, shame'' as police made the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Washington police closed a warehouse being
used by anti-IMF organizers. They also tightened security
throughout the capital, as thousands of demonstrators poured into
town.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the warehouse violated safety codes, and that
they had found a device that resembled a homemade explosive. One
demonstrator, however, said police had ``been looking for any
excuse to shut us down,'' and other protesters said the aggressive
police moves had been intended to intimidate people from joining
Sunday's rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the guise of fire violations, they have violated our
constitutional rights,'' said a protest spokesman, Adam Eidinger.
He said the device found was a plastic bottle, not a Molotov
cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgetown, about 150 demonstrators, including one almost
naked man, blocked the entrance to the Gap store, saying it
exploited underpaid laborers to make its clothes. A protester was
arrested for nudity after he dashed across the street wearing only
a grass skirt. Nearby, demonstrators carried a sign that read,
``We'd Rather Wear Nothing than Wear Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the mass detentions, there had been 21
demonstration-related arrests since the protests began last
weekend. At least one of those arrests included seizure of
ammunition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of as many as 10,000 protesters Sunday, police
have prepared extra jail space.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters insisted that their goal was passive resistance _ not
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been saying all the time that it will be peaceful,''
Police Chief Charles Ramsey said. ``I just hope they honor that.''

SASHA VON SCHERLER, 65, ACTRESS WHO ENLIVENED DOZENS OF PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., spelling Rachael, in last graf, is CQ) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sasha Von Scherler, an actress and comedian who
appeared in more than 100 productions in New York City, died
Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 65 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung disease, said her daughter, Ruth Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   Von Scherler followed her mother, an actress trained by the
playwright and producer David Belasco, into a life in the theater.
Her father, a Prussian baron named Walram-Voystingus Albert
Alexander Von Schoeler, did not approve.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1980 interview in The New York Times, Von Scherler said her
early life was marked by some radical peregrinations, from a
convent school in Windsor, Ontario, to Tokyo, where she first set
foot on stage in an amateur production.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the Yale School of Drama _ she was expelled for
staging a personal sit-in to show her opposition to building stage
scenery _ Von Scherler made her professional debut at the Cherry
Lane Theater in 1956, in George Bernard Shaw's ``Admirable
Bashville.'' It was the first in a nearly unbroken string of plays
over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among her roles were Brown in Eugene O'Neill's ``Great God
Brown'' in 1959, Olivia in Joseph Papp's 1969 production of
``Twelfth Night'' in Central Park, and Avonia Bunn in three
separate productions of ``Trelawney of the Wells.'' She helped
support her acting habit by appearing in several soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not Von Scherler, a woman with large, twinkling
eyes and a merry laugh, played supporting roles, often stealing
scenes. In a 1971 review of ``Trelawney,'' Walter Kerr of The Times
wrote that ``Von Scherler was rather like a fine painting propped
in one corner; the rest of the room might be filled with attractive
objects and engaging people, but your eye kept wandering back to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Von Scherler earned a master's degree in
social work and became a therapist and counselor; she worked for
more than 10 years at an AIDS treatment center in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she appeared in ``Party Girl,'' a film written and
directed by her daughter, Daisy Von Scherler Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Daisy and Ruth Mayer, both of Brooklyn, she is
survived by her husband, Paul Avila Mayer, and another daughter,
Rachael, of Glen Ridge, N.J.; and three grandchildren.

EDWARD KEEFER, A SURGEON, IS DEAD AT 84 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Edward B.C. Keefer, a surgeon who set up the
first transplant bank for human blood vessels and was the first to
fit a horse with an artificial leg, died on April 3 at his home in
Brookville, N.Y. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, establishing a forerunner of today's organ banks,
Keefer set up a bank of arteries taken from donors at their time of
death for transplant into patients who needed them. He and other
doctors had previously devised a procedure to graft arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant bank was no longer needed after medical
scientists learned how to make artificial blood vessels from
Dacron.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring to his horse farm, Faux Pas Farm, in Brookville,
Nassau County, Keefer ventured into a new field, saving injured
thoroughbred horses that would have been destroyed. In 1973, this
interest led him to make an artificial leg for Spanish Riddle, a
stablemate of Secretariat. The horse was a successful stud stallion
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   To push his mission of saving horses, he set up a foundation
called the Equine Preservation Society. An article in Thoroughbred
Times called him ``Racing's Miracle Worker.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the blood vessel bank, the foundation and its mission
faded into obsolescence as techniques invented by Keefer came into
widespread use by veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Boyd Coltrin Keefer was born on Feb. 13, 1916, in
Biltmore, N.C., where his father, a flier in the Canadian Air
Force, was training. The family returned to the Toronto area, where
Keefer studied at Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario. He
graduated from McGill University's medical school in Montreal and
was an intern at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. During
World War II, he served with the Canadian merchant marine and the
Canadian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Elizabeth Grimley, during the year she spent at
McGill before going to Massachusetts to transfer to Wellesley
College, from which she graduated. They settled in Fresh Meadows,
N.Y., when Keefer accepted a surgical position with Cornell, which
was affiliated with New York Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They bought their house in Brookville in 1952 from the master of
the hounds at the Meadow Brook Fox Hounds, a hunt club. The master
offered Keefer a chance to don a red jacket and chase foxes with
the club if he would attend to the medical needs of riders who
fell. Though he had never been a rider, he jumped at the chance and
enjoyed the hunting ritual immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Keefer was told that one of the club's horses had cancer of the
anal gland and was going to be destroyed. He studied equine anatomy
in a book and found that it was fairly similar to human anatomy. He
removed the cancer, and the horse lived for three years until the
cancer recurred and spread.
</P>
<P>
   Keefer continued to work with horses over the years, assisting
any way he could. In his spare time away from New York Hospital, he
began to work on tendon repair with Dr. Bud Wright, a veterinarian
at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Wright had his assistant call Keefer and ask if he
could offer any assistance on Hoist the Flag, a top 2-year-old in
1970. He had injured himself so severely in a fall that the
insurance company had already announced that he would be put down
that afternoon. Keefer was part of the team that saved him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Keefer was called to aid Spanish Riddle, a 4-year-old
with torn tendons and ligaments and broken bones in a lower leg. As
gangrene set in, the hoof fell off.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1973, the same day Spanish Riddle's stablemate,
Secretariat, won his last race, the Canadian International
Championship Stakes, Keefer amputated Spanish Riddle's leg just
above the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never devised an artificial leg before,'' Keefer said in
an interview in Thoroughbred Times. ``I went to a guy who built
them at the Hospital for Special Surgery, who happened to be an
amputee himself. He was a great help to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also went to see a blacksmith. You can't use a human
prosthesis because the kind of plastic they use wouldn't support a
horse. I picked everybody's brain. The blacksmith taught me how to
weld, and I wound up constructing the artificial leg right here at
home. It was basically made of leather with a steel brace. I didn't
know if it would work or not. I just hoped to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months after the surgery, Spanish Riddle was sent
to the Virginia Stallion Station to begin stud duties. Not only was
he the first horse with an artificial leg, but he became a
successful sire. His daughter, Love Sign, earned $934,827 in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this animal's tremendous courage and
intelligence,'' Keefer said in Newsday in 1985, ``he deserves most
of the credit. I saw this horse gallop on an artificial leg. He was
awkward, but he could gallop. That was a thrill, a great reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefer went on to save around a dozen more horses, but in 1975
was unable to save Ruffian, one of the most successful fillies in
racing. Her bones were shattered like glass from a fall, but Keefer
fitted her with an experimental brace; a blacksmith then anchored
it by nailing a shoe to Ruffian's foot.
</P>
<P>
   In the recovery room, the horse began jerking violently as she
came out of anesthesia. She cast aside the men trying to hold her
like so many rag dolls, dislodging the cast and loosening the shoe.
Veterinarians knew her shocked system could not tolerate the
anesthesia required for another operation.
</P>
<P>
   Keefer marveled at her spirit. ``She thought she was still
galloping in the race,'' he said. ``She kept trying to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefer was a large, robust man who windsurfed on Oyster Bay,
played polo with the Meadow Brook Polo Club and designed and
closely supervised the building of his barn. ``He did things other
people said you can't do,'' his wife said. ``He thought he could do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by a son, Edward Jr. of Washington; two
daughters, Elizabeth Jane Keefer, of New York, and Judith Burtis,
of Brooklyn, N.Y.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his mares, descendants of horses he saved, are in
foal this spring.

KNICKS PICK A BAD TIME TO PLAY THEIR WORST
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Although the dazed Allan Houston has spent the last
week groping for inspiration, he is only a symptom of the
unsettling mental slide the Knicks have found themselves in as they
prepare for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the meaningful minutes of the game, Houston was in another
world again Saturday night, right along with his cloud-covered
teammates, as the Knicks were embarrassed for the second time in 24
hours. This time, it wasn't the playoff-bound Raptors, but the
struggling Cavaliers who tucked them away with disturbing ease,
106-96, at Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, down by 19 points in the third quarter, pulled to 10
at the start of the fourth only to have their sloppy perimeter
defense eaten alive by the Cavs' 3-point shooting during a 16-6
run. Cleveland built a 20-point lead with 5 minutes 21 seconds left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, Houston (5 for 15, 21 points) was
not into the game on offense or defense. And his partners, Latrell
Sprewell (15 points) and Patrick Ewing (10 points), were absent in
spirit as well. The Cavs looked more like playoff contenders, with
six players scoring in double figures. They hit 9 for 19 on their
3-point shots and shot 47 percent. Somehow, the Knicks' sense of
urgency has been dulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally unlike last year when we getting more intense and
more urgent and more desperate,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said before
the game. ``We're less of everything because we're in the playoffs
this year. Instead of heading toward playing our best, you can make
the case that in our last few games, we have been at our worst.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an untimely lapse for the Knicks. Their chances of
catching the sliding Heat _ who have lost three in a row _ are
fading. The Knicks are one-and-a-half games behind the
second-seeded Heat. To catch them, the Knicks would have to win
their last two games, while the Heat would have to lose their three
remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, the Knicks have collapsed in the fourth
quarter against Miami, received a fortunate no-call on a goaltend
by Patrick Ewing to edge Indiana, played their worst ball of the
year in an overtime victory against the depleted Nets and were
embarrassed against the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   It has infuriated their coach. But perhaps the Knicks are numb
to Van Gundy's rants of urgency. After coming undone in Toronto
against a team they may well meet in the first round of the
playoffs, there was an odd giddiness in their locker room before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a prelude to their carefree attitude once
the game began. In one telling snapshot, the Knicks allowed Bob
Sura to sprint free on a fast break for an uncontested layup to
close the first quarter with the Knicks down, 31-22.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Sprewell stared vacantly as Lamond Murray took him
off the dribble for 8 first-quarter points. On offense, Houston was
smartly driving to the basket, but he was going in blindly and
taking ill-advised circus shots. He ended the half shooting 1 for
9.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Marcus Camby, who scored 13 first-half points and
grabbed 7 rebounds off the bench, the Knicks would have had no
chance at all. As it was, they trailed by 59-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of putbacks for dunks and trips to the free-throw
line, Camby brought them back to within 9 points with 1 minute left
in the first half. But quickly, the Knicks lost their composure.
When Ewing picked up his third foul, Childs barked at the officials
and drew a technical. Instead of closing in on the Cavaliers, the
Knicks let them end the second quarter on a 5-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs were moving the ball and playing unselfishly with 21
assists, while the Knicks (10 assists) were holding the ball too
long and taking jumpers at the shot-clock buzzer. Cavs point guard
Andre Miller was breaking down Charlie Ward and getting the ball to
the open man, while the Knicks were tripping over each other and
shooting 34.3 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the Knicks were far from inspired. Playing on the
second night of a back-to-back game, the 37-year-old Ewing was
dragging, and Houston and Sprewell closed the first half a combined
3 for 13 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Shawn Kemp in foul trouble, the Knicks couldn't
capitalize. In the third quarter, Kemp picked up his fourth foul
and went to the bench. After the Knicks closed to 67-57, they
failed to score on their next four possessions and let the Cavs
take a 74-57 lead with 4:51 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' weariness was magnified after Houston made just his
second basket of the game with 2:50 left in the period. The Cavs
pushed the ball up the floor and caught Ewing on his heels as
Andrew DeClercq streaked in for a fast-break dunk. Ewing was 20
feet behind. After they fell back by 19 points, the Knicks closed
the third down by 85-70.
</P>
<P>
   It was misery for Van Gundy to witness. All the progress the
Knicks made on their West Coast trip two weeks ago was slipping
away.

By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT -- The previous record for the fastest six goals to
start a playoff game also involved the Red Wings back on April 7,
1988 again st Toronto. The teams did it in 10:22 of play, more than
three minutes longer than it took the Kings and Wings to do it
(6:56) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit won that game, too, 6-2, against Maple Leafs goaltender
Ken Wregget, who now is the Red Wings backup.
</P>
<P>
   It was far different from Game 1 Thursday night when the Red
Wings' 2-0 victory included an empty net goal by Sergei Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams often feel each other out in the first game of a
series,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said. ``But there can be
surprises too. I remember a playoff series between Montreal and
Chicago that had Ken Dryden and Tony Esposito. You can't do any
better than that, but the game ended 9-7.''
</P>
<P>
   /
</P>
<P>
   The Kings and Wings combined for seven goals in the first period
Saturday. The last time two teams did that in a playoff period was
May 20, 1997 in the Eastern Conference between Philadelphia and the
New York Rangers. The Flyers won the period 4-3 and the game 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   No stopping Lapointe: Saturday marked the first playoff
three-goal game of Martin Lapointe's six-year NHL career. He had
his first regular-season hat trick just two weeks ago against the
New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray said after Thursday's low scoring Game 1
that the scrappy Lapointe might have been the best Red Wing on the
ice. Saturday, that diligence resulted in goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to get open and work hard in the corners,''
Lapointe said. ``I make sure every time I get a chance, I bear down
and make sure to get a shot on net.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg for Game 3? Kings defenseman Aki Berg is not playing and
he's not very happy. But at age 23, he knows his time will come,
maybe Monday night when the series moves to Los Angeles. Rookie
Jere Ka ralahti had a difficult first period Saturday and played
sparingly after whiffing on a puck that Lapointe turned into the
Wings' second goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough to watch, no question, but that is a coach's
decision,'' Berg said. ``I have nothing to say about (Saturday's)
game. I am just staying ready for my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick Whistles: The last time teams scored 13 goals in a game,
it actually was 15, April 29, 1993 when the Kings beat Calgary 9-6.
The record is 18, set April 7, 1982 when the Kings beat Edmonton 1
0-8. Two games later the Kings won the Miracle on Manchester and
went on to win the series in five games. .... Saturday, the two
teams had six g oals after 19 shots. Thursday, they had none after
16. ... The Kings imm ediately flew back to Los Angeles and will
practice this afternoon at th eir training facility in El Segundo.

DE FERRAN WANTS NO SUSPENSE
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Gil de Ferran cares about all you folks who are
putting out good money to secure a seat for today's 26th running of
the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, and readily admits, that the size of the crowd helps
turn the Long Beach race into one of the most popular stops for the
drivers on the CART FedEx Championship Series. And he would love
for the fans to see an exciting event. Just not today.
</P>
<P>
   De Ferran, a 32-year-old Brazilian born in Paris, hopes that the
most excitement of the weekend came on Saturday when he wrested the
pole position away from Target/Chip Ganassi Racing teammates Jimmy
Vasser and Juan Montoya in the closing minutes of a final and
frantic 30-minute qualifying session on the 11-turn, 1.968-mile
street circuit.
</P>
<P>
   De Ferran was the fifth and final leader in the final five
minutes of the session, which included the quickest drivers from
Friday's provisional qualifying. His best-lap time of 67.494
seconds at 104.969 miles per hour was just enough to hold off
Vasser (67.703 at 104.645 mph), Montoya (67.984 at 104.213 mph),
provisional pole sitter Adrian Fernandez (68.007 at 104.178),
Walker racing sub Bryan Herta (68.012 at 104.170) and
Miami-Homestead winner Max Papis (68.086 at 104.057).
</P>
<P>
   Today's 82-lap, 161.376-mile race begins at 1 p.m. This will be
the first time a Marlboro Team Penske driver starts on the pole
since Paul Tracy did it in 1997 at the oval in Milwaukee and the
first street-course pole for Penske since Al Unser Jr. was there in
1994 at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'm going to disappear into the lead and make this
the most boring race in the history of Long Beach,'' de Ferran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, sitting on de Ferran's right, had his own hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, just like in '96 when you disappeared in my (rear-view)
mirror,'' Vasser said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   De Ferran countered with a smile, albeit one with a twinge of
sadness, at the memory of a not-so-fond Long Beach memory when he
started on the pole and led 90 laps of the 104-lap race until a
disconnected turbocharger ended his day four laps shy of victory.
When de Ferran encountered his trouble, Vasser sped by en route to
the first of four consecutive Long Beach victories for Team Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remind me,'' de Ferran told Vasser, ``it took me two
years to forget about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since Marlboro Team Penske, once
the most feared on the circuit, has won a race. Since the final
race of 1999 season, Roger Penske made changes in personnel,
including bringing in de Ferran and Helio Castro-Neves to drive,
and switched from Mercedes-powered Penske cars with Goodyear tires
to the Honda- powered Reynards with Firestone rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which is stuck on 99 Champ Car victories, has been
excellent in qualifying thus far. De Ferran was also on the pole in
the season-opener and Miami and Castro-Neves was slated to start
third in the snow-postponed Nazareth race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we did our homework and everything, but it's really
nice to get it confirmed,'' de Ferran said.
</P>
<P>
   Team Target, which has won four consecutive points
championships, has also adapted quickly to its changes during the
off-season. The biggest change, of course, was the switch from the
proven Honda/Reynard package to a Toyota/Lola setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great group of people on the race team,'' Vasser
said. ``That gives us a lot of confidence. But you've got to give
Chip Ganassi credit because he made some pretty bold decisions on
the chassis and engine that don't seem so ludicrous right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, the defending series and Long Beach champion, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how (Ganassi) does it, but he does,'' Montoya
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez improved on his provisional pole effort, but it wasn't
good enough to hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (car) was better today than yesterday, but for some reason
we couldn't get the most out of (it),'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the happiest driver in the first three rows, aside from
de Ferran, is Herta, who was hired early this week to replace
injured Shinji Nakano at Walker Racing for two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made the car better every session and we're all still
getting to know one another,'' Herta said. ``Gil's time was pretty
good, but I think we were just one or two runs away from being
right there with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Team Rahal's Kenny Brack, who was
on the pole after the first session on Saturday, Roberto Moreno,
Helio Castro-Neves and Player's Forsythe Racing sub Memo Gidley.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, making his first street-course start in three years, made
the biggest move of the day, improving from 21st to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Franchitti, last year's runnerup, will start in 19th after
another tough qualifying effort. He broke the right front tire of
his car on Turn 4 just four minutes into his session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there and was trying a bit too hard on my first
lap,'' Franchitti said. ``I'll be (mad) for a while, but you've got
to get on with it. You need to start thinking about our strategy
for passing in the race.''

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ABOUT BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson asked for contract extensions
earlier this season, requests that went nowhere. Donnie Walsh was
candid and honest with the two proud Indiana veterans, but Miller
and Jackson viewed the wait-and-see approach of Walsh, the Pacers'
president, as genuine disrespect for their longevity and loyalty to
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for the guys who brought us to this
level,'' Walsh said last week in an interview at Madison Square
Garden. ``I like every one of them. I don't like this year because
I feel estranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're angry at me; I'm not angry at them. It's never been
like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Eastern Conference getting younger and more athletic
each off-season, Walsh, like many executives, wondered if an aging
team like the Pacers could keep up with the nouveau Knicks, the
Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors. With six of his top
eight players eligible for free agency, the notion of detonating
the roster in the off-season was a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sign up a bunch of guys and then the team
goes down and you're stuck,'' Walsh acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Pacers decide to rebuild will ultimately be decided
over the next few weeks as they try to parlay another impressive
regular season into their first appearance in the National
Basketball Association finals. Yet by essentially sewing up
home-court advantage in the East with a huge victory in Miami on
Friday night, the Pacers moved closer to buying themselves another
season together.
</P>
<P>
   While the Heat wilted amid turmoil _ Pat Riley blasted his team
for back-to-back losses, saying the Heat quit on Wednesday night,
and Alonzo Mourning overslept and showed up late for Friday's
shoot-around and did not start that night's game _ the Pacers were
poised and purposeful.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has firmly committed to re-signing only Jalen Rose,
saying, ``I only know one thing: we want him.'' In shaping the team
next season, Walsh added, ``How we play makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But the acrimony between the organization and Miller and Jackson
may cease soon.
</P>
<P>
   Like Patrick Ewing, they appear to have a lot of game left.
Miller dropped in 26 points in the victory over the Heat, making 9
of 12 shots and all three 3-pointers he took. Jackson played
maestro as well as ever, keeping the Pacers in the game early with
a first-quarter offensive binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to show them the way I felt about them the last
time,'' Walsh said of the multiyear deals he gave Miller and
Jackson. ``I've had, without a doubt, the best guys in the league
over the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   They will most likely not be around another five years. But like
the Knicks of the mid-1990s, the Pacers appear to have at least
another run left.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Sides on Knight
</P>
<P>
   The league's coaching fraternity is one of those tight-knit
societies that usually airs its grievances privately, if at all.
Sure, the coaches occasionally covet and secretly campaign for one
another's jobs. But for the most part, they commiserate with their
less-fortunate peers like Jim Todd, the Clippers' interim coach,
saying, ``He's in a tough situation'' or ``I hope they turn it
around for his sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Codes and lines were not only crossed last week; they were
obliterated. Blame it on Bobby Knight, the embattled Indiana
University coach.
</P>
<P>
   In an excerpt from his new book, Butch Carter, who played for
Knight at Indiana and now coaches the Toronto Raptors, contends
that Knight used a racial slur during an angry tirade against a
black player.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Knight deny the claim, but two more of his former
players, Cleveland Coach Randy Wittman and the Cavaliers assistant
Mike Woodson, took umbrage with Carter's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little shocked that it's in a book because I never heard
Knight use that word,'' Woodson said. ``This is a low blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittman, who is white and played with Carter for two years, said
he never heard Knight use a racial slur. ``That never took place in
the five years I was there,'' Wittman said. ``Obviously, you would
remember something like that. I'm sure he is using all this to try
and make a buck. The timing of it _ no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from Carter's book were published Friday in The
National Post of Toronto. The book is co-written by Carter's
brother Cris, a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's allegations come at a time when Knight faces a
university investigation over allegations that he assaulted a
former player, Neil Reed, who said the coach choked him during a
1997 practice.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas, the former Raptors owner and general manager, who
led the Hoosiers to the 1981 national title, also came to Knight's
defense. ``I never heard coach ever use that word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter barely responded to the criticism from his peers on
Friday night, letting his published work speak for him. But he did
say that as long as people are taking sides on the Knight issue,
``the private will all become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Carter wasn't speaking about long-held resentments
between people in his own profession, you wonder if this little
break in the dike will widen.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's Last Stand
</P>
<P>
   No playoff seeding is at stake. No national cable-television
audience is scheduled to view the game. By most accounts, the
Rockets-Grizzlies game on Wednesday night in Houston appears to be
a drab affair between two lottery-bound teams.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you factor in the return of Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Chucky is back _ in all his verbose splendor. And this time
when he says he is done, he means it. Honest. He promises.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who ruptured a tendon in his left leg in December, said
he planned to play against Vancouver. He announced that he would
retire at the end of this season when he was hurt in a Dec. 8 game
against Philadelphia. Yet within weeks, he decided he wanted
desperately to end his career by walking off the floor at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing a couple of minutes and leaving
the court under my own terms,'' he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Barkley appears to miss the attention that came
with a brilliant and bombastic All-Star career, one in which he won
the most valuable player award in 1993 and carved out a niche
during the league's meteoric rise in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a few minutes against Vancouver almost seems
self-congratulatory, a staged event that is beneath one of the
NBA's top 50 players ever.
</P>
<P>
   But then you remember Barkley's career, and you realize he was
all about playing to the crowd, entertaining the masses and taking
everyone along for the ride. Once a young knucklehead, he became a
blueprint for what happens when a player grows up and realizes what
is important in his career.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, here's hoping he treasures his last night in a
uniform, that Sir Charles is afforded royal treatment for all the
human majesty he displayed the past 16 years. &QL;

   (For release Sunday, April 23)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ENGLAND, ENGLAND &LR;  By Julian Barnes. Vintage International, $13.
In the near future, a tycoon creates a Disney-fied Britain on the
Isle of Wight, where tourists find replicas of the best the nation
has to offer, from bowler hats to a half-size Buckingham Palace
(inhabited by the real king, who abandons the royal family for a
virtual throne). Last year in The New York Times Book Review,
Richard Eder called this an uneven but ``smart and accomplished''
satirical novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VISIONS OF JAZZ: The First Century &LR;  By Gary Giddins. Oxford
University, $18.95. This sweeping compilation of 79 essays, many of
which appeared in The Village Voice, celebrates an American art
form, profiling luminaries from W.C. Handy to Cassandra Wilson and
tracing the music back to its roots in 19th-century minstrelsy.
``Giddins is our best jazz critic'' and ```Visions of Jazz' is the
finest unconventional history of jazz ever written _ a brilliant,
indispensable book,'' Alfred Appel Jr. wrote in The New York Times
Book Review in 1998. ``Giddins has `big ears,' as jazz musicians
used to say, and his jazz vision, his tireless listening habits,
are in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Giddins' first collection of essays,  &UR; RIDING ON A BLUE NOTE:
Jazz and American Pop &LR;  (Da Capo, $16), explores both popular music
and jazz; among its highlights is an incisive account of the
musical and criminal career of the gifted trumpeter Red Rodney. In
1981 the reviewer Robert Palmer said Giddins is ``particularly
scrupulous in his evenhanded appreciation of jazz from every
period.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JACKSTRAWS: Poems &LR;  By Charles Simic. Harvest/Harcourt, $13.
Several poems in this collection explore the moral and
eschatological dimensions of insect life. ``Simic is a master at
interrogating ordinary occurrences with piercing yet slightly
tongue-in-cheek observations,'' Albert Mobilio wrote in 1999. He
``snatches profundities from the air around him, like so many flies
to some wanton boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the verse in  &UR; ALL OF US: The Collected Poems &LR; , by
Raymond Carver (Vintage Contemporaries, $14), was written in the
1980s, during the final decade of Carver's life, and reflects his
desire to blur the lines between poetry and prose. The poems
capture ``much of the same pared narrative power that
distinguishes'' his short fiction, David Yezzi wrote in 1998.
``Their willed artlessness and unflinching emotions commend them to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIRLS ON THE RUN: A Poem &LR; , by John Ashbery (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $12), is an elusive, splintered tale based on a band of
cartoonish characters from a surreal illustrated novel by the
artist Henry Darger (1892-1972). The result is ``a tank of literary
laughing gas that exhilarates and confounds in roughly equal
measure,'' David Kirby wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ON THE BUS WITH ROSA PARKS: Poems &LR; , by Rita Dove (Norton,
$11), a former poet laureate of the United States reflects on Rosa
Parks and other civil rights figures, and on public history vs.
private. ``The poet's eye and voice, trained for the nearly
invisible detail, rescue characters from obscurity by illuminating
their ordinariness,'' Matthew Flamm wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CORRUPTION OF AMERICAN POLITICS: What Went Wrong and Why &LR; 
By Elizabeth Drew. Overlook, $15.95. A respected chronicler of the
Washington scene examines the campaign finance system and shows how
both parties have a vested interest in torpedoing efforts at
reform. ``She nimbly brings to life the machinations on Capitol
Hill and the White House with fresh perspective, behind-the-scenes
detail and convincing analysis,'' Richard L. Berke wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GOLFER'S LIFE &LR;  By Arnold Palmer with James Dodson.
Ballantine, $15. This autobiography by one of golf's most endearing
figures is as unpretentious as its subject and ``yields interesting
and unexpected stories about Palmer's mistakes, disappointments and
personal failings,'' Michael Bamberger wrote in 1999. ``Palmer has
led a rich and singular life and has captured it in a wonderful
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DRINK: A Social History of America &LR;  By Andrew Barr. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $16. A British journalist offers both an impressionistic
history and a polemic intended to shake up American attitudes and
assumptions about alcohol use. ``His book is at once well
intentioned and scornful, earnest and breezy, consequential and
frivolous,'' Patricia Nelson Limerick wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LORDS OF THE HORIZONS: A History of the Ottoman Empire &LR;  By
Jason Goodwin. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15. A travel writer and
journalist traces the rise and fall of a former imperial power,
from its modest beginnings in the 14th century to its stagnation
and collapse in the 20th century. Last year the reviewer Fouad
Ajami called this ``a work of dazzling beauty'' that blends
``historical scholarship and curiosity about distant places with
luminous writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY THE SHORE &LR;  By Galaxy Craze. Grove, $12. The 12-year-old
narrator of this first novel describes growing up with her single
mother in a small English village, and what happens when her
playboy father reappears at an awkward moment in their lives.
``Craze's skill is in seeing so clearly through a vulnerable
child's eyes,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1999. ``Snippets of dialogue tell a lifetime of
stories.''
