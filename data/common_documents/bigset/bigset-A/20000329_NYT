LUCK RUNS OUT FOR TORNADO-STRICKEN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tornado experts always envied Tarrant
County's ``dumb luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your luck has run out,'' meteorologist Harold Brooks said
Tuesday night from Norman, Okla., home of the National Severe
Storms Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that, in the early 19th century, American Indians
camped in between two Trinity River forks because they believed no
tornado would strike the river delta. In 1849, the U.S. Army built
the original Fort Worth atop the overlooking bluff across the Clear
Fork.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 150 years, Fort Worth was a scientific anomaly _
the only major American city without a single tornado fatality,
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legends are just that: legends,'' Brooks said. ``This could
happen again next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's safety _ and complacency _ has been discussed by
storm experts, Brooks said. Residents of Emporia, Kan., also
believed they were protected until a 1974 tornado killed six.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, experts at the Norman center plotted possible damage
from a head-on tornado strike in downtown Fort Worth as part of an
areawide study for the North Central Texas Council of Governments.
The study projected a mile-wide tornado like the one that struck
Moore, Okla., last year. It foresaw the possibility of as many as
300 fatalities and 21,000 demolished structures valued at $2.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that would be a wakeup call,'' Brooks said. ``The
entire Metroplex has a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a tornado striking the Texas Motor Speedway
is a serious concern at the storm center, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race there, the Kentucky Derby, the Indianapolis 500 _
they're all events with a tremendous number of people at the height
of tornado season,'' he said. Speedway officials have said the
arena has an elaborate weather forecast center, but Brooks said
forecasters worry whether it could be evacuated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   After the Storms Laboratory study was released, Fort Worth City
Council member Clyde Picht immediately repeated his call for a $2
million warning siren system. Council members have discussed the
system twice but did not include it in the 1998 or 1999 budgets; it
was excluded in favor of a less expensive public education
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Storms Laboratory forecasters believe cities need both education
and sirens, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sirens have been shown to be very effective where people are
outdoors and simply in drawing public interest,'' he said. ``You
hear a siren, you call your sister.'' Education campaigns are very
effective for schoolchildren, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current Fort Worth sirens are an expanded version of the
Civil Defense system installed in 1956 to warn a city of defense
factories of a Russian attack.

DEADLY TORNADO DEVELOPED SUDDENLY, WEATHER SERVICE SPOKESMAN SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Radar images show the tornado that struck
downtown Fort Worth on Tuesday developed suddenly northwest of the
city center, said Skip Ely, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it a little southwest of Meacham (Airport) when we
issued the tornado warning. ... It was in the Sansom Park or River
Oaks area, and then it headed toward downtown as it curved kind of
eastward,'' Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   He said local weather service forecasters were unable to judge
the intensity of the storm Tuesday. ``We won't fully know until we
can survey it. It could vary widely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ely said zigging and zagging is common for this type of tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move. They change shape. They almost breathe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After striking the Cash America Pawn building at West Seventh
Street and the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, it appeared to head
east, zigzagging between Third and Sixth Streets with a little less
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Ely said forecasters' instruments showed that the twister
appeared to break up in the vicinity of North Riverside Drive or
North Beach Street along Interstate 30 southeast of downtown, but
that it was quickly replaced by a separate but related tornado that
swept through southwest Arlington east of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Arlington storm likely developed in the area of
Collins Street and I-30. It moved to the southeast where it was
tracked toward DeSoto, Lancaster and Wilmer.
</P>
<P>
   Ely said power outages were reported along that track.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ely said, tornadoes were reported in Lampasas,
Hamilton and Cooke County.
</P>
<P>
   Ely said Tuesday's twister was what forecasters call a ``cyclic
storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that a tornado develops and dissipates, and another
tornado develops and dissipates nearby, and sometimes the process
will go on four or five times.''
</P>
<P>
   A tornado is a balance between downdrafts and updrafts, he said.
Sometimes, a downdraft will wrap around the updraft and choke off
the supply of warm, moist air, which causes that tornado to weaken
and dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the parent air circulation aloft in the middle to upper
levels of the storm remains, and a new tornado sometimes develops
in the new updraft of the storm complex,'' he said. The new tornado
frequently moves east or southeast of the first tornado.

POUGHKEEPSIE STUDENTS TRY TO SHAPE CITY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mass., Pa., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Within a few miles of this tough Hudson
River city are two elite colleges, a renowned cooking school, a
college with a nationally watched political polling center and two
state undergraduate institutions. Yet the thousands of students at
these campuses seldom venture past the gates to mingle with their
city neighbors, who often struggle with poverty, homelessness and
the city's faltering attempts at urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But 27 students from the six schools _ Vassar, Bard, Marist,
Dutchess County Community College, the State University of New York
at New Paltz and the Culinary Institute of America _ are involved
in an unusual cross-campus class that uses the city as a laboratory
and whose findings the city, by legislative fiat, must examine.
</P>
<P>
   Several evenings a week, Catherine Schloegel, a senior at Vassar
who describes herself as a typical, ``innocent-looking college
kid,'' waits at the bus stop where homeless men pick up a shuttle
to the county shelter. There, she and Terri-Ann Sweet, a student at
Dutchess County Community, speak to as many men as will allow them
an interview. The results of their work will be included in a
report to the city on the realities and causes of Poughkeepsie's
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night people were like, `You're never going to
understand what it's like to be homeless,''' Schloegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Schloegel, of Boulder, Colo., hung on long enough to watch one
of her subjects, a man who had been homeless for 17 years, find a
job and a place to live. The experience has changed her so much
that she plans to remain in Poughkeepsie after graduation and work
in education.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the program, known as the Poughkeepsie Institute,
tackles an issue important to Poughkeepsie, offering research and
an academic perspective with the hopes of affecting government
policy. Last year, the subjects were race and ethnicity. Previous
classes have focused on mass transportation and welfare. Students
from the Culinary Institute, whose schedule does not mesh with
those of the other colleges, serve meals to the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   While the Poughkeepsie Institute's impact has thus far been
small, last year's class on race and ethnicity increased awareness
of issues surrounding the surging Mexican population and was a
factor in prodding the city's Common Council to hold an annual
Cinco de Mayo festival for Hispanic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the issues could be explored through conventional
lectures and books, but the real-life fieldwork, students and
college officials say, has been invaluable. ``The question for
undergraduates is how do you connect theory and practice,'' said
Leon Botstein, president of Bard College. When looking at these
issues by working in the field, he said, students ``leave the realm
of cliched generalizations immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   While unusual in that it involves a group of colleges, the
Poughkeepsie initiative is not unique. Colleges around the country
have abandoned a fortress-like, town-gown isolation and are finding
a variety of ways, from anthropological and sociological study to
outright redevelopment, of building bridges to their host
communities.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the real-world problem-solving is valued by
career-minded students; another is that campuses want to make their
host cities as attractive as possible to prospective recruits.
Harvard is building low-cost housing in Cambridge, the University
of Pennsylvania has helped rebuild parts of West Philadelphia and
the president of Connecticut College is chairwoman of the New
London, Conn., development authority.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Leonard, chairman of the institute and a Vassar College
faculty member, believes Poughkeepsie's comparatively small size
(population: 29,000) makes it an ideal place for such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's small enough that you can become a player on any issue
and big enough to have all the problems and all the promise of a
major American city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Poughkeepsie, the governing powers welcome the help. Both
Mayor Colette Lafuente and the chairman of the city's Common
Council, Thomas O'Neill, are institute board members. O'Neill said
in his annual address that he hoped to use the students'
information ``as a cornerstone of any meaningful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Thomas, 22, a biology major at Dutchess County Community
College, spends much of her time videotaping interviews with
homeless men and women and has learned just how simplistic her
previous notions about homelessness were.
</P>
<P>
   At the Living Room, a daytime center for the homeless run by the
Mental Health Association of Dutchess County, Thomas leaned
forward, her hand on her chin, as she asked Trudy Dillard, 35,
about her trips in and out of prison; questioned Nancy Reyes, 32,
about the children who were taken away from her, and asked
25-year-old Carmen McClaurin about a life of physical abuse and the
time she spent in jail for stabbing her boyfriend in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you become homeless?'' she asked, filming every
minute. ``Were you abused as a child? What would turn things around
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   The video will be presented to the city's Common Council at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your story touched me,'' Thomas told McClaurin. ``For so many
women, this is the real issue, domestic abuse, and homelessness is
just the end of a long cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   McClaurin nodded and then hugged her interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're learning about us as people, who are out there on the
street,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the class, which is held in a community center in
downtown Poughkeepsie, is structured in traditional fashion, with
three hours of classes and required reading. Students work under a
team of teachers representing each college and a variety of
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a different way of learning,'' Schloegel said. ``I
think a traditional classroom experience is valuable, but so is
knowing where you live. In fact, I think it's more important to
understand the lives of people around us.''

FCC EXPECTED TO REJECT SBC'S LONG DISTANCE APPLICATION
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to thwart
efforts by SBC Communications to enter the $80 billion
long-distance telephone market early this year, according to people
close to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, these people have said that the FCC will almost
certainly reject SBC's application to offer long-distance service
in Texas, because the company has not provided sufficient evidence
that it has opened its local networks in the state to potential
competitors. The FCC probably will not announce a decision until
April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 says that the local telephone
carriers, which split from the former American Telephone and
Telegraph Company in 1984, must convince the FCC that they have
opened local networks to competitors on a state-by-state basis
before they will be allowed into the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Bell Atlantic has passed that test. Just before
Christmas, the FCC cleared the way for Bell Atlantic to sell
long-distance services to its customers in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling appeared to prompt long-distance giants like AT&AMP;T to
step up efforts to offer local service.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, senior SBC executives had hopes of
beating Bell Atlantic into the long-distance market, and many
analysts thought that if Bell Atlantic's application were approved
first, SBC's would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department, which advises the FCC on the
long-distance applications, has said that SBC, based in San
Antonio, has not opened its systems sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Since filing its original petition, SBC has amended the
application to include additional information. But the Justice
Department has not been convinced. Some analysts have said that
Bell Atlantic's successful application was so thorough that it set
a high standard for the other Bells to meet. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Florida portion of the Astros' preparation
for the upcoming season was rather uneventful, which is just the
way the club hoped it would be.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After last spring, when the Astros watched Moises Alou go down
with a knee injury, Ken Caminiti get hospitalized because of an
acute sinus infection and Doug Henry try to pitch through pain in
his elbow that eventually required surgery, no news is good news
this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The team will head back to Houston today for a tour of Enron
Field for the first time as a group. Their luck was so bad last
season, the Astros probably would have hesitated to take their
players to a construction site, but 1999 and 2000 have been hardly
similar in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camp ran smoothly,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
``We got a lot of work done, and we stayed away from serious
injuries. The goal is always to get through the spring without
having injuries factor into the composition of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   There still is one roster spot open, and it could very well come
down to Hunsicker's deciding whether to carry six outfielders _
with Glen Barker being the man on the bubble _ or three catchers.
The Astros want to find a way to keep catcher Mitch Meluskey, but
Paul Bako is out of options, and they don't want to expose him to
the waiver process, which they would be forced to do if they tried
to send him to Class AAA New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   One way of getting around that would be to trade Bako, but to do
that the Astros almost certainly would have to get a
major-league-caliber catcher in return, one who would be willing to
serve as a Class AAA insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Another trade possibility is to upgrade the bullpen with a
lefthanded specialist. It's also conceivable the Astros could trade
a reserve infielder, possibly Russ Johnson, to open a spot on the
roster for Tripp Cromer, or perhaps prospect Julio Lugo, because
the club does not have a true backup shortstop behind starter Tim
Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   So while there hasn't been much news out of the Astros' camp,
things could change. As per his normal policy, Hunsicker does not
discuss trade speculation involving specific players.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at how the Astros shape up in various areas:
</P>
<P>
   Infield
</P>
<P>
   It's loaded with veterans, which makes it reasonably easy to
predict performances. The Astros know what to expect from Jeff
Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Caminiti if they stay healthy. The only
question regarding Bogar is how he will respond to playing every
day. The fact he appeared much stronger this spring went a long way
toward easing those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield
</P>
<P>
   The most significant development was the shift of Alou from left
field to right field, which allows manager Larry Dierker the
flexibility of platooning Richard Hidalgo and Daryle Ward in left.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's only position in the outfield is left field, but Hidalgo
also could see action in center field, where Roger Cedeno is the
starter. Cedeno had some defensive lapses early in the spring but
has been much better lately, and the Astros are thrilled with the
way Alou has bounced back from major knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alou has been impressive from day one,'' Hunsicker said.
``Many times, veteran players sleepwalk through spring training,
but he worked hard and played a lot of innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting rotation
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt was the hard-luck pitcher in the Astros' rotation
last season when he was 5-13. But he has looked like a different
pitcher this spring, and it has more to do with his quality stuff
than it does luck. If Holt takes his game to the next level, he'll
go a long way toward helping the Astros compensate for the loss of
22-game winner Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Shane Reynolds nor Jose Lima was impressive, but their
track records speak for themselves. If they're healthy _ Reynolds
was bothered by two bulging disks in his back _ each is capable of
winning 16 to 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran righthander Dwight Gooden gave plenty of indications
there still is a lot left in his 35-year-old arm, but Octavio Dotel
got himself into trouble with control problems, one of the Astros'
concerns when camp began. He has walked 13 batters in 19 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation could get a boost in mid- to late April when Scott
Elarton is expected to be ready to join the big-league club.
Elarton is recovering from offseason rotator-cuff surgery and won't
start the season on time.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner's elbow was something of a concern when camp began,
but it almost has become a non-issue. Kid Heat has looked like his
old self. A return to form by Jay Powell also has the Astros
excited. Powell was a sinkerball pitcher without a reliable sinker
in 1999, but he appears to have rediscovered his signature pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera has earned the right to pitch in some setup
situations, and Henry's conversion from setup man to middle
reliever will give Dierker far more options than he had last
season, when his bullpen was basically a collection of one-inning
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Mike Maddux has enjoyed a strong spring, but lefthander
Trever Miller has struggled, which no doubt is one of the reasons
the Astros would like to have another lefty in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Bench
</P>
<P>
   This is where decisions still must be made. Super sub Bill
Spiers is the main man on the bench, and the outfield depth further
feeds the reserves. But the Astros must decide if they have more
need for a pinch runner/defensive replacement like Barker or a
third catcher, which would free up Tony Eusebio or Meluskey for
more pinch-hitting assignments, assuming Bako is on the team.

TIME TO PAY ATTENTION TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somehow the impression has been created that Los
Angeles sports fans pay scant attention to the Kings, that we have
no time in our busy schedules for the soccer-on-ice contrivance
known as hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Not true. In fact we might be able to squeeze in a couple of
minutes for hockey right now. Permit us to check our calendar to
make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Why, yes, it seems we've had a cancellation and are free at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Our college basketball team has been bounced out of the
tournament. Our pro basketball team is on cruise control until the
playoffs begin, our baseball team won't open its season until next
week, and our Arena League football team is still learning the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   As for soccer, we never did care for hockey on grass.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the golf and tennis tours have moved on to the next town,
the Academy Awards season is over and the presidential campaign is
in hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's a light week on the local sports and
entertainment schedule. So if the Kings want our attention, then
this is the week to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Which fits into the Kings' plans quite neatly. They have six
games left in the regular season, beginning tonight against the San
Jose Sharks at Staples Center. They're on the verge of clinching a
spot in the NHL playoffs, a formality for many teams but a sign of
progress for this one.
</P>
<P>
   They could make it dramatic and clinch that playoff spot
Saturday afternoon when they face their rivals, the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks, at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's nervous time at the HealthSouth Training Center, the Kings'
new practice facility in El Segundo.
</P>
<P>
   In the dressing room, head coach Andy Murray has been updating a
message board headlined ``The Situation.'' It shows the Western
Conference standings and makes the point that the Kings can't
expect to glide effortlessly into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They're fifth in the 13-team conference with a 36-30-10 record
and 86 points. The top eight make the postseason eliminations.
You'd think the situation is pretty safe for the Kings. But the
board shows that every team below them can still get 86 or more
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're worried about making the playoffs?'' someone asked
Murray after Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I think that's part of my job. I'd like my
players to worry about it too.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger worry might be what happens after they do make the
playoffs. If the season ended today, they'd have to face the
Detroit Red Wings (46-22-9) in the first round, and the Kings'
progress would likely be measured in a short step.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Kings will have their devotees no matter what
happens this week. The old joke was that the team drew the same
8,000 fans every night. The good news is that at least the number
is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is running about 16,400 a game in the first season in
Staples Center, up about 3,600 from last year. Sellouts are up too,
from five to 16 so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't worry about it,'' Murray said of the size of
the Kings' following. ``I think we have great fans. There are more
Kings jerseys (in the stands) at our games than (hometown jerseys)
in other cities. We just go about our business every day here. We
work hard for our fans, and anybody else who wants to jump on
board, you're welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, coming to the end of his first season as Kings coach,
said that until three weeks ago, he could gad about town fairly
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I get the odd person who says, `Aren't you the coach of
the Kings?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's an older gentleman who writes four-page letters to
Murray every week. Murray has kept them all. ``He has some good
suggestions,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a woman in Anaheim who regularly fires off faxes
addressed to ``Andy,'' although he doesn't recall having met her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get !ital!someone!off! in front of the net for the
rebounds. It's killing us!!!'' read such a fax last Wednesday,
after the Kings had lost three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up Sunday night, with the Kings on a three-game
unbeaten streak, reflected the new mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great! Great! road trip,'' it read. ``Loved to see the boys in
front of the net for the rebounds. Now back to the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   The faxes wore big initial R's and smiling faces.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Kings have been around long enough to remember the
brief time when Los Angeles was a hockey town wearing a smiling
face _ when Wayne Gretzky was here and the team went to the 1993
Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (fan excitement) comes with winning,'' said Luc Robitaille,
leading scorer on that team and this one.
</P>
<P>
   Going past the first round of the playoffs in 2000 would be a
nice way to begin reclaiming the Kings' lapsed fans. To do that,
they'll need to get injured Ziggy Palffy back and they'll have to
heat up one of their goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the Kings want to become brighter blips on the L.A. radar
screen, the answer is to make the playoffs for more than one year
in a row. They missed the playoffs in 1999 and in four of the five
seasons before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to earn your credibility,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a long process. But this is the week to start.

INCREASE IN NEW YORK MINIMUM WAGE MAY BE KEPT LOWER FOR SOME
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On Friday, the minimum wage will rise for New
York's lowest-paid workers, but lawmakers plan to prevent the
absolute lowest wage earners, restaurant and bar employees who earn
tips, from collecting the entire increase.
</P>
<P>
   Under a combination of federal and state laws, restaurants and
bars in New York can pay their workers as little as $2.90 an hour
if they also earn tips, a wage that has not changed in nine years.
On Friday, the minimum for some groups of workers will rise to
$5.15 an hour from $4.25, and the minimum for those who make tips
is slated to increase to $3.52 from $2.90.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats who control the Assembly, including Speaker
Sheldon Silver, want to set a new minimum for restaurant and bar
workers who earn tips at $3.30, not $3.52. Until last week, they
proposed freezing the wage at $2.90.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is expected to pass the bill on Wednesday or
Thursday, said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Silver. The
speaker's office declined to discuss the rationale for the bill.
The Republican-controlled state Senate has approved a bill freezing
the minimum for tipped workers at $2.90. Michael McKeon, a
spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said that the governor
supports the idea of setting the wage below $3.52, but that he
objects to some technical provisions of the Assembly bill.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits some of the Democrats' traditional
constituencies, low-wage workers and unions, against powerful
small-business lobbying groups. It also strikes a dissonant note at
a time when the economic talk is of stock options, dot-coms and
full employment _ a reminder that in the service economy, low wages
persist even in rosy times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make $200, $250 a week, with tips,'' said Fernando, a
Colombian immigrant who buses tables in a downtown Manhattan
restaurant, and asked that his surname not be used for fear he
would lose his job. ``I have a wife and two children. It's not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Donnelly, legislative director of the state AFL-CIO, said,
``To take the lowest-paid worker, a waitress in a greasy spoon, and
convene the best minds in the Capitol to rob her of a quarter, to
me is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   But restaurant owners insist that workers have done well in the
booming economy, with their income rising quickly through tips.
``We don't think those people need a statutorily authorized
62-cent-an-hour increase in pay,'' said Scott Wexler, executive
director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association,
which represents 5,000 small businesses. ``For our average member,
that would cost $15,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that among his group's members, employees who are paid
$2.90 an hour actually earn, on average, $10 an hour with tips. But
a 1997 survey by the state Department of Labor found that the
average income for waiters and waitresses was $6.34 an hour, with
tips. That survey found more than 150,000 people working in what
are typically tip-earning restaurant and bar jobs, but the
department could not say how many earn the $2.90 minimum today.
</P>
<P>
   The ``tipped wage'' varies enormously from state to state, and
New York's ranks 17th. The highest minimum is $6.50 in Washington
state, which does not differentiate between tip earners and others.
The lowest is $2.13, in several states, including New Jersey.
Connecticut's is $4.73.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law sets the minimum wage for most workers at $5.15, but
it allows states to set lower minimums for a few categories of
workers, like farm laborers and restaurant employees. (A handful of
states actually have higher minimums than the federal standard.)
New York state's minimum wage has stood at $4.25 an hour since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law also allows states to set even lower minimums for
workers who make tips. When New York raised its state minimum to
$4.25, the state Department of Labor set a $2.90 wage for people
like waiters, bartenders and busboys. Legally, the worker must earn
at least $4.25 an hour with tips, but employees' groups say that
rule is often flouted.
</P>
<P>
   In December, state lawmakers raised the minimum to $5.15 from
$4.25, effective March 31. Under a 1991 ruling by the state
Department of Labor, that would automatically raise the wage for
workers who make tips by the same percentage, to $3.52 from $2.90.
The current bills would overturn that rule.

AFTER HOUSE FIRE, A MAYOR REVISITS HIS NOMADIC PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREWSTER, N.Y. _ To hear John Cesar tell it, he has always been
one step away from homelessness. But a raging fire on Monday erased
that step, leaving Cesar, who at 82 is the oldest and possibly the
most unconventional mayor in the state, truly without a home.
</P>
<P>
   The one-room apartment that Cesar had called both home and
campaign headquarters was incinerated by a midafternoon fire that
is believed to have started in faulty electrical wiring. Cesar lost
everything but the stale clothes on his back, including his poetry,
the books he collected on history and European royalty, and the
first draft of his libretto for a political opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first was elected mayor in 1987, the paper said I was
almost homeless because I financed my campaign by collecting
bottles and cans,'' said Cesar, a onetime circus clown with a Santa
Claus beard and a chuckle to match. ``I'm really homeless now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar is in his third two-year term as mayor of Brewster, a
1-square-mile village of 1,800 people about 60 miles from Midtown
Manhattan. After his first term, it took him several years to win
again. In the interim he ran for other offices, including town
councilman and Putnam County executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran five times in 10 years and lost every time,'' Cesar said
Tuesday, recalling his political fights as he stood on the steps of
the Bagel Depot, a popular breakfast spot where a chair is named in
his honor and a jar asking for donations to help him contained $405
on Tuesday morning. ``I said, `You can beat me, but you are never
going to get rid of me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar was born in Bedford, in neighboring Westchester County, in
1918. ``That was the year Ronald Reagan was born, Babe Ruth, Billy
Graham and me,'' he said, putting himself in good, if not
historically accurate, company. (Reagan was born in 1911, and Ruth
in 1895.) He hitchhiked across the country in 1937 and grew to like
the hobo life, joining the circus so he could get a good hot meal,
he said. When he moved to Brewster in 1945, he started a trucking
company, opened a bar named the Poorhouse and raised a family.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity was evident Wednesday as he walked down Main
Street. Every few steps, he was approached by someone offering
help.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from the Animal Rescue thrift shop, where winter clothes
sell for $5 a bag, said she had put some shirts and pants aside for
him. The minister of the First United Methodist Church offered him
one of the six bedrooms in the parsonage. Others just stopped to
say they were sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar, who lived alone, and the three families who had shared
the rickety apartment building in an alley off Main Street were put
up at a motel by the local chapter of the Red Cross. Members of the
Elks, the Knights of Columbus and the Veterans of Foreign Wars
called Cesar at Village Hall to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   But Cesar, who earns $6,556 a year as part-time mayor, already
has plans for his next home. On a village street dotted with
magnolia trees, there is a trailer that he hopes to rent starting
next week.
</P>
<P>
   It is not fancy, but it is perfect for a man who raised $1,100
in campaign funds by recycling bottles and cans. He used most of
the money to make fliers and to buy paints and poster board to make
campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent $500 for a commercial and I was on TV for 30
seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His latest crusade is a fight for independence. Brewster is a
small, aging village within the booming town of Southeast (though
locals and outsiders alike refer to Southeast as Brewster). Cesar
has started a campaign to secede from Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started it,'' he said. ``They want our water. They want
our sewage. They want our railroad station. They even want our
name.''

CITY'S FIRST DEADLY TWISTER KILLS 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rampaging tornado, the first deadly twister in the city's
history, blasted downtown Fort Worth Tuesday evening, killing two
people and shattering skyscraper windows.
</P>
<P>
   A second twister smashed into south Arlington east of Fort Worth
about a half-hour later, leveling six homes and damaging as many as
100 others. No serious injuries were reported in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth emergency workers were searching late Tuesday for two
missing people whose car was found along the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is believed two people were in the car, and they haven't
been able to find them,'' said Lt. Kent Worley, the Fire Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Six other people were rescued from the river.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Larry McMillen said elsewhere there was ``some
concern that there are people trapped. There are people unaccounted
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were injured in Fort Worth, at least two
critically, as buildings were ripped apart and flying shards of
glass splayed downtown streets about 6:20 p.m., as many workers
headed home from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most seriously hurt was a man struck by a hailstone
that paramedics said was the size of a softball, said Dr. Michael
Hickey, a trauma surgeon at Harris Methodist Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire skull is fractured, so it'd have to take a
tremendous force,'' Hickey said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials closed the downtown area ``to make sure downtown
is safe before we allow people to return,'' Mayor Kenneth Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way in the dark to know what the situation is,''
Barr said. The area is expected to remain closed for part of
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it is ``somewhat a miracle'' that more people did
not suffer serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Mayor Elzie Odom declared a state of emergency
that granted police broad powers to limit access to the damaged
areas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Martin Frost of Dallas
offered Fort Worth federal assistance Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   TXU Electric &AMP; Gas had 30,000 customers without service in Fort
Worth and Arlington, a company spokeswoman said. The hardest hit
areas were downtown and north and west Fort Worth and south
Arlington, said spokeswoman Carol Peters.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth tornado tore its devastating swath along a
two-mile route stretching roughly from University Drive to just
east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Meterorologist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms
Laboratory in Norman, Okla., said the storm would probably reach an
intensity of F2 on the Fujita scale used to compare tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were the Mallick Tower on One Summit Avenue, the
Cash America building at 1600 W. Seventh St., the Bank One Tower
downtown, Tandy Center and the Calvary Cathedral, where all the
brick work of the steeple was ripped off, exposing steel beams.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen cars in the area were flipped over or tossed on
their sides.
</P>
<P>
   One of two homeless men who sought shelter under a porch of the
empty Burns Graphics Building, on West Seventh at the Trinity
River, was killed when a wall behind them collapsed. He was
identified as Carl Spence, 67.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's companion, John Barr, 70, was also buried under the
debris but was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell upon me and I was under a pile of bricks,'' Barr said.
``When I looked back, I saw it fell on him, too. When I got up and
got back to him, I realized he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The other dead man was identified as Howard D. Thornton, 52. He
was crushed by a truck trailer that flipped onto him behind the
landmark Montgomery Ward catalogue building on West Seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The area behind the 70-year-old building, which survived the
April 1949 floodwaters that reached the second floor, was a
shambles of crazily twisted truck trailers jammed against the
loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Thornton) was warning people back by the guard shack to
get down, get down, but the tornado caught up with him and he
didn't make it,'' said Frank Godoy, 26, a Montgomery Ward
maintenance worker from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of glass, chunks of metal and building panels continued
falling to the West Seventh Street pavement an hour after the
storm. Trees surrounding the building were bent and broken. Light
poles were crushed against trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it looks like we are all alive,'' said Jose Rico,
director of marketing for Cash America International, who had left
his seventh-floor office five minutes before the storm hit, got in
his car, then ``I ran back into the building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible. My office is gone. I haven't found my car
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the Fort Worth tornado, another twister
ravaged a southeast Arlington neighborhood. Several retail
businesses and a gas station were heavily damaged, roofs were
ripped off and buildings were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   About eight houses in the area sustained heavy damage, and 30
houses sustained minor damage. Another two dozen homes in the area
near Williams Elementary were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt like the oxygen got sucked out of the house, and
you could hear glass breaking and stuff flying around,'' said J.D.
Walker, who with his wife and 3-year-old twins covered themselves
with a mattress as winds swept through their neighborhood in the
300 block of Chasemore Lane, just south of Interstate 20.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors walked up and down the darkened streets,
carrying flashlights, as they checked on damage and offered to help
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Several dogs ran free through the streets in the storm's
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fences are down _ there's dogs running everywhere,''
said Arlington police Cpl. Michael Van Steenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The building housing the regional office of the Texas Department
of Health and the Department of Human Services was heavily damaged.
The entire east side appeared to be stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   The post office next door also appeared to have been severly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Ava Mitchell of Fort Worth was working in the Lear plant about 7
p.m. and was caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything. We just heard it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the storm passed the damage was evident: Two truck
trailers on the west side of the building were overturned. In a
field behind the building, the air-conditioning units from the roof
were strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the Rev. Bob Nichols of Calvary Cathedral
International watched in awe from his church office as water from
the Trinity River spiraled into the sky and roared toward his
church at 1600 W. 5th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been ripped to shreds if I hadn't run into the
hallway with my wife and two other church members,'' said Nichols,
whose office faces west toward the river. ``We didn't even hear
anything before it hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Only steel beams remained of the cathedral's five-story tower
from the second-story upward to the steeple. Bricks and mortar from
the church were thrown nearly 200 feet across Penn Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this building has been bombed,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   East of the church, Louis Zapata was among five people inside
the Summit Building, 1500 W. 5th St., which was hammered by the
tornado. Walls crumbled and most of the building's roof was ripped
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer shut off, then the lights went out, so I bent down
to get a flashlight out of my bag,'' said Zapata, 65, a lifelong
resident of Fort Worth who was in the building's second-floor.
``When I bent down, the roof started to just rip off and the walls
started disappearing. Everything was blowing everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord said to me, `Bend down and pick up your life,'
'' he said. ``It was a good solid desk. If it would have moved, I
would have had it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown YMCA, Robert Viana watched as the tornado cut
its deadly path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking out the window and you could see a funnel of
debris heading right toward us,'' said Viana, 39, of Fort Worth.
``It looked like fingers dangling from the sky. There definitely
was more than one cloud coming down. We started yelling to
everybody and we all took off for the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing himself against the glass in a 28th floor office at the
City Center Two Tower, Joe Garbe could see the black tornado
weaving its way between buildings in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a vortex,'' Garbe said. ``You could see the lights
sparking different colors and then go dead.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials sought to evacuate everyone from downtown who was
not a resident because of several major areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   A major gas leak was reported at 3000 W. 7th St. In addition,
damage done to buildings caused officials to declare areas around
Sundance West, the Cash America building and the UPR Building areas
of major concern.
</P>
<P>
   Severe damage was reported at a 7-Eleven near University and
Seventh streets west of downtown. Trees and debris was scattered
across the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Urban Search and Rescue team was deployed from College
Station Tuesday night to help Fort Worth officials. The team, which
includes structural engineers, is expected to arrive Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were reportedly arrested for looting at the Cash
America building.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, police reported that eight semi-trailer trucks had
overturned on Interstate 20 and that as many as 15 houses were
damaged around Matlock Road and I-20.
</P>
<P>
   The storm lost much of its punch as it swept east.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
If there's anything the Rockets need after the way things have gone
during this trail-of-tears season, it's a couple of good laughs as
the year winds down.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, they've settled on a couple of laughers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets hammered what's left of the Golden State Warriors on
Tuesday night 121-86 before 14,496 at Compaq Center, their second
straight blowout of monumental proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory came on the heels of Sunday's 45-point victory
over the Bulls, meaning the Rockets have won their last two games
by a combined 80 points. The Rockets also broke the 120-point mark
for the second consecutive game, the first time they had done so
since the end of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good for us to get two back-to-back victories like
this at home,'' said Steve Francis, who finished with 15 points,
eight rebounds and five assists. ``I think it was the assist factor
(30 against the Warriors) that played a role today, because we all
passed the ball around. Everyone who played tonight scored, and
that's a great accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really pleased and impressed by the way our guys
have been taking care of business,'' he said. ``I can't tell you
how pleased I've been with our passing. Everybody moved the ball,
everybody got involved, and there were wide-open shots all over the
place. That's fun basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the last two games showed how easy it is to enjoy a pair
of laughers when you're playing a couple of the league's top jokes.
And it also showed how much of a gap there is between the Rockets
and those teams in the league that are truly horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't have much to say about this game,'' said
Golden State's Jason Caffey. ``It was a terrible outing, and it's
an embarrassment. The sooner I can put this behind me, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite different from how the Rockets will remember the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is having a winning attitude,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``You have to play as a team and do the right things so it's
not just a wasted year. I don't think by any means or any way you
look at it that this is a wasted year, because this is very
valuable time for our young guys. We can get a really good
foundation in place here, and these guys can leave this season with
a positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all laughs, however.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers received a nasty hit to the chin while taking a
charge in the second quarter, a shot from the Warriors' Vonteego
Cummings that buckled Rogers and opened up a gash in his chin that
required seven stitches to close. Rogers was helped from the floor,
but he got woozy and again fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough,'' Francis said. ``He had stitches in his chin,
and I had stitches in my lip (after getting hit by Denver's Tariq
Abdul-Wahad). But I told him I didn't pass out while he did. But
he's all right. He went home, and he said that hopefully he'll be
able to practice (today) with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, though, it was all fun and games for the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   One guy who has really been enjoying himself is Walt Williams,
who posted his eighth straight solid start. After scoring a
season-high 24 points against the Bulls on Sunday, Williams came
back Tuesday to put up 20 points, his third straight game of 20 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't mention the fact he started out 0-for-4 from the
floor, including a missed dunk with 7:15 left in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the dudes on the sidelines were just clowning me crazy out
there, so I knew I had to turn it around,'' said Williams, who also
had a game-high 11 rebounds and six assists. ``I knew I was going
to come out at the end of the first quarter, so I just said, `Hey,
I have to turn this around before the second quarter comes.' So I
just stepped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   As did the rest of the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson matched Williams' scoring total, while Kelvin
Cato was just a notch behind with 18 points. Cuttino Mobley had 16
points, and Matt Bullard tossed in 10 in just 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Down by two points halfway through the first quarter, the
Rockets went on a 35-9 run over the next 12 minutes to blow the
game wide-open. Down 14-12 at the start of the run, the Rockets
found themselves up 47-23 when Bullard tossed in a jumper with 6:19
to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for Golden State's Larry Hughes, who shot as if his
life depended on it, going 9-of-26 from the floor for his 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys earlier that these games are important in how
we handle (the losing), stay focused and not just play out the
season,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's a good opportunity to see the
work ethic and the character of the team, and they've responded
really well.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ As training camps go, this one was as clean as
they come. It concludes today with there having been no injuries of
consequence, no rainouts and no real surprises of any kind. Nary a
bigot nor a bigamist could be found in the Astros' clubhouse, and
Houston's new brick-red, sand and black color scheme seemed to be a
smashing hit, judging by how prevalent the new duds were in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   No small thing, that. If he sells enough ball caps, perhaps
Drayton McLane Jr. can get Mike Hampton out of hock for next
season. Hampy might be a free agent, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros came to Florida under a cloud because of offseason
budget-trimming measures that cost them the services of the
lefthanded 22-game winner and outfielder Carl Everett, the
brash-talking outfielder who may emerge a superstar in Boston if a
rogue Yankees fan doesn't do a Tony Soprano on him first. But the
Astros seemed to take the roster broadsides in stride, and they
return to Houston, by and large, sound of both mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been associated with a better spring
training _ I think we're leaving here in good shape,'' general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said, although he was speaking before he
saw Octavio Dotel get mauled by the Royals on Tuesday. And he
admits he's not done fiddling with the bottom of his roster to
extract as much production from it as he can.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things have been markedly different from a year ago, when
everything that could go wrong did. Then came the regular season,
and things got worse. But the Astros proved resilient enough to win
97 games for a third consecutive Central Division title, and for
all their problems, they were still a far more known quantity than
they are today.
</P>
<P>
   Owner McLane's stubborn determination to eliminate the club's
brick-red bottom line _ he hopes to replace it with a black one _
cost the Astros their best hitter and best pitcher of last season.
Hampton's departure (he failed his fiscal, you might say) saddled
Larry Dierker with a 100-percent righthanded rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But the real X-variable for Houston is Enron Field, the
antithesis of the pitcher-perfect Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros' end run to Enron assures them of some
profitability for the coming season, they are no sure thing to make
hay while the sun shines on them and become four-peat champions as
trendy downtown dwellers. Enron's tight confines, in fact, may
prove downright unfriendly. We just don't know yet, because never
in baseball's modern era has a team successfully built over time
for one venue attempted to reinvent itself in short order for such
a starkly different one.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the aforementioned starting pitchers, for example,
statistical research shows the following:
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds' Dome ERA for the last five seasons was 3.42,
with 8.84 strikeouts per nine innings. Elsewhere, his corresponding
numbers were 4.06 and 6.80.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima posted a 2.90 ERA under glass from 1997-99 but 4.79 on
foreign turf, and his strikeouts fell from 7.48 to 6.13.
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Chris Holt clicked to the tune of a 3.67 ERA and
5.99 K's in the Dome but slumped to 6.55 and 3.65 on the road, and,
no, I didn't get those numbers backward.
</P>
<P>
   While Holt has had a splendid spring, you worry if both Reynolds
and Lima are already psyched out by the move. The former, who makes
his final exhibition start today with a Class AAA lineup behind
him, has given up 27 hits and 12 earned runs in 17 tuneup innings.
Lima's vitals are 26 innings worked, 38 hits allowed and 18 earned
runs charged to his account. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, no doubt, will have to win their share of 9-8 games
to keep the Cardinals and the Reds at bay. Fortunately, statistics
indicate both Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio are as likely to
prosper at Enron as the pitchers are to struggle. Bagwell ripped 30
of his 42 home runs last year on the road and hit 66 points higher.
Biggio's Dome average was 20 points under that when he was
traveling. Hopefully, the net result will be an equal
offense-defense trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Astros will need to wring every possible run
from their available talent pool, Hunsicker is still trying to
tweak the 25-man roster to ensure that all his bases _ and
shortstop, too _ are covered. He gleans great satisfaction out of
plucking players from obscurity, players who were available for the
taking by any club, and seeing them carve out not-insignificant
roles for themselves with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry has to outsmart his competition, because he can't outspend
it. Of late, he's 3-for-3. But they keep raising the bar on him.
</P>

   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks' remaining schedule would seem to be
a favorable one, especially since Anaheim is a combined 7-0-3
against the Kings, Nashville and Chicago -- the three teams that it
plays its final five games against.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim is 2-0-2 versus the Kings, who they play twice, 2-0
against the Predators who they also play twice, and 3-0-1 versus
the Blackhawks who they play once.
</P>
<P>
   But Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg doesn't put much credence in
such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying our games are like playoff games, and when
the playoffs start what you've done before doesn't matter,'' he
said. ``We don't talk about it, just like we didn't talk about how
we hadn't played well versus Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were 1-4 versus the Coyotes before they defeated them
4-3 in overtime on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   -Winger Marty McInnis returned to practice for the first time in
nearly three weeks. McInnis has missed nine consecutive games and
20 of the last 27 due to a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good, but we will see how he feels today,'' said
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis scored 19 goals and 52 points last season when he was
valuable member of the No. 2 line and No. 1 power play unit.
McInnis has been limited to 57 games this season, scoring 10 goals
and 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   -After a lengthy practice on Tueday, most of the Ducks will
concentrate on off-ice conditioning today before returning to the
ice Thursday and Friday in preparation for Saturday's game versus
the Kings.

   VIENNA, Austria _ After two days of disputes, OPEC decided
Wednesday to increase oil production without the participation of
its second-largest producer, Iran. But the increase was not what
the United States had pressed for, and was not expected to bring
down gasoline prices any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks, the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its members
would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a day,
despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase. The higher
production would begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   With Iran, the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels,
but analysts said the actual increase would end up at the higher
level because other OPEC members were likely to seize the
opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million
barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices, which have soared to more
than $1.60 a gallon in most cities. Iran's irritation at the
American pressures was apparently a major reason behind its
opposition to any increase.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks
before any increase in oil production found its way to the gasoline
pumps, and with inventories already unusually low in the United
States as the summer driving season approaches, gasoline prices are
not expected to decline soon. In fact, some analysts predicted,
they would rise still more before easing by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $1 or $1.20 a
gallon will be seriously disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an
analyst at Petroleum Finance Co., an industry research firm based
in Washington. ``Whatever happens, you're going to have a tight
gasoline market this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, however, was more optimistic and
said that several other oil-producing nations that do not belong to
OPEC would also increase output. ``I think our quiet diplomacy
worked,'' said Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, at a White
House briefing on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that when all sources of production were taken
into account, ``we will be well above our objective.'' He and other
officials pointed out that prices were already down, to about $27 a
barrel from a high of $34 a barrel, in anticipation of more
production.
</P>
<P>
   In New York trading on Tuesday, crude oil for May delivery fell
70 cents, to $27.09 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual break in OPEC's ranks came after two days of
wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the largest producer,
which pushed for an increase in production. In the end, OPEC
announced that nine of its 11 members would go ahead and increase
their quotas. The production of Iraq, which says it now produces
2.4 million barrels a day, has been separately governed by U.N.
resolutions since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Iraq said Tuesday
night that it planned to significantly increase its production by
the end of the year, but experts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure with Iran has major implications for the United
States. Indeed, the battle within OPEC was as much political as
economic, and much of the debate was over whether the group would
be capitulating to pressure from the United States for lower oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It was OPEC's decision to cut production last year, joined by
several non-OPEC nations like Mexico and Norway, that sent oil and
gasoline prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's split could damage OPEC's discipline and
credibility, just as the organization seemed to have regained some
of the power it had in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, accused the other
OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not
justified by economic conditions. ``OPEC is not an organization to
rubber-stamp the decisions already made,'' Zangeneh said in a short
but biting statement about 1 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to show our flexibility,'' he continued. ``OPEC needs
a spirit of compromise, which unfortunately we didn't trace at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC's discipline does come unhinged, the United States could
be a major beneficiary and see its bill for imported oil drop. In
the past, when OPEC failed to agree on production limits, prices
have plummeted as production soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC had a commendable record in the past year, and now one of
its founding members is not taking part in their agreement,'' said
Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry
research firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's split comes after a bitter test of wills between
Iran and Saudi Arabia, which was determined to reverse the
production cuts of last year and to allow the price of oil to
settle at about $25 a barrel, compared with about $27.50 today and
its recent high of $34 in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials wanted to raise prices, partly because the
United States is its biggest market and partly because of concern
about political wrath from Congress, where some lawmakers have
pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of military equipment
to OPEC nations.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian leaders, on the other hand, had angrily denounced
American demands and insisted that OPEC should not make decisions
in response to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Oil experts, as well as Saudi leaders, argued here that Iran was
already producing virtually all the oil it could pump, about 3
million barrels a day, and that any increase in production would
come from other countries _ Saudi Arabia in particular _ leading to
lower prices that could hurt Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 7.6 million barrels, has
enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials, alarmed when prices suddenly surged recently to
around $30 a barrel, adamantly demanded an increase in OPEC output
that would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders
intensively for the last several weeks, arguing that the world
markets needed as much as 2.5 million extra barrels a day to meet
demand and to restore depleted inventories.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear that OPEC would not go that far, but Saudi
Arabia had managed to persuade all other members except Iran to
reverse the cuts they had imposed on themselves last year. The
Saudi plan had called for an increase of 1.7 million OPEC barrels
of oil a day in production limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the agreement Wednesday morning, many OPEC leaders
were still fuming about what they viewed as heavy-handed pressure
from Washington that only made their own political situation more
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan leaders, taking a cue from their outspoken president,
Hugo Chavez, have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed
as puppets of the American government, and went out of their way
last week to criticize lobbying efforts by Richardson, the energy
secretary. Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Iranian officials almost gleefully pounced on the
issue of American pressure when Richardson reportedly called the
oil minister of Qatar, another OPEC member, just as he was meeting
with his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest, the proposed increases are still significant.
Indeed, oil prices have already drifted down about 18 percent since
March 8, to about $28 a barrel from $34, and most of that decline
reflected the anticipation that OPEC would agree on an increase of
roughly that magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials have made it clear that they would like to see
the price of oil settle at around $25 a barrel, a price they
believe could be sustained and would allow the United States and
other major oil-consuming countries to rebuild their badly depleted
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   But the increase would also fall well short of what the Saudis
envisioned. Experts said it would provide only a modest relief in
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of OPEC, tried to put the best
possible face on Wednesday's split, noting that countries have on
occasion dissented from the organization's decisions before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remain as a group despite all of these tensions,'' he
said after Iran announced that it would not join in the agreement.
``Many people wrote off OPEC many years ago, and we're still
here.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase its oil production by 1.45 million barrels a
day is welcome and may, over time, lead to lower American gasoline
prices. The action, which Iran, an OPEC member, unexpectedly
refused to take part in, restores just over a third of production
cut by the cartel over the past two years. But it should not be
seen as a definitive answer to the recent sharp rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those prices reached a peak of $34 a barrel in early March, more
than three times what they had been a year earlier. But those 1999
prices were artificially depressed _ lower, once inflation is
accounted for, than at any time since the 1970s. A rebound to more
realistic levels was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's power is not what it once was. Its 11 member countries
now account for less than 40 percent of world oil production, down
from more than 50 percent in 1974. Internal discipline is weak,
with many countries cheating on their production quotas to earn
extra revenue. Even before the OPEC meeting, prices had dropped by
almost 20 percent, to about $28 a barrel. Raising production should
bring further price declines.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's OPEC decision came in response to strong American
pressure. Aside from Iran, most other OPEC countries preferred not
to risk being cast as villains in American political debate if oil
prices remain high. Many of these countries also recognize that
their own self-interest calls for moderation to protect the
economies of major oil-consuming nations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had sought a larger production boost, of at least two
million barrels a day. But the Vienna decision is constructive and
will take significant pressure off world oil prices, which may now
stabilize around $25 a barrel. Gasoline prices, which reflect low
inventories as well as expensive oil, will probably stay high for a
few more months. But their inflationary impact on the American
economy is likely to be relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   After the oil shocks of the 1970's and early 1980's, the United
States and other industrial countries undertook significant energy
conservation measures, like raising automobile fuel economy
standards. They also intensified efforts to discover and exploit
new energy sources, including non-OPEC oil. With oil prices as low
as they have been in recent years, conservation measures have
lagged and the search for new supplies has slowed. By reviving
these efforts, America can gain some protection against future oil
price increases. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE IMPASSE OVER ELIAN GONZALEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved in the Elian Gonzalez case needs to pull back
from the nasty confrontation that now looms so this matter can be
resolved without disorder or further harm to young Elian. The Miami
relatives who have been caring for him since he was rescued off the
Florida coast last November must firmly commit themselves to
accepting his return to his father in Cuba if their court appeals
are rejected. The Justice Department, which is right to seek his
repatriation, should lift its threat to remove the boy from Miami
this week, and the Cuban-American community in south Florida ought
to cease its disruptive efforts to block Elian's return and to make
him into a political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has made every effort to resolve the case
in a fair and calm manner. The relatives have had the opportunity
to challenge in federal court Attorney General Janet Reno's
decision that Elian must be returned to his father, who has sole
authority to speak for his son. Last week Federal District Judge
Michael Moore correctly ruled that Reno's decision was proper and
dismissed the relatives' legal case. That ruling affirmed the
Justice Department's authority to carry out its intent to reunite
Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said last week that it would not
terminate the temporary custody of the Miami relatives if they
wanted to seek an expedited appeal of Moore's ruling. But that
offer was made on the reasonable condition that the relatives issue
a written promise to turn the child over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service if the appeal fails.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have so far refused to do so, a sign that they are
not interested in abiding by the appeals court decision. They seem
intent on prolonging this wrenching process, perhaps hoping that
anti-Castro sentiment in Miami will make it politically impossible
for the INS to retrieve the child. Or they may be expecting
Congress in an election year to provide them a legislative way to
prevent Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's impatience with the relatives is
understandable, but the answer for now is not to threaten to
terminate the relatives' temporary care of Elian immediately. The
government may eventually have no choice but to enforce
repatriation, but removing Elian from his relatives' care without
their cooperation would clearly be the least desirable way to
return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible voices in the Cuban-American community need to step
forward to mediate the situation. In due time the appeals process
will run its course. The federal appeals court has set oral
arguments in the case for the week of May 8. The Miami relatives
may have come to love Elian, but they cannot stand outside the law
and break the bond between a young child and his parent.

</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to end his campaign to evict
the Brooklyn Museum from its premises, cut its funding and remove
its board of trustees is a sensible bow to First Amendment
principles. The agreement between the mayor and the museum ends six
months of legal wrangling over the staging of ``Sensation,'' the
exhibition that included Chris Ofili's notorious dung-adorned
painting of the Madonna. The Brooklyn Museum can now go about
mounting shows that will stimulate, and perhaps offend, visitors
instead of defending in court its right to do so. The mayor can
praise or criticize or ignore those exhibitions as he sees fit,
without tying up the courts with fruitless litigation that runs
headlong into the First Amendment's guarantees of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been far too quick to use governmental powers in an
attempt to censor artistic expression or restrict political
demonstrations. As two justices for the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit noted this week, this administration's policies
have resulted in ``a heavy stream of First Amendment litigation,''
litigation that has not, as a rule, gone well for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over ``Sensation'' was marked by rancor reminiscent
of earlier national battles over contemporary art financed by the
National Endowment for the Arts. With the exhibit now over, City
Hall professes to be pleased with a settlement that ends the
hostilities. But the Brooklyn Museum clearly emerged the winner.
The city's monthly payments to the museum will be restored. The
museum will be given $5.8 million for capital improvements. And it
will be protected from future retaliation by a provision that
prevents Giuliani from imposing any funding cuts that are
disproportionately larger than those affecting other major
city-supported museums.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the free-speech issues, the battle over
``Sensation'' raised troubling questions about the role of private
companies and individuals in financing a museum exhibit from which
they might profit commercially. These practices, which are said to
be common at many institutions, need to be addressed by leaders of
the museum world now that the furor over ``Sensation'' has ended.

ASSESSMENT TEAM BLAMES ALL INVOLVED WITH MARS POLAR LANDER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The loss of the $165 million Mars Polar Lander was
most likely caused by a premature engine shutdown, which sent the
spacecraft crashing into the planet's surface at about 50 mph,
NASA-commissioned investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Program Assessment Team found fault with all key
players in the failed mission, including NASA, the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, which managed the effort; and Denver-based
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, which built the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited poor communication among the three parties and
inadequate testing of systems. It also said tight NASA budgets and
time constraints contributed to the doom of the Mars Polar Lander
and the $29 million Deep Space 2 probes it was to have deployed on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The report also laid down the law for future Mars efforts by
stating: ``If not ready, do not launch.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, JPL and
Lockheed officials pledged to make needed reforms and NASA
announced it was delaying the 2001 launch of another Mars lander.
The 2001 launch of a Mars orbiter will go on as planned. A NASA
official also said the agency would increase funding for needed
testing and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the report will be well-received,'' said JPL's John
Casani, who served on the assessment team.
</P>
<P>
   He said JPL is already implementing recommended organizational
changes, including the establishment of a separate management
office for Mars programs. Previous Mars efforts were managed by an
office that also oversees a number of unrelated JPL space programs.
</P>
<P>
   Casani, who retired in August as JPL's chief engineer and
returned as a consultant, said he was pleased with NASA's pledge of
more funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more funding or fewer programs, one or the other,''
Casani said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Mars Polar Lander was 131 miles
above the Red Planet when it deployed its three landing legs as
planned. However, the deployment sent a false signal to the
engines, indicating the spacecraf

EDITORIAL: YOSEMITE'S NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when California's Merced River jumped its banks
in Yosemite National Park _ uprooting cabins, burying parking lots
under mud and rock and generally making a mess of things _ federal
officials took it as a sign that the time had come to strike a
better balance between man and nature. There was human overload
everywhere _ four million visitors a year, shops and restaurants
jammed into the Yosemite Valley flood plain, a stream of cars,
trucks and recreational vehicles that not only fouled the air but
made the mile-long trip through Yosemite Village seem like rush
hour in Manhattan. On some days visibility was bad enough to
obscure the towering rock formations that rise from the valley
floor and the long waterfalls that seem to descend from the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The flood gave officials a chance to refine a long-mothballed
plan to reduce pollution and overcrowding in the park, and on
Monday, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt unveiled the results. The
new plan would tear out many parking lots and roads in the eastern,
more scenic parts of the valley, as well as three bridges and the
Cascades Dam, which interrupts the Merced River's flow. It would
also demolish various commercial and administrative buildings. The
parking lots would be replaced with three new lots at the western
edge of the park from which visitors would be bused into the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   Although some environmentalists said the plan did not go far
enough, it can be improved during the public hearing process in the
months ahead, perhaps reducing automobile traffic still further by
eliminating more parking inside the valley. But even in its present
form it represents a big step forward. The Merced will begin to
look more natural, asphalt will give way to meadows, and the park's
wildlife will have more room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could also serve as a model for other national parks,
many in varying stages of decay. A disastrous flood provided the
opportunity to set things right in Yosemite. But Congress, which
has consistently underfinanced park maintenance, should not await
further calamities to begin restoring the system as a whole to good
health.

CARTOONISTS BLAME CANADA, PBS FOR LOST JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Watching Canadian-drawn cartoons on U.S.
taxpayer-supported TV is no laughing matter for local cartoonists,
who plan to picket Los Angeles' PBS affiliate KCET on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   The protest is the latest step in a campaign the cartoonists
union launched last fall to urge PBS not to send millions of
dollars worth of work to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when private companies do this. But when it's
American tax dollars, we have a problem,'' said Steve Hulett,
business manager for the North Hollywood-based Motion Picture
Screen Cartoonists Local 839 IATSE. Hulett said he expected at
least 200 cartoonists, both union and nonunion, to take part in the
picketing from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in front of KCET's Hollywood
office on Sunset Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   A KCET spokeswoman referred all questions on the subject to PBS
headquarters in Alexandria, Va. ``This is a PBS issue. We happen to
be the local PBS affiliate, and that makes us handy,'' said the
spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Epstein, director of communications for PBS, disputed the
union's ``implication ... that federal dollars are going to
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said no public money is going into the cartoon programs,
which are produced by Montreal-based Cinar Films and Toronto-based
Nelvana Entertainment. Epstein said about 16 percent of PBS's
annual budget of roughly $350 million comes in the form of public
funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said CPB funds are used at the discretion of PBS, and
currently are being used to acquire several American-produced shows
from such companies as Burbank-based DIC Entertainment and
Scholastic Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Cinar produces PBS' top-rated ``Arthur,'' along with ``Wimzie's
House'' and ``Zaboomafoo.'' Hulett says PBS is a partner in the
production of these shows; PBS spokesman Tom Epstein counters that
PBS is prohibited by its charter from producing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, Boston PBS station WGBH - which has produced or
co-produced many of PBS' most popular shows - is the co-producer of
``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelvana signed a multiyear agreement last year to produce PBS'
first-ever Saturday morning children's programming block. Hulett
said Nelvana touted PBS' commitment as being $40 million; Epstein
said PBS' contribution was actually a fraction of that amount, but
that the exact figure was proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Although they generally get less money up front by selling shows
to PBS rather than commercial outlets, many kids-show producers
consider a berth on PBS to be prime real estate. Programs are
uninterrupted by commercials, get a ``halo effect'' from the
educational reputation of PBS and, in the case of a handful of
programs, including ``Arthur,'' get more viewers than any other
kids TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this fact and seeing another potential revenue
stream, PBS in the past few years has been seeking and getting a
small cut of licensing revenues tied to kids shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hulett said the protest ties into the larger issue of runaway
production. ``Animation has never been more popular,'' Hulett said,
``but at the same time, we've had more layoffs over the past 20 to
24 months than in the past nine years. Disney, DreamWorks, Fox -
they've all had layoffs. There's been a huge downsizing of staffs.
... We have 25 percent to 35 percent unemployment now. Companies
are looking to do it faster and cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S.-based companies, Hulett said, have been sending much
of their work overseas for the past couple of decades. ``Yes, even
if shows are produced in the U.S., they're going to be sent to
Asian subcontractors after the scripts, the storyboards and the key
art is done here,'' Hulett said. ``But I think there is a public
trust that PBS is violating by not dealing with American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulett said he had been told by American animation producers
that ``they can't get PBS to return their calls.'' Epstein insisted
that PBS is constantly on the lookout for good programs from all
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek the best ideas. Our mission is to acquire and
distribute the finest quality children's programming we can find.
We make every effort to do that, and we think our record speaks for
itself,'' said Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein added that the ``lion's share'' of PBS programs are
produced by American companies, and that four new animated programs
that have recently debuted or will debut by next year are
U.S.-produced. He added that PBS' new head of children's
programming, Patricia Nugent, will be encouraged to travel to Los
Angeles to meet with domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
   Over PBS' most recent three-year fiscal period, only about 4
percent of all shows were produced in Canada, Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Hulett said that isn't good enough: ``Come on. Don't say it's
only 4 percent. ... Why isn't it zero?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the cartoonists have succeeded in raising some
awareness on the issue, on the part of both viewers and PBS. A PBS
source, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ``Honestly, I don't
think we ever thought about whether (public money) was going into
acquiring Canadian shows. Now, I think we'll be more aware of
that.''

<P>
   Mark Stuart, a longtime newspaper columnist and editor at The
Record in Hackensack, N.J., and The Paterson Morning Call, died
March 24 at the Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia complicated by Parkinson's disease, said
his wife, Melba, from their home in Rivervale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart wrote a general interest column called ``Marking Time,''
which he began in 1968 at The Morning Call, where he was city
editor, and then wrote for 17 years at The Record, where he was
assistant editorial page editor. After retiring in 1989, he
continued to write it for the weekly Ridgewood News.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from the City College of New York in 1947, he
was editor of a Manhattan weekly, The West Side News. Recognizing
the potential for readers in the developments of Stuyvesant Town
and Peter Cooper Village, which were then attracting returning
veterans, he persuaded his publisher, Charles Hagedorn, to start a
new weekly, Town and Village, and served as it first editor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jane, of
New York City; a son, Thomas, of Washingtonville, N.Y.; and two
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Henry W. McGee Sr., the first black postmaster in Chicago, died
on March 18 at his home in Chicago. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   McGee became postmaster in 1966 and retired in 1973. He began
his career at the post office as a temporary substitute clerk in
1929 and became a full-time clerk in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wadsworth McGee Sr. was born on Feb. 7, 1910, in
Hillsboro, Texas. He attended the Illinois Institute of Technology
and received a master's degree in public administration from the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he was president of the Chicago chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In the
1970s, he served on the Chicago Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   McGee is survived by a son, Henry W. Jr., of Seattle; two
daughters, Sylvia E. Morrison and Marguerite Porterfield, both of
Chicago; eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

WILL LISSNER, 91 N.Y. TIMES REPORTER WHO SPECIALIZED IN ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Lissner, a reporter for The New York Times from 1926 until
he retired in 1976, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Dunedin,
Fla. He was 91 and lived in Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Lissner specialized in writing about economics,
but his varied assignments as a reporter and rewrite man included
Prohibition raids, tong wars in New York's Chinatown and coverage
of The Times itself. In 1935, he contributed to The Times' coverage
of the death of Adolph S. Ochs, who was then its publisher _
unbylined, as was the practice at that time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Lissner prepared a confidential 138-page report for
Turner Catledge, who was then a vice president of The Times,
entitled ``Arthur Hays Sulzberger and the Eastland Investigation.''
James O. Eastland was a senator from Mississippi whose subcommittee
in the 1950s was investigating, among other things, the extent of
Communist infiltration and influence that he believed existed at
The Times. Lissner's report, intended for the paper's archives and
its senior executives, largely recapitulated the ways in which the
paper and Sulzberger _ then the publisher, and grandfather of the
present one _ had responded to Eastland. It was also an account of
Communist Party activity in the newspaper business in New York from
the 1930s to 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Harrison E. Salisbury, a Pulitzer-Prize winning
reporter and later an editor at The Times, cited Lissner's report
in his book ``Without Fear or Favor: The New York Times and Its
Times.'' Salisbury wrote: ``When I was sent as correspondent to
Moscow in January 1949, as the McCarthy tensions were building
up,'' The Times' management ``took pains to make certain that the
dispatches of the new man from Moscow were carefully scrutinized by
a veteran Times reporter, Will Lissner, a dedicated anti-Communist
and Soviet economics specialist. Lissner was able to report no
signs of Communist bias in the new man's report; quite the
reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lissner, a native New Yorker, graduated from Stuyvesant High
School and studied and taught at the New School for Social
Research. He founded the American Journal of Economics and
Sociology in 1941 and continued his ties to it after leaving The
Times.
</P>
<P>
   His 1929 marriage to Ellen Batters ended in divorce in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Burnham; two
daughters, Claire Shepherd of Milwaukee and Ellen Benjamin of
Dover, Mass.; 9 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.

TORNADOES, RAIN WREAK HAVOC ON FORT WORTH GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Hundreds of Fort Worth area athletes were
prepared to hit the baseball, softball and soccer fields Tuesday
night. But instead of looking for victories, players, coaches and
fans searched for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took our kids and the kids from Trinity and the parents and
loaded up the buses,'' Richland High School baseball coach Brian
Master said. ``We went up and took shelter in the basement at
Richland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 6 p.m., we had a pretty steady and hard rain. At 6:30
p.m., we had the tornado siren go off. We started getting hail,
pea-size and quarter-sized hail.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, coaches and parents from both Richland and Trinity High
School also took shelter in the concession stands and bathrooms,
Master said. At 6:45 p.m., a second tornado siren sounded.
Listening to a radio report, Master said he heard a report that a
tornado had been sighted near I-35 and Loop 820.
</P>
<P>
   Haltom High School coach Randy Porter never even made it out of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 6 p.m., it started hailing,'' Porter said. ``Then, it
got real still, the sky looked green. From what we could see toward
Fort Worth, it wasn't pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haltom softball team was scheduled to face Irving High
School at Buffalo Ridge Park. Instead, the girls were forced to
take shelter in the concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Catholic baseball coach Art Senato said he saw first-hand
the storm that forced everyone to run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got pounded,'' Senato said. ``We detected lightning with
the lightning meters,'' Senato said. ''Just as we got off the
field, the (tornado) sirens went off. I watched the tornado come
right by the school, down I-30.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Catholic was leading Dallas St. Mark's, 6-0, in the fourth
inning before the storm blew through. The game was suspended and
Senato said the game will likely be made up in a doubleheader in
April.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to a game against MacArthur High School in Irving,
Richland softball coach Mike Fielder received the news about the
approaching storm. Seeking safety, Fielder stopped at a local
Braum's and asked the manager if his girls could take refuge in the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it wasn't very safe to be on the bus,'' Fielder said.
``We looked for a brick building, someplace safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm and the threat of harm wiped out many of last night's
scheduled contests, including several key soccer games. The girls
Class 4A Region II semifinal game between Highland Park and Crowley
was postponed until 7 p.m. tonight at Highland Park. The Coppell
boys Class 4A Region II semifinal game against Dallas Wilson has
been rescheduled for 7:30 p.m. tonight at Cedar Hill High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Class 4A Region II boys semifinal match between Carroll and
Mesquite Poteet at UT-Dallas in Richardson has been rescheduled for
7 p.m. tonight. The Richland-McKinney Class 5A Region I
quarterfinal game scheduled for 7:30 p.m. last night at Wildcat-Ram
Stadium is tentatively scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tonight at Goldsmith
Stadium in Lewisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw a lot of lightning and rain,'' Richland boys
soccer coach Mark McCanlies said. ``With the threat of tornado
activity, we were packed under the stadium like sardines.''
</P>
<P>
   Left in the storm's wake was broken glass, downed trees and
power lines and debris on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going across downed power lines and four 18-wheelers
were tipped over,'' Country Day softball coach Don Hicks said. ``It
was a mess. There was a Porta Potti splattered on I-20. We were
underneath the overpass at Highway 360 and I-20 and our bus was
getting hit by softball-sized hale. We were in that situation for
about five to seven minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm left Dunbar softball coach Alvin Selmon with a lasting
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was wrong when we were on the bus and I heard
the dispatcher sounding really excited,'' Selmon said. ``Then I
heard her telling all the bus drivers to get off the streets. That
made me feel uneasy. By the time we got back to the gym, it was
raining buckets, but we felt safe there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the (Dunbar) gym, and it was just raining so hard
... the phones were out and the electricity went out twice,''
Selmon continued. ``After it stopped raining, we looked outside and
we could still see the clouds swirling and we watched it move
through Arlington and southeast Fort Worth at about 7:30 or 8 p.m.
I'm from out in West Texas by Lubbock, so I was used to seeing
stuff like this, but seeing it happen here in Fort Worth was
something that I won't forget.'' nn

   NEW YORK _ If Notre Dame was out to prove that it belonged in
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, the Irish
did it on Tuesday night with a convincing 73-52 victory over Penn
State in the semifinals of the National Invitation Tournament at
Madison Square Garden before 14,268.
</P>
<P>
   This was a victory with an exclamation point, as the Fighting
Irish (22-14) jumped on Penn State early and never let up. Before
the Nittany Lions (18-16) could get into any kind of rhythm, they
were fighting for their lives. Midway through the second half, they
were trailing by 56-36 and playing a desperate game of catch-up.
Penn State never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When seven different people score the first few points of the
game, that says something,'' the Notre Dame sophomore forward David
Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish will play Wake Forest, which defeated North
Carolina State, 62-59, in overtime in the first semifinal, for the
championship on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was also a showcase for the Notre Dame sophomore
forward Troy Murphy, who averages 22.9 points and 10.5 rebounds a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Nittany Lions seemed intent on keeping Murphy from
making the Garden his playground. Every time Murphy touched the
ball, two Penn State defenders would collapse on him. He finished
with 18 points and 8 rebounds before leaving with 1 minute 36
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penn State couldn't just concentrate on one person,'' Murphy
said. ``I think we showed that we can spread it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame point guard Jimmy Dillon twisted his ankle with 6:56
left to play and had to be helped from the game. The injury could
loom as a problem against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have put him back out there even if it
had been a close game,'' Notre Dame Coach Matt Doherty said. ``I'm
really concerned about him. I think he's going to have to sleep
with a bag of ice on it and we'll have to see on tomorrow and
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were led by guard Joe Crispin, who had 16
points, and forward Jarrett Stephens, who had 11 points and 9
rebounds. Penn State dug a deep hole for itself in the first half
and couldn't climb out. Notre Dame kept dropping in 3-pointers,
hitting 5 of 11 3-point attempts in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good news-bad news kind of night for Penn State. The
good news was that Murphy, the Big East player of the year, only
scored 8 points in the first half. The bad news was that his
teammates didn't need much help from him.
</P>
<P>
   Crispin, of Pitman, N.J., tried to keep things close in the
first half. He contributed greatly on during an 8-0 run during a
crucial stretch in the first half, helping trim Notre Dame's 23-11
lead to 23-19. During that run, Crispin hit a 3-pointer and dished
out two assists. After a layup by Stephens with 2:28 to play in the
first half made it 27-23, Notre Dame went on an 11-0 run to close
out the half and go to the locker room with a secure 38-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me I'm never comfortable until there's 30 seconds to go and
we're up by 20 points,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal game, North Carolina State shot 20
percent from the field against Wake Forest before waking up in the
second half and giving the Demon Deacons a game. It was a wildly
swinging affair with nine ties and six lead changes in regulation
before Wake Forest (21-14) prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest forward Darius Songaila, who led the Demon Deacons
with 18 points, scored 8 points over the last 1:38 of overtime _
all of his teams points in that stretch _ to help seal the victory.
Songaila's slicing layup with 58 seconds to play gave Wake Forest a
58-56 lead. Then Songaila finished things off on the free-throw
line, making all four of his attempts after getting fouled twice
with less than minute to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the points were going to come hard tonight and they
came to easy early,'' Wake Forest Coach Dave Odom said. ``That gave
us a false sense of security. That was an old fashioned ACC Tobacco
Road game. I knew it was going to happen. Herb Sendek knew it was
going to happen. Both teams played with great will and great
passion. We just hit a few more free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had a chance to win the game in regulation. North
Carolina State guard Justin Gainey went to the free-throw line for
two shots with the Demon Deacons trailing by 51-50 and just eight
seconds to play after being fouled on a driving layup by Wake
Forest guard Josh Howard. Gainey made the first free throw and
missed the second. Wake Forest got the rebound from the second
missed shot, but time expired before the Demon Deacons could get a
shot off.

CELTICS IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Heads, apparently, are going to roll.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the Celtics' blowout loss Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night to the
Orlando Magic, coach Rick Pitino said he was so appalled at his
team's behavior during the game that he would announce ``major
suspensions'' Wednesday. The 122-87 defeat, the Celtics' worst of
the season, pretty much ended their playoff hopes, but that was not
what bothered Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   He said behavior during the second half, in timeouts and on the
bench, led him to his decision. He did not name names, but
observers close to the Celtics bench said the coach exchanged words
with Danny Fortson when Fortson was taken out of the game. In
addition, Antoine Walker was said to be jawing with reserve guard
Doug Overton.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said the suspensions could last for anywhere from a
couple of games to the final 11 games of the season. He said he
would ``sleep on it'' before making a final determination. He also
said the behavior might lead him to overhaul the team again at the
end of the season. The coach publicly has praised his players all
year for having excellent chemistry and togetherness, but he noted
what happened Tuesday night was not an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset. It will never happen again,'' Pitino said.
``It's extremely unprofessional, very un-Celticlike. These guys
have been good. Unfortunately, they're going to pay dearly for
this. I told them in all my years of coaching, I've never seen as
unprofessional an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for specifics, Pitino said there was too much
finger-pointing, blaming one another, and ``picking on the weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yelling, finger-pointing, childish behavior,'' he went on.
``Things you'd never see from a professional athlete. I've never
seen it from a Bernard King. You can't be a Celtic and have that.
It has nothing to do with frustrations. You don't do that. You
can't do that as a pro. We'll nip it in the bud. It will never
happen as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   It all happened as the Celtics were getting outscored, 72-35, in
the second half, including an astonishing 40-11 in the third
quarter. Walker sat out the final 14 minutes of the game after a
2-for-11, 5-point performance. Fortson played 12 minutes and,
amazingly, did not collect a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen crazier stuff,'' said Celtics cocaptain Dana Barros.
``But at this point, it's hard to swallow. You realize your season
may be slipping away, and doing things like that might come to
mind. But you just don't do it. We've all been through it. It's the
sign of an immature team. You can't have that as a team. It's
disturbing the privacy of a family. It wasn't the first time, and
it probably won't be the last time. But you can't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was fined last season for an on-court squabble with Kenny
Anderson in Washington. Pitino also left Anderson at home for a
game last season after another conflict. This, however, clearly was
worse than either of those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really upsetting,'' Pitino said. ``Very
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who in the first half was talking trash with Darrell
Armstrong, downplayed the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 71 games into the season,'' Walker said. ``Guys are
emotional. Guys want to win. Guys want to play hard. Situations
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is a professional athlete here. Everything is not
going to be picture perfect, the way you want it to be. But
everybody on this team is still great friends and good friends with
each other. It's just frustration from the game, when things aren't
going well. You played well in the first half and it doesn't go
well in the second half. Frustration sets in. We've got to regroup.
It's good we don't play a game until Friday. We've got to regroup
and catch ourselves, get back together, and put some wins
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by what Walker's coach said, it might be a different
look Friday night. It may be too late to salvage the season, but
Pitino obviously believes it's never too late to try to salvage a
club's reputation.

WOMAN FINISHES 23-DAY PINBALL MARATHON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Canoga Park, Calif.) _ Pinball wizards around the globe,
beware!
</P>
<P>
   Mandi Martin, known for her supple wrists and iron will,
finished a marathon 23 days of consecutive pinball play Tuesday to
surpass her old mark and set a new world record that even Tommy
from The Who's rock opera would envy.
</P>
<P>
   And she finished her 555 hours, 55 minutes and 55 seconds in
signature over-the-top style.
</P>
<P>
   For the final ball-smashing, point-racking fun, Martin took her
show on the road, playing an antique machine aboard a flatbed truck
in a victorious motorcade through the streets of the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the support of great friends, you can do anything if you
want it bad enough,'' the Canoga Park woman told a crowd of about
30, mostly friends from her team of witnesses. ``This is a dream
come true to me, and I couldn't have done it without you all.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she felt confident her reign as world pinball champion
was untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now I'm not even thinking about trying to raise the stakes
again,'' she said. ``I feel like I could do it again, but for now I
just want to celebrate by eating some sushi and sleeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee DePalma, an independent film maker, is filming a
documentary about Martin, who is now working on a book about her
life and is scheduled to hit the nationwide talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the past month, many took time off from work and
other activities to motivate Martin, massage her, feed her and lend
her moral support as she played a perpetual game of pinball in her
Canoga Park home.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Martin and her following planned a big finale
outside a Valley coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark fur coat and donning a New Year's tiara, the
local pinball queen was flanked by witnesses and followed by a
caravan of horn-tooting cars. At the front was a Ford pickup truck,
modified to look like a steam locomotive and driven by members of
the American Legion's 18th District.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, curious motorists honked horns in what could have
either been interpreted as support or annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Residents came out of their homes in pajamas and robes to wave
to the early-hour caravan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just amazing what she's doing,'' said Barry Katz,
a friend of Martin's who volunteered to do a couple of graveyard
shifts as a witness. ``She's got a heck of a lot of stamina. When I
was just trying to stay awake, she just kept playing away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dazzling display of pinball prowess, Martin has played
around the clock at her home since Mar. 5, with less than two hours
rest each day and sworn witnesses at all times in accordance with
rules set by The Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   The final mark of 555 hours, 55 minutes and 55 seconds was
achieved at a celebration in the parking lot in front of the Coffee
Junction in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   A singer and songwriter by profession, Martin said she decided
to upgrade her record at the urging of friends as a way to mark her
55th birthday last week and deal with the passing of her husband,
Jerry Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has held the previous world record of 505 hours of play
since 1979, seriously challenged only by a pair of spunky Brits who
reached 216 hours, according to Guinness spokesman Neil Hayes in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a category that is often challenged,'' Hayes said.
``Ms. Martin's record is quite impressive, and of course we'll have
to verify her latest feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said other unusual categories recently called in by
would-be record setters include the world's biggest umbrella and
the world's biggest pencil collection.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest record Hayes could recall was a political party in
Brazil that reported the most votes ever tallied for a political
office by a nonhuman species. They reported 4,000 votes collected
for a monkey on a local campaign ticket with the slogan ``Vote
monkey, get monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   What might set Martin apart from other record seekers is that
she was after more than just fame. She took advantage of the
occasion to call for donations to some local charities that support
families who lose a loved one, including the Chad Aitken Foundation
and Haven Hills, a domestic violence prevention group.

NETS TOP PACERS, 111-106 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As yet another seemingly insurmountable
lead sank like a barbell in the ocean on Tuesday night, many of the
17,676 New Jersey Nets fans looked on in stunned disbelief,
wondering what type of curse must hover over their woebegone team.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three quarters of brilliant basketball, of
spectacular alley-oops and feverish defense against the premier
team in the Eastern Conference, the Nets were crumbling again.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers, mimicking the Denver Nuggets of two days
before, began chopping at the Nets' advantage with frightening
effectiveness and speed. In five minutes, the Nets' 21-point
fourth-quarter lead was down to 8. Fifty-nine seconds later, it was
5. Less than two minutes after that, the teams were separated by
only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who blew an 18-point lead late in the game in a loss
to Denver on Sunday, looked as if they would pull a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Coach Don Casey's embattled unit was able to fight
off defeat, if only slightly. Despite being outscored by 36-20 over
the final 11 minutes, the Nets beat the Pacers, 111-106, and saved
themselves from the indignity of monumental collapses in
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank god we took care of business because if we had lost this
one, I don't know if anybody would have come to the game Thursday
night,'' Kendall Gill said. ``There was big-time panic. I felt a
sense of urgency on my part because this had happened the previous
game. And you could hear the fans talking about, `Ahh, we can't do
this again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gill could hear the fans clearly because he was on the bench for
much of the Pacers' run. After scoring 15 of his 17 points in the
third quarter and playing stifling defense against the Pacers'
Jalen Rose to help the Nets turn a 5-point halftime advantage into
an 85-70 lead heading into the fourth quarter, Gill was taken out
of the game with 10 minutes 8 seconds remaining and the Nets ahead,
91-72.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the Pacers, who were without Reggie Miller
because the star shooting guard was ejected for hollering at the
officials with 11:57 left in the game, began to charge. As the lead
dwindled and Gill watched, the game took on the eerie feel of
Sunday's debacle in which Casey sat Gill, one of the league's best
perimeter defenders, for the entire fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, with the injured Jayson Williams and numerous
fans screaming and pointing for Gill to be put on the floor, Casey
reinserted him with 6:09 left. By that time, a 13-2 Indiana run had
trimmed the Nets' lead to 93-85.
</P>
<P>
   When Gill returned, Rose, who had scored only 10 points on
5-of-14 shooting through the first three quarters, was rolling and
not even the Nets' best defender could stop him. The Pacers' small
forward scored 7 of his 27 points in less than three minutes and
pulled Indiana within 97-96 on a short jumper with 3:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that they were going to make a run,'' Keith Van
Horn said. ``They're a quality veteran team that has won a lot of
games, so I just tried to keep my composure, keep the fire under
the team, and fight back and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn had a monstrous game, matching a season high with 30
points and 10 rebounds. He scored 5 points and made a steal down
the stretch to help the Nets avoid defeat. With 2:16 to play, he
hit a 3-pointer that made it 104-99, and the Pacers never got
closer than 3 points again.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, who shook off a head cold to contribute 28
points and 10 assists, was also big in the clutch, scoring 6 points
in the final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which improved the Nets to 30-40, did little to
bolster their scant postseason hopes since Orlando, holder of the
East's eighth and final playoff spot with a 36-36 record, routed
Boston on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That reality led Gill to admit being somewhat disturbed with
Tuesday night's Nets performance, which above all was just another
example of their season-long pattern of losing games to lesser
teams, like Denver, and playing well against members of the
league's elite, like Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real disappointing because we beat this team, but we
can't take care of Denver,'' Gill said. ``That's where we have to
grow. We're like Jekyll and Hyde.''

CELLULAR PHONES FEED OUT HANG_UPS

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hold those calls!
</P>
<P>
   On the leading edge of a cellular phone backlash, Los Angeles
County supervisors voted Tuesday to silence cell phones in their
board room, joining churches, colleges, theaters and restaurants
that are sick of the incessant chirping, beeping and ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters now run warnings against cell phone use, some
restaurants have cell phone sections, and one London anti-cell
phone group has gone as far as smashing people's phones and
displaying its exploits on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It has even been suggested that motorists caught with cell phone
in hand be charged with driving under the affluence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, exasperated supervisors said the ringing and
chatting has been drowning out their meetings, so they voted
unanimously to require cell phones and pagers to be set on vibrate
mode or be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many people with cell phones today, they should give
us the courtesy to turn them off during the hearing,'' said
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who sponsored the motion. It
will only get worse. The number of people with wireless telephones
has gone from 283,600 in 1985 to 76 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While cell phone abuse irritates some people, many are finding
these devices of convenience and security really are modern torture
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get away from people,'' said Ken Sereno, associate
professor of communications at the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Southern California. ``I feel
that way. That's why I'm reluctant to give people my cell phone
number. I think that supports the idea that it's intrusive and
prevents you from getting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sereno said cell phones have many obvious advantages,
among them giving ready access to 911.
</P>
<P>
   Don Slater, a Kirkland, Wash., resident in Los Angeles on
business, uses a cellular phone but only when he has to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a meeting, they're just annoying,'' the
53-year-old said. ``I don't consider anything in life so important
that I need my cell phone on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He might be the exception to the rule, however. In many ways,
cell phone abuse is a symptom of a technology moving too quickly
for society's rules of etiquette and civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much communications happening too quickly,'' said A.
Michael Noll, a USC communications professor.
</P>
<P>
   Like cowboys of the Old West, Noll said, it could get to the
point where ``we have to park our guns outside. Only instead of a
gun rack, people will park their cell phones in a cell phone
rack.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cell phones have vibrating modes, but that can be a
problem, particularly for women who don't wear their phone on their
belt.
</P>
<P>
   A Pacific Bell Wireless spokesman said the vibrating mode and
voice mail are designed specifically to defuse some of the
complaints now surfacing about cell phone abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage our customers to use the technology and features
of their phones to enhance convenience, safety and courtesy when
using the phones in public,'' said Brian Brokowski, a PacBell
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some cell phone users apparently don't care about their
intrusion, and some might even enjoy it, according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Self-Imposed Importance, or SIP,'' said Nancy
Friedman, president of Telephone Doctor, a St. Louis, Mo.-based
training company specializing in customer service and telephone
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disease that people get. It says, 'Hello, I'm
important. I have a cell phone.' The frustration with annoying cell
phone users is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   At California State University, Northridge, students in a
journalism class are asked to vote on whether a classmate should be
marked absent for the day if her or his cell phone or beeper goes
off. So far no one has been sent home.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Beth Shalom in the Los Angeles suburb of Encino, board
chairman Avery Greenburg said the synagogue put up signs a few
months ago asking people to turn off their cell phones and pagers
to ``be respectful of the services.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a growing number of restaurants in Southern California
that have banned cell phones is Millie's in Silver Lake, where the
staff will chant ``No phones, no phones'' to anyone who breaks the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never allowed cell phones in the eight years I've owned
this place,'' owner Patti Peck said. ``We're an old-fashioned
place. We like people to enjoy their food. You can't legislate
courtesy, but in our case we have the right to say, not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants in Hong Kong have ``cell phone'' and ``noncell
phone'' sections, said Sereno.
</P>
<P>
   And some Los Angeles County judges hold attorneys in contempt if
their phones ring in the courtroom. Court officials say they
haven't heard of the rule being enforced yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been occasions when a person's cell phone rings and
it's kept until the court is out of session for the day,'' said Los
Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   On area golf courses, those teeing up have become teed off by
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a recreational golfer, it's a slight annoyance,''
said Westlake Golf Course professional Ted Lehmann. ``But if you
are a serious golfer, it could disrupt your shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thomas, spokesman for the Southern California Golf
Association, said cell phone abuse is penalized on some courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etiquette doesn't happen without teaching people the rules of
etiquette. The way we do that is to penalize them when they break
the rules.''

   SACRAMENTO _ The Knicks tried to imitate the Kings' blinding
flash and telegenic moves only to find the uniforms didn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   All of this hocus-pocus _ quick shots, loose possessions and
circus attempts _ was as unnatural as imitation cheese for a team
that usually places defense as its priority. Without this staple,
the Knicks could not deter the Kings from executing their
sleight-of-hand ways, 103-95, at Arco Arena on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the feel-good high the Knicks were on after winning in
Portland was punctured with a loss that left them one game out of
the Atlantic Division lead. Once they tucked Phoenix away on
Tuesday night, the Heat took over the lead once again.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 hours earlier, a youthful-seeming Patrick Ewing had put
the Knicks in a tie with the Heat and had been anointed team
savior. On Tuesday night, his body language showed how worn the
elastic in his 37-year-old body can be. On Tuesday night, Chris
Webber reminded Ewing and the rest of the Knicks how inconsistency
remains the bane of their existence. Using an All-Star incident
with Coach Jeff Van Gundy as motivation, Webber humbled the Knicks
with a triple-double that read like this: 21 points, 11 assists and
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of a Kings team that shot 50 percent from the field.
As the reserve Pedgrag Stojakovic (20 points) slipped around the
soft defense of Allan Houston (33 points), as Vlade Divac (19
points) stepped outside to escape the lethargic Ewing (8 points),
the Knicks' undisciplined chase ended when the Kings use a 6-2 run
to close out a game that consisted of shots from a pool shark's
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't us; we like to buckle down and play solid
defense,'' Houston said. ``But they baited us out of that. We
didn't attack them on the defensive end. We can't allow another
team to dictate the game, especially on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so different Sunday night. The Knicks were in control and
Ewing was back on top after his heroics against the Trail Blazers.
On Tuesday night, he provided an uninspiring encore. Once Divac
opened up the third quarter with 11 points in eight minutes to put
the Kings up, 70-60, Ewing was taken out and sat for the next 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Knicks went on a 14-5 run that was fueled
with good defense on Webber by Marcus Camby and patience on offense
by Charlie Ward. Until then, Webber had been a problem for Larry
Johnson, who started out well with 9 points in the first quarter,
but found himself in foul trouble. ``I just sat on the bench,
didn't do nothing,'' said Johnson, who finished with 11 points and
missed five of his last six shots. ``The fouls? No biggie. I just
had to get out there and be professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson remained cool. Ewing did not. Soon after his return to
the game with 5 minutes 42 seconds left, he let his frustrations
boil over. After having his shot blocked by Divac and then getting
called for a foul on the other end, he barked obscenities at
Referee Nolan Fine with 4:23 left and the Knicks down, 94-86.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take technicals in the fourth, players or coaches,''
Van Gundy said. ``Points are too valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing was in a fit of anger, and probably a little
embarrassed by Divac's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just tired of everything,'' Ewing said. ``I thought I
was getting hit on my shot and not getting the calls they were. I'd
had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was an example of a team that lacked composure down the
stretch. Although they started getting serious on defense, and held
the Kings to 30 percent in the fourth, they were far too careless
on offense. With nine minutes left, Chris Childs went spinning into
the lane early in the shot clock and whirled up a crazy shot.
Between 5:19 and 5:16 left, Childs and Latrell Sprewell managed to
turn the ball over twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks finished with 15 turnovers, while the Kings had just
11. Even the usually untethered Jason Williams played with more
restraint than the Knicks' point guards. After two turnovers in the
opening minutes of the game _ which allowed the Knicks a brief
9-point first quarter lead _ he buttoned down and ended with 11
points, 4 assists and 4 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, buttoned down for Williams. He still winged passes behind
his back, but Webber was the coolest King on the floor. A day
before the game, he had told The Sacramento Bee he was still
irritated by Van Gundy's slight of him at the All-Star Game. During
the game, Van Gundy, who was wearing a microphone, said, ``Leave
Webber alone.'' As a response to Van Gundy's unwillingness to
double-team him in the All-Star Game, Webber told The Bee he wanted
to ``bust'' the Knicks on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he didn't double-team me again,'' Webber said after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had enough trouble keeping tabs on everyone else,
particularly Stojakovic. As hot as Houston was to burn Stojakovic's
soft defense, he was hit right back by the European. As one of the
Knicks' mental lapses on defense, Houston fouled Stojakovic from
3-point range in the fourth. Stojakovic hit all three free throws.
``I knew he was a shooter, but he moves really well,'' Houston
said. ``He makes guarding a tough team even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd part of the fourth was how the Kings played more like
the Knicks. In the tense finish, they tightened on defense and shut
the Knicks down. The Knicks hit just 5 of 20 shots in the fourth.
``That's what we're trying to do,'' Webber said. ``We have style,
but we have to keep substance with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually substantial Knicks just pretended to have style
instead of being true to themselves.

ASSESSMENT TEAM BLAMES ALL INVOLVED WITH MARS POLAR LANDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff writer Usha Sutliff contributed to this report) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The loss of the $165 million Mars Polar Lander was
most likely caused by a premature engine shutdown, which sent the
spacecraft crashing into the planet's surface at about 50 mph,
NASA-commissioned investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Program Assessment Team found fault with all key
players in the failed mission, including NASA, the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, which managed the effort; and Denver-based
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, which built the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited poor communication among the three parties and
inadequate testing of systems. It also said tight NASA budgets and
time constraints contributed to the doom of the Mars Polar Lander
and the $29 million Deep Space 2 probes it was to have deployed on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The report also laid down the law for future Mars efforts by
stating: ``If not ready, do not launch.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, JPL and
Lockheed officials pledged to make needed reforms and NASA
announced it was delaying the 2001 launch of another Mars lander.
The 2001 launch of a Mars orbiter will go on as planned. A NASA
official also said the agency would increase funding for needed
testing and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the report will be well-received,'' said JPL's John
Casani, who served on the assessment team.
</P>
<P>
   He said JPL is already implementing recommended organizational
changes, including the establishment of a separate management
office for Mars programs. Previous Mars efforts were managed by an
office that also oversees a number of unrelated JPL space programs.
</P>
<P>
   Casani, who retired in August as JPL's chief engineer and
returned as a consultant, said he was pleased with NASA's pledge of
more funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more funding or fewer programs, one or the other,''
Casani said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the Mars Polar Lander was 131 miles
above the Red Planet when it deployed its three landing legs as
planned. However, the deployment sent a false signal to the
engines, indicating the spacecraft had touched down.
</P>
<P>
   The engines shut down and sent the lander into a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Computer software designed to thwart false signals had been
tested before the lander's launch, the report said. But the system
had been incorrectly wired and failed to respond during the test.
</P>
<P>
   No full-scale follow-up test was conducted after the wiring had
been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Software was also the culprit in the Sept. 23 loss of the $125
million Mars Climate Orbiter, another NASA-JPL-Lockheed project.
The orbiter, which was to have relayed data from the Polar Lander,
burned up in the Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It veered off course after Lockheed engineers sent JPL
navigational data that they had failed to convert to metric
measurement units.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Young, the retired Lockheed Martin chief executive who
chaired the assessment team, also said that NASA, JPL and Lockheed
made ``a major mistake'' when they failed to equip the lander with
a device that would send signals to controllers during the landing.
The equipment was deleted to cut the cost and the weight of the
lander.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Young noted, investigators might never know the
true fate or location of the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories on the demise of the Mars Polar Lander include a
tumbling fall into a mile-deep canyon, a breakdown of fuel systems
and the failure of a parachute designed to brake the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Young and Edward J. Weiler, NASA associate administrator
for space science, cited cost restraints on the Mars Climate
Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. They noted that both spacecraft had
budgets below the $200 million spent on Pathfinder, the successful
lander that broadcast the first images of Mars to Earth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander) had been a
little less cheap, they would have been a lot better,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission was underfunded from the start and people tried to
work in a box,'' said Peter Lyman, a Pasadena-based consultant and
member of the assessment team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have people working 60- to 80-hour weeks, you get
fatigue and the wrong risks are taken,'' added Lyman, who was
involved in the successful Viking and Voyager programs during 30
years at JPL.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler, who stressed that the effort to find life on Mars would
continue, had high praise for JPL's staff members, calling them
``the best talent in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed JPL too far,'' added Weiler. He pledged ``not to ask
JPL to do the impossible'' on future missions.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA administrator also said that despite the delay of the
2001 launch, work would go on at JPL on improving the newest Mars
lander. He also said that NASA, which had required officials at JPL
and Lockheed to deal with a number of agency officials, had begun
its own reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   He announced the appointment of Scott Hubbard, a veteran of
several major space efforts at the Ames Research Lab in Sunnyvale,
as NASA's Mars program director.
</P>
<P>
   At JPL, Director Ed Stone announced the formation of the Science
Flight Projects Directorate, which will be headed by JPL employee
Thomas Gavin and focus on overseeing space science missions at the
lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of individuals not doing their job. Every
individual was in fact doing their best for mission success,''
Stone said. ``There were not enough checks and balances in place to
catch the inevitable human errors which are made. ... In the
future, we will be sure that the budget is such that we can have
the appropriate JPL work force engaged in all these missions.''

   UGANDA-CULT (Rugazi, Uganda) _ In one room, the concrete floor
looked a little newer and, on a hunch, the police began to dig.
First they found a human foot, sole upturned, poking up from the
rubble. Within a few hours Tuesday, 28 corpses were hauled out of a
pit _ carefully sealed over with cement, maybe months ago _ inside
the house owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark,
the pit was only half emptied. It was, on one level, another
horrifying discovery in the two weeks since more than 300 people
were found burnt to death at a church not far from here. The death
toll, from three different sites, has now risen to at least 593.
There are at least two more suspected grave sites. But the
discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well-organized and,
perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in Uganda was. By

in his own home. Cherie Blair, 45, is seven months' pregnant with

Haitian immigrant and made payments on a little house in southwest
Florida. They had two children here, Jean Gardy, now 6, and Gaelle,
21 months. Ms. Pierre has received a deportation order from the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and barring one last,
thin appeal, said her Miami lawyer, she will be sent back. Her
husband, who also entered the U.S. on fake documents, has also been
ordered home. But their children, born here, are U.S. citizens by
birthright and cannot be deported. So, Ms. Pierre, like thousands

   TENN-EXECUTE (Nashville) _ Philip Workman, who was convicted of
killing a police officer during a fast-food restaurant robbery in
1981 in Memphis, could become the first person executed in
Tennessee in 40 years. Lawyers for Workman, whose execution is
scheduled for April 6, have made a fairly compelling case about the
fairness of his trial, including some ballistics evidence that
suggests the officer may have been killed by friendly fire from
other cops. The only eyewitness at the trial has recanted, saying
he fabricated his story after being coached and threatened by
police. And just a few weeks ago, the medical examiner turned over
a potentially exculpatory x-ray of the victim that had never been
seen by the defense. The issue may ultimately be whether Workman is
guilty of felony murder even if he didn't fire the fatal shot
because he clearly committed the crime that led to the officer's
death. The question is now before the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals. By Kevin Sack.

lot of money and was looking for a bullhorn. Both found it in an
obscure corner of the IRS known as Section 527, a provision that
allows groups to raise and spend unlimited sums on political
activities without any disclosure as long as they do not expressly
advocate voting for one candidate or another. Section 527 has
become the loophole of choice this year for groups large and small,

have not, by and large, passed along the higher costs, in part
because global competition and a relatively strong dollar have made
it unwise to raise prices. Even inflation hawks, including Alan

far, however, the higher petroleum costs have not for the most part

The goal was to move the orange down the entire line in less than

enhance communication and promote problem solving. And, oh yes: to
have a hoot in the process. But after the fun ended, employees
returned to their desks, submerged themselves in their daily chores
and forgot all about the great fruit exchange. More and more

   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who go 20-20 when the writing's on
the wall, have saved some graffiti for their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Dallas Mavericks had the last word Tuesday
night, walking away with a 112-102 victory over the Clips before
10,157 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyrone Nesby and interim coach Jim Todd made additional
statements in a verbal scrimmage that soured what could be termed
an entertaining defeat.
</P>
<P>
   More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   With Lamar Odom (calf strain) and Maurice Taylor (ankle sprain)
joining the usual casualties (Brian Skinner, Eric Murdoch) in
street wear, the Clippers (14-58, eight losses in a row) were given
superb moments from other sources.

   The aforementioned roll call of the wounded created a few more
shots for the common Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys in suits on the bench,'' said Todd on
taking on the Mavericks, who actually suit up nine assistant
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But his team's combative nature impressed the Dallas head coach,
Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me congratulate the Clippers,'' Nelson said. ``Olowokandi
just dominated our inside people, and that's good news for him. But
the Clippers really pushed us with three starters out of their
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, just two. Nesby did start and produced eight points before
a disagreement with Todd on the sense of responsibility led to a
spot on the bench and a halftime confrontation over, well, shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby declared his opposition to the team waiving close friend
Troy Hudson by writing Hudson's name on his sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Todd) subbed me out and I got mad,'' Nesby said. ``Then at
halftime, he got mad because I had Troy's name on my shoes. He told
me he wasn't going to play me for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   You're witness, coach Todd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving it at disciplinary reasons,'' Todd said as
explanation for why Nesby didn't play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Clippers actually led, 55-51, at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (31-40) used 20 points each from triple-doubler Michael
Finley (12 rebounds, 10 assists) and Dirk Nowitzki to extend its
winning streak over the Clippers to six. The Mavericks made 13 of
26 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive word should be aimed at Etdrick Bohannon, a CBA
escapee who grabbed five rebounds in 11 minutes in his Clipper
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he used me this early,'' Bohannon said of
Todd. ``I thought I would have more of an impact on the game,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Clipper gurney keeps rolling, he'll probably get the
chance. But playing time for the acrobatic Nesby could be up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can put me on injured reserve the rest of the year,'' Nesby
said. ``That's cool with me.''
</P>

ONE WORKPLACE GREAT, ONE NOT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ In the dirty old heart of the city ...
<P>
   THEY'RE DROPPING like flies in SoMa, the traditional businesses
that are being priced out of the neighborhood by the
Johnny-dot-com-latelies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firms that recently closed up was, I'm told, San
Francisco's only locally based phone-sex company, headquartered on
Second St. The rent tripled and that was it for a business that
thrived for about 15 years, and about 50 hard-working and creative
women are out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company was one of the few places where a woman from any
part of the world, with limited job skills, could get work with
decent pay and good benefits,'' says Serena, who worked the phones
for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had quite a mixture of employees, all ages and races, from
college students to housewives to grandmothers, who were always
quite good at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss is a wonderful, wonderful man. We had catered food
every Friday and great benefits. More babies were born to my
co-workers than at any other place I've ever worked, and none of
the mothers had to pay a dime for hospital care. In scheduling, the
company worked with each employee's needs and was sensitive to
family problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great job, if you have the stomach for it, because it
can get kind of weird. But it's amazing the honest-to-god
friendships that form over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'm going now, but I'll be damned lucky if
I find anything even remotely comparable to this company. As far as
I'm concerned, gentrification can go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, I love it when you talk like that.
</P>
<P>
   ON HIS WAY to work recently at one of S.F.'s very very big
corporations, a man died of a heart attack on BART.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee from the corporation's executive office was on
the train and reported the tragedy when she arrived at the big
office downtown. Nothing was done, no calls made.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office called to get a phone number for the dead
man's wife, a teacher, but nobody had the number.
</P>
<P>
   The wife phoned at about 4 o'clock to speak to her husband, but
the husband's boss declined to speak to her.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 minutes, her call was routed to the new human resources
manager, first day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very human going on there. But they can always pay their
rent.
</P>
<P>
   THE JUDGE likes to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   He's a traffic court judge and they know him at all the
neighborhood bars because he's a neighborhood guy. Everybody calls
him Judge. W'as up, Judge?
</P>
<P>
   They are amazed that he makes it to court every morning, because
he likes to stay out late. Maybe his secret is the sleep he gets at
the bar, standing up, using his right arm for support.
</P>
<P>
   He likes white wine and he's not a mean drunk, although they say
he can get kind of grouchy if you bump him while he's trying to get
some shut-eye.
</P>
<P>
   SHE'S LATE for the Big Utility's board meeting and can't find a
parking place in the city, imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   The big board member finally wheels into a parking garage, yells
to the attendant that she has to get to a very big board meeting,
they can't start without her. She leaves the key in the ignition
and dashes off.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a valet lot. When she returns after the meeting,
the car is gone, stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The other board members spring into action, ordering office
minions to comb the neighborhood. Then they call a limo for Ms.
Bigshot. And later they vote to buy her a new car, but then her car
is recovered.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why your Big Utility bill is so big.
</P>
<P>
   BEHOLD the lowly Parking and Traffic Officer, the meter maid,
object of scorn and loathing by the city's drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Now meet one of them, B. Lance Greenfield, veteran of the force.
</P>
<P>
   There's Lance, putt-putting south on Eighth St. in his
three-wheeler, a glorified golf cart, when he sees a car turn off
Brannan onto Eighth. It's a one-way street and the car is going the
wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Greenfield alertly stops his DPTmobile in the middle of
the street across two lanes, to halt the cars behind him and give
the errant driver time to realize his mistake and turn around.
</P>
<P>
   But the errant driver is making his own rules. He guns his car
straight for Officer Greenfield's cart and rams it at about 40 mph.
Greenfield, with three fractured ribs and a mangled kneecap, crawls
out of his vehicle and phones the cops on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong-way driver, in a Pac Bell car he has just stolen from
the company lot on 16th St., then slams head-on into a taxi, jumps
out and flees. The taxi driver gives chase, tackles the bad guy and
holds him down to wait for the police. But the bad guy's friends
pull up in another car and threaten the Good Samaritan cabbie, who
has no choice but to let the bad guy go.
</P>
<P>
   So the man gets away and Greenfield gets to spend a month trying
to breathe without pain and waiting for the swelling in his knee to
go down so he can have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for information in the case of the man who tried to
road-kill one of your dedicated officers is now up to (most recent
tally): Zero dollars.

MEDICINES CAN ALTER SENSE OF TASTE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most prescription drugs not only are
foul-tasting but also can lead to profound changes in the sense of
taste, particularly in older people, scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drug researchers hope to use the latest findings to make
medicines easier to take while also gaining a better idea of what
happens to the senses as people age.
</P>
<P>
   New studies on the chemistry of taste were presented Tuesday
during the national meeting of the American Chemical Society, under
way this week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Among conference highlights, taste experts said they are closing
in on a long-sought ``sweet tooth'' gene believed to influence how
people perceive some flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists working with mice already have narrowed it down to
about a 100-gene region of the mouse's set of genetic instructions,
or genome, which closely mirrors the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The key segments of human DNA underlying taste differences are
expected to become clear within about six months to a year, said
Gary Beauchamp, an expert on taste genetics at the Monell Chemical
Senses Center in Philadelphia, which bills itself as ``the world's
first scientific institute for multidisciplinary research on taste,
smell and chemosensory irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Schiffman, professor of medical psychology at Duke
University, summarized elaborate taste tests involving 62
prescription medications.
</P>
<P>
   Her research found that brief exposure to a bitter taste
releases a flood of stress-related neurotransmitters, presumably
part of a natural response to a sense of being poisoned. Such
responses could help explain problems of wasting and appetite loss
in patients on a steady regimen of bitter, taste-distorting
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy patients lose, on average, 20 to 30 pounds.
Scientists hope the new wave of research will lead to ways for
improving taste and smell, perhaps giving cancer patients more
ability to withstand high-dose therapies.
</P>
<P>
   In Schiffman's laboratory, tongues of research volunteers were
dabbed with samples of pharmaceuticals at concentrations four times
above a previously determined ``detection threshold.'' Subjects
were then given a choice of 14 adjectives to characterize the
dominant taste sensation.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, only three adjectives _ bitter, sour and
metallic _ were needed to describe all the drugs that had any taste
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Mind-altering drugs were found to taste ``awful,'' Schiffman
said, while some analgesics were among those rated ``least awful.''
Nearly all the anti-microbials tested were deemed ``terrible'' to
the taste.
</P>
<P>
   Nine AIDS drugs tested were all found to be peculiarly bitter.
Saquinavir, sold under the brand name Invirase, the first of the
protease inhibitors to hit the market, also turned out to be
detectable at the lowest concentration of any drug tested.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming what many patients on long-term anti-HIV therapy have
experienced, researchers concluded that taking antivirals can
dramatically and unpredictably alter the taste of other things.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffman said she is just starting experiments designed to sort
out the complex biochemistry involved in taste distortion, a
phenomenon, known clinically as dysguesia, also associated with the
aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old alike perceive some of the worst-tasting
medicines, particularly anti-microbials, as bitter, in part because
such drugs tend to be highly soluble in fat, a characteristic that
drug designers cannot easily do much about.
</P>
<P>
   But studies are now being conducted to find designer ``bitter
blockers'' _ potentially yet another category of drugs that may
someday be prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   An even more intriguing puzzle concerns how the taste-sensing
system can change as a result of aging, as well as from a steady
diet of medicines. These changes may occur not only in how taste
buds on the tongue respond to a given chemical, but also in how the
brain processes taste signals.
</P>
<P>
   Gene studies ``may explain quite a bit,'' Beauchamp said,
although he conceded that upbringing, cultural influences and
numerous other factors influence changing tastes.

 DAVIS SEEKS CESAR CHAVEZ HOLIDAY BILL BY FRIDAY  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Looking to capitalize on the media's love of
coincidences, Gov. Gray Davis hopes to sign a bill making Cesar
Chavez' birthday a state holiday on Friday _ the late labor
leader's date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Davis asked the Legislature to speed passage of a
bill making the former United Farm Workers union leader's March 31
birthday a paid holiday for state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wants the bill before Friday, so he can sign the measure
in Los Angeles, the state's largest media market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appropriate to have the bill signed on the date of this
great hero's birthday,'' said Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles,
the author of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is gaining a reputation for usurping popular bills in
order to maximize his public exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, Davis' press secretary, denies lawmakers are
rushing the bill through at the governor's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not driving it,'' Bustamante said. ``I don't think we
asked them to speed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Using bill signings for political gain is nothing new in
Sacramento, but Davis has taken it upon himself to be prominently
associated with some of the most popular legislation he has signed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor staged two large-scale press conferences on last
year's assault weapons ban _ one held in Los Angeles and the other
in San Francisco _ and at both he was surrounded by police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Davis staged a photo opportunity to announce his
support for a Senate bill to fight a bug that causes Pierce's
Disease, a bacteria that is threatening the state's all-important
wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chavez bill, the plan is for the Assembly Appropriations
Committee to hear the bill Thursday morning, then waive the
Assembly's rules and take it up on the Assembly floor.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote by the state Senate is also needed before the bill
goes to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor's sudden request that lawmakers speed up
approval of the bill is a sharp change from earlier this year when
administration aides privately told lawmakers the price of the bill
was prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante confirmed that the governor was worried about the $90
million cost of giving a holiday to court, school and state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at Davis' request, the bill was scaled back to just a
holiday for state workers _ a move that angered some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To create a Chavez holiday that gives state workers a day off
and leaves farmworkers toiling in the field is misdirected,'' said
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Clovis. ``Scholarships for children of
farmworkers would be a much more fitting tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante says limiting the bill to state workers now lowers
the price tag to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, using
figures provided by Davis' own administration, pegs the costs at
$34 million to give the state's nearly 280,000 employees another
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   State workers already enjoy 13 paid holidays a year. They also
have a memorial day for Chavez which allows workers to take March
31 off in lieu of another holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Chavez's birthday to the paid holiday list would also
cost an additional $12.5 million to pay time-and-a-half to health
and safety workers like prison guards and highway patrol officers
who would have to work on the holiday, according to administration
figures.

DOMESTIC PARTNER RIGHTS OKD BY ASSEMBLY PANEL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ A trio of bills expanding the rights of domestic
partners to include inheriting property, making funeral
arrangements and legal standing to sue for wrongful death were
approved Tuesday by a key Assembly committee.
<P>
   The measures would greatly broaden California's domestic
partners law, which allows partners to register with the state and
have hospital visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters claimed the bills are modest and humane changes to
the law. Opponents said there were already legal mechanisms
available to solve the problems the bills address and that
approving them would promote same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still live in a society in which there are certain taboos
and phobias about people who choose a lifestyle that might be
different from our own,'' said Assemblywoman Gloria Romero, D-Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a bill about morality. It is not a bill about
redefining marriage,'' Romero said of her bill, which allows a
domestic partner registered with the state to make medical
decisions for an incapacitated partner.
</P>
<P>
   The first public hearings on the bills come three weeks after
voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 22, which prevents
California from legally recognizing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of the domestic partnership bills said polls show
that even Californians opposed to same-sex marriage are willing to
increase domestic partner benefits. The bills are the first efforts
of lawmakers to build on Gov. Gray Davis' approval last year of a
bill that creates a statewide registry for domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the proposed legislation is unknown, however. A
Davis spokeswoman said the governor had no position.
</P>
<P>
   If last year was any indication, Davis is unlikely to embrace
such sweeping changes. He made lawmakers water down the domestic
partners bills and finally consolidate them into one measure before
signing it.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposed rights for domestic partners are contained in
three bills: AB 1990 by Romero, AB 2047 by Assemblyman Darrell
Steinberg, D-Sacramento and AB 2211 by Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl,
D-Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   For partners who register with the state, the three bills give
them the rights to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sue for negligent infliction of emotional distress and
wrongful death, the same right spouses have.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make funeral arrangements and autopsy decisions for a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be the conservator for a partner or the partner's estate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be a beneficiary of a partner's will.
</P>
<P>
   -- Inherit property from a partner if that partner has no will.
</P>
<P>
   -- Act as administrator of a partner's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehl's bill also would have California recognize domestic
partnerships from other states but would only afford those couples
the rights extended to partners in California.
</P>
<P>
   California began official recognition of domestic partnerships
three months ago by creating a statewide registry.
</P>
<P>
   A domestic partnership is defined as a couple, over 18 years of
age, ``who have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate
and committed relationship of mutual caring.''
</P>
<P>
   People 62 years old or older and living together also can
registered with the state as domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Secretary of State's office, which maintains the
registry, has received 2,805 applications.
</P>
<P>
   Being registered confers no special benefits. Domestic partners
are granted hospital visitation rights under the bill creating the
registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just adds a few benefits for those who register,'' Kuehl
told the Assembly Judiciary committee, which approved all three
bills on party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said many of the benefits the bills seek to
provide are unneeded if domestic partners use existing legal
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   People already can designate whomever they wish to act as a
conservator or grant them power of attorney to make medical and
financial decisions, said Steven Burlingham, a Sacramento family
law lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not asking too much to merely check a box and sign a
form, particularly when we're asking people to register as domestic
partners,'' Burlingham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jane Pearce, another Sacramento family law lawyer, said she
favored the bills.
</P>
<P>
   She said 20 percent of her clients are gay and lesbian couples
seeking estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the lucky ones. Lucky they have knowledge that
planning is essential for them to protect their last wishes,''
Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   The bills still must move through the Assembly and be approved
by the Senate before being sent to Davis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in the big city, cultural ripples from back home
can assert themselves
</P>
<P>
   Here's the scene: It's Mardi Gras night in Kansas City. A
downtown block party, a near-debauch with beer and a band, attracts
a couple of artist-made floats: wacky, bejeweled trucks, things
like that.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the evening, the bed of a pickup truck receives
a layer of mud and becomes an ad hoc wrestling ring. As the truck
and the other floats begin to head down the street for a short
parade, two bad girls go at it. Everybody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can look at girl mud wrestling in any number of ways:
Is it a) a spectacular performance art, b) a pathetic yahoo
regression or c) a neo-feminist pose?
</P>
<P>
   A few culture-centric days in New York will prompt big life
questions like that.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker notwithstanding, you can celebrate your place in the
human crowd while riding the subway. At the same time you can
engage in a lively sort of contemplation, a kind of synaptic
pinball that doesn't always unfold during the behind-the-wheel
commute back home. One subway thought hypertexts to the next, and
pretty soon the idea of wrestling's place in the culture begins to
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been reminded of that Kansas City mud-wrestling scene as I
passed an attitudinal shop window in lower Manhattan, where a
bumper sticker shouted, ``Girls Kick Ass.'' It's part of the new
consciousness that turns self-made young women into girls (or,
often, ``grrrls''), whether they're in cyberspace or the mud pit.
Forget the Martha Stewart thing; the operative image is Xena in Doc
Martens.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, of course, is in the air. Judging from the TV ratings
and bookdom's best-seller lists, you can hardly avoid the new
over-the-top celebrities. (Hello, Chyna. Howdy, Mankind.)
</P>
<P>
   But what does all that have to do with culture?
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically, we wrestle with big ideas, when we have the
time, which isn't often. Writers and readers wrestle with words,
and artists of all kinds wrestle with perception, consciousness and
the tools of their expression.
</P>
<P>
   But, literally, wrestling and its muscle-popping cousins can
show up when you least expect it.
</P>
<P>
   At the opera, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The current Metropolitan Opera season in New York includes a
smashingly surreal production of the Shostakovich ``Lady MacBeth of
Mstensk.'' It has everything one could hope for in the opera:
seduction, sex, betrayal, death _ and wrestling, if only for one
sweaty moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the starring role Catherine Malfitano has a huge voice and
pours her zaftig frame into a series of blond-bombshell dresses _
imagine Shelley Winters in a Marilyn Monroe number.
</P>
<P>
   In an early scene the sultry, unsatisfied Katerina (Malfitano)
confronts the swaggering new laborer Sergei (Vladimir Galouzine) in
the work yard outside the home she shares with her cold,
businessman husband and his domineering father.
</P>
<P>
   Katerina protests when the workmen fondle the family cook, and
she stands up for the strength of women. She is taken aback when
Sergei grabs her hand and proposes a little upstairs-downstairs
wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic grapple that ensues is played out against a steamy
backdrop: a male-chorus orgy of bump-and-grinding sexuality, a
scene that seems to have been imported from one of those
Christopher Street leather bars one hears about.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the spark is lighted and later Sergei and Katerina
end up, er, upstairs, in that other kind of tangle, atop her
hot-pink bed.
</P>
<P>
   HHH
</P>
<P>
   There's no sex in David Mamet's play ``American Buffalo.'' But
the language is raw, and there is an eruption of violence, a
momentary smackdown of sorts, in Mamet's thinly veiled rant against
the evils of American business.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's 25-year-old play is enjoying a thrilling run, first in
London and now at the Atlantic Theatre Company, the actor-friendly
Chelsea house that Mamet founded with William H. Macy. Macy (he's
everywhere) heads the cast of thieving lowlifes, along with veteran
Philip Baker Hall and young Mark Webber, making an impressive
theatrical debut as Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Buffalo'' seems as vital as ever, and the way Mamet
conquers all with words is simply astounding. (``That's what
business is,'' says Hall's Don, proprietor of Don's Resale Shop,
the play's sole set, ``people taking care of themselves.'')
</P>
<P>
   The stage is a convincing junk-shop repository of American
consumerism: broken radios, stacks of dusty books, milk crates of
LPs, shelves of old luggage ring the action; a dartboard, a saw and
a cheap guitar hang from the back wall. No wrestling paraphernalia
that I could see, but there was a Chicago Bears pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to smother you in theory,'' Mamet's Teach
(Macy), a tightly wrapped bundle of aggression and angst, blurts
out in a typical bit of irony.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, could be the motto of wrestling's Vince McMahon
and company, the entrepreneurial force behind the resurgence of
testosterone entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   HHH
</P>
<P>
   Only in retrospect did it occur to me that evidence could be
gathered no matter where I turned up in New York. Even at the Frick
Collection, in all its quiet, Upper-East-Side, old-money glory.
</P>
<P>
   Among the treasures are a pair of gorgeous, allegorical
paintings by Veronese. Four hundred years old. In one of them,
``Wisdom and Strength,'' the brain wrestles with brawn and comes
out, if not the victor, then at least in the lead. The painting
depicts Hercules, with all his brute force and courage, and
Minerva, goddess of wisdom and the arts. She has the upper hand,
and her heavenward gaze trumps Hercules' apparent submission.
</P>
<P>
   Veronese's background reinforces the subtext of culture vs.
nature: Minerva stands in front of a fluted column and Hercules
against a backdrop of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, deep in the shadow of the painting, at the base of
Minerva's column, is the inscription ``Omnia Vanitas'' (all is
vanity).
</P>
<P>
   Our girl mud wrestlers _ remember them? _ might find inspiration
in a mysterious, haunting object that stands as the centerpiece of
a charming and understated exhibit currently showing at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. It's the ``Leonine Goddess,'' a
5,000-year-old piece of carved and polished limestone that is said
to come from southwestern Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is the signature item of the Guennol Collection,
the eclectic holdings of A.B. and Edith Martin, who since the late
1940s have sought out rare and beautiful objects from around the
world: Olmec jade, carved Egyptian marble, painted-wood folk art
from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Martins admire pays homage to the natural
world, but their connoisseurship extends to humor and the
often-unexplainable sublimities that art and the human hand present
to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   At less than 4 inches tall, the ``Leonine Goddess'' packs much
more aesthetic wallop than one might first expect. The lion's head
is turned to its left, and from the shoulders down the figure seems
like nothing less than a human body builder, hands clasped, elbows
out, pecs and arm muscles bulging.
</P>
<P>
   It's far more subtle than the mud-covered faux warriors in the
back of a Kansas City pickup. And, in its way, it's far more
effective as an astounding portrait of pride and assertive
identity. Grrrl power. Hear it roar.

THE WELL OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  Nature never set forth the earth in
so rich tapestry as divers poets have done; neither with so
pleasant rivers, fruitful trees, sweet-smelling flowers, nor
whatsoever else may make the too much loved earth more lovely.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Sir Philip Sidney, ``The Defence of Poesy,'' 1595
</P>
<P>
   Poetry has been under attack for hundreds of years. Long before
Sir Philip Sidney's time and long after, it was accused of
promoting immorality and impure thoughts, in addition to being a
terrible waste of one's time.
</P>
<P>
   When not being oppressed, poetry has been overlooked. It has
never been as popular as prose, as mainstream as music, as, well,
theatrical as theater. In the last century, poetry has faced
increasing competition, with the rise of the novel; the birth of
film, radio, TV; and the evolution of computers from scientific
tool to entertainment powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that in 2000, poetry is ... more vital than
ever?
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, yes. April is National Poetry Month, and to hear
people talk, there's much to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a hunger to hear words used well,'' says
Rebekah Presson Mosby, who produces spoken-word recordings for
Rhino Records. ``People are burned out on the vulgarity and
ugliness and flatness of language they hear on TV and in movies
these days. People know instinctively that there is power in the
spoken word, and what they're hearing ... isn't evoking that power.
Poetry contains the tools they can use to unlock their souls.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it contains enough appeal to survive commercially.
Rhino recently released ``Our Souls Have Grown Deep Like the
Rivers,'' a collection of African-American poets reading their
works. Recently it stood at No. 1,300 on amazon.com's sales list _
which isn't bad, considering that the list includes hundreds of
thousands of books, CDs and other titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first compilation I did for Rhino, 1996's `In Their Own
Voices: A Century of Poetry,' blew the lid off Rhino's expectations
for sales,'' Mosby says. ``They thought they'd sell 5,000 copies,
and they've sold 10 times that amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course these two examples involve listening to poetry, not
reading it. These days, though, that's the point: Poetry is finding
its way off the page and into pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Electric verse
</P>
<P>
   Mosby, who for years was host for Kansas City's ``New Letters on
the Air'' program but now lives in Hamilton, N.Y., believes that
one of the forces behind poetry's popularity is its return to the
oral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dimension you get from hearing a poem that you can't
get from reading it. ... Even if a poet is not a good reader, you
still learn something about their work from hearing how their voice
works the line endings, the rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Vando Hickok may be a publisher (she operates KC's
Helicon Nine Press), but she agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more poetry readings, poetry on television, on
the radio _ and on records; and there's also hip-hop and rap. It's
becoming more of a spoken art, like it used to be. In the '50s
there were a lot of poetry readings, then it went underground. Now
the coffeeshop has come back, and poetry has come back with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, poet//activist Bob Holman spreads the news that
poetry matters. Last April he drew 10,000 people to the People's
Poetry Gathering, which featured writers ranging from rocker Ani
DiFranco to U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky. The next gathering
will be in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem with getting an audience for poetry is how
poetry is defined,'' Holman says. ``As long as it's defined as
exquisite but elitist art, it will attract an exquisite but elitist
audience. ... But when you can define poetry as Ani DiFranco, you
start to see a different kind of vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People enjoy reading with their ears. The sounds in poems are
as critical to meaning as are the texts. Text has proven to be a
very acute method of transmission, but something is lost in that
transmission. It can be reconstituted, like orange juice, if you
read it aloud and hear the meaning. ... It puts the tongue back in
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman is working on a series for PBS called ``The World of
Poetry'' that will be an international sequel to his ``United
States of Poetry.'' He also plans to open a poetry nightclub in a
building he's buying in downtown Manhattan _ a ``seven-day-a-week
poetry hangout spot.''
</P>
<P>
   KC may not be ready for that yet, but there are plenty of
readings here: the Riverfront series, the Writers Place, events
scattered among the local bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   But are we to abandon texts altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Looks good on paper
</P>
<P>
   Helicon Nine has been holding literary contests for a decade,
and poetry submissions outnumber prose offerings 3-to-1, Hickok
says. There is no shortage of poets.
</P>
<P>
   And no shortage of outlets for their talents. Last month the
Mid-America Press Inc. of Warrensburg, Mo., produced the inaugural
issue of The Mid-America Poetry Review. The new review will focus
on poets from Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Robert C. Jones is optimistic but also apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions, because I look what's going on with
major publishers,'' Jones says. ``They're publishing a million
copies of `thud and blunder' stories, and people seem to be buying
it. But the typical poetry book press run is usually under 10,000
and more like 500 to a thousand _ and bookstores have trouble
selling that many.''
</P>
<P>
   If not books, though, can a thrice-a-year journal survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of betting that regionalism is making a comeback,''
Jones says of his decision to focus on the seven-state area. As for
marketing, he's sending complimentary copies to libraries, working
on a Web site to allow Internet sales and selling copies by mail.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones is encouraged about the quality of work. ``I'm seeing
some marvelous poetry. There's always the `moon, june, spoon'
doggerel kind of thing, but there are also some tremendous poets
writing in our seven states.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stewart, managing editor of KC's New Letters literary
magazine, not only agrees on the quality issue but also isn't
bothered that poetry will never be as popular as other art forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap lies in the fact that mass-media culture has a natural
aversion to it because serious poetry _ not to mean humorless, but
poetry as art _ by its nature is eccentric, that is, original and
unpredictable, which generally is not how the mass media wants to
appeal to a wide audience base.''
</P>
<P>
   But those not glued to a screen of some kind do turn out for
poetry events.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1984 the Midwest Poets Series, which I run, attracted about
40 people for a major poet, Mona Van Duyn,'' Stewart says. ``Today
a relatively unknown poet will attract an audience of 150 easily,
and last October W.S. Merwin on two consecutive nights drew 300 and
400 people, respectively.''
</P>
<P>
   G.S. Sharat Chandra, an internationally known poet and writer of
eight books who is also a professor at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City, enjoys the ``private'' kind of fame that
being a poet provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is true that poetry is marginalized ... but I can't
think of any time that it has not been. It has never been
commercially feasible; poets can't make money out of writing
poetry, and publishers can't make money out of publishing poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional exceptions, Chandra notes: James Dickey,
Robert Frost, Dylan Thomas. ``By and large, though, I think poets
always stay in the shadows and most are content to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry is not a public art. It's a private art, and the
aesthetics are such that the enjoyment one gets is very personal.
However, I feel exuberant about what has been happening in the last
decade or so. There does seem to be more attention given to poetry
and more poetry written by good writers.''
</P>
<P>
   `Ancient lava'
</P>
<P>
   In the archives of a Web site called Poetry Daily
(www.poems.com), one may find a poem called ``Parchment'' by
Michelle Boisseau. She also has published in the traditional way:
two books of poetry and a how-to book with Robert Wallace called
Writing Poems. She is an associate professor of English at UMKC.
Boisseau seems delighted with poetry no matter the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry is ancient lava, really. It's the oldest form of using
words that we have, and it connects us back to our earliest roots.
Most of the time when we read newspapers or even novels, the words
are there to convey information or provide data. But with poetry,
the words themselves have the power.''
</P>
<P>
   In our high-tech age, poetry wouldn't seem to be a good fit. And
yet Boisseau says poetry is one of the most sought-after subjects
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems strange that poems would be right up there with
pornography,'' she says with a laugh. She is pleased that poetry is
extending tendrils into the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have a misconception of poetry as something
elite and far removed from everyday language, like truffles or
Camembert. But really it's more akin to something you pull out of
your garden. We're used to eating language that is canned.
Sometimes when students get their first taste of a poem, it
quickens them in an amazing way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry is for people who love the twists and turns of
sentences and the sizzle of an interesting metaphor. After awhile
as an adult, you know how all the stories turn out _ but there's
nothing like a good poem.''
</P>

WILL POETRY'S RENAISSANCE LAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't put one over on Al Young. At 60, the Berkeley, Calif.,
poet is in a good position to answer a question: Will America's new
infatuation with poetry last?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough to have seen a lot of fads come on strong, then
roll on down the poetry pike,'' he said. ``Right now we're going
through a renaissance that is unlike anything America has seen
since the 19th century, which was a great time for poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen this before. When times get tough, poetry comes
back. Look at its popularity in the 1950s, a time that wasn't
really all Ike and Hula-Hoops. We grew up believing that at any
moment someone was going to drop the bomb and it would be all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're having another hard time. Everything has been
desacralized. Sitcoms make laughingstocks of people who were
hippies, of civil rights, which is supposedly over _ now that's
considered hokey and corny. Poetry is the way of expressing a lot
of things that can't be expressed otherwise, things that are now
looked upon with suspicion in a predominantly cynical era.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American poetry is flourishing, too. A lot of the
younger voices are coming from hip-hop and the vocal tradition that
is flourishing because of recordings and the Internet and all that.
There is a profusion of poetry by African-Americans and people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``When CEOs are getting $2 million bonuses and workers are being
laid off, we have every right to question things, but not enough
questioning is being done. I teach at St. Mary's College in Moraga,
and I asked my students to write a poem of social significance, and
they had a really hard time with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard times are good for poetry. And we're probably looking at
some protracted uncertainty. National entities like the United
States are breaking down and the corporate structure is taking
over. We're seeing the country of Microsoft, the country of IBM.
These are the new powers and they are unenlightened in terms of how
they regard human beings, because it's all about profit margins and
returns on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But Al! Will it last?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's here to stay.''

CULTURE TAKES TO THE MAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  NEW YORK _ Even in the big city,
cultural ripples from back home can assert themselves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick cut to a Kansas City flashback: It's Mardi Gras night. A
Crossroads block party, a near-debauch with beer and a band,
attracts a couple of artist-made floats: wacky, bejewelled trucks,
things like that.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the evening, the bed of a pickup truck receives
a layer of mud and becomes an ad hoc wrestling ring. As the truck
and the other floats begin to head down the street for a short
parade, two wild girls go at it. Everybody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can look at girl mud wrestling in any number of ways:
Is it a) a spectacular performance art, b) a pathetic yahoo
regression or c) a neo-feminist pose?
</P>
<P>
   A few culture-centric days in New York will prompt big life
questions like that.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker notwithstanding, you can celebrate your place in the
human crowd while riding the subway. At the same time you can
engage in a lively sort of contemplation, a kind of synaptic
pinball that doesn't always unfold during the behind-the-wheel
commute back home. One subway thought hypertexts to the next, and
pretty soon the idea of wrestling's place in the culture begins to
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been reminded of that Kansas City mud-wrestling scene as I
passed an attitudinal shop window in lower Manhattan, where a
bumper sticker shouted, ``Girls Kick Ass.'' It's part of the new
consciousness that turns self-made young women into girls (or,
often, ``grrrls''), whether they're in cyberspace or the mud pit.
Forget the Martha Stewart thing; the operative image is Xena in Doc
Martens.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, of course, is in the air. Judging from the TV ratings
and bookdom's bestseller lists, you can hardly avoid the new
over-the-top celebrities. (Hello, Chyna. Howdy, Mankind.)
</P>
<P>
   But what does all that have to do with culture?
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically, we wrestle with big ideas, when we have the
time, which isn't often. Writers and readers wrestle with words,
and artists of all kinds wrestle with perception, consciousness and
the tools of their expression.
</P>
<P>
   But, literally, wrestling and its muscle-popping cousins can
show up when you least expect it.
</P>
<P>
   At the opera, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The current Metropolitan Opera season in New York includes a
smashingly surreal production of the Shostakovich ``Lady MacBeth of
Mstensk.'' It has everything one could hope for in the opera:
seduction, sex, betrayal, death _ and wrestling, if only for one
sweaty moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the starring role, Catherine Malfitano has a huge voice and
pours her zaftig frame into a series of blonde-bombshell dresses _
imagine Shelley Winters in a Marilyn Monroe number.
</P>
<P>
   In an early scene, the sultry, unsatisfied Katerina (Malfitano)
confronts the swaggering new laborer Sergei (Vladimir Galouzine) in
the work yard outside the home she shares with her cold,
businessman husband and his domineering father.
</P>
<P>
   Katerina protests when the workmen fondle the family cook, and
she stands up for the strength of women. She is taken aback when
Sergei grabs her hand and proposes a little upstairs-downstairs
wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   That dramatic grapple that ensues is played out against a steamy
backdrop: a male-chorus orgy of bump-and-grinding sexuality, a
scene that seems to have been imported from one of those
Christopher Street leather bars one hears about.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the spark is lighted and later Sergei and Katerina
end up, er, upstairs, in that other kind of tangle, atop her
hot-pink bed.
</P>
<P>
   HHH
</P>
<P>
   There's no sex in David Mamet's play, ``American Buffalo.'' But
the language is raw, and there is an eruption of violence, a
momentary smackdown of sorts, in Mamet's thinly veiled rant against
the evils of American business.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's 25-year-old play is currently enjoying a thrilling run,
first in London and now at the Atlantic Theatre Company, the
actor-friendly Chelsea house that Mamet founded with William H.
Macy. Macy (he's everywhere) heads the cast of thieving lowlifes,
along with veteran Philip Baker Hall and young Mark Webber, making
an impressive theatrical debut as Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Buffalo'' seems as vital as ever and the way Mamet
conquers all with words is simply astounding. (``That's what
business is,'' says Hall's Don, proprietor of Don's Resale Shop,
the play's sole set, ``people taking care of themselves.'')
</P>
<P>
   The stage is a convincing junk-shop repository of American
consumerism: broken radios, stacks of dusty books, milk crates of
LPs, shelves of old luggage ring the action; a dartboard, a saw and
a cheap guitar hang from the back wall. No wrestling paraphernalia
that I could see, but there was a Chicago Bears pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to smother you in theory,'' Mamet's Teach
(Macy), a tightly wrapped bundle of aggression and angst, blurts
out in a typical bit of irony.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, could be the motto of wrestling's Vince McMahon
and company, the entrepreneurial force behind the resurgence of
testosterone entertainment. HHH
</P>
<P>
   Only in retrospect did it occur to me that evidence could be
gathered no matter where I turned up in New York. Even at the Frick
Collection, in all its quiet, Upper-East-Side, old-money glory.
</P>
<P>
   Among the treasures there are a pair of gorgeous, allegorical
paintings by Veronese. Four hundred years old. In one of them,
``Wisdom and Strength,'' the brain wrestles with brawn and comes
out, if not the victor, then at least in the lead. The painting
depicts Hercules, with all his brute force and courage, and
Minerva, goddess of wisdom and the arts. She has the upper hand,
and her heavenward gaze trumps Hercules' apparent submission.
</P>
<P>
   Veronese's background reinforces the subtext of culture vs.
nature, juxtaposing formal columns and a backdrop of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, deep in the shadow of the painting is the inscription
``Omnia Vanitas'' (all is vanity).
</P>
<P>
   Our girl mud wrestlers _ remember them? _ might find inspiration
in a mysterious, haunting object that stands as the centerpiece of
a charming and understated exhibit currently showing at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. It's the ``Leonine Goddess,'' a
5,000-year-old piece of carved and polished limestone that is said
to come from southwestern Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is the signature item of the Guennol Collection,
the eclectic holdings of A.B. and Edith Martin, who since the late
1940s have sought out rare and beautiful objects from around the
world: Olmec jade, carved Egyptian marble, painted-wood folk art
from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Martins admire pays homage to the natural
world, but their connoisseurship extends to humor and the
often-unexplainable sublimities that art and the human hand present
to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   At less than four inches tall, the ``Leonine Goddess'' packs
much more aesthetic wallop than one might first expect. The lion's
head is turned to its left and from the shoulders down, the figure
seems like nothing less than a human body builder, hands clasped,
elbows out, pecs and arm muscles bulging.
</P>
<P>
   It's far more subtle than the mud-covered faux warriors in the
back of a Kansas City pickup. And, in its way, it's far more
effective as an astounding portrait of pride and assertive
identity. Grrrl power. Hear it roar.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 0330: Local cemeteries alive with history
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters.
Photos and a sig/locator map are available.)

<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Listen closely. The dead might be talking.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be alarmed. It's not the chain-rattling, haunting kind
of talking.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the dead are spinning their tales into the web of
history even as they rest in local cemeteries _ cemeteries that
play an important role in preserving the past, according to Dr.
Norman Black. Black is a Longview, Texas, dentist who has headed
the Gregg County Historical Commission for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything spectacular here, but we do have some
oddities,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those oddities is a mystery that captivated Longview in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Longview News-Journal, then the Longview News
Co., was expanding its facility. And on Jan. 16, 1975, construction
workers unearthed a cast-iron casket at First and Tyler streets,
according to newspaper articles provided by the Gregg County
Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know where it came from,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   A historical team from Southern Methodist University came to
Longview to investigate the discovery. A skull and several bones
were still inside the casket, and investigators determined the body
was that of a 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was a girl because some of the mud and clay
(that had seeped into the coffin) had preserved some of the
clothes,'' Black said, including what looked like patent leather
shoes with 1-inch heels.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimated the girl was buried between 1870 and 1890.
Newspaper reports said some local residents remembered that a
cemetery had once been located in that area, but if it had been, it
wasn't a city cemetery. And some suggested that someone on a train
traveling through Longview had buried the child there.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery, however, was never solved. The small casket is now
on display in the historical museum, and a man anonymously donated
a grave in Grace Hill Cemetery to rebury the child on May 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A grave near Kilgore also carries the answers to another mystery
that never will be solved. Karen Silkwood, a former chemical
technician at a plutonium fuels production plant in Oklahoma, is
buried in the Danville Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1974, Silkwood discovered that she had been exposed
to plutonium, and as a member of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers' Union, she was an outspoken critic of plant safety. On
Nov. 13, 1974, she left a union meeting to meet with a New York
Times reporter to talk about dangerous plant conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But she never made it.
</P>
<P>
   Silkwood died in a one-car wreck, which wreck investigators said
occurred when she fell asleep. Tests later showed that her blood
contained twice the amount necessary to induce drowsiness of the
drug Quaalude. Her story later was depicted in a movie,
``Silkwood.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said Silkwood had relatives in the Kilgore area and that
is why she was buried in the Danville Cemetery. Her tombstone
carries the simple message, ``Rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere but in East Texas could the wealth of the oil field have
played a role in the development of a cemetery. In this case, it's
Rosedale Cemetery in Gladewater. Rosedale is one of three
cemeteries in Gregg County with a historical marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the richest cemetery in the world because it had two
oil wells on it,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery association was established in 1911, according to
the historical marker. The wells were drilled in 1932 and plugged
in 1972, but not before the association was able to benefit from
the money the wells generated.
</P>
<P>
   According to information Black provided, the cemetery sold
burial permits instead of lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allowed the surface and mineral rights to remain with the
association,'' Black's information said.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery association used the money to build streets inside
the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a house for the caretaker,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Gregg County cemeteries have received historical
markers. Black said a fourth cemetery probably will receive a
historical marker soon, Greenwood Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is one of two in the area that are the final
resting place for a War of 1812 veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really unusual,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Levy has a simple headstone which says he served in
Atkinson's Troop in the 19th Virginia Militia during the War of
1812. Family members buried on either side of him also served in
the military. Maj. William T. Levy was a member of the 1st U.S.
Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish-American War and Richard B.
Levy fought in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven Confederate soldiers are buried in the Greenwood
Cemetery, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the most outstanding cemetery in the county,''
Black said, and many residents who have played important roles in
the area's development are buried there.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps one of the most remarkable cemeteries is on private
land north of Lone Star and isn't open to the public. Black said
the cemetery, known as Black Mountain Cemetery appears to have
tombstones bearing the names of English people and dates from the
early 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``History books said the English weren't even in this part of
the world,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery has never been fully investigated or researched, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have to rewrite the history books,'' Black said.

 &HT;    Glamour, revelry reign over long Oscars night
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like a Cecil B. DeMille production, Sunday's
Academy Awards ceremony had a cast of thousands and a running time
of several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out the number of valet parkers required for
the night alone was mind-boggling, considering there were about
5,000 limousines expected to bring the 6,000 or so members of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The 72nd annual bestowal of Oscars officially began at 5:30 p.m.
PST. At 2:30 p.m., everyone _ media, security, Academy personnel,
ushers _ with credentials for the arrivals area, the red-carpeted
zone that stands between the limo door and the entrance doors to
the Shrine Auditorium, was in position. Though it was midafternoon,
each was wearing the Academy-sanctioned tuxedo or long gown. Most
sported sunglasses. In the press section, several people slathered
on suntan lotion as protection against the strong Los Angeles rays.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long afternoon and night. The first limousine pulled up
at 2:50 p.m. Movie fans in the bleachers looking for anything to
cheer about _ they'd been waiting at the Shrine auditorium to catch
a glimpse of a star since early that morning _ cheered on their
favorite television hosts, the men and women from ``Entertainment
Tonight,'' ``Access Hollywood'' and ``E! Entertainment
Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The first nominees to walk the gauntlet were Haley Joel Osment
and Chloe Sevigny, about one hour later. Pandemonium in the
bleachers. At last, somebody from the big screen had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, a parade of famous faces passed by. What wasn't
apparent to television viewers was the staggering noise level in
the arrivals area, with reporters and photographers screaming out
stars' names, the fans screeching whenever one of their favorites
came into view and the live interviews columnist Army Archerd did
over the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing was the usual sound of cellular telephones
ringing. Either everybody had put their phones on silent mode or
the ensuing cacophony just filtered the ringing out.
</P>
<P>
   What there was, after a relatively quiet prelude of a couple of
hours, was a definite buzz, an old-fashioned Hollywood opening
flavor characterized the whole affair.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver came through the metal
detectors in the entrance tent at just after 5 p.m., the final big
names to arrive on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It was then time to head for the seats and see Billy Crystal if
you had a ticket to the show, or to the backstage area, where the
international press corps of about 250 reporters and photographers
watched the show on headsets and television monitors. Here they all
waited for the winners in various categories, accompanied by the
actors and actresses who served as presenters during the telecast,
to appear for photos and question-and-answer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The streamlined Oscar telecast promised by show producers
Richard D. and Lili Fini Zanuck was received well by those in the
press room. Applause and laughter for Crystal's opening number. Not
many tough questions for the winners. There was laughter during
Robin Williams' archly staged production number for Best Song
nominee ``Blame Canada.'' And a little disappointment when John
Irving, who took home the Oscar for the screenplay adaptation of
his novel ``The Cider House Rules,'' chose only to enter the photo
room, not facing the reporters. When Hilary Swank was announced as
best actress for her role in ``Boys Don't Cry'' and the cameras
focused on her teary-eyed husband Chad Lowe in his seat, the best
crack of the night was heard: ``I guess boys do cry,'' said one
jaded reporter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final winners of the night _ ``American
Beauty's'' lead actor Kevin Spacey, director Sam Mendes (who
received the award for his debut as a feature film director),
writer Alan Ball, and producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks _ were
shepherded in and out of the interview room and a quick appearance
at the Academy's Governor's Ball at the Shrine's Expo Center, it
was time to venture to a few parties. The third portion of the
night began around 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes' drive away in Beverly Hills, DreamWorks SKG, the
studio behind ``American Beauty,'' had taken over Spago for the
night. Here, the Oscar winners from the film and a number of
Tinseltown celebrities, including Steven Spielberg, Judi Dench,
Molly Shannon, Sean Young and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown,
faced another line of photographers and reporters before heading
into the soiree.
</P>
<P>
   Bars close at 2 a.m. in Los Angeles. At about 2:30 a.m. in West
Hollywood, at the intersection of Robertson Boulevard and Melrose
Avenue, the much-hyped Vanity Fair party was just winding down.
People were shuffling out of the InStyle/Elton John party, just
across the street from Morton's restaurant, the site of Vanity
Fair's celebrity-filled fest. The faces in the crowd were mostly
famous _ and mostly glazed over, as faces will look at this time in
the morning after nine or so hours in the spotlight. Even Swank,
clutching her Best Actress Oscar as she left Morto's, looked as if
she'd had just about enough for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The big, long night in Hollywood was over.

 &HT;    State agency's new employee perk: the boot
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ No one can accuse management at the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission of being overly warm and
fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday when the state agency on North Interstate 35 wanted
to show its workers what could happen to them if they parked in the
wrong spot at work, they displayed a state van in a company parking
lot with a vehicle restraint device attached to the left front
wheel. Some departments even showed off the ``boot'' to employees
inside the office, said commission spokesman Andy Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how the pilgrims used to put people in stocks and taunt
them in the town square when they got caught messing up? This
policy kind of reminds me of that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I am exaggerating for a cheap laugh. But _ and here's
the funny part _ the agency did e-mail its employees about the
display beforehand so that they could come by and see the state van
affixed with the boot in the parking lot. Dear employees: Please
come to the parking lot and see what you'll be getting if you
continue to screw up. Love and kisses, your boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a demonstration, one of these devices will be applied to a
state vehicle for employees to view in the building A visitor lot
on Tuesday, March 21th (sic) between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.,''
said the e-mail inviting employees to come see the boot. March
21th? So parking Nazis aren't English majors. What can I tell you?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the new employee parking policy: The first two times you
park in the wrong place, they put the boot on your car. Each time,
to set your car free, you have to go to your deputy director _ make
that one of the big bosses _ and go through the embarrassment of
asking him to unlock the boot for you.
</P>
<P>
   The third time, they tow. Then they throw you in hot oil and
send your mamma a snapshot. Just kidding about the oil.
</P>
<P>
   I think a better policy would be to make parking violators wear
large red P's around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   I went out to the conservation commission last Tuesday to
witness the boot demonstration, and I'm here to report that it was
a pretty boring show. We're talking about one state van, parked
with an orange contraption clamped to it to keep it from moving. So
is it any wonder, despite the considerate invitation, that only a
handful of employees walked by to look at the display while I was
there? The commission could have at least set out some chips and a
bowl of salsa.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this is tough you should have been here last year,
Saenz said. He says the agency has a problem with employees parking
their vehicles in the visitor lot, instead of in the company
parking garage. So last year, Saenz said, the agency hired a guy
named Big Al to tow employee vehicles. After complaints about Big
Al being too expensive, he was replaced by the boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Al does not take American Express,'' Saenz said. ``Big Al
wanted cold, hard cash _ $91. And if Big Al got to keep your car
overnight, he charged you an extra $20 for storage.''
</P>
<P>
   If the boot doesn't work, I wonder when they're going to start
the floggings in the parking lot?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Big Al isn't busy next year, they could hire him back
and give him a whip.
</P>

American-Statesman. He can be reached at jkelso(at)statesman.com.

</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about presidential disability and succession made
me wonder: Has there ever been a case in the United States when an
acting president was required to step in for a short emergency
period?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As World Book Encyclopedia explains, Vice President
George Bush became the first U.S. acting president in your scenario
when, on July 13, 1985, he officially held that position for eight
hours while President Reagan underwent cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This matter is addressed in Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to
the Constitution, which states: Whenever the president transmits to
the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the
House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable
to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he
transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such
powers and duties shall be discharged by the vice president as
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gasoline prices have been in the news a lot lately. Adjusted
for inflation, how much have they changed over, say, the past 10
years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Statistics compiled by the American Petroleum Institute are
available only up to August 1999, before the recent surge in
prices. But information in API's booklet ``How Much We Pay for
Gasoline'' shows how adjusted prices have moved over the years. It
says that in 1990, the inflation-adjusted U.S. city retail price
for all types of gasoline, not including taxes, averaged $1.20.3 a
gallon. In the first eight months of '99 it averaged 74.9 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For historical perspective, API says gasoline prices staged a
long decline after the Depression, down to an inflation-adjusted
average (not including taxes) of 97 cents in 1972, when prices
jumped with the 1973-74 oil embargo. Prices climbed even higher in
1979 when Iranian crude supplies were curtailed, reaching an
inflation-adjusted peak of $2.20.3 in 1980. Then they fell,
especially during the winter of 1985-86, owing to the large
production increases by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're higher once again, changing so frequently that
it's hard to keep track.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the telephone number to check on a federal tax
refund?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-829-4477.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are the next sets of state quarters going to be issued?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a popular question. The quarters are being issued
over a 10-year period. The first five, in 1999, were Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. This year's
group: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining schedule: 2001, New York, North Carolina, Rhode
Island, Vermont, Kentucky; 2002, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana,
Indiana, Mississippi; 2003, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri,
Arkansas; 2004, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin; 2005,
California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia; 2006, Nevada,
Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota; 2007, Montana,
Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah; 2008, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering about the sequence, the coins are being
issued in the order in which the states became part of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 1-800-872-6468, or online at
www.usmint.gov/50states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, it was reported that a student somewhere
in the Carolinas was scheduled to receive a kidney transplant from
his teacher. But the surgery was delayed because he developed a
fever. I never saw anything more about it. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Michael Carter, a student at Max Abbott
Middle School in Fayetteville, N.C., whose eighth-grade science
teacher, Jane Smith, offered to donate one of her kidneys. As
reported Dec. 18, the surgery, which had been planned at UNC
Hospitals in Chapel Hill, N.C., was postponed in the wake of
Carter's fever.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Karen Stinneford told Q&AMP;A on March 22 that
the surgery still has not been rescheduled. She added that the
families of both Carter and Smith had been overwhelmed by the
public's response, and although they were grateful that the case
had ``touched a chord in people,'' they had asked hospital
officials not to provide the media with any more information this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping that when the surgery does take place, they can
slip into the hospital without much fanfare and have the
transplant,'' Stinneford said. ``Then, of course, we would let the
media know.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the families and doctors hoped the surgery could
be rescheduled soon, but she provided no specific timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton taken a leave of absence from Stanford?
I've seen pictures of her in Washington, and taking trips and
making appearances with her parents. A newspaper photo showed her
in India recently with the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first daughter is still enrolled at Stanford University,
and the first lady's press office confirmed that Wednesday. She's
on spring break, a spokeswoman said, which allowed her time to join
the current overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several years ago that a U-boat that was sunk
in 1945 was found off the Danish coast. It was supposed to be
recovered and its contents examined. What became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 255-foot German submarine, which was on its way to the
North Sea and ultimately to Japan, was sunk by a British bomber on
May 5, 1945. It was brought to the surface 15 miles off the small
Danish island of Anholt on Aug. 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A Danish consortium, hoping to find jewels, gold and art stolen
from occupied territories, as well as secret documents, financed
the operation to salvage the U-534. But when the sub was opened,
and detonators removed from its torpedoes, salvagers found no such
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   However, they discovered a number of well-preserved supplies and
effects of the U-boat crew, and that was a relative treasure to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Linnemann, head of registration and preservation on the
project, credited their preservation after 48 years in salt water
to a thin film of oil caused by leaks inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items recovered: nautical maps, logbooks and diaries,
binoculars, gas masks, clothing and tinned food.
</P>
<P>
   The sub's crew of 52 escaped before it sank, but three died in
the water from exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could Al Gore choose Bill Clinton to be his running mate? If
so, and Gore becomes our president and Clinton our vice president,
and then Gore resigns or has to leave office for whatever reason,
could Clinton become our president again?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 12th Amendment to the Constitution states that ``no
person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall
be eligible to that of vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a list of companies and products that are
not tested on animals?
</P>
<P>
   A: A list can be found online at this address, maintained by
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) _
www.peta-online.org/cmp/ccdont1099.html _ or you can purchase ``The
2000 Shopping Guide for Caring Consumers,'' which includes the
list, by calling 1-800-483-4366 and charging it to a credit card.
The cost is $8.95 plus $3.20 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Webster's Dictionary says the origin of aleck, as in the
expression ``smart aleck,'' was the nickname for Alexander. Is the
identity of that original Alexander known?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins nor
the Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins records
who the first ``smart aleck'' was. As the encyclopedia observes,
the original Alexander was at least clever enough to cover up all
traces of his identity.
</P>
<P>
   The expression _ meaning a conceited wise guy, usually endowed
with a bit of the brassiness called ``chutzpah'' in Yiddish _ has
been common in America at least since midway through the last
century. Its first recorded appearance in print was in a Carson
City, Nev., newspaper in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Dictionary reports that many years later, Alexander
``Alec'' Woollcott was a prodigiously vain figure on the New York
literary scene. But the expression was well established before his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Richard Riley, the U.S. secretary of education, go
to college?
</P>
<P>
   A: Riley, a former South Carolina governor, graduated from
Furman University in 1954. After serving in the Navy as an officer
on a minesweeper, he entered law school at the University of South
Carolina, graduating in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that a Coast Guard vessel based in Key West,
Fla., had intercepted a boat off Ecuador on Saturday. Aren't these
international waters? Why was a U.S. Coast Guard vessel involved so
far from its base?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ecuador's navy said the 40 women and 194 men found on the
Ecuadorean-registered Viviana II were detained because they were
traveling through international waters without documentation. The
U.S. government had received permission from Ecuador to stop the
vessel, whose intended destination appeared to be Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Knight, spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in San
Francisco, said a growing number of Ecuadoreans are using high seas
routes to Central America and Mexico to reach the United States
illegally. This was the fourth or fifth such interception in the
past 12 months, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard participates in a multi-agency operation
designed to intercept smuggling and narcotics operations, Knight
told Q&AMP;A. The Joint Interagency Task Force has locations on the
U.S. East Coast and U.S. West Coast. Their areas of concern are
divided by a line extending southward just west of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard patrols from the East Coast routinely operate
through the Panama Canal into waters west of the canal, Knight
explained. Once a Coast Guard cutter from the East Coast becomes
engaged in law-enforcement activity in the Pacific, such as
stopping a vessel suspected of smuggling, the California Joint
Interagency Task Force takes jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted Ecuadoreans were turned over to Ecuadorean
authorities Monday, ending the Coast Guard's involvement.

<P>
   Q: An article about presidential disability and succession made
me wonder: Has there ever been a case in the United States when an
acting president was required to step in for a short emergency
period?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As World Book Encyclopedia explains, Vice President
George Bush became the first U.S. acting president in your scenario
when, on July 13, 1985, he officially held that position for eight
hours while President Reagan underwent cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This matter is addressed in Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to
the Constitution, which states: Whenever the president transmits to
the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the
House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable
to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he
transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such
powers and duties shall be discharged by the vice president as
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gasoline prices have been in the news a lot lately. Adjusted
for inflation, how much have they changed over, say, the past 10
years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Statistics compiled by the American Petroleum Institute are
available only up to August 1999, before the recent surge in
prices. But information in API's booklet ``How Much We Pay for
Gasoline'' shows how adjusted prices have moved over the years. It
says that in 1990, the inflation-adjusted U.S. city retail price
for all types of gasoline, not including taxes, averaged $1.20.3 a
gallon. In the first eight months of '99 it averaged 74.9 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For historical perspective, API says gasoline prices staged a
long decline after the Depression, down to an inflation-adjusted
average (not including taxes) of 97 cents in 1972, when prices
jumped with the 1973-74 oil embargo. Prices climbed even higher in
1979 when Iranian crude supplies were curtailed, reaching an
inflation-adjusted peak of $2.20.3 in 1980. Then they fell,
especially during the winter of 1985-86, owing to the large
production increases by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're higher once again, changing so frequently that
it's hard to keep track.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the telephone number to check on a federal tax
refund?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-829-4477.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are the next sets of state quarters going to be issued?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a popular question. The quarters are being issued
over a 10-year period. The first five, in 1999, were Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. This year's
group: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining schedule: 2001, New York, North Carolina, Rhode
Island, Vermont, Kentucky; 2002, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana,

   Q: Several months ago, it was reported that a student somewhere
in the Carolinas was scheduled to receive a kidney transplant from
his teacher. But the surgery was delayed because he developed a
fever. I never saw anything more about it. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Michael Carter, a student at Max Abbott
Middle School in Fayetteville, N.C., whose eighth-grade science
teacher, Jane Smith, offered to donate one of her kidneys. As
reported Dec. 18, the surgery, which had been planned at UNC
Hospitals in Chapel Hill, N.C., was postponed in the wake of
Carter's fever.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Karen Stinneford told Q&AMP;A on March 22 that
the surgery still has not been rescheduled. She added that the
families of both Carter and Smith had been overwhelmed by the
public's response, and although they were grateful that the case
had ``touched a chord in people,'' they had asked hospital
officials not to provide the media with any more information this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping that when the surgery does take place, they can
slip into the hospital without much fanfare and have the
transplant,'' Stinneford said. ``Then, of course, we would let the
media know.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the families and doctors hoped the surgery could
be rescheduled soon, but she provided no specific timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton taken a leave of absence from Stanford?
I've seen pictures of her in Washington, and taking trips and
making appearances with her parents. A newspaper photo showed her
in India recently with the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first daughter is still enrolled at Stanford University,
and the first lady's press office confirmed that Wednesday. She's
on spring break, a spokeswoman said, which allowed her time to join
the current overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several years ago that a U-boat that was sunk
in 1945 was found off the Danish coast. It was supposed to be
recovered and its contents examined. What became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 255-foot German submarine, which was on its way to the
North Sea and ultimately to Japan, was sunk by a British bomber on
May 5, 1945. It was brought to the surface 15 miles off the small
Danish island of Anholt on Aug. 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A Danish consortium, hoping to find jewels, gold and art stolen
from occupied territories, as well as secret documents, financed
the operation to salvage the U-534. But when the sub was opened,
and detonators removed from its torpedoes, salvagers found no such
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   However, they discovered a number of well-preserved supplies and
effects of the U-boat crew, and that was a relative treasure to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Linnemann, head of registration and preservation on the

to a thin film of oil caused by leaks inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items recovered: nautical maps, logbooks and diaries,
binoculars, gas masks, clothing and tinned food.

   The sub's crew of 52 escaped before it sank, but three died in
the water from exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could Al Gore choose Bill Clinton to be his running mate? If
so, and Gore becomes our president and Clinton our vice president,
and then Gore resigns or has to leave office for whatever reason,
could Clinton become our president again?
</P>

   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Listen closely. The dead might be talking. But
don't be alarmed. It's not the chain-rattling, haunting kind of
talking. Instead, the dead are spinning their tales into the web of
history even as they rest in local cemeteries _ cemeteries that
play an important role in preserving the past, according to Dr.
Norman Black. Black is a Longview, Texas, dentist who has headed
the Gregg County Historical Commission for 15 years. ``We don't

Black said. Among those oddities is a mystery that captivated
Longview in 1975. (Hammer, Longview News Journal). MOVED.

   FETUS-PHOTO _ DOUGLASVILLE, Ga. _ Baby pictures of Samuel Armas
of Douglasville were taken a little earlier than usual, and
circulated more widely. Samuel, now 3 months old, was a 21-week-old
fetus with spina bifida when a freelance photographer shot his
penny-sized hand emerging from an incision in his mother's uterus
during controversial surgery to correct the defect. Weeks later,
Samuel became an inadvertent celebrity: The photo was on Page 1 of
USA Today and subsequently went worldwide as a kind of
right-to-life icon. (Internet gossip Matt Drudge lost his Fox TV
show in a dispute over using the photo.) Samuel was born in
December and in their first interview since the birth, his parents
Julie and Alex Armas of Douglasville talk about how their
opposition to abortion led them to discover the risky surgery, and
their amazement and bemusement (part discomfort, part belief in
God's plan) that their infant son's image stimulated reaction
worldwide. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

And with good reason. Albano has managed 19 tag-team champions,
including several duos that held the titles more than once. And he
even wore a tag-team championship belt around his own ample waist
at one time. ``I looked for guys that were a good size and could
work together in the ring,'' said Albano, now a 67-year-old

 &HT;    Celebrating a century of Spencer Tracy
 &HT;    By Steve Uhler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story goes that when lanky Katherine Hepburn
was first introduced to Spencer Tracy, she looked down her
aristocratic nose and said, ``You're rather short, aren't you?'' He
responded, smiling confidently, ``Don't worry. I'll cut you down to
size.'' Thus began one of Hollywood's most enduring partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Spencer Tracy cut everyone down to size. Frequently
cited as the screen's all-time greatest (Olivier thought he was the
best), he projected a seemingly effortless, masculine naturalism,
rock solid. Though never a conventionally handsome heartthrob (he
had a face for Mount Rushmore), Tracy conveyed more strength and
conviction than a dozen Erroll Flynns. You never see Spencer Tracy
acting; roles bent to the force of his will like mountains came to
Muhammed.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday, April 5, marks the centennial of his birth in
Milwaukee, 1900. Celebrate his 100th birthday by checking out one
of his great performances on video or DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's early movie roles were marked by playing cocky tough
guys (``20,000 Years In Sing Sing,'' 1932) or second banana to
top-billed Clark Gable (``San Francisco,'' 1935). In 1938, he won
his first Best Actor Oscar for his role as Manuel, the
life-embracing fisherman who teaches spoiled rich kid Freddie
Bartholomew the lessons of life in the seafaring adventure,
``Captains Courageous,'' a still-splendid film, even if Tracy's
Portuguese accent was a bit dodgy. He won again the following year
for his stern but compassionate Father Flanagan in ``Boys Town.''
He was so quietly authoritative that you actually believed him when
he said ``There's no such thing as a bad boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy could handle physically demanding roles. As Major Rogers
in King Vidor's robust ``Northwest Passage'' (1940), he leads a
regimen of Rangers into Canada in the late 1700s to quell Indians
who have been attacking American colonists. A rousing, entertaining
adventure that still looks great (thanks to beautifully rendered
Technicolor photography), ``Northwest Passage'' was originally
intended as the first of a two-part series. The sequel never got
made because Tracy and Vidor didn't get along, but the first half
was splendid enough.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tracy made several films with real-life love
Katherine Hepburn, including ``Woman of the Year,'' ``Pat and
Mike,'' ``Sea of Grass,'' and ``Desk Set.'' Their chemistry was
tangible both on-screen and off. The best of their co-starring
vehicles is the delightfully witty ``Adam's Rib,'' where they play
Adam and Amanda Bonner, husband-and-wife lawyers on opposite sides
of a particularly volatile battle-of-the-sexes case. Snappy
direction by George Cukor, a sharp script by Ruth Gordon and Garsin
Kanin, and a marvelous performance by Judy Holliday make this
courtroom courtship an absolute delight.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy showed his superb flair for light comedy as bride-to-be
Elizabeth Taylor's doting and harried father in the amiable
``Father of the Bride'' (1950); the part was so successful he
reprised it the following year in ``Father's Little Dividend''
(1951), where Tracy faces the prospect of being a grandfather. Both
films were re-made recently with Steve Martin in the part. While
amusing, the Martin versions lack the originals' depth and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after his performance as Manuel, Tracy returned to
the sea with a tour-de-force performance in the screen adaptation
of Hemingway's epic symbolic struggle between a fisherman and a
giant marlin, ``The Old Man &AMP; The Sea'' (1958). Though slightly
marred by poor back projection, the movie actually improves on the
small screen; its faults aren't as glaring and its strengths _
mostly Tracy's performance _ are still intact. Keep an eye peeled
for a cameo by Hemingway himself in a bar scene near the end.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's twilight years contained some of his finest hours: The
one-armed war veteran who finds himself an unwelcome visitor in a
hostile desert town that holds a dirty secret in ``Bad Day at Black
Rock'' (1954); the passionate liberal lawyer (based on Clarence
Darrow) in the 1960 courtroom drama ``Inherit The Wind''; the
conflicted judge who is the conscience of Stanley Kramer's
``Judgement at Nuremberg'' (1961). These were meaty, intense roles,
brilliantly played. By the time he got to lighten up in ``It's A
Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' (1963), Tracy's old age and failing
constitution were showing (he was a chronic drinker, and suffered
from lung congestion). In some scenes, you can actually see him
drifting away, losing his lines, looking years older than his age.
</P>
<P>
   He rallied for his last film, co-starring again with Hepburn, as
Mathew Drayton, the cantankerous but loving husband and father who
must contend with his daughter's impending interracial marriage to
a young doctor (Sidney Poitier) in 1967's ``Guess Who's Coming To
Dinner?'' Though the script is a bit dated and soggy, Tracy's
performance is a vintage valedictory, funny, touching, and
remarkably rich. I've always believed that during his speech at the
end, where he acknowledges his enduring love and many happy years
with his wife, Hepburn's tears were unscripted. He died two weeks
after completing the film.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-told advice Spencer Tracy gave to younger actors was
``know your lines and try not to bump into the furniture.'' No one
ever caught Spencer Tracy bumping into the furniture. Happy
birthday, Spence.

<P>
   For this menu of pork and polenta with brussels sprouts, you
will find quick-cooking polenta has been put on the ``your pantry''
list. The theory is that readers of this column have seen many
recipes call for it so perhaps they are keeping it in the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonderful way to enjoy the earthy flavor and texture of
this Italian dish without having to stir it for 45 minutes. Yes, I
know purists will argue that quick-cooking polenta isn't the same
as regular because it isn't as coarsely textured.
</P>
<P>
   But if the choice is between having polenta quickly or not
having it at all, I vote for the quick variety. Polenta is so easy
to make and so satisfying, and the corn meal absorbs the strong
flavors of the pork and its seasonings. When you prepare polenta,
don't cook it so long that it is stiff and will not drop off the
spoon. Cook it just enough so that you can still hear it ``plop.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you plan to reheat polenta by spreading it in a pan and
baking it in an oven or turning it into cakes and sauteing it in a
pan, use the polenta right away because it thickens rapidly after
it is removed from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fresh ingredients _ the scallions, cilantro and mint
_ makes a refreshing contrast with the earthiness and of the
polenta and pork, and you could use beef or lamb instead of pork in
this dish, if you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Any green vegetable will be happy with the treatment accorded
the brussels sprouts here: broccoli, green beans, asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   SPICED PORK WITH POLENTA
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces boneless pork loin
</P>
<P>
   Enough ginger to yield 1 tablespoon coarsely grated
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups no-salt-added chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup quick-cooking polenta
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced ripe tomatoes (about 3/4 of a pint basket of cherry
tomatoes, depending on size; l large tomato or 3 or 4 plum
tomatoes)

</P>
<P>

add to the pan. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until tomatoes
soften, just a couple of minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   6. Slowly add the polenta into the boiling stock, constantly
stirring; reduce heat and cook the polenta until it has absorbed
all the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Wash the scallions and trim. Slice the white portion and a
little of the green; wash and dry the cilantro and mint and
coarsely chop.
</P>
<P>
   8. Spoon the polenta onto two plates and top with pork and
tomatoes. Sprinkle with scallions, cilantro and mint and serve.

   PUTIN-EDITORIAL _ Vladimir Putin campaigned for Russia's
presidency without revealing much about his personality or program.

and economic development. (Atlanta Constitution)

   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Listen closely. The dead might be talking. But
don't be alarmed. It's not the chain-rattling, haunting kind of
talking. Instead, the dead are spinning their tales into the web of
history even as they rest in local cemeteries _ cemeteries that
play an important role in preserving the past, according to Dr.
Norman Black. Black is a Longview, Texas, dentist who has headed
the Gregg County Historical Commission for 15 years. ``We don't
have anything spectacular here, but we do have some oddities,''
Black said. Among those oddities is a mystery that captivated
Longview in 1975. (Hammer, Longview News Journal). MOVED.

   FETUS-PHOTO _ DOUGLASVILLE, Ga. _ Baby pictures of Samuel Armas
of Douglasville were taken a little earlier than usual, and
circulated more widely. Samuel, now 3 months old, was a 21-week-old
fetus with spina bifida when a freelance photographer shot his
penny-sized hand emerging from an incision in his mother's uterus
during controversial surgery to correct the defect. Weeks later,
Samuel became an inadvertent celebrity: The photo was on Page 1 of
USA Today and subsequently went worldwide as a kind of
right-to-life icon. (Internet gossip Matt Drudge lost his Fox TV
show in a dispute over using the photo.) Samuel was born in
December and in their first interview since the birth, his parents
Julie and Alex Armas of Douglasville talk about how their
opposition to abortion led them to discover the risky surgery, and
their amazement and bemusement (part discomfort, part belief in
God's plan) that their infant son's image stimulated reaction
worldwide. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

tender, young leaves from the garden. Those heavy, leafy greens we
ate during the winter have given way to sweet baby spinach, Swiss
chard, broccoli raab and peppery cress. The epitome of ``fast
food,'' these fresh greens cook in minutes and are packed with
nutrients. Add them to salads, bake them in stratas or saute a
handful as a nest for a grilled fish fillet. Here's a quick guide

<P>
   WRESTLING-TAGTEAMS _ In biblical times, anyone searching for an
expert on pairs would probably look up Noah. In pro wrestling, the
most likely source of expertise on twosomes is Captain Lou Albano.
And with good reason. Albano has managed 19 tag-team champions,
including several duos that held the titles more than once. And he
even wore a tag-team championship belt around his own ample waist
at one time. ``I looked for guys that were a good size and could
work together in the ring,'' said Albano, now a 67-year-old
grandfather (he has 13 grandchildren to go with his four grown
children). A rundown of Albano's list of champions reveals that
``good size'' might be putting it mildly. (Braun, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   w/WRESTLING-KOWALSKI _ Walter Kowalski wasn't always known as
``Killer.'' He actually started his career as Tarzan Kowalski, and
was a babyface. But when the fans started booing him, he became a

   CASINO-BRIBE (Baton Rouge, La.) _ Getting mixed up with a

TORNADO BATTERS FORT WORTH, ARLINGTON; AT LEAST 3 PEOPLE KILLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Officials in Fort Worth and Arlington on
Wednesday began the massive task of cleaning up the devastation of
tornadoes that killed at least three people, leveled buildings,
shattered skyscraper windows and shut down downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Two men were crushed to death on the outskirts of downtown _ one
by a truck trailer that toppled onto him and the other by a
collapsing wall _ as the tornado plowed its way through the heart
of the city at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Wednesday recovered the body of a third victim, a
man who was swept away with his grandmother in floodwaters from the
Trinity River. The grandmother remained missing Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   City officials closed much of the downtown business district
Wednesday, barricading it as fears mounted that cracked plate-glass
windows would break loose from skyscrapers and rain onto downtown
streets. Officials said at least parts of downtown will remained
closed through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The first deadly twister to hit Fort Worth was followed by a
second tornado about 30 minutes later in southeast Arlington, where
at least six homes were leveled and about a 100 more were damaged.
No injuries were reported in that storm.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth officials said seven buildings on the west side
collapsed and a search was being conducted Wednesday for possible
victims still trapped in the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were injured in Fort Worth, at least two
critically, as buildings were ripped apart and flying shards of
glass crashed onto downtown streets at about 6:20 p.m., just as
many people headed home from work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most seriously hurt was a man struck by a hailstone
that paramedics reported was the size of a softball, said Dr.
Michael Hickey, a trauma surgeon at Harris Methodist Fort Worth
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire skull is fractured, so it'd have to take a
tremendous force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials closed the area ``to make sure downtown is safe
before we allow people to return,'' Mayor Kenneth Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way in the dark to know what the situation is,''
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it was ``somewhat a miracle'' that more people
did not suffer serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Mayor Elzie Odom declared a state of emergency
that granted police broad powers to limit access to the damaged
areas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, and Martin Frost,
D-Dallas, offered Fort Worth federal assistance Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   TXU Electric &AMP; Gas had 30,000 customers without service in Fort
Worth and Arlington. The hardest-hit areas were downtown, the north
and west parts of Fort Worth, south Arlington around Collins Street
and Interstate 20, and Grand Prairie, TXU spokeswoman Carol Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth tornado tore a devastating 2-mile-long swath
stretching roughly from University Drive to just east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms
Laboratory in Norman, Okla., said the storm probably reached F2
intensity on the Fujita scale, which is used to measure the
strength of tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were the Mallick Tower at One Summit Avenue, the
Cash America building at 1600 W. Seventh St., the Bank One Tower
downtown, Tandy Center and Calvary Cathedral International, where
all the brickwork on the steeple was ripped off, exposing steel
beams.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen cars in the area were flipped over or tossed on
their sides.
</P>
<P>
   One of two homeless men who sought shelter under a porch of the
empty Burns Graphics Building, on West Seventh at the Trinity
River, was killed when a wall behind them collapsed. He was
identified as Carl Spence, 67.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's companion, John Barr, 70, was also buried under the
debris but was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell upon me and I was under a pile of bricks,'' Barr said.
``When I looked back, I saw it fell on him, too. When I got up and
got back to him, I realized he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dead man was identified as Howard D. Thornton, 52. He
was crushed by a truck trailer that flipped onto him behind the
landmark Montgomery Ward catalog building on West Seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The area behind the 70-year-old building, which survived the
April 1949 floodwaters that reached the second floor, was a
shambles of crazily twisted truck trailers jammed against the
loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton ``was warning people back by the guard shack to get
down, get down, but the tornado caught up with him and he didn't
make it,'' said Frank Godoy, 26, a Montgomery Ward maintenance
worker from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of glass, chunks of metal and building panels continued
falling to the West Seventh Street pavement an hour after the
storm. Trees surrounding the building were bent and broken. Light
poles were crushed against trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it looks like we are all alive,'' said Jose Rico,
director of marketing for Cash America International, who had left
his seventh-floor office five minutes before the storm hit and got
into his car, and then ``I ran back into the building.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
d nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible. My office is gone. I haven't found my car
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the Fort Worth tornado, another twister
ravaged a southeast Arlington neighborhood near Bardin and Matlock
roads at about 7 p.m. Several retail businesses and a gas station
were heavily damaged, roofs were ripped off and buildings were
flattened.
</P>
<P>
   About eight houses in the area sustained heavy damage, and 30
houses sustained minor damage. An additional two dozen homes in the
area near Williams Elementary School were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt like the oxygen got sucked out of the house and
you could hear glass breaking and stuff flying around,'' said J.D.
Walker, who with his wife and 3-year-old twins, covered themselves
with a mattress as winds swept through their neighborhood in the
300 block of Chasemore Lane, just south of Interstate 20.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors walked up and down the darkened streets,
carrying flashlights, as they checked on damage and offered help to
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Several dogs ran free through the streets after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fences are down _ there's dogs running everywhere,''
said Arlington police Cpl. Michael Van Steenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The building housing the regional office of the Texas Department
of Health and the Department of Human Services, on Bardin between
Collins and New York, was heavily damaged. The entire east side
appeared to be stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   The post office next door also appeared to have been severely
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Ava Mitchell of Fort Worth was working in the Lear plant on
Bardin at about 7 p.m. and was caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything. We just heard it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the storm passed the damage was evident: Two truck
trailers on the west side of building were overturned. In a field
behind the building, the air-conditioning units from the roof were
strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the Rev. Bob Nichols of Calvary Cathedral
International watched in awe from his church office as water from
the Trinity River spiraled into the sky and roared toward his
church at 1600 W. Fifth St.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been ripped to shreds if I hadn't run into the
hallway with my wife and two other church members,'' said Nichols,
whose office faces west toward the river. ``We didn't even hear
anything before it hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Only steel beams remained of the cathedral's 5-story tower from
the second story to the steeple. Bricks and mortar from the church
were strewn nearly 200 feet across Penn Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this building has been bombed,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   East of the church, Louis Zapata was among five people inside
the Summit Building, 1500 W. Fifth St., which was hammered by the
tornado. Walls crumbled and most of the building's roof was ripped
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer shut off, then the lights went out, so I bent down
to get a flashlight out of my bag,'' said Zapata, 65, a lifelong
resident of Fort Worth who was on the second floor. ``When I bent
down, the roof started to just rip off and the walls started
disappearing. Everything was blowing everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord said to me, `Bend down and pick up your life,'''
he said. ``It was a good solid desk. If it would have moved, I
would have had it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown YMCA, Robert Viana watched as the tornado cut
its deadly path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking out the window and you could see a funnel of
debris heading right toward us,'' said Viana, 39, of Fort Worth.
``It looked like fingers dangling from the sky. There definitely
was more than one cloud coming down. We started yelling to
everybody and we all took off for the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing himself against the glass in a 28th-floor office at the
City Center Two Tower, Joe Garbe could see the black tornado
weaving between buildings downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a vortex,'' Garbe said. ``You could see the lights
sparking different colors and then go dead.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials sought to evacuate everyone from downtown who
does not live there because of several major areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   A major gas leak was reported at 3000 W. Seventh St. In
addition, damage done to buildings caused officials to declare
areas around Sundance West, the Cash America building and the UPR
Building areas of major concern.
</P>
<P>
   Severe damage was reported at a 7-Eleven store near University
and Seventh streets. Trees and debris were scattered across the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Urban Search and Rescue team was deployed from College
Station last night to help Fort Worth officials. The team, which
includes structural engineers, is expected to arrive this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were arrested, suspected of looting the Cash
America building.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, along I-20 east of Cooper, police reported that
eight semi-trailer trucks had overturned on the highway and that as
many as 15 houses were damaged around Matlock Road and I-20.
</P>
<P>
   The storm lost much of its punch as it swept east. Little damage
was reported in Grand Prairie.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when campaign finances are a
ballyhooed issue in the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush's
chief political strategist is a featured speaker Friday for a group
that is under fire for its fund-raising to help elect Republican
attorneys general across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Strategist Karl Rove is scheduled to give a political briefing
to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), which meets
at the Barton Creek Resort here Thursday and Friday. The meeting is
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A Thursday reception that had been scheduled at the Governor's
Mansion, which the Bush presidential campaign said the governor
never planned to attend, has been moved to a restaurant. The
association said the restaurant is larger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Vice President Al Gore for the
Democrat's past fund-raising problems. Both candidates have said
they want to change campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Two watchdog groups that look at campaign finances, the Center
for Public Integrity and Texans for Public Justice, criticized RAGA
for soliciting corporate donations and not disclosing specifically
who donates.
</P>
<P>
   Donations to the association, which is part of the Republican
National Committee, are reported to the Federal Election Commission
by the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog groups contend that the corporate donors are at
least potentially gaining influential allies and access, including
access to Rove.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans dismissed the criticism as ridiculous
and said attorneys general would not hold back from prosecuting
lawbreakers due to contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters also noted that the group is separate from
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl was invited to give a political briefing. That's the
extent of his involvement,'' said Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rove has been a campaign consultant to two attorneys general who
led the Republican association, including Texas Attorney General
John Cornyn, said RNC press secretary Mike Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl was speaking to groups like this before Bush was even
governor. He is well-respected and well-known in his own right,''
added Ray Sullivan, spokesman for Texas Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, also a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned the credibility of the watchdog groups, noting
in part that Texans for Public Justice refuses to disclose its
donors. Both the Texas group and the Washington-based Center for
Public Integrity describe themselves as nonprofit and non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, speaking for the attorneys general association, also
contended the Democratic Governors' Association has been more
secretive in its fund-raising, partly because it files its reports
state-by-state rather than with the Federal Election Commission.
George Shelton of the Democratic group said that is what it is
required to do.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC goes beyond what is required by federal law by filing
its reports monthly, said Collins. The attorneys general
association has raised $525,000 since it was formed a year ago, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has helped solicit association members, who pay $5,000 to
$25,000 or more to belong, according to a mailing sent to
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Attorneys General Association was born out of
concerns arising out of recent industry-wide lawsuits that seek to
promote policy changes via the courthouse rather than the
statehouse,'' said a letter signed by Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn added in a Tuesday statement, ``As attorney general, I
will always take action against those who have broken the law. No
exceptions. No excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An article by Marianne Holt and Kathryn Wallace posted on the
Web site of the Center for Public Integrity said: ``At the very
least, association with RAGA could give businesses advance word of
costly state-prosecuted lawsuits, such as claims against the
tobacco industry that cost the industry some $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, corporations that join RAGA secure potential allies
in the White House and advocates in the offices of attorneys
general who could discourage joining in such litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice said of the GOP
attorneys general, ``It appears they are selling immunity to large
corporate contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   He said for Rove to participate is unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is happening, it appears RAGA is not only selling
immunity from attorneys general but also selling access to what
might be the new White House,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn lashed back at McDonald's group, calling it ``a secretive
front group for the trial lawyers, who don't like that I've stood
for conservative principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents practice politics by litigation and want to
further enrich themselves by using the power of the state against
law-abiding citizens. I believe that I should fairly enforce the
law, not make social policy through the courthouse,'' Cornyn said.

FEARING LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, IRAN INCREASES OIL PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Complaining about U.S. pressure on the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iran said Wednesday
that it would join other OPEC members and increase crude oil
production to avoid losing its share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take our market share,'' Iran's OPEC governor,
Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in an interview. ``We are going to
keep and preserve our market share. Beyond that, we will see what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His remark left open the possibility that Iran could threaten to
go beyond its share of the total increase of 1.7 million barrels a
day sought by a Saudi-led coalition in OPEC. Without Iran, the
cartel announced on Tuesday that production would rise by 1.45
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's decision was quickly felt in London trading, where the
price of oil dropped 4 percent Wednesday morning to below $25 a
barrel. One OPEC official predicted that by May, the cartel's own
basket price for oil could drop to $20 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Ardebili complained about the pressure that the United States
had put on OPEC members to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a question in a debate about production,'' he
said. ``This is a question of influence.'' He said that OPEC
``should not have been put in the position of being pushed to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's representative complained that on Tuesday, the U.S.
energy secretary, Bill Richardson, had telephoned OPEC's president,
Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, while the cartel was meeting behind
closed doors. Richardson, he said, made a similar call to the oil
minister of Qatar during a ministerial meeting on Monday. ``We
don't like it,'' Ardebili said.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of discussion, OPEC announced on Tuesday that 9
of its 11 members would increase oil production by a total of 1.45
million barrels a day without the participation of Iran, the
cartel's second-largest producer. That forced Iran, which wanted a
much smaller increase, to follow their lead Wednesday. The higher
production would begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to send a signal that we are out for ruining the
cohesion of the organization,'' Ardebili said, ``but we expressed
concern about a huge increase in one step.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase was not as large as the United States had hoped,
and it was not expected to bring down gasoline prices anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   With Iran, the total increase is expected to be about 1.7
million barrels. Analysts said earlier that even without Iran, the
actual increase would end up at the higher level because other OPEC
members were likely to seize the opportunity to cheat on their
quotas to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million
barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices, which have soared to more
than $1.60 a gallon in most cities. Iran's irritation at the U.S.
pressure was apparently a major reason behind its opposition to any
increase.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks
before the effects of increased oil production are felt at the
gasoline pumps. With gasoline supplies already unusually low in the
United States ahead of the summer driving season, prices are not
expected to decline soon. Some analysts predicted that the retail
price would continue to rise before it eased by the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $1 or $1.20 a
gallon will be seriously disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an
analyst at Petroleum Finance Co., an industry research firm based
in Washington. ``Whatever happens, you're going to have a tight
gasoline market this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was more optimistic and said that
several oil producing nations that do not belong to OPEC would also
increase their outputs. ``I think our quiet diplomacy worked,''
Richardson, the energy secretary, said at a White House briefing
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that when all sources of production are taken
into account the United States ``will be well above our objective''
for increased production. He and other officials noted that prices
were already down from a high of $34 a barrel in anticipation of
increased production.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The unusual break in OPEC ranks on Tuesday came after two days
of wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the largest producer,
which had pushed for an increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   The production of Iraq, which says it now produces 2.4 million
barrels a day, has been separately governed by U.N. resolutions in
place since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC cut production last year and was joined by several non-OPEC
nations like Mexico and Norway, sending oil and gasoline prices
soaring to their highest levels in years.

FACING CORRUPTION CHARGES, TOP MINISTER RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Thailand's tough and powerful interior
minister resigned Wednesday after a newly formed anti-corruption
agency charged that he had concealed his assets by fabricating a
million-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the minister, Sanan Kachornprasart, is a
severe blow to the ruling party at the start of an election year in
which Sanan had been expected to play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am innocent,'' Sanan said in his resignation statement. ``I
will prove the truth in the Constitutional Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanan is the most powerful public official that the National
Counter-Corruption Commission has targeted since it was formed in
1997 as part of a wide-ranging attempt to reform Thai politics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission, Sanan falsely claimed to have
borrowed 45 million baht ($1.21 million) from a private company in
an attempt to conceal his assets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of the charges against him, the fact that an
independent body toppled one of the most influential figures in
Thai politics was a sign that the landscape of the nation's deeply
corrupt political system has begun to shift.
</P>
<P>
   A separate commission, also formed under Thailand's new
constitution, that monitors electoral fraud has in recent weeks
disqualified 78 of the 200 winners in an election last month to the
newly formed Senate. One of those disqualified was Sanan's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Sanan, 64, said he was resigning from all his
government positions, which include a deputy premiership and a seat
in Parliament. He said this would avoid any suggestion that he was
influencing the conduct of his case, which now goes before a
special Constitutional Court. The court was also recently formed
and adjudicates issues involving the country's new liberal charter.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against him, he could be banned from any
political activity for five years, whether or not he holds any
office.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a severe blow to the Democratic Party, which came
into office in the depths of the Asian economic crisis in late
1997. The party, led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, is credited
with cleaning up the country's fiscal affairs and restoring
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition _ which was notoriously corrupt during the
years it held power _ has leveled continuing charges of corruption
against the Democratic Party. One of those charges led to the
investigation of Sanan.
</P>
<P>
   Sanan said Wednesday that he would remain as the party's
secretary-general and would play a key role in the party in advance
of the elections that Chuan must call before November.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's political future and its coalition government
have now been thrown into uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the whole coalition is also at stake, given
the fact that Sanan, the government's Mr. Fixit, is such a central
figure,'' the Bangkok Post, the English-language daily, said
Wednesday in an editorial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The question of replacing Sanan as interior minister is expected
to be a difficult political challenge for Chuan as he balances the
forces of his coalition, and it has led to speculation that the
prime minister might call an early election.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Ong-art Klampaiboon,
said, ``There is no reason to think there will be any change in
government for the moment.''

&HT;     TEXAS TAX CUT GIVES BREAK TO CONDOM BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD and CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At the University of Texas at San Antonio,
students can walk into the health center and grab a handful of free
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are not hesitant at all to come in and ask for
them,'' said James Sawyer, the health center director.
</P>
<P>
   Such events, repeated on campuses across the country, are a
telltale sign that the availability of condoms for students is
becoming less controversial as Americans recognize the role
prophylactics can play in preventing not only unwanted pregnancy,
but the transmission of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as recent events demonstrate, condoms can still pack a
political punch, especially when presidential ambitions are at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, the Texas comptroller released a list of
over-the-counter medicines and health aids that will become exempt
from the sales tax on April 1. Condoms are on the list.
</P>
<P>
   This puts Gov. George W. Bush in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, an advocate of sexual abstinence for teen-agers, got a
widespread, popular tax cut passed last year before launching his
presidential campaign. The bill he signed into law eliminated the
sales tax on condoms, an unpopular move with certain conservative
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum,
said tax-free condoms will promote promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is loath to talk about the issue. His spokesman, Mike
Jones, said, ``The governor has stated before that abstinence is
the only 100 percent effective way to prevent pregnancy and
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted the vast majority of the $160 million tax cut
involves such items as vitamins and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush is afraid of appearing to give tacit approval to
premarital sex, studies have shown that the elimination of sales
taxes on condoms will not encourage promiscuity, said Michael Ross,
a public health professor at the University of Texas-Houston Health
Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of condoms is lowered, ``all that will happen is
that the people who are promiscuous will continue to be
promiscuous, but they will not be transmitting the diseases they
would otherwise be transmitting,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas spends $3.6 million per year to combat the notion among
teens and pre-teens that sexual activity among middle school
students is expected, said Rachelle Hill, head of the abstinence
education program at the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring in the use of contraceptives, you are already
implying that sexual activity is accepted,'' she said. So condoms
and other birth control are not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The state money is matched by federal funds, a program that
Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has called for
expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms are a health issue and should not become a political
issue, said Peggy Romberg, executive director of the Texas Family
Planning Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get very frustrated that so much public health policy is
being driven by politics and what religious extremists want, as
opposed to basing public health policy on what is good for the
health and well-being of Texas citizens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For public health workers, condoms are not a scandalous item. In
San Antonio, Bexar County officials respond to outbreaks of
sexually transmitted diseases by handing out condoms on the street,
in bars and even at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that (condoms are) probably the most effective
method of preventing the spread of sexually transmitted disease and
also of preventing unwanted pregnancies,'' said Dr. Fernando
Guerra, director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams of the Texas Eagle Forum said the wrong message is
being sent when the government makes getting condoms easier, either
through a tax cut or free distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as parents, and certainly our governor, have been saying
that we want our children to be abstinent from sexual activity
until they are married,'' she said. The state tax code, by
providing an incentive to buy condoms, creates a mixed message, she
said.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tax exemption for condoms became part of the law almost by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston, introduced the first
version of the bill in 1999. His legislation would have cut the
sales tax on diapers and other medicine for children, but not
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   He did not want his bill ``bogging down into a divisive
argument,'' spokesman Jeremy Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had proposed a similar tax cut in 1998 as a way to help
families. He, too, ruled out condoms.
</P>
<P>
   To simplify matters, Ellis' bill was rewritten to state that all
medicinal items ``labeled with a national drug code'' would be
exempt from the sales tax. Prophylactics help prevent the spread
sexually transmitted diseases, so the federal government gave them
a drug code. But the bill was still targeted at children's
medicine, ruling out condoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, an amendment was tacked on to greatly expand the
reach of the tax cut. The new version covered all over-the-counter
medicines and health aids, not just those for children.
</P>
<P>
   These two sets of changes opened the door for condoms.
</P>
<P>
   As the only pharmacist in the Texas House, then-state Rep.
Leticia Van de Putte, a Democrat from San Antonio, said she made
her fellow lawmakers aware of the new amendment's implications. She
is now a state senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned to my colleagues on the House floor that (the
amendment) included things below the belly button,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Roberto Gutierrez, a Democrat from McAllen, who
helped write the amendment, said few questions were asked about
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one asked,'' he said, ``and no one said.''

</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The British are coming! Again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's wishful thinking since I'm a sucker for all things
Britpop, but I have a feeling that 2000 will be year in which the
United Kingdom's jangly psychedelia stages another siege on these
shores.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits last ruled in 1997, spearheaded by the Verve and
Radiohead, and secondarily assaulted by Kula Shaker and Blur. And
the signs are there for a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the hottest tickets in San Francisco so far in
this short year were (a) the Cure at the Fillmore (b) Travis, at
the Bottom of the Hill, who will be returning with Oasis to the
Berkeley Community Theatre April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Wheel's April-due album and tour is buzz-worthy.
Elastica's new album is so eagerly anticipated that songs are being
leaked on the Internet. And Richard Ashcroft, singer-songwriter for
the now-defunct Verve, has finished a much-ballyhooed solo album
and is soon to tour behind it.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest tangible evidence of a U.K.-based uprising was
heard Tuesday night at the Warfield, where two of the island
nation's most popular bands lit up the chilly sky: the venerable
standard-bearers Charlatans UK, and relative upstarts
Stereophonics, from Wales.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd to think that these two bands could fill Wembly Stadium
in London with 50,000 screaming fans, but in this country are still
just a notch above curiosities. Still, that may yet change,
especially for Stereophonics, who have potentially greater
alt-rock-radio appeal than Charlatans. Both bands are fronted by
gorgeous, emotive (if diminutive) singers _ also a plus in MTV
land.
</P>
<P>
   Stereophonics' excellent new album, ``Performance and
Cocktails,'' earned them several Brit Awards nominations (the
equivalent of our Grammys). In their hour-long opening set (this
tour is more of a co-headliner setup), Stereophonics showed why
they were causing such a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Kelly Jones has an engagingly hoarse tenor, somewhere
between Paul Westerberg and Rod Stewart, writes impressively
literate lyrics, and knows how to interpret a song. A high point
was the band's U.K. Stonesy hit, ``The Bartender and the Thief,''
which rocked the house down. Also excellent were the haunting
``Hurry Up and Wait,'' and the anthemic ``I Wouldn't Believe Your
Radio.'' Like Travis' show last month, this one was all about the
song, which meant lulls while ballads were crooned.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Charlatans UK flat-out rocked, with nary a
dip in intensity. In the early `190s, the band, along with the
Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, helped define what became known as
the ``Manchester sound.'' Because they never made it as big as
their imitators (who include pretty much everyone mentioned above),
there's always confusion as to who influenced whom, but listening
to the band Tuesday night, and to their excellent, watershed new
album, ``Us and Us Only,'' it was clear that this is a band that
has developed its sound to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Singer-heartthrob Tim Burgess (who was still a teen when
Charlatans formed) showed off his eccentric, floppy-handed delivery
and pouty lips to perfection, although his normally hearty and
fluid vocals were much diminished by a cold. Opening with the
Dylan-fused ``Forever,'' Charlatans UK laid claim to the stage with
the authority of a band that's played together for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible,'' their newest single, was simple and poignant,
and smacked of alternative country. ``Senses'' was bluesy euphoria,
reminiscent of the Stones' ``Exile on Main Street'' era. And with
``A House is Not a Home,'' they exploded with a joyful noise
reminiscent of the Verve's majestic show here two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cross your fingers that the euphoria felt among audience members
will translate to record sales and radio play. If this is the
British invasion, I hope they win the war.

   Attention health-conscious shoppers: The salad dressing in aisle
one is now spiked with a drug that lowers your cholesterol. In the
produce section, you'll find carrots bred to reduce the risk of
cancer. And on the way out, why not grab a snack bar that helps
stave off heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods _ those that confer benefits beyond basic
nutrition _ are changing the rules about how to eat healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, your staid supermarket will sell an array
of ordinary edibles with extraordinary claims. The first of these
products _ just hitting the market _ contains novel
health-enhancing additives or benefit from breeding intended to
boost the innate medicinal properties of fruits and vegetables.
Farther ahead, some researchers plan to redesign nature's bounty
from the genes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing the marriage of the food and pharmaceutical
industries,'' says food scientist Manfred Kroger of Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly six in 10 shoppers already choose groceries with the
idea of managing or lowering their risk of illness. Rudimentary
functional foods _ such as orange juice enriched with vitamins C
and E _ are a $15 billion market in this country, says Tom Aarts,
publisher of the Nutrition Business Journal in San Diego. Those
numbers are expected to soar over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, the giant Swiss-based pharmaceutical corporation, is
throwing its full weight behind the functional-food movement. For
years the company has touted Ovaltine, its chocolate-milk mix, as a
vitamin and mineral supplement. Last year in Europe, Novartis
introduced a broad line of cereals, snack bars and other foods
spiked with ingredients that diminish the likelihood of heart
disease and osteoporosis. The products still rely on relatively
traditional health aids like calcium and dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis is readying foods with a new functional additive:
Phytrol, a wood-pulp extract that lowers levels of ``bad'' LDL
cholesterol in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that
soy protein lowers heart-disease risk, guaranteeing that a slew of
soy-enriched foods will show up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section of the grocery is also getting a functional
makeover. Leonard Pike of Texas A&AMP;M University has created
BetaSweet, a maroon carrot packed with beta-carotene and
anthocyanin, antioxidants that may reduce the risk of cancer and
fight aging. Adventurous shoppers are crunching the BetaSweet right
now in its Houston test market.
</P>
<P>
   Pike is also breeding carrots rich in lycopene _ a chemical that
gives tomatoes their red color and may also reduce the risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are delving into DNA in their quest for better
ways to eat. At Monsanto, researchers are reconfiguring the genes
of potato plants to create a starchier tuber that absorbs less oil
during frying.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for
Plant Research at Cornell University, is working on perhaps the
most ambitious genetically engineered food of all: an edible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen and his colleagues genetically modified potatoes so they
incorporate a protein from the hepatitis B virus. The protein is
harmless, but it trains the immune system to recognize the virus
and mount a preemptive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen is also working on engineered bananas and tomatoes and
targeting other diseases, such as cholera. Preliminary human trials
last year showed the concept works with raw potatoes. Follow-up
studies with processed potatoes and tomatoes are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Like iron-rich rice, disease-preventing foods are intended
primarily for poor countries where hundreds of millions of children
today do not have access to vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a tomato sauce whether they're in Colombia or
Cambodia,'' Arntzen says.
</P>
<P>
   But custom-designed functional foods are still a long way from
the dinner table. Some scientists and activists suspect tinkering
with DNA will cause long-term health and environmental problems.
Opposition to genetically modified food, which has sparked mass
demonstrations in Europe, is growing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean DellaPenna, a plant biologist at the University of
Nevada at Reno, is more concerned that the genetic-engineering
debate will slow efforts to improve nutrition worldwide. Many
people get enough to eat, he notes, but still suffer from
malnutrition because they do not have access to a well-rounded
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bellies are full, so we can afford to argue, but some 3
billion people in the world don't have that luxury. Once we can
show the direct benefit of genetic modification, I hope consumers
will realize the possibilities of the technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   DellaPenna hopes to make his case by showing how to reconfigure
staple crops to increase their vitamin E content tenfold. Plenty of
other functional foods don't require cracking the genome. Additives
like Phytrol and soy protein are derived from perfectly ordinary
trees and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Pike used only conventional breeding for his BetaSweet carrot,
crossing seeds from Brazil to obtain a root with stellar taste and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be as fast or exciting as genetic modification, but
we can do it without upsetting people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding alone could still fill stores with racks of
heart-friendly soybeans, cancer-fighting tomatoes and anticlotting
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Hasler, director of the Functional Foods for Health
Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, predicts
tomorrow's grocery store will house a miniclinic that administers a
quick blood test and a genome printout, including a person's top
disease risks and a recommended shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will lead people to diet patterns that defray
_ or even eliminate _ many of the chronic diseases we face,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   If privacy is an issue, people might run their genome tests at
home and then shop for appropriately tailored foods on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the focus on individualized nutrition will begin
before birth, Kroger says. Hospitals already test babies for the
enzyme phenylalanine hydrolase. Children who lack it must avoid any
food containing the amino acid phenylalanine _ including meat and
even mother's milk _ or risk mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already modifying diet based on a gene,'' Kroger says.
``Soon, we'll be able to go a step further _ to take an amniotic
fluid sample from an unborn baby and determine its genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful parents could then pick out optimal functional baby
foods. If the food companies have their way, that's one early trend
that will stick around for a lifetime.

<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

   Attention health-conscious shoppers: The salad dressing in aisle
one is now spiked with a drug that lowers your cholesterol. In the
produce section, you'll find carrots bred to reduce the risk of
cancer. And on the way out, why not grab a snack bar that helps
stave off heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods _ those that confer benefits beyond basic
nutrition _ are changing the rules about how to eat healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, your staid supermarket will sell an array
of ordinary edibles with extraordinary claims. The first of these
products _ just hitting the market _ contains novel
health-enhancing additives or benefit from breeding intended to
boost the innate medicinal properties of fruits and vegetables.
Farther ahead, some researchers plan to redesign nature's bounty
from the genes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing the marriage of the food and pharmaceutical
industries,'' says food scientist Manfred Kroger of Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly six in 10 shoppers already choose groceries with the
idea of managing or lowering their risk of illness. Rudimentary
functional foods _ such as orange juice enriched with vitamins C
and E _ are a $15 billion market in this country, says Tom Aarts,
publisher of the Nutrition Business Journal in San Diego. Those
numbers are expected to soar over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, the giant Swiss-based pharmaceutical corporation, is
throwing its full weight behind the functional-food movement. For
years the company has touted Ovaltine, its chocolate-milk mix, as a
vitamin and mineral supplement. Last year in Europe, Novartis
introduced a broad line of cereals, snack bars and other foods
spiked with ingredients that diminish the likelihood of heart
disease and osteoporosis. The products still rely on relatively
traditional health aids like calcium and dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis is readying foods with a new functional additive:
Phytrol, a wood-pulp extract that lowers levels of ``bad'' LDL
cholesterol in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that
soy protein lowers heart-disease risk, guaranteeing that a slew of
soy-enriched foods will show up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section of the grocery is also getting a functional
makeover. Leonard Pike of Texas A&AMP;M University has created
BetaSweet, a maroon carrot packed with beta-carotene and
anthocyanin, antioxidants that may reduce the risk of cancer and
fight aging. Adventurous shoppers are crunching the BetaSweet right
now in its Houston test market.
</P>
<P>
   Pike is also breeding carrots rich in lycopene _ a chemical that
gives tomatoes their red color and may also reduce the risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are delving into DNA in their quest for better
ways to eat. At Monsanto, researchers are reconfiguring the genes
of potato plants to create a starchier tuber that absorbs less oil
during frying.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for
Plant Research at Cornell University, is working on perhaps the
most ambitious genetically engineered food of all: an edible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen and his colleagues genetically modified potatoes so they
incorporate a protein from the hepatitis B virus. The protein is
harmless, but it trains the immune system to recognize the virus
and mount a preemptive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen is also working on engineered bananas and tomatoes and
targeting other diseases, such as cholera. Preliminary human trials
last year showed the concept works with raw potatoes. Follow-up
studies with processed potatoes and tomatoes are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Like iron-rich rice, disease-preventing foods are intended
primarily for poor countries where hundreds of millions of children
today do not have access to vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a tomato sauce whether they're in Colombia or
Cambodia,'' Arntzen says.
</P>
<P>
   But custom-designed functional foods are still a long way from
the dinner table. Some scientists and activists suspect tinkering
with DNA will cause long-term health and environmental problems.
Opposition to genetically modified food, which has sparked mass
demonstrations in Europe, is growing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean DellaPenna, a plant biologist at the University of
Nevada at Reno, is more concerned that the genetic-engineering
debate will slow efforts to improve nutrition worldwide. Many
people get enough to eat, he notes, but still suffer from
malnutrition because they do not have access to a well-rounded
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bellies are full, so we can afford to argue, but some 3
billion people in the world don't have that luxury. Once we can
show the direct benefit of genetic modification, I hope consumers
will realize the possibilities of the technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   DellaPenna hopes to make his case by showing how to reconfigure
staple crops to increase their vitamin E content tenfold. Plenty of
other functional foods don't require cracking the genome. Additives
like Phytrol and soy protein are derived from perfectly ordinary
trees and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Pike used only conventional breeding for his BetaSweet carrot,
crossing seeds from Brazil to obtain a root with stellar taste and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be as fast or exciting as genetic modification, but
we can do it without upsetting people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding alone could still fill stores with racks of
heart-friendly soybeans, cancer-fighting tomatoes and anticlotting
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Hasler, director of the Functional Foods for Health
Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, predicts
tomorrow's grocery store will house a miniclinic that administers a
quick blood test and a genome printout, including a person's top
disease risks and a recommended shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will lead people to diet patterns that defray
_ or even eliminate _ many of the chronic diseases we face,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   If privacy is an issue, people might run their genome tests at
home and then shop for appropriately tailored foods on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the focus on individualized nutrition will begin
before birth, Kroger says. Hospitals already test babies for the
enzyme phenylalanine hydrolase. Children who lack it must avoid any
food containing the amino acid phenylalanine _ including meat and
even mother's milk _ or risk mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already modifying diet based on a gene,'' Kroger says.
``Soon, we'll be able to go a step further _ to take an amniotic
fluid sample from an unborn baby and determine its genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful parents could then pick out optimal functional baby
foods. If the food companies have their way, that's one early trend
that will stick around for a lifetime.

<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?

   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;

   On a recent morning, Jennifer Connelly stood before the mirror
in the bathroom of her West Village apartment and found her first
gray hair. This may come as a shock to anyone who remembers
Connelly's stint as an '80s teen queen _ or, further back, as the
12-year-old who melted boys' hearts from behind a chink in the wall
in Sergio Leone's 1984 epic, ``Once Upon a Time in America.''
</P>
<P>
   If you did grow up in the '80s, then chances are you saw
Connelly play the pubescent baby sitter in Jim Henson's
``Labyrinth'' and then the rebellious rich girl _ with blown-out
hair, Brooke Shields eyebrows and a ``Dynasty''-sized coat over
leggings _ in John Hughes' ``Career Opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a cameo in a Duran Duran video and the release of
a pop song _ in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly laughs looking back on the fleeting moment when she was
a male teen-ager's ultimate fantasy object _ the face that launched
a thousand dirt bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about the old stuff is like having a conversation
with someone you were once in a relationship with,'' she says later
that day, sitting down to a pot of tea at a neighborhood
restaurant. ``You remember how there was once this incredible
intimacy between you, but now you feel like strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   With three high-profile films scheduled for release this year,
Connelly is about to show that she's come a long way since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Keith Gordon's ``Waking the Dead,'' in which she
stars as a bright-eyed '70s activist whose mysterious death starts
to haunt her lover (Billy Crudup) 10 years later _ so much so that
he begins to suspect she may still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Next come Darren Aronofsky's ``Requiem for a Dream,''
co-starring Jared Leto, and Ed Harris' ``Pollock,'' about the life
of the Abstract Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has said, with just a touch of Hollywood overstatement,
that casting Connelly's part in ``Waking the Dead'' was akin to the
search for a Scarlett O'Hara for ``Gone with the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jennifer just had this tremendous intelligence,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the actresses who read for the part struck
Gordon as clueless, Connelly engaged him on subjects ranging from
Isabel Allende and magical realism to quantum physics and
Schrodinger's cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt that I knew Billy thought highly of her,'' he
adds. ``I had called him and he said, `I don't think people even
realize how good she is yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the obvious chemistry between Connelly and Crudup,
already recorded in 1996's ``Inventing the Abbotts.'' Shooting the
love scenes in ``Waking the Dead,'' Connelly had to take frequent
timeouts to unpeel Crudup's hippie-style muttonchops every time
they ended up stuck to her forehead. But there's nothing goofy
about the final cut, which is fraught with a kind of ominous
passion.
</P>
<P>
   As for Connelly's offscreen romantic life, she spent five years
with Bill Campbell, her co-star in 1991's ``The Rocketeer,'' and
recently ended a relationship with Dave Dougan, a photographer and
the father of her 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something so new I'm not sure I should even talk about
it,'' she says. ``But it's hot. My God, I have such a one-track
mind these days! I run around making lists of all the things I need
to do in our next sexual encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   All this bedroom talk comes as a surprise, since Connelly
insists that it's the nerd, not the nymph, with whom she
identifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange to start working as a child,'' says the
actress, who began modeling at 10 and had appeared in nine films by
the time she was 20. ``I was being so much watched from the outside
that I became very careful _ which is sort of crippling. In certain
ways you grow up fast, but I think in other ways you arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   After the string of teen flicks, Connelly decided to take a
break and enrolled at Yale. But when her ``lack of socialization
skills'' got the best of her, Connelly left _ first for Stanford,
then to work on another string of films she'd rather not think
about (``Far Harbor,'' ``Mulholland Falls,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Now 29, Connelly picks her roles carefully, but she's just as
happy thinking about the outer-space mural she's planning for her
son Kai's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years on the outer rim of the limelight,
Connelly is far too familiar with the fallibility of the acting
life to submit to the fantasies Hollywood spins for its leading
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just avoid the word `celebrity,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her insistence that acting is a job like any other,
you can sense her enchantment when she talks about how her dream
role relates to her dream man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about the guy I'm looking for these days, it's
somebody who's completely uninhibited, who defies all
conventions,'' she says. ``The guy who's just so real, so amazingly
clear. You know that guy? I want to play that girl.'' &QL;

   On a recent morning, Jennifer Connelly stood before the mirror
in the bathroom of her West Village apartment and found her first
gray hair. This may come as a shock to anyone who remembers
Connelly's stint as an '80s teen queen _ or, further back, as the
12-year-old who melted boys' hearts from behind a chink in the wall
in Sergio Leone's 1984 epic, ``Once Upon a Time in America.''
</P>
<P>
   If you did grow up in the '80s, then chances are you saw
Connelly play the pubescent baby sitter in Jim Henson's
``Labyrinth'' and then the rebellious rich girl _ with blown-out
hair, Brooke Shields eyebrows and a ``Dynasty''-sized coat over
leggings _ in John Hughes' ``Career Opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a cameo in a Duran Duran video and the release of
a pop song _ in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly laughs looking back on the fleeting moment when she was
a male teen-ager's ultimate fantasy object _ the face that launched
a thousand dirt bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about the old stuff is like having a conversation
with someone you were once in a relationship with,'' she says later
that day, sitting down to a pot of tea at a neighborhood
restaurant. ``You remember how there was once this incredible
intimacy between you, but now you feel like strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   With three high-profile films scheduled for release this year,
Connelly is about to show that she's come a long way since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Keith Gordon's ``Waking the Dead,'' in which she
stars as a bright-eyed '70s activist whose mysterious death starts
to haunt her lover (Billy Crudup) 10 years later _ so much so that
he begins to suspect she may still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Next come Darren Aronofsky's ``Requiem for a Dream,''
co-starring Jared Leto, and Ed Harris' ``Pollock,'' about the life
of the Abstract Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has said, with just a touch of Hollywood overstatement,
that casting Connelly's part in ``Waking the Dead'' was akin to the
search for a Scarlett O'Hara for ``Gone with the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jennifer just had this tremendous intelligence,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the actresses who read for the part struck
Gordon as clueless, Connelly engaged him on subjects ranging from
Isabel Allende and magical realism to quantum physics and
Schrodinger's cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt that I knew Billy thought highly of her,'' he
adds. ``I had called him and he said, `I don't think people even
realize how good she is yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the obvious chemistry between Connelly and Crudup,
already recorded in 1996's ``Inventing the Abbotts.'' Shooting the
love scenes in ``Waking the Dead,'' Connelly had to take frequent
timeouts to unpeel Crudup's hippie-style muttonchops every time
they ended up stuck to her forehead. But there's nothing goofy
about the final cut, which is fraught with a kind of ominous
passion.
</P>
<P>
   As for Connelly's offscreen romantic life, she spent five years
with Bill Campbell, her co-star in 1991's ``The Rocketeer,'' and
recently ended a relationship with Dave Dougan, a photographer and
the father of her 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something so new I'm not sure I should even talk about
it,'' she says. ``But it's hot. My God, I have such a one-track
mind these days! I run around making lists of all the things I need
to do in our next sexual encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   All this bedroom talk comes as a surprise, since Connelly
insists that it's the nerd, not the nymph, with whom she
identifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange to start working as a child,'' says the
actress, who began modeling at 10 and had appeared in nine films by
the time she was 20. ``I was being so much watched from the outside
that I became very careful _ which is sort of crippling. In certain
ways you grow up fast, but I think in other ways you arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   After the string of teen flicks, Connelly decided to take a
break and enrolled at Yale. But when her ``lack of socialization
skills'' got the best of her, Connelly left _ first for Stanford,
then to work on another string of films she'd rather not think
about (``Far Harbor,'' ``Mulholland Falls,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Now 29, Connelly picks her roles carefully, but she's just as
happy thinking about the outer-space mural she's planning for her
son Kai's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years on the outer rim of the limelight,
Connelly is far too familiar with the fallibility of the acting
life to submit to the fantasies Hollywood spins for its leading
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just avoid the word `celebrity,''' she says.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANO, Nigeria _ Squinting in the hot West African sun, farmer
Sabo Garba wades into the waste-high wheat that has turned the pale
amber color of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is perfection,'' Othman Yahaya Othman shouts to Garba
with pride. ``This is what it is supposed to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Othman has worked with Garba, showing him how to
increase his yield of crops with new methods of farming. This
harvest will represent a passage of sorts: Garba now will employ
these new techniques on the rest of his land and teach his
neighbors by example.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it also will represent a small passage for all of
Africa, which has been struggling for decades to feed its
burgeoning population.
</P>
<P>
   Othman is the Kano state coordinator for Sasakawa Global 2000, a
joint venture of the Tokyo-based Sasakawa Africa Association and
Global 2000, an arm of the Carter Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kano rests on an arid plain a hot breeze away from the Sahara
desert. But beneath much of the dusty plain lies fresh water _ in
some places just a few feet underground. When the land is properly
irrigated and farmed, it is immensely productive.
</P>
<P>
   Othman envisions an African breadbasket stretching more than 400
miles across northern Nigeria to Lake Chad. ``When you see this
here, it's only a start,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects for this vision are uncertain. Nigeria is
struggling in its first year under a fledgling democracy. The new
government's agriculture policies _ which can be life or death to
small farmers _ have as yet to take. And peace in Africa is always
tenuous. Recent weeks in Nigeria have included spurts of sectarian
violence between Muslims and Christians _ killing more than 3,000
people in one violent episode.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Othman has continued making his rounds to the
farmers. On test plots of an acre or less, he teaches them how to
apply fertilizer, to plant disease-resistant seeds and better
methods of pest control and weeding.
</P>
<P>
   SG 2000 insists that farmers adhere strictly to the regimen.
When they stray, they are dropped to make way for farmers who will
follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   When the recipe is followed faithfully, the results can be
dramatic _ doubling, and even tripling yields.
</P>
<P>
   Using the methods he learned as a boy, Garba used to get five
bags of wheat _ less than half a ton _ from his parcel of an acre
or so carved out of the dry brown savanna. Now he expects to
harvest 13 bags _ about a ton and a half _ from the same land.
</P>
<P>
   Even though wheat prices have become depressed by an influx of
cheap imports since the government removed restrictions on
agricultural products, Garba expects to make a little extra money.
He intends to invest some of it in his small appliance shop in the
nearby village.
</P>
<P>
   SG 2000 organizers are committed to using farmers such as Garba
as the medium for their message. ``We depend on farmers showing
other farmers how this works _ they teach each other,'' says Jose
Antonio Valencia, SG 2000's director for Nigeria and the only
non-African working with the program in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When the program came to Nigeria eight years ago, the SG 2000
system was greeted with skepticism. Initially, it requires more
labor, precision and money than traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers must sow within narrow windows of time, space plants
according to exact measurements and work precise amounts of
fertilizer into the soil rather than simply tossing a handful on a
young plant. To make measuring fertilizer easier, SG 2000 had
special spoons made.
</P>
<P>
   When Garba first heard the organization's pitch, he listened
with wizened suspicion. ``At first I was thinking that this won't
work, that they're planting these too close together, But, now,
look,'' he says pointing at his second dense crop of wheat.
</P>
<P>
   SG 2000 uses few outside experts and places on farmers the
burden of using the new techniques and financing seed and
fertilizer. Early on, the program provided loans to farmers to get
started. Now, farmers must pay in advance for seed and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, farmers work with the program about two years, long
enough to learn the system but not so long that they become
dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though farmers must invest more time, money and energy on
their crops, their yields and incomes tend to rise by more than
enough to justify the trouble. Average yields of corn have more
than tripled using the techniques, while wheat has enjoyed similar
success.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been in Africa since the mid-1980s. It has
operated in a dozen countries in addition to Nigeria, and has been
credited with dramatic increases in corn, wheat and rice production
throughout the sub-Saharan region.
</P>
<P>
   Its methods were developed by Norman Borlaug, the American
agronomist who heads the Sasakawa part of the venture. Borlaug won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for breeding the high-yield wheat
that set off Asia's green revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which has involved more than 12,000 Nigerian
farmers, operates in six states here, mostly in the poor, rural
north.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is seen as crucial to the goal of making Africa
self-sufficient for food. With more than 110 million people,
Nigeria is home to 20 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa
and the largest and most influential country in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the SG 2000 program nearly gave up on Nigeria, which in 15
years of military rule became one of the world's most dangerous and
corrupt places. ``It was very difficult dealing with the military
regime,'' said Valencia, who also is the country director for
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Corruption, which for decades has entered every facet of
Nigerian existence, also consumed SA 2000's resources. ``Out of a
budget of $500,000, maybe $200,000 would actually get to the
farms,'' Valencia said, adding that government officials appeared
to be more interested in lining their pockets than seeing farmers
progress into the modern age. ``Nobody has been willing to teach
the farmers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so bad that Valencia said he was reluctant to bring
new cars into Nigeria despite the severe needs of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   SG 2000 officials decided to stay only after last year's
election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president. Obasanjo, a respected
chicken farmer, also is a former member of SG 2000's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties of working in such an environment, the
program has endured because it has remained focused, Valencia said.
``We bypass everybody and go directly to the farmers _ that's the
only way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Winning farmers over to fertilizer and new seeds is only half
the battle. The other half is convincing governments to pursue
policies that provide farmers high enough prices to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   While SG 2000 has shown the region's potential for growing
wheat, the Nigerian government has undermined these efforts by
allowing in nearly unlimited cheap imported wheat, Valencia said.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged farmers have been turning to growing tomatoes,
peppers and other crops that get a better price but do little to
help the continent's food needs.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia regards this as a tragic trend that undercuts the
effort to ensure Africa's food supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the farmers can't make any money at wheat _ as important as
it is _ they'll grow something else that has a better market,'' he
said. ``This is a shame.''

&HT;     `ER' GETS SOME WORTHY COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When ``ER'' first burst onto the scene, it was a
mix of supreme drama and over-the-top hospital theatrics _ yelling,
running, cameras swooshing around the room. The worry then was that
even though you couldn't take your eyes off it, who could bear the
clatter?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people, apparently. ``ER'' (NBC) has been the most
dominant drama on television since it debuted. With two other
hospital dramas already on the schedule _ ``Chicago Hope'' and
``City of Angels'' (both CBS) _ a cynic might say a fourth is
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC's new midseason replacement series, ``Wonderland,'' is a
special kind of hospital drama, one that recalls all the greatness
of ``ER'' without having yet fallen into the soap-operaesque
storylines of a tired front-runner. In fact, ``Wonderland'' is the
new ``ER,'' the fresh take with a twist. Anyone with an inkling
that ``ER'' has played itself out and needs a discharge should take
a look at this show's premiere (10 p.m. Eastern Thursday). Yep, a
head-to-head battle with the champ _ conventional programming
wisdom would call that a suicide mission.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is worth skipping ``ER'' to watch ``Wonderland.'' It
isn't about ruptured spleens and heart attacks. It's about the
mentally ill, the psychotics and schizophrenics and the severely
depressed. It's about the doctors who take care of these special
cases, the so-called gatekeepers holding the barbarians back from
society.
</P>
<P>
   Produced, written and directed by Peter Berg (himself an alum of
``Chicago Hope,'' as well as an independent filmmaker),
``Wonderland'' is a riveting if challenging bit of television. Berg
and a team of writers spent months at New York's Bellevue hospital,
where they were allowed to witness and interview doctors working
with the mentally ill. They've borrowed storylines from there and
have gained a convincing knowledge of psychiatry and its terms,
much as ``ER'' mastered the fine art of yelling for drugs and
clinical tools with the right words.
</P>
<P>
   To further the effect of being in what is essentially an asylum,
Berg uses hand-held cameras and lets the actors improvise when
needed. This gives ``Wonderland'' a gritty, realistic feel. But the
technique also adds a sense of chaos to the viewing experience.
Watching ``Wonderland'' is a sensory overload, as patients scream
at the top of their lungs, bang on things, turn TV channels rapidly
and provide a kind of non-stop white noise over the show's
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who have put to bed unruly children will find no relief
here, nor will anyone else seeking to unwind from the day's work.
``Wonderland'' makes the frenetic talking-and-walking banter of
``The West Wing'' look like a mime show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Wonderland'' has more in common with Martin
Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead'' than any hospital drama on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But those who hang in there will discover the potential of
television's next great drama. The doctors and patients in Rivervue
Hospital's psychiatric and emergency wards are an engaging bunch.
Dr. Robert Banger (Ted Levine, ``Silence of the Lambs'') heads the
forensic psychiatry department. He's the calmest in the storm _ a
trait he needs with a crumbling marriage and the impending custody
loss of his two beloved young sons. Levine is brilliant, by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Another forensic specialist is Dr. Neil Harrison (Martin
Donovan, ``The Opposite of Sex''), who is married to Dr. Lyla
Garrity (Michelle Forbes, ``Homicide: Life on the Street''). The
two are expecting their first child, and for two tightly wound
people, that's just added pressure. Donovan has been wonderful in
every movie he's been in and Forbes' intensity is her greatest
asset. She heads the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program _
meaning she has to decide if people checking in to the crowded
hospital are really disturbed or not. A misread in the pilot leads
to the dramatic crux: A mentally ill man who thinks he's taking
orders from Zeus guns down five people in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix: young Dr. Abe Matthews (Billy Burke), whose
womanizing and fear of intimacy sometimes cloud his psychiatric
evaluations; Dr. Derrick Hatcher (Michael Jai White), a physician
(as opposed to a shrink) at the hospital; and resident Heather
Miles (Joelle Carter), who is bright and understanding (and a
potential romantic partner to Dr. Matthews). Like any good series,
``Wonderland'' is littered with smaller characters giving fine
performances, and its ``crazy people'' truly get into their parts.
</P>
<P>
   The writing and acting in this series are superb. And Berg
hasn't tried to tell too many stories too quickly, so we can get to
know the characters slowly. That said, the pilot has an explosive
subplot that kick starts everything.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been attracted to the reality feel of ``NYPD Blue'' or
the fine writing of a show like ``The West Wing,'' you'll see the
potential in ``Wonderland'' right away. This thing is just dripping
with quality. The question is whether you can adjust to the
in-your-face chaos and, more importantly, if you can give up
``ER.''

ON A ROLL WITH FROZEN DOUGH

CAPTIONS:

Frozen bread dough makes a great base for creations such as Lemon
Danish Rolls and Salami, Provolone and Pepper Torte. 
 
 
Charcoal Grilled Pizza Style Breads lend themselves to a variety of
toppings, including tomatow-basil. 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever spent a little time perusing the freezer cases at
the market, you've probably run across those snow-white loaves of
frozen unbaked bread dough.
</P>
<P>
   They are nothing new. They've been around since the early '60s
when Bridgeford Foods Corp. introduced them at a cost of 49 cents
for three. And the product _ which other companies also produce _
continues to have a faithful following today.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I have baked a couple of the white loaves over the
years, I could never get jazzed about the flavor or texture. But
that's not surprising because I grew up around fabulous homebaked
yeast rolls, coffee cakes and breads.
</P>
<P>
   However, after a little exploration recently, I discovered that
you can transform the dough into something more _ and delicious _
by adding a medley of different ingredients. It's easy to change
flavors and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The loaves offer lots of short-cut options for making all kinds
of yeast dough-based creations ranging from a variety of sweet and
savory items _ from pizzas, focaccia, sandwiches, twists,
empanades, calzone, fondue bread, pizza rolls, herb twists, stuffed
sandwich loaves and garlic herb bread to cinnamon rolls, monkey
bread, turnovers, Danish, coffee cakes, hot cross buns and all
kinds of special holiday breads.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of the Bridgeford's food service sandwich and meat
business, the frozen dough product came into being at a time when
convenience products were all the rage, said Lorene Salcido,
director of advertising and public relations at the Anaheim-based
company,which opened in 1932 as a meat market.
</P>
<P>
   The product _ the formula has not changed _ enabled consumers to
serve a fresh-baked loaf of bread hot from the oven without
spending time making and kneading the dough. What a boon!
</P>
<P>
   ``For a number of years, the main consumer of the product was 55
years or older, but today there is increased interest from younger
mothers who desire more input in meal preparation,'' said Salcido.
``Also, with the resurgence of interest in comfort foods and bread
in the '90s, more people are baking bread again, either from
scratch or using frozen bread dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Grab a loaf of frozen dough _ or two or three _ and begin having
some fun. Use today's recipes as a starting point to come up with
your own combinations and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's feasible to substitute honey wheat (packaged two
1-pound loaves to a bag) for the white bread dough (which is the
most readily available locally) in recipes _ or in some cases white
rolls (available in 27-ounce bags) or parkerhouse rolls (in
25-ounce packages) _ these products are more difficult to track
down in local supermarkets (we tried unsuccessfully).
</P>
<P>
   I turned out a focaccia-like creation effortlessly with one and
a half loaves in a 14-inch pizza pan. After pressing the thawed
dough in the greased pan, it was drizzled with some extra virgin
olive oil, a sprinkling of dried basil and grated Parmesan cheese.
A 15- to 20-minute bake in a 350-degree oven yielded a
lovely-looking golden, fragrant creation that tasted good, too.
</P>
<P>
   I also whipped up a cream cheese coffee cake by lining a 9-inch
round cake pan (or use a pie pan) _ bottom and sides _ with thawed
dough and adding a cream cheese filling made with a package of
cream cheese, an egg, 1/2 cup sugar, two teaspoons flour, a little
vanilla and grated orange peel. Before pouring on the cream cheese
mixture, I sprinkled the dough with a couple of handfuls of
chocolate chips. After baking the filling until set (20 to 25
minutes), the end result was delicious. Tasters gave it a thumbs
up.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I plan to try making bread bowls for soups or chilis along
with some stuffed sandwiches and filled appetizers. The dough
definitely has possibilities, so give it a chance.

&HT;     CONFESSIONS OF AN SUV CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is a tough confession to make, but I've
gone over to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   I now have both a sport utility vehicle and a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, first I became a Republican, and now I'm despoiling the
environment and talking loudly to myself in restaurants. But hold
on. It isn't quite like that.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I'm not piloting one of those 10 mpg,
Toyota-squishing, Tiger tank SUVs. It's just a baby SUV, a Honda
CRV with a Civic engine that gets 25 mpg around town and is built
just barely tough enough to get up my driveway _ which genuinely
requires four-wheel drive or deer hooves.
</P>
<P>
   I've had the car for a while, but as an early campaigner against
SUVs I've been ashamed to admit it. The thing about having a Honda
SUV is that you're betwixt and between, neither fish nor fowl and
permanently a little pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban panzer drivers in Ford Explorers and Land Rovers
sneer at your wimpy little on-road four-wheel-drive with no low-end
gear ratios. Meanwhile, your 25 mpg doesn't win you any points with
tree-huggers, bicyclists and pedestrian liberationists.
</P>
<P>
   You're just another jerk in an SUV _ and you probably have a
cell phone, too.
</P>
<P>
   And I do. But I don't dial and drive at the same time. I don't
have the skill, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   You can see I'm making fine distinctions to avoid being
convicted as a typical phone-carrying, SUV-driving idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Idiot, maybe, and here's why.
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst confession of all. I wear my little Nokia
clipped to my belt, or if I'm feeling really jaunty, I hang it low
on my pocket like a Western six-gun.
</P>
<P>
   I've been traipsing around like that for 2 1/2 weeks, and my
wife still laughs when she sees me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' I tell her, ``if I put it in a coat pocket, it'll fall
out, and I won't be able to keep in constant touch with you, my
love. That's the reason we got these phones remember?'' That's what
I tell her.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I feel kind of macho geeky with a Nokia gunbelt. Geeks
are the new macho men and macha women, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when my wife calls, and I hear one of the 36
ditties I can choose as a ring? (I chose ``quiet phone ring'' from
Pacific Bell's Canon, forgoing Pachebel's Canon.)
</P>
<P>
   Every time I've had incoming calls, I've jumped and been unable
to get the phone out of its quick-release holster, pressed a wrong
button or two and canceled the call. I'm the Barney Fife of the
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some columnists aspire to be arbiters of fashion. Not me. I'm
the canary in the newspaper at the bottom of the birdcage. I'm an
early warning system for out of fashion. Make that a late warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   I like Dockers (they're the trouser equivalent of oldies radio,
but you don't have to iron them), chambray shirts, brown work boots
and leather bomber jackets _ all the things that embarrass entire
offices on casual Fridays, and cause absolute revulsion at dot-coms
on casual everydays.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm wearing a cell phone and driving an SUV, even a small
one, then you know cell phones and SUVs are over.
</P>
<P>
   They've come to Kmart, as my wife puts it. But you know, Kmart
isn't so bad, and Target is even better.
</P>
<P>
   A Nokia on your belt can be hazardous. My wife just got a
message from me that I accidentally left when I leaned my cell
phone against a cafe chair, auto-dialing her number and recording a
cafe yakfest on her phone.
</P>
<P>
   Phone klutzes who have something to hide from their wives could
get in real trouble by carelessly dropping their belts and phones.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be great when we can hide these things in a handsome
wristband or shoe. And you'll have me to thank for being an
unerring fashion stopper, and ending the reign of terror of Nokia
gunbelts and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   If only there was an easy and decorative way to hide the SUVs.

TIPS ON THE RISE

Following are a few tips for success when using frozen bread dough.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Before you begin, you'll need to thaw the frozen dough. It'll
take about 8 to 12 hours in the refrigerator. Leave in the bag and
move from freezer to fridge. (Use the refrigerated dough within 24
hours of placing it there initially.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Or you may take the dough out of the freezer and thaw at room
temperature in about 1 to 2 hours (half that amount of time for
rolls). Be aware that temperature (of the dough, room, etc.)
affects thawing and rising times. If the dough is allowed to rise
in a warm place, it will double in volume more quickly than in a
cold room.
</P>
<P>
   _ To thaw in the microwave, place one loaf of frozen dough (or
rolls) on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on low power about
three minutes, checking often. Depending on the wattage of your
oven, a longer or shorter time may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ For best results, Lorene Salcido of Bridgeford Foods
recommends stashing the dough in your freezer (away from the door
to avoid shortening the life of the dough) immediately after
purchasing if you are not planning to use it right away. Use the
frozen dough within 30 days of purchasing (be sure it is solidly
frozen and contains no ice crystals when you buy it).
</P>
<P>
   _ If thawed and refrozen, the yeast action in the dough may
decrease _ and the dough may never rise. ``The fresher the dough,
the better the yeast works,'' said Salcido.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't attempt to change the texture of the dough by
incorporating an egg. It won't work as the dough is already set.
However you can change the flavor by kneading in a little sugar or
other ingredients such as dried fruits, cut up pepperoni, chocolate
chips and the like.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to working with the dough, the warmer it is, the
easier it is to roll out. ``It tends to be elastic if cold,'' said
Salcido.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also, avoid using too much flour for rolling the dough as it
will change the flavor and texture of the finished product. &QL;

northern flank, with a population of just 800,000 but port access
to the Caribbean, is squarely on its radar. There is no more vivid
symbol for Brazil's increased presence in the region _ and the
concern it arouses _ than the heavy equipment that is steadily
paving the 60-mile road between Boa Vista, a city in northern
Brazil, and Lethem ``We run the risk of becoming a kind of adjunct

</P>
<P>
   Q: Neil Armstrong, speaking at the National Press Club in
Washington recently, discussed the 20 greatest engineering
achievements of the 20th century as determined by the National
Academy of Engineering. Can you list them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The achievements were ranked according to how they affected
the quality of life, in the opinion of a committee of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong presented them in reverse order, starting with No. 20:
high-performance materials (synthetic resins, plastics, polymers,
composites, ceramic materials); nuclear technology; lasers and
fiber optics; petroleum technology; health technologies; household
appliances; imaging technologies; the Internet; space flight;
development of the Interstate highway system; air conditioning and
refrigeration; the telephone; computers; agricultural
mechanization; radio and television; electronics; technologies that
purify and deliver safe water; the development of aircraft; the
development of automobiles; and the development of electrification
(the delivery of power to homes and businesses).
</P>
<P>
   Information can be found online at www.greatachievements.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Academy Awards ceremony included a segment on film
industry people who died in the previous year. Why was Stanley
Kubrick, who was a giant of filmmaking, left out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kubrick died March 7, 1999, at age 70. The director was
included in the montage of memorials at last year's Oscar ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Delta Air Lines repainting its aircraft
mentioned that some older planes would be retired. What does it
mean when a plane is retired? Is it sold? Is it broken up for
parts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both are possibilities, said Delta spokesman John Kennedy. In
general, retired aircraft can be ferried to a desert location in
Arizona where they're broken down or otherwise scrapped and the
parts sold, or they can be sold to other organizations for
continuing use as passenger or cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the aircraft Delta is retiring this time around,
they're primarily being sold to other organizations, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Kato Kaelin of O.J. Simpson fame?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, Brian ``Kato'' Kaelin, once the nation's most
famous house guest, was said to be living in the Hollywood Hills
and pursuing an acting career. He did a short radio talk show
stint, but that fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he doesn't need a job anyway to make ends meet. In
October, it was reported that Kaelin had settled his $15 million
libel lawsuit with Globe Communications Corp. over this headline in
the National Enquirer: ``Cops Think Kato Did It!''
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin's lawyer, Gary Bostwick, wouldn't discuss how much Globe
Communications agreed to pay his client.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer ran the headline a week after Simpson was
acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. While the
tabloid argued that it never accused Kaelin of murder and the word
``It'' in the headline meant perjury, a federal appeals court in
1998 ruled that the headline alone could be grounds for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With John and Patsy Ramsey back in the news, I'm reminded of
a question I've had for some time: Where does the name of their
slain daughter, JonBenet, come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a combination of the first and middle names of her
father, John Bennett Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article reported that more than 1,000 women won a
settlement of $508 million in a federal sex discrimination case.
Where will the money come from, the taxpayers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whatever amount is ultimately awarded would come from the
Treasury Department's justice fund, said Charles Miller, Justice
Department spokesman. When the government wins cases, it puts money
into the fund; when it loses them, it draws money back out. So some
of the justice fund may be taxpayer money, and some from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   This particular case involved gender bias in hiring and
promotions at the U.S. Information Agency and Voice of America
radio service. If the $508 million settlement agreed to by the
government is accepted by the federal judge who oversaw the
lawsuit, it will be the largest ever recorded in a federal
sex-discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I receive Social Security payments, and I've misplaced the
W-2 equivalent that the Social Security Administration sent me. How
do I get a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-772-1213 and a replacement form 1099 will be sent
to you, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security Administration.
The field office numbers can be found in the U.S. government blue
pages of your business telephone directory, under Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm very much aware of the middle names of many past
presidents, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Dwight David
Eisenhower, Richard Milhouse Nixon and George Herbert Walker Bush.
But I'm curious about our early presidents. Did George Washington,
for example, have a middle name? Who was the first president to
have a middle name?
</P>
<P>
   A: George Washington didn't have a middle name or middle
initial. He was the first of 17 presidents without them. The
others: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe,
Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor,
Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln,
Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley and Thedore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The first president to have a middle name was John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting for the next trivia contest: Grover Cleveland was
born Stephen Grover Cleveland. But he dropped his first name, as
did (Thomas) Woodrow Wilson and (John) Calvin Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   And another tidbit: Ulysses S. Grant was born with the name
Hiram Ulysses Grant. Before he entered West Point, the first name
on his appointment was written, by mistake, as Ulysses. The middle
name also was erroneously listed as Simpson, from his mother,
Hannah Simpson Grant. Ulysses never corrected the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on the middle names and initials, or lack of
them, of many U.S. presidents. What about Harry Truman? It's often
claimed that his middle initial, S, had no period because it didn't
stand for anything.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that Truman had no middle name. But it appears not
to be true that the initial wasn't followed by a period.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was the oldest of the three children of John Anderson
Truman and Martha Ellen Young Truman. His parents named him Harry
in honor of his uncle, Harrison Young. They chose the middle
initial ``S'' but gave him no middle name, so that each of his
grandfathers, Solomon Young and Anderson Shippe Truman, could claim
that the grandson was named for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry S. Truman Library &AMP; Museum in Independence, Mo.,
addresses the matter of the period after the initial on its Web
site. An oversized signature in Truman's own handwriting, clearly
showing a period after the S, illustrates a segment on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The text states that evidence provided by Truman's own practice
``argues strongly'' for the use of the period, even though he
frequently signed his name in a single stroke without lifting pen
from paper. The text continues by saying the Truman Library's
archives has numerous examples of the signature written at
different times during his life where his use of a period after the
S ``is very obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Information can be found online at www.trumanlibrary.org or in
World Book Encyclopedia, Congressional Quarterly's ``Guide to the
Presidency,'' Current Biography, and ``The Book of Presidents,''
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was told that PETA dropped its campaign for college
students suggesting that beer was better than milk. I thought it
sounded ill-advised. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) indeed has
backed away from the campaign it launched March 14, which urged
college students to put milk products out to pasture. In that
campaign, PETA said ``even beer was better for them,'' and _ in a
slap at ads showing celebrities with a white ``mustache'' from
drinking milk _ said a foam mustache should be from a brew, not a
``moo.''
</P>
<P>
   After an outcry led primarily by Mothers Against Drunk Driving
(MADD), PETA quickly pulled the ``Got Beer?'' promotion. In a March
16 announcement, PETA, while not apologizing, said it was
``shifting the focus'' to appeal to college students' compassion
for animals instead.
</P>
<P>
   On its home page, PETA, meanwhile, announced that its ``Got
Beer?'' campaign was ``such a hit with college students'' that the
antidairy Web site attracted 41,000 visitors in 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   PETA also said that as a goodwill gesture, it was donating $500
given by its employees to MADD, and was including a link on its Web
site to that of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``right-to-work state''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A ``right-to-work'' law provides that a person need not
belong to a labor union to get or keep a job. It also provides that
a person may not be denied a job because of union membership. About
20 states have such laws. The Taft-Hartley Act permits the union
(or ``closed'') shop, in which employers can hire only members of
the union, but its Section 14B also permits states to pass laws
prohibiting them (right-to-work legislation).

</P>
<P>
   Q: I receive Social Security payments, and I've misplaced the
W-2 equivalent that the Social Security Administration sent me. How
do I get a replacement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-772-1213 and a replacement form 1099 will be sent
to you, said Patti Patterson of the Social Security Administration.
The field office numbers can be found in the U.S. government blue
pages of your business telephone directory, under Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm very much aware of the middle names of many past
presidents, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Dwight David
Eisenhower, Richard Milhouse Nixon and George Herbert Walker Bush.
But I'm curious about our early presidents. Did George Washington,
for example, have a middle name? Who was the first president to
have a middle name?
</P>
<P>
   A: George Washington didn't have a middle name or middle
initial. He was the first of 17 presidents without them. The
others: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe,
Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor,
Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln,
Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley and Thedore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The first president to have a middle name was John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting for the next trivia contest: Grover Cleveland was
born Stephen Grover Cleveland. But he dropped his first name, as
did (Thomas) Woodrow Wilson and (John) Calvin Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   And another tidbit: Ulysses S. Grant was born with the name
Hiram Ulysses Grant. Before he entered West Point, the first name
on his appointment was written, by mistake, as Ulysses. The middle
name also was erroneously listed as Simpson, from his mother,
Hannah Simpson Grant. Ulysses never corrected the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on the middle names and initials, or lack of
them, of many U.S. presidents. What about Harry Truman? It's often
claimed that his middle initial, S, had no period because it didn't
stand for anything.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that Truman had no middle name. But it appears not
to be true that the initial wasn't followed by a period.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was the oldest of the three children of John Anderson
Truman and Martha Ellen Young Truman. His parents named him Harry
in honor of his uncle, Harrison Young. They chose the middle
initial ``S'' but gave him no middle name, so that each of his
grandfathers, Solomon Young and Anderson Shippe Truman, could claim
that the grandson was named for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry S. Truman Library &AMP; Museum in Independence, Mo.,
addresses the matter of the period after the initial on its Web
site. An oversized signature in Truman's own handwriting, clearly
showing a period after the S, illustrates a segment on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The text states that evidence provided by Truman's own practice
``argues strongly'' for the use of the period, even though he
frequently signed his name in a single stroke without lifting pen
from paper. The text continues by saying the Truman Library's
archives has numerous examples of the signature written at
different times during his life where his use of a period after the
S ``is very obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Information can be found online at www.trumanlibrary.org or in
World Book Encyclopedia, Congressional Quarterly's ``Guide to the
Presidency,'' Current Biography, and ``The Book of Presidents,''
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was told that PETA dropped its campaign for college
students suggesting that beer was better than milk. I thought it
sounded ill-advised. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) indeed has
backed away from the campaign it launched March 14, which urged
college students to put milk products out to pasture. In that
campaign, PETA said ``even beer was better for them,'' and _ in a
slap at ads showing celebrities with a white ``mustache'' from
drinking milk _ said a foam mustache should be from a brew, not a
``moo.''
</P>
<P>
   After an outcry led primarily by Mothers Against Drunk Driving
(MADD), PETA quickly pulled the ``Got Beer?'' promotion. In a March
16 announcement, PETA, while not apologizing, said it was
``shifting the focus'' to appeal to college students' compassion
for animals instead.
</P>
<P>
   On its home page, PETA, meanwhile, announced that its ``Got
Beer?'' campaign was ``such a hit with college students'' that the
antidairy Web site attracted 41,000 visitors in 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   PETA also said that as a goodwill gesture, it was donating $500
given by its employees to MADD, and was including a link on its Web
site to that of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``right-to-work state''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A ``right-to-work'' law provides that a person need not
belong to a labor union to get or keep a job. It also provides that
a person may not be denied a job because of union membership. About
20 states have such laws. The Taft-Hartley Act permits the union
(or ``closed'') shop, in which employers can hire only members of
the union, but its Section 14B also permits states to pass laws
prohibiting them (right-to-work legislation).

<P>
   Q: An article about presidential disability and succession made
me wonder: Has there ever been a case in the United States when an
acting president was required to step in for a short emergency
period?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As World Book Encyclopedia explains, Vice President
George Bush became the first U.S. acting president in your scenario
when, on July 13, 1985, he officially held that position for eight
hours while President Reagan underwent cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This matter is addressed in Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to
the Constitution, which states: Whenever the president transmits to
the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the
House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable
to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he
transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such
powers and duties shall be discharged by the vice president as
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gasoline prices have been in the news a lot lately. Adjusted
for inflation, how much have they changed over, say, the past 10
years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Statistics compiled by the American Petroleum Institute are
available only up to August 1999, before the recent surge in
prices. But information in API's booklet ``How Much We Pay for
Gasoline'' shows how adjusted prices have moved over the years. It
says that in 1990, the inflation-adjusted U.S. city retail price
for all types of gasoline, not including taxes, averaged $1.20.3 a
gallon. In the first eight months of '99 it averaged 74.9 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For historical perspective, API says gasoline prices staged a
long decline after the Depression, down to an inflation-adjusted
average (not including taxes) of 97 cents in 1972, when prices
jumped with the 1973-74 oil embargo. Prices climbed even higher in
1979 when Iranian crude supplies were curtailed, reaching an
inflation-adjusted peak of $2.20.3 in 1980. Then they fell,
especially during the winter of 1985-86, owing to the large
production increases by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're higher once again, changing so frequently that
it's hard to keep track.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the telephone number to check on a federal tax
refund?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-829-4477.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are the next sets of state quarters going to be issued?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a popular question. The quarters are being issued
over a 10-year period. The first five, in 1999, were Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. This year's
group: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining schedule: 2001, New York, North Carolina, Rhode
Island, Vermont, Kentucky; 2002, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana,
Indiana, Mississippi; 2003, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri,
Arkansas; 2004, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin; 2005,
California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia; 2006, Nevada,
Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota; 2007, Montana,
Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah; 2008, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering about the sequence, the coins are being
issued in the order in which the states became part of the United
States.

<P>
   Q: Several months ago, it was reported that a student somewhere
in the Carolinas was scheduled to receive a kidney transplant from
his teacher. But the surgery was delayed because he developed a
fever. I never saw anything more about it. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Michael Carter, a student at Max Abbott
Middle School in Fayetteville, N.C., whose eighth-grade science
teacher, Jane Smith, offered to donate one of her kidneys. As
reported Dec. 18, the surgery, which had been planned at UNC
Hospitals in Chapel Hill, N.C., was postponed in the wake of
Carter's fever.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Karen Stinneford told Q&AMP;A on March 22 that
the surgery still has not been rescheduled. She added that the
families of both Carter and Smith had been overwhelmed by the
public's response, and although they were grateful that the case
had ``touched a chord in people,'' they had asked hospital
officials not to provide the media with any more information this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping that when the surgery does take place, they can
slip into the hospital without much fanfare and have the
transplant,'' Stinneford said. ``Then, of course, we would let the
media know.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the families and doctors hoped the surgery could
be rescheduled soon, but she provided no specific timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton taken a leave of absence from Stanford?
I've seen pictures of her in Washington, and taking trips and
making appearances with her parents. A newspaper photo showed her
in India recently with the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first daughter is still enrolled at Stanford University,
and the first lady's press office confirmed that Wednesday. She's
on spring break, a spokeswoman said, which allowed her time to join
the current overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several years ago that a U-boat that was sunk
in 1945 was found off the Danish coast. It was supposed to be
recovered and its contents examined. What became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 255-foot German submarine, which was on its way to the
North Sea and ultimately to Japan, was sunk by a British bomber on
May 5, 1945. It was brought to the surface 15 miles off the small
Danish island of Anholt on Aug. 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A Danish consortium, hoping to find jewels, gold and art stolen
from occupied territories, as well as secret documents, financed
the operation to salvage the U-534. But when the sub was opened,
and detonators removed from its torpedoes, salvagers found no such
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   However, they discovered a number of well-preserved supplies and
effects of the U-boat crew, and that was a relative treasure to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Linnemann, head of registration and preservation on the
project, credited their preservation after 48 years in salt water
to a thin film of oil caused by leaks inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items recovered: nautical maps, logbooks and diaries,
binoculars, gas masks, clothing and tinned food.
</P>
<P>
   The sub's crew of 52 escaped before it sank, but three died in
the water from exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could Al Gore choose Bill Clinton to be his running mate? If
so, and Gore becomes our president and Clinton our vice president,
and then Gore resigns or has to leave office for whatever reason,
could Clinton become our president again?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 12th Amendment to the Constitution states that ``no
person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall
be eligible to that of vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a list of companies and products that are
not tested on animals?
</P>
<P>
   A: A list can be found online at this address, maintained by
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) _
www.peta-online.org/cmp/ccdont1099.html _ or you can purchase ``The
2000 Shopping Guide for Caring Consumers,'' which includes the
list, by calling 1-800-483-4366 and charging it to a credit card.
The cost is $8.95 plus $3.20 for shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Webster's Dictionary says the origin of aleck, as in the
expression ``smart aleck,'' was the nickname for Alexander. Is the
identity of that original Alexander known?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins nor
the Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins records
who the first ``smart aleck'' was. As the encyclopedia observes,
the original Alexander was at least clever enough to cover up all
traces of his identity.
</P>
<P>
   The expression _ meaning a conceited wise guy, usually endowed
with a bit of the brassiness called ``chutzpah'' in Yiddish _ has
been common in America at least since midway through the last
century. Its first recorded appearance in print was in a Carson
City, Nev., newspaper in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Dictionary reports that many years later, Alexander
``Alec'' Woollcott was a prodigiously vain figure on the New York
literary scene. But the expression was well established before his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Richard Riley, the U.S. secretary of education, go
to college?
</P>
<P>
   A: Riley, a former South Carolina governor, graduated from
Furman University in 1954. After serving in the Navy as an officer
on a minesweeper, he entered law school at the University of South
Carolina, graduating in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that a Coast Guard vessel based in Key West,
Fla., had intercepted a boat off Ecuador on Saturday. Aren't these
international waters? Why was a U.S. Coast Guard vessel involved so
far from its base?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ecuador's navy said the 40 women and 194 men found on the
Ecuadorean-registered Viviana II were detained because they were
traveling through international waters without documentation. The
U.S. government had received permission from Ecuador to stop the
vessel, whose intended destination appeared to be Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Knight, spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in San
Francisco, said a growing number of Ecuadoreans are using high seas
routes to Central America and Mexico to reach the United States
illegally. This was the fourth or fifth such interception in the
past 12 months, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard participates in a multi-agency operation
designed to intercept smuggling and narcotics operations, Knight
told Q&AMP;A. The Joint Interagency Task Force has locations on the
U.S. East Coast and U.S. West Coast. Their areas of concern are
divided by a line extending southward just west of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard patrols from the East Coast routinely operate
through the Panama Canal into waters west of the canal, Knight
explained. Once a Coast Guard cutter from the East Coast becomes
engaged in law-enforcement activity in the Pacific, such as
stopping a vessel suspected of smuggling, the California Joint
Interagency Task Force takes jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted Ecuadoreans were turned over to Ecuadorean
authorities Monday, ending the Coast Guard's involvement.

Carolina, graduating in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that a Coast Guard vessel based in Key West,
Fla., had intercepted a boat off Ecuador on Saturday. Aren't these
international waters? Why was a U.S. Coast Guard vessel involved so
far from its base?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ecuador's navy said the 40 women and 194 men found on the
Ecuadorean-registered Viviana II were detained because they were
traveling through international waters without documentation. The
U.S. government had received permission from Ecuador to stop the
vessel, whose intended destination appeared to be Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Knight, spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in San
Francisco, said a growing number of Ecuadoreans are using high seas
routes to Central America and Mexico to reach the United States
illegally. This was the fourth or fifth such interception in the
past 12 months, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard participates in a multi-agency operation
designed to intercept smuggling and narcotics operations, Knight
told Q&AMP;A. The Joint Interagency Task Force has locations on the
U.S. East Coast and U.S. West Coast. Their areas of concern are
divided by a line extending southward just west of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard patrols from the East Coast routinely operate
through the Panama Canal into waters west of the canal, Knight
explained. Once a Coast Guard cutter from the East Coast becomes
engaged in law-enforcement activity in the Pacific, such as
stopping a vessel suspected of smuggling, the California Joint
Interagency Task Force takes jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted Ecuadoreans were turned over to Ecuadorean
authorities Monday, ending the Coast Guard's involvement.

   CENSUS _ ATLANTA _ Nine people were hidden under the overpass.
Even though it was hours before dawn and they were all covered with
layers of blankets, the homeless people were cooperative and polite
to the Census workers who interrupted their rest with flashlights
and questions. One of the men, who told a reporter his name was
``just Harry,'' said he didn't mind that Census takers had come to
question him while he was in bed, because he hadn't gone to sleep
yet. ``I just laid down,'' Harry said. Before dawn Wednesday,
between the hours of 4 a.m. and 7 a.m., census workers wearing
orange vests searched nationwide for people living under bridges,
in abandoned buildings and in secret spots sheltered by bushes.

&HT;     CHRONICLE URGES JUDGE NOT TO BLOCK NEWSPAPER SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Chronicle has asked a federal
judge to reject a request for an emergency order blocking the
Hearst Corp. from buying the morning newspaper, saying it would
cause the daily to continue losing money.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed Tuesday, Chronicle Publishing Co. called
the antitrust suit filed by former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly
``baseless'' and said that each day he was allowed to delay the
sale beyond its March 30 closing date would cost the company nearly
$102,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker to hold a
hearing Thursday and issue a temporary order blocking Hearst from
concluding its purchase of the Chronicle, pending a full hearing on
his claim that it would give Hearst an illegal newspaper monopoly
that would raise advertising and subscription prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing and Hearst have denied Reilly's claims.
They say Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle and sale of its San
Francisco Examiner to the publisher of the weekly Independent would
restore economic competition between daily newspapers in San
Francisco for the first time in 35 years. Even if the Examiner
closed, Hearst says, the Chronicle would still face competition
from a host of other media in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends that delaying the sale would not significantly
harm the Chronicle because it makes a daily profit, a claim the
Chronicle disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers shed light on why the Chronicle's owners are
eager to sell and Hearst, based in New York, is eager to buy: The
morning newspaper loses money under its current joint operating
agreement with the afternoon Examiner, but could be highly
profitable on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has a daily circulation of 465,535. The Examiner
has a daily circulation of 108,968.
</P>
<P>
   J. Thomas Rosch, a lawyer for the Chronicle, said the
newspaper's owners would lose $100,000 a day in interest that they
could earn if they invested the $660 million in cash that Hearst
has agreed to pay for the Chronicle and its SF Gate Web site at an
annual rate of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch also said any delays caused by Reilly's suit would force
the Chronicle to incur additional daily losses.
</P>
<P>
   In a declaration, Martin A. Jaffe, the Chronicle's chief
financial officer, said that so far this year the Chronicle and SF
Gate had lost $1,900 per day, after depreciation and amortization
of the company's buildings, computers, trucks and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Depreciation and amortization are accounting methods that deduct
from revenue the cost of business equipment over its useful life.
Figuring them into the equation produces a lower net revenue than
does a cash flow analysis, which does not take those costs into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe's figures are based on revenue for January and February, a
period following the holiday buying season when advertising falls
off.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem odd that a newspaper with the Chronicle's
circulation would lose money, the explanation lies in its joint
operating agreement with the Examiner, according to sources at each
company familiar with the finances.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, Hearst's Examiner and the locally owned Chronicle
have published under a joint operating agreement, an exception to
federal antitrust laws allowing them to combine business operations
while maintaining independent editorial staffs. The exception is
authorized by the Newspaper Preservation Act, which seeks to
maintain multiple editorial voices in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Chronicle Publishing created the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency, which handles all advertising, circulation,
printing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The agency collects the revenue for both newspapers, deducts the
cost of their business operations and evenly splits the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Each newspaper takes its share, pays its respective newsroom
costs and winds up with a net gain or loss, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Chronicle has an editorial staff of 375, it has far
higher newsroom costs than does the Examiner, with a staff of 217.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hearst buys the Chronicle and sells the Examiner to the
publishers of the Independent, it would have the opportunity to
boost revenue, cut expenses and operate profitably.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has agreed to provide the Independent with a $66 million
subsidy over 32 months to help cover costs of publishing the
Examiner as a daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends it would cost $250 million over five years to
publish a viable competitor, and that Hearst would end up owning
the only metropolitan daily in San Francisco.

<P>
   BEIJING _ In a surprise announcement, Taiwan's president-elect,
Chen Shui-bian, said Wednesday that the outgoing Nationalist Party
defense minister would be prime minister of his new government,
which takes office May 20.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the defense minister, Tang Fei, a 68-year-old
former air force general, may help reassure nervous citizens as
well as the Chinese government that Chen does not intend to make
radical changes in policy toward the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Chen had long advocated Taiwan's formal independence, which
Beijing has warned would lead it to attack Taiwan, which China
considers an integral part of the country rather than a separate
entity. Chen, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party, recently
moderated his position, saying that a declaration of independence
is unnecessary because Taiwan is already sovereign in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Tang may also help Chen gain the support of
senior military officers, most of whom are lifelong supporters of
the Nationalist Party and strongly oppose declaring independence.
The appointment of a respected Cabinet member from the outgoing
Nationalist government will also aid Chen's drive in broadening his
political base, which is needed because he won with just 39 percent
of the popular vote and faces a Nationalist majority in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Tang was appointed prime minister after the post was turned down
by Chen's first choice, a Nobel-prize winning scientist, Lee
Yuan-tseh, who is head of the Academia Sinica, Taiwan's premier
research institution. Lee's endorsement of Chen before the March 18
election was credited with helping him win. Chen had sought to
bring Lee into his government as a sign of nonpartisanship and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   James Soong, the Nationalist maverick who came in second in the
presidential election, said Wednesday that he would form a new
political party called the People First Party.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, March 30:
</P>
<P>
   COUPLAND-TOTEMS (Chicago) _ It was a Sunday and the novelist
Douglas Coupland, chronicler of disaffected youth, was trawling for
mid-century American ceramics. He bought one piece after another,
never inquiring who made them or so much as glancing at the prices.
What he didn't tell storeowners (``I don't have the heart'') is
that the vases aren't going to be vases much longer. ``They're an
art supply,'' said Coupland, who studied sculpture before taking up
writing. Back home in Vancouver, Coupland will sand the finishes
off the vases, stiffen them with plaster, then join them with metal
rods and an adhesive he called ``shoe-goo'' into Brancusi-like
columns (totems, he calls them), with which he is currently filling
his 1960 post-and-beam house to the point of overcrowding. By Fred
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDIO (San Francisco) _ The bugles are silent now. But in
secluded vales of eucalpytus and along once-dusty parade grounds
lined with red-brick Victorians, history still stands watch over
the Presidio, the windswept 1480-acre former Army base wrapped by
the headlands of the Golden Gate Bridge. Since 1994, when this
National Historic Landmark _ about twice the size of Central Park _
became a national park, a novel and controversial experiment in
park planning and historic preservation has been underway at this
200-year-old military garrison that, though part of the city, still
feels like the edge of the world. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

   DESERT-PILGRIMS (Buenos Aires, Ariz.) _ A multicultural group of
O'odham, Comcaac and Yoeme Indians, as well as their
botanist-ecologist friends walked 240 miles from a Mexican village
on the Sea of Cortez, across the Sonoran Desert to Tucson, Ariz.,
following the steps of their ancestors. Eating only native foods
and treating their ailments with wild plants from the desert, they
walked to raise awareness of diabetes, which affects 250,000 Native
Americans in the Southwest. By Anne Raver.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists are using lasers to nudge clouds of
atoms into tiny traps where the properties of the particles can be
studied.
</P>
<P>
   This atom trapping is helping scientists to test the merits of
the so-called standard model of physics that dominates physics
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the standard model seems to be ``in very good shape,''
Gene Sprouse, a physicist from the State University of New York at
Stony Brook, told the American Chemical Society on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The standard model is a general theory of the underlying nature
of matter and energy, which is presumed to consist of certain
families of particles and sub-particles. The best-known
sub-particles are quarks, the building blocks of atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of moving atoms around like so many billiard balls, and
corralling them in pens like so many obedient sheep, would have
amazed scientists not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only a century ago, the very existence of atoms was denied by
scientific titans such as Ernst Mach, whose philosophy strongly
influenced the great physicist Albert Einstein and others.
(Ironically, Einstein's early research on a phenomenon called
Brownian motion provided smoking-gun evidence for the existence of
atoms.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, nowadays, atom trapping has become a major
enterprise in physics research.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists like Sprouse use particle accelerators to generate
fast-moving beams of atoms. First, they fire these beams into
chambers _ in Sprouse's case, a transparent glass sphere. Then,
they use magnetic fields and lasers to nudge the particles into
small clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Within the glass sphere, a few thousand atoms float around.
Then, scientists illuminate them with bursts of laser light. In
response, the atoms flash back different frequencies of light.
</P>
<P>
   The electromagnetic frequency of those flashes, and other
technical details, reveal much about the atoms' innards. For
example, different types of atoms are expected to emit radiation in
different ways. Sprouse's technique allows him and his colleagues
to see whether the atoms are behaving as expected.
</P>
<P>
   If they ever misbehave, that might be a possible hint of
problems with the standard model.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Sprouse and his colleagues have analyzed trapped
clouds of atoms of the element francium. Discovered in 1939,
francium is so rare and short-lived _ it rapidly decays into pure
energy _ that according to Sprouse there is only ``about an ounce
of it on the Earth.''

PROTEIN-PACKED LENTILS DELICIOUS DURING LENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   R. Nagy of North Richland Hills, Texas, is looking for a recipe
for a lentil soup and also want to know where to buy
``light-colored'' lentils.
</P>
<P>
   Lentils, after soybeans, have the highest protein count of all
vegetables _ hence their popularity with vegetarians. And they come
in many shades, from the green lentils that are so chic (and
relatively expensive) in France to yellow, brown, pink and gray
lentils, which are a mainstay in the Middle East and India. Indian
markets are a great source for lentils of all colors, as are
health-food and other ``alternative'' groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Lentils are often eaten during Lent, when the observant are
avoiding meat.

&HT;     IT'S TIME TO CHANGE PRIMARIES' SCHEDULE AND FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 2)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Democrats gathered in Baltimore in the summer
of 1912, they sweated and fretted through 46 roll calls before
Woodrow Wilson won the necessary two-thirds majority and became the
party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, in 1924, the Democrats met in New York's
Madison Square Garden and suffered through a heat wave and an
all-time record political endurance test of 103 ballots over nine
days. When the battle was over, neither of the frontrunners, New
York Gov. Alfred E. Smith and former Treasury Secretary William
Gibbs McAdoo, emerged triumphant. Neither man was able to win two
thirds of the vote and neither would yield to the other. So the
delegates nominated a colorless, little-known compromise candidate,
former Solicitor General John W. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   McAdoo, a defender of Prohibition, had won nine primaries;
Smith, an outspoken opponent of Prohibition, had entered none and,
therefore, won none. But Smith was popular with northerners while
McAdoo was the choice of many southerners and westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Democrats lost badly in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The two-thirds vote had been a part the Democrat's nominating
process since 1832 when both parties staged their first national
conventions. That rule provided southerners an opportunity to veto
the nomination of presidential candidates whose policies they
disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates from Dixie got the veto, but the two-thirds
requirement made it difficult, even for men of such stature as
Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   After 1932, the year of FDR's first election as president, the
Democrats wisely scuttled the two-thirds rule. Henceforth, a simple
majority of delegate votes was enough to choose the nominees in
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   As presidential primaries spread across the land, they were seen
as the means by which power was taken from professional politicians
and given to the people.
</P>
<P>
   But primaries are not without their faults.
</P>
<P>
   We now are at the beginning of April, with the Democrats having
chosen Al Gore and the Republicans, George W. Bush. But suspense
has gone out of the nominating process, except for discussion of
who will be nominated for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, straight-talking Sen. John McCain of Arizona may
have become the most admired politician in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries are a vital force in the nominating process
because they permit the people to choose the ultimate candidates.
Of course, the people can make mistakes just as the bosses do.
Among such mistakes in recent years were the Republican nomination
of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and the Democratic nominations of George
McGovern in 1972 and Michael Dukakis in 1984. All had won in the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Timing continues to be a problem. We now have seven months to
listen to Gore and Bush repeat their cliches, indulge in flamboyant
rhetoric and attack each other. Meanwhile, voters and the news
media will grow bored with the process and its negativism, and
dissatisfaction with the lengthy campaign could reduce voter
turnout in November.
</P>
<P>
   For years the primaries were spread over the first six months of
a presidential election year. But that meant the states voting in
May or June would have less impact on the final decision than those
that voted in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception in recent years has been California with its
huge block of delegates to both conventions. Traditionally,
California's primaries were held in June.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Goldwater's victory in the California Republican
primary that sealed his nomination over Nelson Rockefeller in 1964.
Success in California might have done the same for Robert Kennedy
four years later had he not been assassinated on the night he won
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to play an even more decisive role in the
nominating process, California moved its primary into early March
along with other populous states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the race for this year's nominations was over in
mid-March, following primaries in California, New York, Texas,
Florida, Michigan and Ohio and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In those races the candidates in both parties spent obscene
amounts of money. No previous candidate had ever raised an
estimated $70 million, as Bush did just to win in the primaries.
But Gore, Bradley, and McCain also raised millions. Forbes spent
his own millions trying, but failing, to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reform is once again in the air, both as to how candidates
accumulate campaign funds and when the states should stage their
primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have suggested that primaries be staged in regional
clusters such as New England one week, the Mid-Atlantic the next,
and then the South until all sectors of the nation have voted. But
there is no easy solution.
</P>
<P>
   Unless all states vote in a national primary on a single day,
which would pose grave travel and fund-raising difficulties for the
candidates, some states will inevitably ballot ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   We should try to narrow the gap between the last primaries and
Election Day. And we should overhaul the way campaigns are
financed, which was McCain's major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries should be concluded closer to Election Day because
democracy suffers when campaigns become boring and repetitive and
when candidates become beholden to special interests that provide
the funds for them to keep up the fight.

A BIG RASPBERRY AND APOLOGIES TO ALL YOU BELGIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First off, it might be good to mention that lambic beer has
nothing to do with sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Lambic is a sour brew, native to Belgium and produced by
``spontaneous fermentation.'' That means they let all kinds of
airborne dust, pollen, bacteria, yeast and who knows what fall into
the mix to get it going.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you think about it, it's good to remember that beer
is representative of a culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, for instance, brew up aggressive beverages that
invade the tongue and make it snap to attention. ``Ach du lieber!''
</P>
<P>
   Australians make friendly g'day-mate beers big enough to quench
a way-out-in-the-Outback kind of thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Now take Belgium, please. Everyone else has.
</P>
<P>
   Have the Belgians ever invaded anything? Have they ever won a
battle? Quick, name one Belgian war hero.
</P>
<P>
   Belgians make even the French seem really macho, so it's only
natural that they would be a major producer of fruit-flavored ales.
Which, in a roundabout way, brings us to Framboise Lambic Ale.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredient list on the label starts out fine: water,
barley-malt, wheat, hops and yeast _ all of your beer-making
essentials. But then they ruin it by adding not just raspberries,
but fresh raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a very tart beverage with a raspberry flavor that
overwhelms any beer characteristics. It comes in a 750 milliliter
wine bottle and sells for $9. It's made by Lindemans Brewery in
Vlezenbeek. They also make varieties with cherries and peaches, and
with PRUNES and RAISINS??!
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't look like it knows if it wants to be wine or beer,''
said The Norm, a general know-it-all who claims to be homeless but
who lives in my back yard. He also refers to himself as ``The
Norm,'' but he's far from it.
</P>
<P>
   I had offered a glass of lambic to The Norm to calm him down
after I had proposed including him on my census form. He found the
idea highly unsettling, not only because he doesn't want the
government or the space aliens to know where he is, but because, as
he said: ``The Norm is homeless and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claims to be a world traveler who had spent enough time
among the Belgians to pick up their language, which he said is
called ``Belch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never tasted anything like this when I was there,'' he
said. ``If this is the kind of stuff they're making now, I'm glad I
don't drink anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norm and I give this a .5 on the international 1-5 scale.

   COUPLAND-TOTEMS (Chicago) _ It was a Sunday and the novelist
Douglas Coupland, chronicler of disaffected youth, was trawling for
mid-century American ceramics. He bought one piece after another,
never inquiring who made them or so much as glancing at the prices.
What he didn't tell storeowners (``I don't have the heart'') is
that the vases aren't going to be vases much longer. ``They're an
art supply,'' said Coupland, who studied sculpture before taking up
writing. Back home in Vancouver, Coupland will sand the finishes
off the vases, stiffen them with plaster, then join them with metal
rods and an adhesive he called ``shoe-goo'' into Brancusi-like
columns (totems, he calls them), with which he is currently filling
his 1960 post-and-beam house to the point of overcrowding. By Fred
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDIO (San Francisco) _ The bugles are silent now. But in
secluded vales of eucalpytus and along once-dusty parade grounds
lined with red-brick Victorians, history still stands watch over
the Presidio, the windswept 1480-acre former Army base wrapped by
the headlands of the Golden Gate Bridge. Since 1994, when this
National Historic Landmark _ about twice the size of Central Park _
became a national park, a novel and controversial experiment in
park planning and historic preservation has been underway at this
200-year-old military garrison that, though part of the city, still

LADYBUG, LADYBUG, YOUR WINE IS FINE

<P>
   There's a reason Lolonis Winery uses a ladybug as its trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1956, no chemical pesticides have been applied there.
Instead, ladybugs (released twice each growing season) and praying
mantises are used to eliminate pests. To further ensure organic
purity, vine leaves are picked off by hand to expose grapes to the
sun and to allow air to circulate. That allows sunshine to develop
more fruit intensity in the grapes and additional air to control
the mold and mildew. Sulfur is applied in the vineyard to prevent
mildew, but the grapes are still organic because sulfur is a
naturally mined product.
</P>
<P>
   Lolonis was founded by Greek immigrants who came to the Redwood
Valley of Mendocino County, Calif., in 1914. It is the only winery
still owned by Greek-Americans who own their vineyards and whose
parents planted the original vines. Most grapes are grown for the
family winery, but some are sold to Beringer, Kendall Jackson,
Fetzer and other wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The reds impressed us the most. Lolonis Zinfandel 1997 ($18) is
a star. The wine, made from 50- to 60-year-old vines, has a nose
full of spice and some smoke. Full of rich, dark berry fruit,
abundant structure and a peppery taste, this wine is delicious with
beef fajitas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 ($18) has generous body but minimal
tannins. In fact, it is similar to a merlot in its softness and
smoothness. Because it is so full of fruit and easy to drink, the
cabernet blends with any all-American meat dish such as pot roast
or chicken-fried steak. Serve it the next time you grill steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first year Lolonis was distributed in Texas.
Because production has gone to 27,000 cases per year, enough is
available so we can sip the good taste here. &QL;

&HT;     CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS WEIGH SEVERAL GAY PARTNERSHIP BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Legislature is moving to
grant gay and lesbian couples some of the same legal rights that
automatically come with marriage, just three weeks after voters
overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure defining marriage as
between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian couples were given the right to register as
domestic partners under legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis last year. But pressure from Davis, Republicans and moderate
Democrats from the Central Valley cut the scope of the law so that
it only granted hospital visits to gay and lesbian partners and
excluded all but state workers when it came to sharing state
medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This legislative session, which began in earnest this week,
includes four bills that would grant homosexual couples the right
to inherit property if one partner dies without a will, let a
surviving partner make funeral and autopsy arrangements, and grant
the partner the right to make medical decisions in dire
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bills also allows a domestic partner to sue for
emotional distress and wrongful death if their companion is killed,
a legal right married couples are granted. A separate bill would
grant gay and lesbian couples the right to make decisions over
donating organs after death.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the bills were designed to put weight and meaning
behind the state's nascent domestic partnership registry, which was
set up for gay and lesbian couples and any couple, gay or straight,
older than age 62. As of Tuesday, 2,805 California couples have
applied for the domestic partnership registry with the secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, voters approved Proposition 22, which codified
traditional marriage as between only a man and a woman. Statewide
polls, however, have shown voters agree with granting legal rights
to domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loving relationships must be honored,'' said Dr. Aaron Aronow,
a neurologist at the University of Southern California School of
Medicine who has treated patients with AIDS, the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Aronow said he has seen parents and siblings of AIDS patients
arrive at the last minute and deny a partner access to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents have demanded religious funeral services even
though their child had requested secular services; others have
taken possession of the body to hold separate funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a client who was barred from attending the funeral of
his partner because his partner's parents obtained a restraining
order to keep him away,'' said Jane Pearce, an estate attorney in
Sacramento. ``They had been together for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Democrat-dominated Assembly Judiciary Committee
approved three of the measures. The organ-donor bill, written by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat from San Francisco, will be
introduced later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bills faced opposition from conservative groups that
normally oppose all gay-rights legislation. The groups see the new
measures as a roundabout way to impose gay marriage even though
California voters overwhelmingly rejected the concept with
Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't injure the definition of family,'' said Randy Thomasson
of the Campaign for California Families, one of three opposition
witnesses Tuesday who noted that gay and lesbian couples can simply
write wills and sign over power of attorney to their partners.

MORE BODIES FOUND NEAR CULT LEADER'S HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda _ Another 53 bodies were discovered Wednesday
crammed into a small pit inside the house of a Ugandan cult leader.
A total of 81 bodies have been found in the pit in the past two
days, 48 of them children.
</P>
<P>
   With each day bringing some new horror in one of the largest
mass murders in recent history, the police said Wednesday night
that they believe they have found yet another mass grave at a
building about 80 kilometers south of here, in southwest Uganda.
Excavation will begin Thursday morning, the police said. But even
before that work begins, the death toll already stands at more than
600.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the home of an excommunicated Roman Catholic priest,
Dominic Kataribabo, investigators unearthed 74 bodies in the back
yard on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, another 81 bodies were
found inside the indoor pit, covered over with concrete in one of
the stone house's 10 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The space for so many corpses was incredibly small: The pit,
lined with banana leaves, was just six-feet deep and four-feet
square, and the corpses were packed together in a dense,
interlocking heap.
</P>
<P>
   Since Feb. 17, at least 654 bodies have been recovered in the
wreckage of a cult, Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, splintered off from the Roman Catholic church.
The cult demanded strict adherence to the Ten Commandments,
required members to sell their possessions and preached that the
world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The police originally suspected mass suicide by more than 300
followers found burned to death in a church in the town of Kanungu,
less than 50 miles from here. But since then, more bodies have been
found, a number with unmistakable signs of strangulation _ some by
rope or banana leaves, others by hand. Many bodies have shown no
sign of violence, leading some investigators to suspect mass
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The police are increasingly calling this an organized slaughter,
though they have not speculated publicly about how so many people
could have been killed or by how many executioners.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the house here Wednesday was particularly wrenching
because so many bodies of children were found. Workers with rubber
gloves pulled out the bodies one by one and placed them in a row on
the lawn for a quick examination by a police pathologist. Then they
were dragged to the rear of the compound to be buried in a long
trench with the 74 bodies found earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the police gave no details about the sight they
intend to search Thursday except to say that it is in the village
of Kabira, where they said cult members often stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   A Ugandan police spokesman, Mugenyi Assuman, said investigators
also expected to take soil samples from the various mass graves,
particularly the original site in Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what investigators would be testing for, Assuman would not
say exactly: ``Maybe poison,'' he said.

CUBS DEFEAT METS, 5-3, IN FIRST OFFICIAL GAME HELD OUTSIDE NORTH
AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Short on drama, long on tedium, the first major-league
game ever held outside North America looked mundanely like
thousands of other games, particularly those held indoors _ except
of course for the presence of the Crown Prince of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs beat the New York Mets, 5-3, Wednesday night,
14 and 15 time zones ahead of their respective home cities, in
front of a Tokyo Dome crowd announced at 55,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time an official American game had ever been
held outside the United States, Canada and Mexico, as part of Major
League Baseball's attempt to expand its impact. Baseball is
fitfully becoming more of an international game now that the sport
has been included in the Olympic Summer Games since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took advantage of early wildness by Mike Hampton, the
left-handed rent-an-ace the Mets imported from Houston for the
remaining year on his contract. Hampton walked nine batters in five
innings before leaving. Shane Andrews later slugged a two-run home
run and Mark Grace hit a bases-empty homer for the Cubs. Jon Lieber
went seven innings for the Cubs and was the winning pitcher. Mike
Piazza launched a long two-run homer in the eighth for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the two-game series, which concludes Thursday
night, was an American style rather than a Japanese feel. Crown
Prince Naruhito and his wife, Masako, sat in the owners' box high
behind home plate, an extremely rare appearance by members of the
royal family at a baseball game. There was a brief glimpse of them
on the Mitsubishi message board, but no introduction.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the crown prince met with Sammy Sosa, whose face
can be seen in advertisements all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bowed to him, of course,'' Sosa said. ``Then we were
talking about the game. He enjoyed it. He told me everybody wanted
me to hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not hit one, but he did have two hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Once it started, the game felt very much like any North American
game under a dome _ that is, it had a certain airless sterile
quality to it, magnified by the sickly pale green of the artificial
turf. In a perfect example of commonality far across the sea, the
incessant blare from the loudspeaker was trapped by the roof,
making sure that nobody could possibly have a conversation with the
person in the next seat.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the traditional American bunting for opening
day and World Series games, but there was some Japanese presence in
five women in kimonos presenting flowers to the managers as well as
the umpires and Sosa and Piazza, the two stars imported for this
very short run.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strange cross-cultural notes was the absence of
organized cheering sections, a staple of regular Japanese games.
With tickets going for as much as nearly $200, this was a different
crowd, consisting of many button-down business executives, known
here as salarymen, and their guests.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of the expectation of a rock crowd. The fans had
come to see the two stars, who touch the imagination of the
Japanese public. Hampton was having trouble with his control, and
maybe even with the mound, but when he walked Sosa to load the
bases in the third, some boos were heard, almost unheard of at
Japanese baseball games or any other public gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The boos got even louder in the fifth when Hampton walked Sosa
again, this time with a runner on first and one out. With the crowd
approximately 95 percent Japanese, it could only be assumed that
the fans were hip enough to know that American fans would boo in
such a situation.
</P>
<P>
   The fans have a long way to go to approximate New York fans.
Nobody hurled invective _ to say nothing of AA batteries _ at the
heads of the players. Civility reigned.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored right away when Eric Young walked, stole second
and scored on a single by Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied it in the third on a single by Rey Ordonez, a
sacrifice by Hampton, a single by Rickey Henderson and a sacrifice
fly by Darryl Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs went ahead, 2-1, in the fifth on a single by Buford,
and after an out, three straight walks, including one to Shane
Andrews, to force in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was struggling, either with the mound or himself. There
was talk before the game that the players were not happy with the
mound and the dirt area around home plate, feeling there was not
enough clay to provide traction for their large and powerful
frames.
</P>
<P>
   Players did seem to have trouble with the dirt. Both Robin
Ventura and Derek Bell of the Mets slipped after hitting the ball.
Ventura never got out of the batter's box after grounding to second
in the second inning. In addition, Todd Ziele, newly acquired by
the Mets and making his debut at first base, had his foot nicked by
a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, with the Cubs leading by four runs, chants of
``Let's Go Mets'' could be heard. Piazza did not disappoint,
whacking a two-run homer, a signal for hundreds of tired fans to
start their trek homeward in this sprawling metropolitan region.

A BOSTON TV PARTY IN AID OF A VIDEO REVOLUTION  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Miles Unger writes on art for boston.citysearch.com, an online
guide to the city. 
 By MILES UNGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 23, 1969, the infant medium of video art launched a
guerrilla raid on broadcast television. The attack, a show titled
``The Medium Is the Medium'' and described in the program guide as
``six avant-garde artists take over television,'' consisted of a
barrage of abstract images and visual non sequiturs.
</P>
<P>
   And if most viewers were too busy singing along with Peter, Paul
and Mary on ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' to notice the
artistic coup d'etat, the broadcast nevertheless marked a turning
point in the history of an art form that is now firmly entrenched
in the bastions of high culture.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sights that would have greeted the adventurous viewer
of Boston's WGBH that night was a psychedelic go-go dance _
interrupted by random splats of abstract color and the
electronically distorted face of Richard Nixon _ set to Beethoven's
``Moonlight Sonata.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Nam June Paik's ``Electronic Opera, No. 1.'' It begins:
``This is participation TV. Please follow instructions,'' and
continues with admonitions, delivered in Paik's heavily accented
English, to ``close your eyes,'' and then ``three-quarters close
your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The absurd instructions capture the mood of the project as a
whole, which through Dada-inspired mayhem tried to jolt viewers out
of the mindless passivity induced by the boob tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a strong belief among these artists in the late '60s
that they wanted to reinvent TV,'' says John Hanhardt, who
organized the current retrospective of Paik's work at the
Guggenheim Museum. Like many of their colleagues, video artists had
a utopian vision of breaking down the barriers between the museum
and the public in the belief that they could transform the world.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the ``The Medium Is the Medium'' return to
broadcast television this Sunday at 4 p.m. when WGBH presents ``The
Electronic Canvas,'' a history of video art that highlights that
city's crucial contribution to the medium. In showing ``The
Electronic Canvas,'' which will be made available to other public
broadcasting stations after its Boston premiere, WGBH is returning
to its roots, since it was in its studios that much of the early
history of video art took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medium Is the Medium'' was put together by a young
producer and director at WGBH named Fred Barzyk, and it marked the
first time that artists got their hands on broadcast equipment. It
was the artistic equivalent of a sit-in, an attempt to wrest, at
least for a moment, control of the mass media from the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The video artist Peter Campus remembers: ``There was this
political idea in the late '60s of not being in the galleries and
museums. To reach the masses, the work had to be broadcast, and at
the time WGBH was the only place in the country to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1969 Fred Barzyk already had a reputation for daring work. As
far back as 1964, Barzyk and his colleagues at the station had put
together a piece called ``Jazz Images'' in which music was
accompanied by such quirky vignettes as a view through a 50-cent
child's kaleidoscope and a potato reassembling itself out of bits
of peel. Though it was never meant to go on air, it helped foster a
spirit of invention that would later bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my way of proselytizing, `C'mon, we can do something
different,''' Barzyk explains.
</P>
<P>
   Now 63, with more than 40 years at WGBH behind him, Barzyk, his
once shaggy Beatles-style mane more neatly trimmed and gone gray,
still shows flashes of the mischievousness that helped launch an
artistic revolution. His own low-tech contribution to ``Jazz
Images'' was made with wire screens, a couple of candles and a
Miles Davis record.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments led to ``What's Happening, Mr. Silver?,'' a
local talk show starring David Silver, a Tufts University professor
with an iconoclastic bent and a Mick Jagger look. The program,
which Barzyk directed, favored illogical juxtapositions and such
experimental techniques as asking the audience to tune in
simultaneously to the two local WGBH stations, on which they would
run contrasting sound and images; another episode featured Abbie
Hoffman tossing drugs around the set. The show was almost canceled
after Silver made ``inappropriate remarks'' about Nancy Sinatra's
anatomy, leading to an on-air mea culpa by Barzyk and the host.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution of WGBH in those early days was to explore the
technical and aesthetic possibilities of video rather than to take
on political issues directly. ``WGBH early on was crucial,''
Hanhardt says. ``There was the idea of a laboratory, a place where
one could create, experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many at the time, Barzyk believed that artistic radicalism,
by expanding consciousness, somehow contributed to social change.
Ironically, what ultimately did in ``What's Happening, Mr.
Silver?'' was management's response to the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr., which was to push more socially relevant
programming.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the notoriety of ``Mr. Silver?'' that brought WGBH to the
attention of a group of young artists working with video at the
Howard Wise Gallery in New York. ``I was inside the castle, with
all this sophisticated equipment,'' Barzyk says. ``The artists were
on the outside looking in. Someone needed to lower the drawbridge
and let them in.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to cross was Nam June Paik, the Korean-born
artist often regarded as the father of video art, who came to the
station as part of the Rockefeller Artists-in-Television program.
Though Barzyk's creed was to push the envelope, there was still a
culture clash between the technicians whose job was to get skin to
look like skin and an artist whose career had been built on
treating the television signal like electronic Play-Doh, something
to be squeezed and molded at will.
</P>
<P>
   Barzyk laughs as he tells of Paik tramping around the studio in
oversize rubber boots so he wouldn't get electrocuted while
fiddling with the insides of his TV sets. The crisis came during
Paik's 1970 ``Video Commune,'' a four-hour psychedelic romp set to
Beatles music; the juiced-up, synthesized signal blew the station's
transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tensions between technicians and artists, public
television, through WGBH and related programs at WNET in New York
and KQED in San Francisco, remained the one place where artists
could work with broadcast equipment and get their visions on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who came to WGBH as part of the Television Workshop,
successor to the Artists-in-Television program, was a young video
artist named William Wegman. Wegman views his time at WGBH in the
early '70s as a missed opportunity. ``It was very hard for me to
work in front of other people,'' he remembers. ``I was sort of an
anti-tech person at the time, and my own studio seemed to suit my
more offhand style.''
</P>
<P>
   One who did take full advantage of the high-tech equipment the
station offered was Peter Campus, who made his seminal ``Three
Transitions'' at WGBH in 1973. Unlike Wegman, who tended to
improvise with whatever was at hand, Campus came with a complete
scenario. Working with multiple cameras and switchers that could
superimpose and merge different images of his own face, Campus used
the medium to explore psychological space.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what was going on at the time was: `Isn't it groovy?
Isn't this fun?''' Campus recalls. ``I thought of myself as
conveying something deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   If the late '60s and early '70s was a time when artists believed
they could change the world by changing mass media, that moment
soon passed. ``A window was created,'' Hanhardt says, ``where the
artists could explore what TV could be, one that's largely been
lost.'' In some sense, video art has come full circle, conquering
the world of the museum while losing the battle for broadcast
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Electronic Canvas'' _ which will also be screened
throughout April at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in
Lincoln, Mass., where viewers can check out more complete versions
of much of the historical material _ provides a taste of those
early experiments, but the antic sensibility of Barzyk and his
peers has been replaced by an earnest historicism.
</P>
<P>
   Such retrospective tributes are a sure sign that the medium has
come of age, but they also make one nostalgic for the days of
video's wild youth.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators Wednesday introduced a bill that would
ban wagering on collegiate and amateur sports, calling it a
corrupting influence on young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The Amateur Sports Integrity Act, co-sponsored by Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and backed by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, would prohibit gambling
on high school and college sports as well as the Summer and Winter
Olympic Games. Congress last moved to restrict sports wagering in
1991, banning it in all but a handful of states, none of which have
any significant betting activity except Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In that state, $2.3 billion is wagered legally each year on
sporting events, one-third of it on college athletics. The National
Collegiate Athletics Association's men's basketball tournament and
football bowl games account for between $50 to $60 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``By closing the Vegas loophole and banning college sports
gambling completely, we will end a practice that has turned college
athletes into objects to be bet upon, exposing them to unwarranted
pressure, bribery and corruption,'' McCain said at a Senate
Commerce Committee hearing at which several government, NCAA and
gambling officials testified.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said, ``I realize that a ban on collegiate sports
gambling will not eliminate all gambling on college sports.
However, a total ban will prevent another avenue for those
participating in point-shaving scandals to spread out their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee released a letter from 65 college coaches from
across the country that said gambling on amateur games was a
corrupting influence on young people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 84 percent of NCAA referees said they had
participated in some form of gambling since beginning their
careers, according to a University of Michigan study discussed at
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that nearly 40 percent of referees bet on
sporting events, and 20 percent said they gambled on the NCAA
basketball tournament. Some referees even admitted they had been
asked to fix games they were officiating, while others said they
were aware of the spread on a game and it affected the way they
officiated the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said it represented an attempt by the NCAA
to divert attention from its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada is not the problem, and the NCAA should stop trying to
cover up its own non-existent efforts to teach student athletes
about the laws which prohibit betting on college sports,'' said
Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the NCAA should invest some of the billions of dollars
they are raking in on college athletics to spread the word about
the dangers of illegal gambling on their own campuses,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's other senator, Richard Bryan, also a Democrat, noted
that a recent survey of six colleges in five states found that 23
percent of students gambled at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association,
told the committee there is nothing improper in betting legally on
college athletics. Outlawing it, he said would only drive betting
underground or overseas via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Closing sports books to send a message about gambling is like
closing restaurants to send a message to young people about
alcohol, added Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need better education and law enforcement, not a punitive
measure against one state's primary industry,'' she said.

FRIEDKIN TRIES AGAIN FOR THE A-LIST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ William Friedkin was a golden boy in Hollywood in
the early 1970s. Two of his films, ``The French Connection'' and
``The Exorcist,'' were among the most successful of that decade.
But Friedkin responded to sudden wealth and power with the kind of
self-destructive arrogance all too common in Hollywood. The town
waited for him to fail. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was arrogant, I let success go to my head, I did not
suffer fools gladly,'' said Friedkin, the director of the new drama
``Rules of Engagement,'' which opens Friday. He spoke quietly. ``I
probably was more enamored of myself than my talent deserved,'' he
said. ``I thought I was infallible. I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 64, Friedkin accepts his fallibility with a shrug,
and still seems brashly confident. But the years have taken their
toll. ``If someone is successful as a filmmaker, you have the keys
to the kingdom, you can do what you want,'' he said, seated in a
small lounge near the editing facilities at Culver City where he
was adding the final touches of music to the new film. ``But if you
have a failure, you virtually must beg for alms with the rest of
les miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement,'' which has stirred more anticipation
than any Friedkin movie in recent years, is mostly a military
courtroom drama in which a highly decorated United States Marine
colonel (played by Samuel L. Jackson) asks another Marine colonel
and his comrade-in-arms from Vietnam (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to
serve as his lawyer in a court martial. The Jackson character is
accused of killing unarmed civilians who have engaged in a violent
demonstration outside the United States Embassy in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, by Stephen Gaghan, was adapted from a story by
James Webb, the novelist who was secretary of the Navy in 1987-88.
Webb, a decorated Marine infantry commander in Vietnam, is also
executive producer of the film, which is being released by
Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The actors said that Friedkin was, in many ways, a welcome
change from the hotshot music video directors who have surged into
the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Billy's mellowed over the years, but there's a
definite fire there,'' Jackson said. ``What makes him unusual
compared to so many other directors is that he really knows what
he's doing. He has a very clear idea of how the picture begins and
plays and ends. A lot of times guys have no idea what they really
want. Billy knows. He hires you because you can do the job that he
wants you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has heard all the war stories about Friedkin's tantrums
and misbehavior. ``The arrogance and, I guess, the hardness is no
longer there,'' he said. ``All the things he went through got him
to the place he is today. He's able to do things calmly today that
he was hotheaded about years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is not exactly a comeback for Friedkin, who has, in
recent years, directed ``Blue Chips'' (1994), a well-received
basketball drama starring Nick Nolte and Shaquille O'Neal, as well
as ``Jade'' (1995), with David Caruso and Linda Fiorentino, which
fared disastrously at the box office. In 1997, Friedkin also
directed a Showtime/MGM television remake of the classic ``12 Angry
Men,'' which earned him strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rules of Engagement,'' from its stark opening in the
jungles of Vietnam to its mob scenes in Yemen (actually filmed in
Morocco) to the military courtroom, could mark a turnabout in a
career that floundered after extraordinary success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy just picked poor subjects _ his selection of material
was not good,'' said Richard D. Zanuck, who produced the film with
Scott Rudin. ``And when you're dealing with poor material,
everything else gets dragged down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck has known Friedkin for nearly 30 years, going back to
when the director came to 20th Century Fox with ``The French
Connection'' after every other studio in town had rejected it. At
the time Zanuck was Fox's president of production. ``He's probably
the most focused director I've ever worked with,'' Zanuck said.
``He's very organized. He has a clear-cut vision. And he sticks to
it. There's no indecisiveness about Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friedkin's poor choices over the years _ films like
``Sorcerer'' (1977), ``The Brinks Job'' (1979), ``Cruising''
(1980), ``Deal of the Century'' (1983) and ``Rampage'' (1987) _
were compounded by a reputation that haunted him. In Peter
Biskind's 1998 book ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' about film
directors of the 1970s, Friedkin was described as demanding,
autocratic, bullying and immensely difficult to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin hardly disagrees. ``I had come, quite quickly, from
obscurity to great success,'' he said. ``I mean, the two hardest
things to live with are success and failure. Success is often as
difficult as failure. To be extremely honest about it, I was
arrogant beyond my talent. That's what it boils down to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an adversarial relationship with the heads of the
studios then. When you're riding a string of hits, there's very
little problem with that. But then the worm turns.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ``Jade,'' a mystery thriller, especially
disturbed him. ``After `Jade,' I thought I must be doing something
wrong because I liked the film and I thought it delivered,'' he
said. ``But the audience is right. They're always, always right.
You hear directors complain that the advertising is lousy, the
distribution is no good, the date was wrong to open the film. I
don't believe that. The audience is never wrong. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudin said he hired Friedkin for the current film because of a
hunch that he would prove especially adept at a film about the
military. ``We needed someone who was muscular and ascetic,'' Rudin
said. ``There was a danger of it being bathetic, that it would
become sentimental. I knew Billy wouldn't fall for that trap. He's
got an astringent tone. That's what was needed here. It's emotional
but tough at the center. It's about guys who are not especially
verbal. I knew Billy could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rudin said that Friedkin, like some other well-known directors
of the 1970s, had, over the years, become ensnared in a Hollywood
spiral. ``Billy made a couple of turkeys,'' he said. ``And once you
get off the A-list, you don't get the scripts anymore. But you
can't get back to the A-list without the scripts. Well, he got the
script here and he did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Friedkin has mellowed, because of his age and,
perhaps, his seemingly stable personal life. After some tumultuous
relationships, he has been married for eight years to Sherry
Lansing, chairman of Paramount Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``She totally backs away from anything to do with any film I
make there,'' Friedkin says, adding that most of his dealings are
with producers and production executives at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lansing, he was wed three times, including a brief
marriage to Jeanne Moreau. ``Sherry is my fourth wife _ we should
leave out the other names to protect the innocent,'' said Friedkin,
who has two sons from his earlier marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin's survival, and his stubbornness, are probably the
result of a childhood and early career that were marked by an
intense hunger to succeed that has never diminished.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on the north side of
Chicago; his Russian-immigrant father barely earned a living and
his mother was a nurse. At the age of 16, he got a job in the
mailroom of the television station WGN. At about the same time he
saw the film ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it five times,'' he recalled. ``I stayed in the theater
all day. I was stunned. It moved me so profoundly. I had never seen
a film that embodied the various art forms _ music, composition,
lighting, editing, performance. It was incredibly powerful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By his early 20s, Friedkin was directing live television in
Chicago, and he soon turned to documentaries. By the early 1960s he
had made a documentary called ``The People Versus Paul Crump,''
about a black man on death row accused of killing a guard in the
course of a holdup at a baby-food factory. The inmate, who insisted
that he was innocent, was later given a sentence of life
imprisonment and was subsequently released from jail. The film won
numerous awards and caught the attention of the television producer
David Wolper, who offered Friedkin a job in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin soon began working in network television, including
directing episodes of ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' His first
feature film, in 1967, was ``Good Times,'' with Sonny and Cher. It
was during a period when studios were seeking to imitate ``A Hard
Day's Night.'' Friedkin said with a laugh: ``I loved both Sonny and
Cher, but, I tell you, you'd have to be sentenced to see that film.
It's inept. And that's being charitable.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were ``The Night They Raided Minsky's'' (1968) and
adaptations of two plays, Harold Pinter's ``Birthday Party'' (1969)
and Mart Crowley's ``Boys in the Band'' (1970). After that came the
classic ``The French Connection'' (1971), which not only won five
Academy Awards, including best picture, but whose sharp, gritty
documentary style has certainly had an impact on police films and,
notably, television series like ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stylistically as far out as `The Blair Witch Project'
is today,'' he said. ``It's been copied a lot. Just look at
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin's style in ``The French Connection'' was
straightforward, unsubtle. The film was made as if it were a
documentary, with cameras catching events unexpectedly. At times,
Friedkin did not tell the camera crew precisely what to shoot, but
merely told it to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was making documentaries, I would often not know where
to put my camera if an event was taking place _ a riot, a police
chase,'' he said. ``I wanted to make this film, which was based on
an actual case, look like the cameras just happened to drop in on
an actual event.''
</P>
<P>
   His next film, ``The Exorcist,'' is being reissued shortly with
an additional 10 minutes that had been cut in its original version.
Friedkin said the newer version of the thriller has a spiritual
element that had been missing. The film itself has grossed more
than $500 million, a startling figure given the low cost of tickets
in the 1970s. (Within a few months of the film's release, Friedkin
got a check for $1 million, a huge profit check at the time for a
director).
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin is uncertain about his next films, although he has been
working on one about the boxer Sonny Liston and another about the
battle for Jerusalem in the 1948 Israeli-Arab war. But these films
hinge, to some degree, on the critical and audience responses to
``Rules of Engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   He sipped some water out of a bottle. ``If the film doesn't work
for an audience, I will be tremendously disheartened and
disappointed and depressed,'' he said. ``But only because I have
failed. I can't blame anyone else. The failure ends up in one
place. I made the choices. With a lot of help, of course. But I
made the decisions. And I'll have to live with that.''

KEEPING FAITH WITH `HIGH FIDELITY'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the director M. Night Shyamalan.  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the transition from novel to film, Rob, the hero of ``High
Fidelity'' _ Nick Hornby's 1995 novel, Stephen Frears' new film _
undergoes some minor transformations: he ceases being British and
becomes American, relocates from London to Chicago and sees his
last name change from Fleming to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The first two changes were no doubt to accommodate the casting
of the Chicago native John Cusack; the last you can speculate about
on your own. Otherwise, much remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Rob is still the owner of a marginally failing vintage record
shop, still called Championship Vinyl, which is still manned by
``the musical moron twins,'' Dick and Barry; he is still moping
about his love life, especially his recent dumping by his
girlfriend, Laura; and he is still the gloomy underachiever whose
relentless navel-gazing is made palatable by his honesty about his
shortcomings and his often quite funny insights about men, women
and romance. As film adaptations go, this one is almost fiercely
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``I never expected it to be so faithful,'' Hornby fairly
chirped last week. ``At times it appears to be a film in which John
Cusack reads my book.''
</P>
<P>
   Which should be good news for the novel's rabid fans. ``High
Fidelity'' isn't exactly a cult novel _ there's no shape-shifting,
no artificial intelligences, no pages-long hallucinogenic spiels _
but it does seem to be something of a cultural hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has become one of those books that people of a
certain age have all read,'' says Wendy Carlton, Hornby's editor at
Riverhead Books. ``It was the kind of book that everybody in my
summer house just had to read. There's a lot of us _ aging
teen-agers, thirtysomething teen-agers _ who are a lot like Rob:
not married, not settled, career in the air. We love the freedom of
it, but at the same time we feel this nagging guilt. You know, that
`By the time they were my age, my parents already had me' kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornby said: ``Both `High Fidelity' and my earlier book, `Fever
Pitch'''_ a memoir about his life as a devoted fan of Arsenal, the
powerhouse English soccer club _ ``received the most curious
response. People would come up and say, `This book is about me _
literally, this book is about me.' I've been told, I don't know how
many times, `I know the record shop you wrote about,' and the
shop's in some part of the country I've never been to. It's a
fairly depressing indictment of the state of things, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys, of course, find it easy to identify with at least some
part of Rob: if not his thoughts on women, dating, sex,
relationships and disappointment, then his ardor for pop culture,
for rock music and movies and sitcoms, and his tireless willingness
to ponder, critique and rank their tiniest nuances. Which albums
have the best side-one, cut-one songs? Which are the five best
episodes of ``Cheers''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have a way of talking in superlatives,'' says Hornby,
speaking by telephone from London. ``There's no point in saying
that someone is good at something; you have to say he's the best
whatever since so and so. Men like to have a frame of reference.''
One of the funniest, smartest riffs in ``High Fidelity'' is Rob's
lengthy rumination on whether Laura's dumping of him ranks as one
of the ``desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable
split-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   But the novel has also found a receptive audience among women.
``The first wave of readers had a lot of guys,'' Hornby says. ``But
there was a second wave of women, perhaps because the story was
told from the man's perspective and the men liked it, so the women
maybe thought it would give them an inside line into what the men
were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton recalls: ``Nick had a reading at Astor Place. There were
a lot of couples. I can't tell you the number of times you'd see
girls nudging the guys, saying like: `See? That's what drives me
crazy about you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hornby muses: ``Yes, the nudge seems to be my literary bit.
Other people get reviews. I get nudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Attaining nudgability is certainly the hope of the makers of
``High Fidelity,'' the film. The book was optioned by Disney's
Touchstone division, where it went into development and was finally
presented to John Cusack and his writing and producing partners on
this film, D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink.
</P>
<P>
   They were also members of the writing team for ``Grosse Pointe
Blank'' (1997), a successful dark comedy that happened to star
Cusack and happened to be about a young man caught up in both a
career crisis and romantic confusion, and that made such a fruitful
use of pop music that it spawned two volumes of soundtrack hits. In
other words, in ``High Fidelity'' they found about as close to a
sequel as they could get without needing Roman numerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge in adapting the novel,'' Cusack says,
``was to commit to direct address.'' Indeed, Rob in ``High
Fidelity'' shares with other protagonists of the new century, like
television's Malcolm in ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and Christopher
Titus in ``Titus,'' an affinity for breaking the fourth wall and
talking directly to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob, like a lot of Nick's characters, is a guy who ought to
know better than to be the way he is,'' Cusack continues. ``And in
fact he does know better. He's a lazy, delusional slacker, but he's
brutally honest with himself, and has these terrifically incisive
insights, and that's what makes him redeemable. Rob does a lot of
things where he messes up, and those were fairly easy to show.
</P>
<P>
   But the inner, more confessional aspects were harder. Almost
immediately we thought, let's just do what Michael Caine did in
`Alfie''' _ speak directly to the camera _ ``but then I vetoed that
idea. I thought there'd just be too much of me. But then Frears
brought it up, and we went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Frears, who had worked with Cusack a decade ago, memorably,
in ``The Grifters'': ``The direct address was very liberating. Once
you commit to that, you can bypass naturalism completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the setting to America subtly altered the characters'
behavior in ways sure to start purists debating. ``Nick's
characters are very English,'' says Frears, who is English himself
and whose early films ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``Sammy and
Rosie Get Laid,'' which were set in London, share a sensibility
like that of ``High Fidelity.'' ``Rob is mental, stoical, a passive
observer. And quite glum. And I think this is one of the
differences between English and American actors. American actors
like to do things, they want to be engaged in things, they want the
audience to like them, even if their characters are doing some not
so likable things. So I was enormously relieved to be doing it in
America. To have left that English glumness of it was a great
relief. Now I'm sure I'll be spat at on the streets when I
return.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge the writers faced was the partly creative,
partly legal problem of figuring out what songs would go where.
Given that Rob and his cohorts, Dick and Barry, are such musical
snobs _ ``The three of them see themselves as misplaced royalty,''
Cusack says, ``as kings of somewhere, though maybe not here on
earth'' _ the cues clearly had to be smart, and if not immediately
recognizable, then at least very intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film has 70 song cues, and we probably listened to 2,000
songs to get those 70 cues,'' Cusack says. ``We used our Rob and
Dick and Barry dispositions a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornby says: ``The movie was made by people who are exactly the
right age. They shifted some of their reference points slightly,
but the book clearly made sense to them. One of the things
different is the adoration of all things black American, which is
such an English thing. We're great curators of black America. But
the filmmakers transferred their sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   If the soundtrack is studded with nuggets _ the Velvet
Underground's ``Who Loves the Sun?,'' Bob Dylan's ``Most of the
Time,'' Elvis Costello's ``Shipbuilding,'' the 13th Floor
Elevators' ``You're Going to Me'' _ so are the performances.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Joan Cusack all get to swipe a
scene or two, and Lisa Bonet and Sara Gilbert, of whom we've seen
little since they stopped being the daughters on ``Cosby'' and
``Roseanne,'' make appealing appearances. Todd Louiso and Jack
Black are hilarious in what should be career-boosting portrayals of
Dick and Barry, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, in an uncredited
performance, plays an ex-girlfriend, showing in flashback all the
sexiness and verve that appealed to the collegiate Rob and in the
present all the boorishness that makes him wonder what he was
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand, in an all-too-brief ``Play It Again, Sam''-like
cameo, is Bruce Springsteen, who offers Rob a bit of romantic
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this idea to have Rob have this conversation with Bruce
in his head,'' Cusack says. ``Of course we never really thought
we'd get Bruce, we just thought putting him in there would make a
good read for the studio and get them all excited. But I had met
him socially, so I thought even though he's going to say no, I may
as well call him and throw the Hail Mary pass and get it over with.
And he kind of just laughed at the idea and said, `Send me a
script.' So when we finished shooting, we wrapped around 2 a.m.,
flew to New York, and taped him the next morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The riskiest choice the filmmakers made was casting a Danish
newcomer, Iben Hjejle, as Laura. ``We had been reading a lot of
actresses,'' Cusack says, ``and we had no consensus about choice.
And then Stephen went to a film festival in Berlin where he saw
`Mifune,' in which Iben is just wonderful, and she was there
getting an award. And he called me in the middle of the night,
screaming: `I've found her! I've found Laura!' I said, `Where are
you?' He says, `In Germany!' I say, `Laura's German?' He says, `No,
from Denmark.' That's when I asked him if he was drunk. And then I
got on a plane to Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears says: ``I don't know what she thought. I talked to her
for two hours. I felt like a salesman. I was ashamed of myself,
like I was a white slaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the truth is that this is a story about a man obsessed
with a woman. Well, this has to be something everyone understands.
You have to have someone who fulfills that requirement. Well,
that's an incredible thing to hang on someone; no woman in life is
like that. But on that cold night in February in Berlin, Iben
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack says: ``Laura has to be the ballast of the film. The
actress who plays her has to provide the weight, has to convey the
sense of what he'd lose, has to say, `Look, you're playing with
real bullets here.' And Iben has that depth and presence. And she
does it without pushing. She doesn't have it in her to fall into
melodrama. I'd hate to be on the wrong side of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack and Frears know they have not undertaken a simple
assignment; adapting a beloved book, no matter how faithfully, is
an invitation to criticism. But they appear to have at least one
fan. ``It's a really good movie,'' Nick Hornby says. ``All authors
should be so lucky.''

CITIES AND STATES MAY BAN NUDE DANCING, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Ind.)  (Eds: Longer version to follow.) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that cities and
states may ban nude dancing as a way of combatting crime and other
``negative secondary effects'' associated with establishments that
offer this kind of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 vote upholding an Erie, Pa., ordinance that requires
exotic dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string, the court's
fractured majority did not explain how that requirement would
reduce the crime, prostitution, sexual assaults or other problems
associated with places where dancers appear fully nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, requiring dancers to wear pasties and G-strings
may not greatly reduce these secondary effects,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor conceded in her opinion. But she said such a
regulation needed only to further the government's legitimate
interest rather than fully accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may also be true that a pasties and G-string requirement
would not be as effective as, for example, a requirement that the
dancers be fully clothed,'' O'Connor said, ``but the city must
balance its efforts to address the problem with the requirement
that the restriction be no greater than necessary to further the
city's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision Wednesday, Erie v. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161, the
court took up where it left off nine years ago, when an even more
splintered majority upheld a public indecency law in Indiana that
also banned nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the court ruled that nude dancing _ as opposed to
simple public nudity _ was a form of expression that had at least
some minimal protection under the First Amendment but that could
nonetheless be regulated under an appropriate standard.
</P>
<P>
   The court failed in the Indiana case to settle on a standard,
and did only marginally better Wednesday as Justice David H. Souter
changed his mind on the amount of evidence cities needed in order
to justify a ban on nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor in the majority were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer,
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Souter
dissented.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You may not know the name, but you know the face: the
big baggy eyes, the sensual mouth with the overbite. And then there
is that deep hoarse voice and that sulfurous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Heckart has been acting for more than 50 years now,
almost always as the second banana. She was the spinster teacher
who gets tipsy in ``Picnic'' in 1953 and the alcoholic mother whose
son is drowned in ``The Bad Seed'' in 1955, both on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do one, they have no imagination,'' said Heckart about all
the drunks she has played. Sometimes she is the aunt, as she was in
the Mary Tyler Moore television show. She was Marilyn Monroe's
waitress friend in the 1956 movie ``Bus Stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, and at 81, Heckart has the lead. Indeed, she
dominates the stage at the Promenade Theater for nearly every one
of the 110 minutes of ``The Waverly Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's
memory play about his grandmother's decline, in which Heckart
portrays Gladys Green, a woman who is gradually becoming senile.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Anderman and Mark Blum play her daughter and son-in-law;
Josh Hamilton plays her grandson, who is the narrator, and Anthony
Arkin the last painter whose work Gladys exhibits at the gallery of
the title, in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart was having tea at the Plaza recently before an evening
performance. She is driven to the theater each day from her home in
Norwalk, Conn., except for the Wednesday and Saturday matinees,
when Scotty Bloch takes the part. ``This is my swan song, my last
performance in a play; it just takes too much energy,'' Heckart
said. ``You get such a good one, you may as well go out on a
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   And a wave it is. Ben Brantley called her performance
``uncanny'' in The New York Times, describing her ``beautifully
coherent and intelligent portrayal of a woman sliding into
incoherence.''
</P>
<P>
   To disintegrate mentally and physically onstage in front of an
audience is, to say the least, taxing. ``She has to have a sense of
what she's doing and thinking, even though she is
self-destructing,'' said Scott Ellis, the play's director.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart portrays Gladys's decline in almost imperceptible
gradations. She begins Act I with a slight stoop, a faint
trembling, a cheery deafness. In the second act comes the cane, the
language is increasingly disorganized, the trembling becomes more
noticeable. Until finally she is a tiny figure, wasting away, ready
to die.
</P>
<P>
   So it is a shock to see Heckart at the curtain call, walking
briskly onto the stage and bowing gracefully to the audience. And
it is a surprise to meet her in person, to see the pink-and-white
complexion, the soft white hair neatly coiffed, the careful makeup,
the big sapphire and diamond ring, the shapely legs and the high
heels.
</P>
<P>
   How did she go about creating the performance? ``I don't know
how to act,'' Heckart said, with her deep laugh. ``I don't know how
to talk about it.'' Actually, her son Luke, a theater director
himself, said in a separate interview that his mother is ``a
perfectionist, so exacting, so specific; she does a great deal of
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Alzheimer's is never mentioned by name in ``The Waverly
Gallery,'' which takes place from 1989 to 1991, Lonergan said about
Gladys's decline, ``We assumed it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to be a play (italics)about(end italics)
Alzheimer's in particular,'' he added. ``I wanted it to be
analogous to other things that have happened to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Heckart said she had seen the effect of Alzheimer's on a number
of friends. And when the play was in rehearsals last summer at the
Williamstown Theater Festival, where it had an earlier run, Ellis
brought in a nurse who cares for Alzheimer's patients, and a woman
whose husband had the disease, to talk to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart was ideal for the part of Gladys, said Lonergan, who
also wrote the hit 1996 play about slackers, ``This Is Our Youth.''
``Eileen is a great actress and she also has a certain urban
sharpness to her,'' he said. ``You believe her as someone who spent
all their life in Greenwich Village. It's a big personality under
assault. A milder personality falling apart is less dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress's early life had its own dramas. She was born in
Ohio in 1919. Her parents separated when she was 2. Her father took
her younger brother to live with him, she said, and she remained
with her mother. Heckart's mother, Esther, was married five times.
``She liked it a lot,'' Heckart said with a wicked laugh. When her
mother finally went into a nursing home she asked her daughter:
```Was I married three or four times?' I said, `Would you believe
five?''' Heckart made a list of all her husbands for her mother.
``Do you remember anything about them?'' Heckart asked. ``They were
all gorgeous,'' her mother replied.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart graduated from Ohio State University. It was while she
was in college that she caught whooping cough, which, she said, she
ignored. The result was the deepening of her voice to its
distinctive register.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she married her college sweetheart, John
Harrison Yankee Jr., who became an insurance broker. The couple had
three sons, Mark, 47, a liquor salesman; Philip, 45, a stage
manager for cruise ship theatrical productions, and Luke, 40, the
director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her brief biography in the program for ``The Waverly
Gallery,'' Heckart mentions what is important to her: the sons, of
course, her two granddaughters and, among other awards, her Oscar
(for best supporting actress in the 1972 ``Butterflies Are Free'').
</P>
<P>
   She began her career in summer stock. ``When I was young, I
wanted to drag a mink stole around like Joan Crawford,'' Heckart
said. ``But I wound up in all those kitchen dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to New York and, like many actors of her generation,
cut her teeth in live television _ ``The Alcoa Hour,'' ``The Philco
Television Playhouse,'' ``Goodyear Television Playhouse.'' The
actresses wore black lipstick for the cameras then, and the heat
from the lights was so intense that costumes wilted, Heckart said.
But the pressure of performing live provided unparalleled
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on an NBC show _ Heckart couldn't remember which _ an
actor missed his line and the director simply cut off the cameras
to give him a cue. For a few seconds there was only static on
television screens across America. But ``everyone was used to
having snow'' in those days, Heckart said.
</P>
<P>
   Her first break onstage came in William Inge's ``Picnic,'' when
she was 33. She played a schoolteacher with, as Brooks Atkinson put
it in The New York Times, ``a hunger for life and a knack for
getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Woodward was an understudy and fell in love with Paul
Newman, who played the rich boy. Did Heckart suspect? ``We all
suspected, yes. She was a very Southern beauty, very gentle, very
quiet; in her little assertive way, though, there was a lot of
steel in that lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Seed'' followed ``Picnic.'' Heckart found she could
hardly endure the role of a mother whose son is drowned by a
little-girl murderer. ``Mark was a year old,'' she said. ``I saw
his face going underwater at night. The doctor said, `You have to
get out of it.''' She acted the part again on film, but disliked
the movie. ``The Hayes office had to have a happy ending,'' she
said. The little girl is struck by lightning. ``It was tacky,
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   She portrayed Van Heflin's wife on Broadway in Arthur Miller's
``View From the Bridge'' in 1956, and in 1958 was an unhappily
married woman in another Inge drama, ``The Dark at the Top of the
Stairs.'' In 1969 came ``Butterflies Are Free'' on Broadway with
Keir Dullea and Blythe Danner, in which she played Dullea's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, she was supposed to arrive onstage to find Dullea
and his girlfriend, played by Danner, in a state of half dress
after they have made love. But one night, Heckart recalled, Dullea
couldn't get the zipper closed on his trousers. ``It was top of the
second act,'' said Heckart. ``Blythe got so hysterical laughing she
walked offstage. The next scene was Blythe and me. Without her
there was nothing. She didn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   So Heckart, the trouper, turned to the audience and said,
```Ladies and gentlemen, we're a group of actors who can't cope
with a zipper. If you don't mind, we'll start again.' It took us so
long to get that audience to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Heckart's husband died suddenly on his morning
walk. She was standing at the kitchen window when she saw him fall.
``I looked out the window and he was gone,'' she said. ``It was the
worst year of my life.'' The two had been married for 53 years.
Their son, Luke, ``got me out of it,'' Heckart said. Luke Yankee
put together a video retrospective of all his mother's major roles,
and the two of them presented it as a lecture on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Heckart is grateful that before her husband's death, the couple
had moved out of their big house in Connecticut, with the swimming
pool and all the gardens, into another home that is easier to
maintain. ``Jack was very wise,'' she noted. ``He said let's get
rid of this big house before one of us is ill and has to make this
decision alone.'' Today, she lives near her oldest son, Mark.
</P>
<P>
   What is the secret of her seeming youthfulness and vigor? Does
she exercise? ``As little as possible,'' Heckart said. Yes, walking
is good for you, she acknowledged: ``But, oh, my, I think, what a
chore! I'd rather drive than walk anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   And let it be said, Heckart also smokes, a great deal. ``I go
down there,'' said Ellis, the director, about Heckart's dressing
room, ``and all I do is cough as I'm giving notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if she doesn't exercise, what does Heckart do with her
spare time? ``I needlepointed myself to death,'' she said. What she
likes most these days is going to the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard,
Conn., with a friend. At the entrance, the friend heads to the
blackjack tables, Heckart to the slot machines.

HISTORY MADE AT THE TOKYO DOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sports Column with BBN-METS-CUBS) 
(jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the Mets' 5-3 opening game loss to the Cubs on
Wednesday, Thom Brennaman, the Fox Sports Net's effusive
play-by-play announcer, described the game from Tokyo as ``one of
the most historic nights in the grand history of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Where should this mediocre game be placed in baseball history?
Between the ``Black Sox'' scandal and Cal Ripken playing his
2,131st consecutive game? Between Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee
selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees and, let's see, Mark McGwire's
62nd home run in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   But let's give Brennaman some slack even if he blithely
pooh-poohed all criticism of opening the season in Tokyo by saying
one happy Japanese boy's cheering for Mike Piazza's home run made
the trip all worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, history was ultimately made at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first regular season game played by Major League
Baseball outside North America. It forced Mets fans to rise by 5:05
a.m. ET and Cubs fans up by 4:05 a.m. Central Time.
</P>
<P>
   The game was certainly the first time that an American-born
manager, the Mets' Bobby Valentine, who once managed a Japanese
team, returned to play a game under protest.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it was the first time that Japanese fans witnessed a
nine-walk performance by the starting pitcher for a major league
team on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   What lessons shall be learned, passed down through generations,
thanks to the uneconomic pitching of the Mets' Mike Hampton!
</P>
<P>
   The game bore witness to major leaguers wearing advertising on
their persons _ a sight not yet seen in North America _ uniform
sleeve patches promoting AIU, the Japanese subsidiary of the Auto
Insurance Group, and helmet decals for AM/PM, a convenience store
chain.
</P>
<P>
   It was disappointing to watch this historic event along with
Brennaman and his partner, Bob Brenly. Brenly, a credible analyst,
is always better than Brennaman, but much better when he is teamed
during postseason telecasts with Tim McCarver and Joe Buck. With
Brennaman, Brenly shifts too easily into the hype mode; beside
McCarver, he thinks and works harder.
</P>
<P>
   Brenly certainly did not need to pause at midgame to say, ``The
stands are full of baseball fans at the Tokyo Dome.'' We got the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   For New York fans, the game needed Howie Rose, who is still
fulfilling his last few games of Islanders' play-by-play chores,
Gary Thorne, Ralph Kiner or Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   The telecast lacked the feel of an historic event, or even a
memorable one. Where was the Japanese prime minister? The American
ambassador to Japan? Somebody reading ``Shogun?''
</P>
<P>
   The production needed an Al Trautwig, of the MSG Network, or a
Matt Laughlin, of Fox Sports New York, to patrol the Tokyo Dome to
speak to some of the clearly ecstatic fans who were enthralled with
the first of the two-game series. And viewers should have been
treated to more video clips of former major leaguers who spent
quality time in the Japanese leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The game needed an expert on Japanese baseball, like a Robert
Whiting, the author of the authoritative book, ``You Gotta Have
Wa,'' to explain the hold baseball has on Japanese fans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we got some graphics about former major leaguers like
Randy Bass and their success in Japan, and information about the
cost of a platter of sushi at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net should have given us a show to reward those of us
who cut into their sleep to catch opening day. Fortunately, I fell
asleep four times (the third time, Hampton walked in a Cub run)
waiting for something historic to happen. Hearing ``Twist and
Shout'' on the Tokyo Dome loudspeaker system just did not measure
up.

MATH SOFTWARE FOR BLIND AND DISABLED STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Md.)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless you are like the character played by Matt Damon in ``Good
Will Hunting,'' solving complex mathematical equations is no walk
in the park. But for those with visual or physical impairments,
doing advanced math is even more daunting because of the difficulty
of converting Braille or the spoken word into equations on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is more help for such students. Programs developed by
Henry Gray, a professor of statistics and mathematics at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, have taken a step beyond other
software that aids the disabled because they can accept and read
back mathematical symbols and commands. The programs are intended
to give disabled students greater access to a high-level math
education.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's software works in combination with other programs to
translate mathematical voice commands into corresponding
expressions on the computer and to help perform the computations.
The solutions can be printed out with a voice command as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gray's programs, called MathTalk for the Visually
Impaired, is still being tested. It is designed for high school and
college students and works in combination with Dragon Dictate,
speech-recognition software from Dragon Systems; Scientific
Notebook, a computational program by MacKichan Software; JAWS, a
screen reader from Henter-Joyce; and a Nemeth converter program,
shareware that converts conventional math symbols into Nemeth
Braille, the standard code for math and science notation used in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Physically impaired students who cannot type can do high school
and college math by using another of Gray's programs, called
MathTalk Scientific Notebook. It lets a student dictate math
assignments or information, line by line, into a computer
microphone, just as someone would dictate a letter with a dictation
program. If the wrong word or symbol is recorded, the student can
say ``erase'' or ``wrong word'' to have MathTalk Scientific
Notebook make a correction. The program can handle about 3,000
mathematical commands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the high school and college-level programs, Gray
has designed an elementary school version of MathTalk Scientific
Notebook that could help physically handicapped children. The
software, called ArithmeticTalk ($395), lets students speak
commands like ``put down a seven and carry a one'' to direct the
solving of multiplication, division, subtraction and addition
problems on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   To use MathTalk for the Visually Impaired, a student must have a
sighted person type in the math material or dictate it into the
computer microphone. Then the student can get a printout in Nemeth
Braille. The student can do math problems in Nemeth Braille and can
produce a conventional copy for the teacher without the help of a
sighted reader.
</P>
<P>
   The program helps students who cannot see well, or at all, but
who want to move beyond high school math, said Jason Balusek, a
graduate student at Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches,
Texas, who is testing the program.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Balusek had help from a sighted teacher who
translated math equations from Nemeth Braille into print for
teachers, and from print into Nemeth Braille for students. Now
Balusek is studying for a master's degree and must handle more
complicated math and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   When he uses MathTalk for the Visually Impaired, Balusek can
dictate his results into a computer microphone so the computer
program can convert the work into a printed copy with standard math
notation for his professors. And a copy in Nemeth Braille can be
printed out on his embossing printer.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said his program was the first to allow blind students to
print copies for their professors with all the standard math
notation, in addition to Nemeth Braille hard copies for themselves.
After printing a copy in Nemeth Braille, the student can check for
any translation errors by listening as the problems are read back
by the computer program.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he did not know of any colleges that taught Nemeth
Braille so the program also helped the students by teaching them
unfamiliar Nemeth symbols. ``This reinforces the Nemeth they know,
and helps teach them what they don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another program from Gray, MathBraille Talk, allows sighted
teachers to dictate problems into a computer and have them
translated into Nemeth Braille code, which can be printed on an
embossing printer. But unlike MathTalk for the Visually Impaired,
MathBraille Talk does not allow a student to dictate work done in
Nemeth Braille into the computer so it can be printed in
conventional form for a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a need for this kind of software,'' said Richard Ring,
supervisor of the International Braille and Technology Center for
the Blind, a division of the National Federation of the Blind in
Baltimore. ``There aren't as many people in the sciences in general
because of the difficulty in representing math in Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs developed by Gray are distributed by Metroplex Voice
Computing of Arlington, Texas; the e-mail address is
mathtalk(at)onramp.net. MathBraille Talk and MathTalk Scientific
Notebook each cost $395 per copy. MathTalk for the Visually
Impaired will be available in a few months and will cost $300 to
$500, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Balusek, the student in Texas, said he hoped that other people
with visual problems would be able to use the math software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there aren't many blind college math majors,''
Balusek said. ``I'm hoping it will encourage more people to think
about doing this.''

 GETTING VIDEO ONTO THE iMAC  
 (Circuits)  
 (Eds: Question may be italicized)

<P>
   Q. Is there some way of transforming old home videotapes into
the digital video format so that they could be edited using the
iMovie software on the new iMacs? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While the new iMacs are designed for easy video transfer
between digital camcorder and computer with a FireWire cable, older
analog video formats like VHS must be converted to the digital
video format for use with iMovie, the iMac's video-editing program.
A Web search can point you to companies that handle video transfers
between formats, but there are other options if you would like to
do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   If you already own (or can rent or borrow) a digital camcorder,
you should be able to dub your existing videocassettes directly to
the camcorder to make a digital copy. To do this, you will need a
set of standard video patch cables (usually available from
electronics stores for less than $10) to connect the video output
ports on the back of your VCR to the video input ports on the
digital camcorder. Press Record on the camcorder and Play on the
VCR to dub the video. Once you have the footage copied onto the
camcorder, connect it to the iMac's FireWire port and import the
video.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a digital camcorder, you may want to invest in
an analog-to-digital video converter, which can convert the data
and send it right into your iMac. A converter box can also transfer
digital video back to analog if you would like to give
videocassettes of your opus to others. Apple's Web site says the
Sony DVMC-DA1 Media Converter ($499) is compatible with the iMovie
software. &QL;

MAYOR'S LOSES FURTHER GROUND IN BLACK COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost two weeks after an undercover detective shot
Patrick Dorismond in a botched drug sting _ the fourth unarmed
black man to be shot by New York police in 13 months _ Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani is suffering greatly for his failure to form
any links to his city's massive black community.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his first term as mayor, Giuliani was never very popular
with black New Yorkers. He was a Republican where 90 percent of the
city's blacks vote Democrat, and he had defeated David Dinkins, the
city's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But early on, Giuliani at least met with them. A small circle of
black officials and clergy supported and advised him. He went to
town meetings in black neighborhoods, and listened to residents.
</P>
<P>
   When a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima was tortured by
police officers in a Brooklyn stationhouse, Giuliani rushed to his
bedside, met with his family, condemned the torturer, and called
for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The night he won his reelection, 2 1/2 years ago, he promised to
reach out more to minority communities. ``We have to do a better
job to include all of you,'' he said. ``If we haven't, I apologize,
I'm sorry. It's my personal commitment, we will try endlessly and
tirelessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Floyd Flake of the Allen AME Church in Queens, a former
congressman and one of the most powerful black ministers in New
York, remembers that victory speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It filled me with a lot of hope,'' he said. Flake had long
been a big Giuliani supporter. When The New York Times asked
Giuliani to name some black allies, he cited Flake first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But something happened between his first and second term,''
Flake said. ``What happened in his dealings with the black
community is, nothing happened. He failed to follow up on his
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his second term, Giuliani has had almost no contact
with the black community, even though African-Americans make up
over a quarter of his city's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani wrote off the black vote long ago,'' said Fred
Siegel, professor of urban affairs at the Cooper Union for Art and
Science, who is generally a supporter of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are returning this neglect _ many term it disrespect _ in
kind.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last month showed just 8 percent of blacks here have a
favorable view of the mayor. Only 4 percent say they will vote for
Giuliani in the upcoming US Senate election, while 90 percent plan
to vote for his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 mayoral election, by contrast, Giuliani attracted 20
percent of the city's black vote, a huge figure for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens _
black and white _ are wondering where Giuliani went wrong, why he
has chosen to ignore such a huge segment of his own city.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment in his second term when he started paying
attention again. A little over a year ago, after a West African
immigrant named Amadou Diallo was killed by four policemen as he
stood in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx,
Giuliani met with some black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan borough president C. Virginia Fields and state
comptroller Carl McCall had sought meetings with the mayor for over
a year, ever since that election-night pledge. Giuliani had always
put them off, until Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   Flake also met with the mayor, though it was far from the first
time. ``I tried to get him to realize,'' Flake recalled, ``that
this was not an Al Sharpton thing, that there was a good deal of
fear on the part of middle-class African-Americans like myself, who
were afraid of their sons being stopped by gangs of police officers
more than by street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested that he make a statement,'' Flake said, ``to give
a sense of comfort that he is the mayor of all the citizens. He
nodded. But that didn't happen. He went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake added, ``That was the last time I talked with the mayor.
He hasn't called me since.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said she met with Giuliani three times just after the
Diallo shooting. At the first session, she recalled, ``He
acknowledged that he should have met with me prior to that, and
said we would meet as needed on a more frequent basis.'' But, she
added, ``There has been no follow-up, no more meetings, since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, set up
two meetings between Giuliani and some black teenagers. ``There was
very good interaction,'' Walcott recalled. But, again, after that,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's press office did not respond to requests last week
for an interview on the subject of race.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his supporters conceded he has a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel contends Giuliani has reasons for his withdrawal. ``It's
a two-way street,'' he said. ``Giuliani reached out early, and he
kept getting hit over the head, so he quit doing it. He's not a
politician in the conventional sense. He doesn't `empathize.' He
doesn't like taking crap from people _ not just black people, any
people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Siegel acknowledged, ``He made a mistake in breaking
off relations. A mayor needs to build ties to all groups in a city.
Now he doesn't have anybody to reach out to, and that's not just
bad politics, it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral march for Dorismond on Saturday, a riot briefly
broke out, with 23 police officers wounded by bricks and flying
glass. A fear is stirring that race relations in this city may get
ugly again.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's stance on racial issues dates back to the start of
his mayoralty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   New York politics, over the previous two decades, had
deteriorated to a point where the loudest, most radical leaders of
each ethnic group demanded special treatment and usually got it.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani ended this culture, calling for a policy of ``one city,
one standard,'' and most New Yorkers, including many blacks,
welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   However, many think he took this policy beyond neutrality, into
neglect and alienation. Fields noted there are only two
high-ranking black officials in the Giuliani administration. While
the mayor shrugs this off as resulting from the absence of racial
quotas, many blacks see it as meaning ``their community has been
left out of the running of the city,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani repeatedly cites statistics showing that New York's
police are less trigger-happy than those of other large cities, and
that they are getting less and less so. Last year, 11 citizens here
were killed in 71 police shootings. By comparison, in 1993, 23 were
killed in 215 shootings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the outrage over Dorismond's death is over not so much
the shooting _ which is under investigation by the Manhattan
district attorney _ as the mayor's reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was standing on a midtown street corner after midnight
when an undercover detective, doing a ``buy-and-bust'' drug-sting
operation, approached him for some ``smokes.'' Dorismond _ who, as
a security guard for the 34th Street Business Improvement District,
worked all day clearing the streets of criminals _ got angry at the
affront. A fight broke out. Back-up officers ran to the scene. One
of them shot Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   The real storm broke when Giuliani released Dorismond's
rap-sheet, to show that the victim was, as he put it, ``not an
altar boy.'' The material included an alleged offense committed
when Dorismond was 13 _ a record that the juvenile court had
ordered sealed. His adult arrests were for minor infractions,
pleaded down to ``disorderly conduct,'' but the mayor falsely said
they were for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani came under attack, he justified opening the sealed
record, saying a person's right to privacy ends with his death. He
also refused to meet with Dorismond's grieving mother, saying that
doing so would suggest the police officer was to blame for the
shooting.

AN UPDATE FOR THE INNARDS OF THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MAURA KELLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the reason the Web, as
we know it today, works. It is the standard for communication among
Web servers that enables Web browsers to call up pages when users
type in URLs or click on hyperlinks.
</P>
<P>
   But HTTP is getting a bit long in the tooth. It was created to
control the transfer of Web documents constructed with Hypertext
Markup Language, or HTML, the Web's current standard programming
language, so it cannot get the most out of HTML's younger, more
versatile cousin, eXtensible Markup Language, or XML.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new protocol, nicknamed Blocks, has been written with the
idea of wringing as much as possible out of XML, and it would add
another dimension to Web searches as well.
</P>
<P>
   While HTML labels the pieces of a Web page with generic tags,
XML labels pieces with tags that are customized to describe the
information itself. That allows the data to be used in many more
ways after it is downloaded. Many people in the industry believe
that XML will become the major formatting language for all
business-to-business electronic commerce, used alone or in
combination with HTML to create Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   XML labels could, for example, mark a piece of downloaded
information as a 1999 budget figure, and that would allow the
company receiving the information to plug it into the correct spot
in a spreadsheet or database right away. That kind of information
about information is called metadata. An HTML tag would say only
how to display that piece of downloaded information on the screen,
not what it was.
</P>
<P>
   XML's metadata capabilities are not fully exploited by HTTP, but
they would be with the Blocks protocol, or BXXP. That is short for
the Blocks eXtensible eXchange Protocol, which is designed to
transfer blocks of data from one computer network to another.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol, developed by Invisible Worlds, makes a different
sort of data exchange possible. Invisible Worlds is a new company
with many of the Net's royalty on its boards, including Dr. Paul
Mockapetris, who invented the Internet system for naming domains;
Tim O'Reilly, president of O'Reilly &AMP; Associates, a publisher of
books about Internet technologies; and Paul Vixie, a Metromedia
Fiber Networks senior vice president who is best known as the
creator of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain).
</P>
<P>
   The Blocks protocol is meant not to replace HTTP but simply to
enhance it. It is likely to make the Web more user-friendly by
allowing a faster, smoother exchange of XML documents.
</P>
<P>
   Malamud's company presented the new protocol on Tuesday to the
Internet Engineering Task Force at an informal session at its
meeting this week in Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   While a stamp of approval from the task force, an open
international group of Internet experts, does not carry the weight
of a governmental edict, the group is widely respected by
information technology professionals. The task force defines online
standards, approving protocols it finds to be stable, competently
designed and useful.
</P>
<P>
   So the presentation to the task force is the first step toward
getting an imprimatur of approval for Blocks as an Internet
standard, something that the majority of Web users would be able to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible Worlds would make money on the venture by working with
other companies to prepare them to handle the protocol. ``We are
the folks who have to build and maintain a digital Hoover Dam, if
you will,'' Malamud said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make sites act something like databases. For
instance, changing a single digit in one cell of an Excel
spreadsheet changes the sums or products in other cells. Similarly,
with the Blocks protocol, changing one piece of information
anywhere on the Web could have a ripple effect, changing related
information all over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it might work. Let's say you are searching for a
newspaper article about a hypothetical Internet company called
Hypocomp.com on a site that offers a searchable archive of
newspaper and magazine articles. You find the article and then
decide you want to see how Hypocomp.com is trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Under HTTP, you would have to leave the first site, connect to
the stock exchange site and search there for Hypocomp.com. But the
Blocks protocol could be set up so the current stock price of a
company would be displayed when that company's name came up in
search results. In effect, it would make possible an automatically
generated hyperlink.
</P>
<P>
   The new protocol would make that sort of interaction between
sites possible and could make searches easier.
</P>
<P>
   It relies on three software applications developed by Invisible
Worlds: mixers, which search for text and data; space servers,
which receive information from mixers, compare the pieces of
information and share them with other servers to generate
hyperlinks; and builders, which assemble information for display.
</P>
<P>
   BXXP, like HTTP, would operate behind the scenes, invisible to
the Web surfer, but its dynamic links would make the Web ``seem
more coordinated and useful,'' said Mockapetris, a member of the
Invisible Worlds protocol advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Others outside the company are also interested in the protocol.
``I think there has been enough interest in Blocks and similar
topics so that I would not be surprised if this did become a
working group,'' said Steve Coya, executive director of the
Internet Engineering Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion and study by a working group would be a first step
toward becoming a standard Internet protocol, Coya said, but no
guarantee. Nevertheless, he said, ``the objective of a working
group is to produce something for use by the Internet community.''
</P>
<P>
   Invisible Worlds is viewed as having a competitive edge because
it has so many academics and Internet pioneers on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offhand, I don't know of anything else like Blocks,'' said
Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard's Berkman Center
for Internet and Society, who said it was highly likely that Blocks
would eventually be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Blocks different is not necessarily its technical
aspects but the way in which you have a venture-backed dot-com
integrated with the academics and researchers who comprise the
Internet engineering community _ people who gave us the
fundamentals of the Net _ on board.''

   WASHINGTON _ The recollection of 21-year-old Gayla Tyler's
unsolved murder on Easter Sunday 1985 still makes her mother cry.
All Catherine Tyler knows is that her daughter was shot four times
in a Boston apartment, and for all these years, she has been pretty
helpless in waging a one-woman war against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain is almost indescribable, to tell the truth,'' said
Tyler, a retiree and grandmother who works with a program that aids
parents of murder victims. ``And it can happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And anywhere. At Columbine High School. At an elementary school
near Flint, Mich. At a day camp in Granada Hills, Calif. Donna
Dees-Thomases was so shaken last August by the televised images of
those little children, hand in hand, being led from the Jewish
Community Center where a gunman with a semiautomatic weapon shot
and wounded five people, including four youngsters, that she
hatched the idea for a Million Mom March for gun control on
Mother's Day in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Million Mom March is to send Congress the
message that women stand together for stronger national gun-control
laws, Dees-Thomases said. Fashioned after the 1995 Million Man
March that bonded black men, the Million Mom March is expected to
be the nation's first large-scale demonstration against guns.
Specifically, the marchers will demand the licensing of handgun
owners and registration of handguns, tougher background checks and
``cooling off'' periods prior to handgun purchases, mandatory
childproof safety locks on handguns, and limiting buyers to one
handgun purchase a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases, a Short Hills, N.J., mother of two girls, admits
it took shootings in ``safe'' middle-class suburbs to jar mothers
into joining forces with city women like Catherine Tyler, who long
have agonized over gun violence. Awakened and worried, women are
registering for the march via a Web site _
www.millionmommarch.com)_ at the rate of two per minute,
Dees-Thomases said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost been too easy,'' said Dees-Thomases, a part-time
publicist for David Letterman who started her crusade by calling
friends and now has coordinators in every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are terrified and frustrated. We see security guards
in our schools and every day read another story about some child
bringing a gun to school,'' Dees-Thomases said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real beef is with Congress,'' continued Dees-Thomases, who
said the march will turn from a rally to a protest if the Capitol
Hill stalemate over gun control hasn't ended by Mother's Day, May
14. ``Tom DeLay, the majority whip, beats his chest and says the
House is `pro-gun.' That's obscene. We thought it belonged to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been stalled for eight months over gun control. The
Senate's version of a juvenile-justice bill has a requirement for
gun safety locks, but the House version does not. After the Feb. 29
shooting of 6-year-old Kayla Rolland in Michigan, allegedly by one
of her first-grade classmates, President Clinton lobbied Congress
to break the logjam. But besides a war of words between the
president and the National Rifle Association, nothing has happened,
leading gun-control advocates to believe lawmakers won't act this
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say Republicans, who tend to favor owner rights over
gun control, could be vulnerable on the issue, particularly because
of what Andrew Kohut at the Pew Research Center calls ``a whopping
gender gap'' over gun control and a growing fear among suburban
voters that gun violence is too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   In a Pew poll last year, respondents were asked what was more
important: protecting the right of Americans to own guns or
controlling gun ownership. Men were split evenly in their answers,
while 75 percent of the women polled said it was more important to
control guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women put a much higher priority on gun control as an issue,
and they are stronger backers of all kinds of gun-control
measures,'' Kohut said. ``It is as simple as this: Men have a
greater affinity for guns, and they use them more than women. Women
are concerned about the consequences of too many guns in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the Million Mom March is mainly grass roots.
While it is getting financial support from national groups, some
gun-control advocates in Washington fear the march may divert
attention and resources from their goal, which is defeating
gun-rights lawmakers in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that the march is going to change the
landscape overnight,'' said a gun-control advocate who asked not to
be identified. ``It can't and won't do that, and when it doesn't,
it will put a tougher burden on those of us who work the issue
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, the pro-gun lobby, is keeping an unusually low profile
about the rally, perhaps so it won't be singled out as the villain
or put in the ``time out chair'' on the Web site of the Million Mom
March. Clinton gets the group's ``Apple Pie Award'' for his
proposal to license gun owners. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Senate
candidate in New York, has agreed to take part in the march.
</P>
<P>
   But a rival group of women, the Second Amendment Sisters, has
formed in cyberspace _ www.sas-aim.org _ challenging the Million
Mom group over the right to bear arms and countering with its own
Armed Informed Mothers' March on the Washington Mall on Mother's
Day. Since January, 22,000 people have signed its petition urging
Congress to oppose new gun control measures, said Juli Bednarzyk of
Plainfield, Ill., one of the group's founders.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Collins, who held off her abusive former husband with a
12-gauge shotgun until the police arrived at her Aurora, Colo.,
home, said guns save the lives of women and children. ``Mothers are
best able to protect their children by educating them about firearm
safety and being educated themselves about handling a firearm,''
said Collins, who has been invited to talk about guns and
self-defense at the AIM March.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling female forces are energetically spreading the word.
Bednarzyk is distributing literature about the AIM March at gun
shows and to gun-owner groups. Melinda Lee, of Longmeadow, home to
some executives of Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest handgun
maker, is publicizing the Million Mom March through local schools,
churches, and a community forum on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that shooting in Michigan, I had had it,'' said Lee, who
is taking her husband and two children along on her Washington
trip. ``It was the wake-up call that said, `You can't sit around in
your safe little suburban town anymore.' ''

BATTLING LITTLE MONSTERS IN THE SCHOOLYARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're still looking for that special place to let your inner
child run free, better keep her away from the playground in Sissy
Fight 2000 _ she's very likely to get roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   Sissy Fight is the brainchild of editors at Word, an online
magazine. Since the free game's official debut in late February, it
has developed something of a cult following of players attracted to
its deceptively simple premise.
</P>
<P>
   Players simply go to www.sissyfight.com or click a link found on
the Word site (www.word.com). Sissy Fight 2000, a Web-based,
multiplayer free-for-all, is a game not for children but for adults
in the mood for a little whimsical regression, often in the form of
marauding parochial-school girls going by names like Big Patty, Sky
Witch and PMS Angel. Be warned, though: Many players assume
character names that are not suitable for printing in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Players need a fairly speedy Internet connection (anything
slower than a 56K modem is excruciating) and a Web browser that can
handle the Shockwave plug-in from Macromedia.
</P>
<P>
   After you are whisked inside to create a little warrior princess
from a selection of hairstyles, dress colors and skin tones, you
give your girl a name and choose a password.
</P>
<P>
   The rules posted can call up unfortunate flashbacks, depending
on your childhood experience: ``Three to six girls can play in a
game. Everyone starts out with 10 Self-Esteem points. When other
girls humiliate and abuse you, you get really embarrassed and lose
your self-esteem. If your Self-Esteem goes down to zero, you
become, like, totally mortified and a loser and have to sit out for
the rest of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A built-in chat feature adds an interactive touch. Players
logged on from all over the world can gang up on other girls and
claim the teeter-totter. No one is completely safe _ girls you're
merrily chatting with may turn on you suddenly. Think of a Sissy
Fight game as a virtual community theater re-enactment of ``Lord of
the Flies'' _ with pigtails and knee socks.
</P>
<P>
   Sissy Fight 2000 probably won't appeal to those who like
fast-paced shooting action or buxom Lara Croft-type characters. As
a study in social dynamics and cultural anthropology, though, Sissy
Fight can be fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   It can also provide a cheap vicarious thrill after a bad day at
work, and the basic attacks (scratching, grabbing and teasing) and
defensive moves (cowering and tattling) make one realize that
office politics have not evolved very far from playground
squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   The game was developed in less than a year by several staff
members at Word, including Marisa Bowe, the magazine's founding
editor in chief; Eric Zimmerman, the game's designer; and Tomas
Clark, an associate editor who coordinated the production and
assisted with the Sissy Fight design. Bowe said the creative team
had wanted to make a game that would force people to interact with
one another online.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting the insular world of the role-playing-game subculture
to a broader audience was also one of the goals. ``Could you apply
other types of humor and style to it to make it attractive and
appealing to a much broader audience?'' Bowe recalled wondering. In
Sissy Fight, evil ogres and fire-snorting dragons have been
supplanted by the taunting of Big Patty and PMS Angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who would never normally take on those roles in a
literal-minded way are really happy to take on this absurd role of
a little girl and march in there and take people down,'' Bowe
observed. ``They're very enthusiastic about that because it's sort
of ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively simple game,'' Zimmerman said, ``but I think
what makes it so satisfying to play is that it's an understandable
strategic system that's embedded within the social system that the
game creates. That adds a whole different kind of unpredictability.
We're not simulating a military conflict here. We're simulating a
social conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no gloriously realistic 3-D character renderings in
Sissy Fight 2000. The animation is purposely somewhere between
Frogger and early Nintendo. The little girl avatars were partly
inspired by the works of the folk artist Henry Darger, Bowe said.
</P>
<P>
   The game's creators said more than 17,000 people had signed up
to play since Sissy Fight went online last month. There always seem
to be at least 75 players on the Web site's counter on any given
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sissy Fight creators are still refining the game and hope to
build up the virtual community aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in Doom and Quake, people have spontaneously formed
these clans,'' Bowe said, ``and that's what we're going to
encourage in our own game with stuff that we're going to develop.
She added that Sissy Fight clans would probably be called cliques,
for obvious reasons.

BUSH'S RECORD? LOOK AT TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week was a scary peek into a George W. Bush White House. In
Pasadena, Texas, a man came to a Wednesday night church service to
ask an 18-year-old woman to be his girlfriend. The woman refused.
The man stomped out of the church. He returned with a semiautomatic
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   He shot the woman, her mother, the pastor, and another man. The
assailant then killed himself in the church parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Texas church shooting in six months. In
September, also on a Wednesday night, a man went to a Baptist
church in Fort Worth that was filled for a concert with hundreds of
teenagers. Using two handguns, the man killed seven people, wounded
seven more (paralyzing one), then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response to the September massacre read like a cold fax
from the National Rifle Association. The Fort Worth killer had
purchased his guns legally at a flea market, even though he did not
have a license to carry concealed weapons. An unmoved Bush said,
``I personally do not believe that registering every handgun in
America is going to make America a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   The two church shootings, in so short a span, may be more than a
coincidence in a state where guns are communion wine. Forget Bush's
appeals to suburban white women by saying he would entertain gun
modifications such as safety locks. Forget his momentary distance
from the NRA's attack on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There are no modifications in Bush's support of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was elected governor of Texas pledging to make concealed
handguns legal in Texas. When he signed the bill in 1995, he said
concealed handguns ``will make Texas safer.'' Last summer, he
signed a bill that attempts to stop Texas cities from suing gun
manufacturers. Bush aides called the lawsuits ``frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence points to a more dangerous Texas. From 1996 to
1998, according to the Violence Policy Center, a gun violence think
tank, concealed handgun license holders in Texas were arrested for
2,080 crimes, including 15 charges of murder and attempted murder,
103 charges of assault with a deadly weapon, 442 charges of drunk
driving, 100 charges of indecent sexual conduct, and 140
drug-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly frivolous. Bush has blamed church and school
shootings on a ``wave of evil'' that can be solved with ``hopes and
prayers'' for more ``love in society.'' It would never occur to a
Bush White House how a wave of evil can become a terrible tsunami
with a semiautomatic handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is probably hoping and praying that people missed the news
on the health front. The Centers for Disease Control last week
released a new national survey that found Texas to lead the nation
in the percentage of people who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of uninsured Texans, 24 percent, was double the
US average. The percentage of uninsured Latinos was 45 percent,
also double the national average, and significantly more than the
other six states where Latinos make up more than 10 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   This comes a year after another report by the nonpartisan Urban
Institute found Texas lagging way behind the rest of the country in
health insurance. The report found that 50 percent of low-income
families had no health insurance compared to 37 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, one of the few positive categories that Texas was a
leader in was prayer. Low-income families report more engagement in
religious activities than the national average. But while the
people of Texas pray, Bush has yet to make any sweeping proposals
on how the poor will get health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally last week, the Texas comptroller announced that condoms
will be among the over-the-counter health items that will be
exempted from the state sales tax, along with diapers, aspirin,
suntan oil, deodorants, cough drops, contact lens solutions, and
wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Bush to complain. Never mind that using condoms
probably saves more lives and saves more young lives from being
economically ruined than all of the over-the-counter products in
the drug store put together _ through preventing HIV transmission
and unwanted pregnancies. ``The governor never wanted condoms to be
exempt,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not fight the exemption for condoms, but for
him to single out condoms for political derision, given how much he
otherwise champions massive tax cuts for Americans, certainly
should make the prochoice crowd nervous as to what this man would
do with Supreme Court appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he should be president based on his record in Texas.
On violence, the uninsured, sexually transmitted diseases, and
pregnancy, his solutions are simple: hope, prayer, abstinence, and
concealed handguns. The federal government would be so concealed a
weapon, its power would never be used.
</P>
<P>
   We elect presidents to build dams against waves of evil. Bush
sounds as if he would pray peacefully in the White House, as a
tsunami of semiautomatic blood crashes onto the Rose Garden.

   DESTINY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Tim Parks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arcade, 249 pp., $24.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you are stuck sitting in a train next to a compulsive
talker. On and on she chatters to a companion, without so much as
coming up for air, thinking, of course, that she is the smartest of
conversationalists, the wittiest, the most profound. It's enough to
drive you mad.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Destiny,'' author Tim Parks describes such a scene, with
his protagonist as the bored bystander. ``I am impatient for
silence,'' he writes, adding that their chitchat makes it hard for
him to read. He goes on to complain about the predictability, the
banality, the pretentiousness of their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Parks could well be talking about himself. ``Destiny,'' his 10th
novel, is an irritating, untidy book. For 250 pages, Parks delivers
a run-on soliloquy about his protagonist's life, his family, his
work, his marriage _ until the reader too becomes impatient for
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destiny'' begins with a phone call that will change the life
of Chris Burton, one of Britain's top foreign correspondents. The
caller tells him that his schizophrenic son has committed suicide
in Italy, where the family lives. In London on an extended stay
with his wife, Burton immediately concludes that their 30-year
marriage is over. The rest of the book is an attempt to explain
why, in a stream-of-consciousness interior dialogue that rambles on
and on in Burton's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason,'' he tells himself, ``no reason at all for
you and your wife to go on living together now that your son is
dead.'' His wife, Mara, is a flirty Italian who turns her charm on
everyone except her husband and their adopted daughter. Estranged
from the daughter, she lavished attention on the biological son,
who has attacked her and sledgehammered her house.
</P>
<P>
   If the book is supposed to delve deeply into the complexities of
a mother's unconditional love for her son, it fails, for Mara
Burton is presented as a cardboard character, a flimsy construction
we don't really come to know. The same goes for the other
characters, who are filtered through Chris Burton's jaundiced eyes.
With subjects that should make the reader sympathetic _ teenage
suicide, the death of a long-term marriage _ the reader is instead
left feeling impatient.
</P>
<P>
   The Burton marriage may be endlessly fascinating to Chris
Burton, but not to the reader. Mara Burton is presented as the type
of woman who has cheated on her husband, doesn't see her daughter
or grandchildren, won't discuss their son's death with her husband;
who won't allow him in as she sits by his body in the morgue, who
makes all the funeral arrangements without consulting him, and then
goes to the service alone while he is sick in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Burton is no innocent victim here. He has betrayed his
wife on a number of occasions and has allowed the marriage to
deteriorate into a cold war. At late midlife, he is hoping to
resurrect his ``obsolete ambition'' by writing the definitive book
on Italy's former prime minister, a corrupt old gasbag who finally
grants him the interview he has been waiting for. But it's too
late. During the interview, Burton realizes the man is a hopeless
narcissist, a revisionist who has fooled himself into thinking he
is a simple, heroic man.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is an appropriate spot for the showdown of a dying
marriage, and in a memorable scene after Marco's funeral, Burton
finally unleashes years of hostility on his wife. Again, the
glimpse is interior, so that the reader gets only his now-familiar
side. And the cemetery tirade only serves to set up an
unsatisfactory denouement.
</P>
<P>
   If Chris Burton had been more interesting, more insightful,
displayed some backbone and a sense of humor, Parks might have
pulled off 250 pages of stream-of-consciousness wandering. But what
the reader ends up with is a mishmash of male menopause, Italian
politics, and complaints about England, Italy, and a nagging kidney

escape his tedious, egocentric parents.

<P>
   If you've read a lot about speech recognition software but
aren't a user yet, it's time to take a deep breath and start
talking to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't breathe on the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the many tips you'll begin to follow right after
installation. But first you need to figure out what program to get,
among the many available.
</P>
<P>
   People use speech recognition for a variety of reasons. They may
want to be more productive or to accommodate disabilities, or they
may be unable to type or to have secretaries type for them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, using speech recognition requires an
investment of both time and money _ money not just for the software
but, most probably, for more up-to-date hardware. If a computer is
more than a couple of years old, it may well need to be replaced by
a new one before dictation software can be used successfully. Even
a newer computer may need more RAM or a better sound card. And
picking out a software program and learning how to use it well
means an investment of time.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing among available software can be daunting. Dragon
Systems, which brought continuous speech dictation to the consumer
market in the spring of 1997, has nine products for general use,
from NaturallySpeaking Essentials at $60 to Professional at $695.
IBM and Lernout &AMP; Hauspie both have a handful of products for
general use; IBM's are priced up to $180, while Lernout &AMP; Hauspie's
are up to $150. A fourth competitor in the personal computer arena
is Philips Speech Processing, with FreeSpeech 2000 at $99. L&AMP;H's
plans to acquire Dragon promise to complicate things. These
companies also offer high-end products like legal and medical
editions and add-on vocabularies, as well as packages that include
handheld recorders.
</P>
<P>
   IBM seems to be taking care of other operating systems by
including speech recognition as part of OS/2, offering a
developers' kit for Linux and selling ViaVoice for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, MacSpeech, is working with Philips on a Mac
continuous-speech product (while offering a free program, ListenDo,
just for commands). Dragon has backed off its plans for a Mac
product, saying it is awaiting the Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   All these programs take dictation in continuous speech. This is
not really ``natural'' speech, no matter what the companies say in
their marketing pitches. But the well-enunciated speaking style is
a far cry from the halting word-pause-word speech that earlier
programs required as they wrote down things you didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Today's programs do write down what you say, with accuracy
levels reaching above 98 percent, with speeds as fast as you can
talk (clearly). That is not an off-the-shelf miracle, however. The
high levels are reached after you have trained the program on how
you speak and the program has, along the way, trained you on how
you ought to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The training is essential. You can't just go up to a computer,
start talking to it and expect to have your words accurately
transcribed into text. But the first session of training is shorter
than ever, 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial training, you will improve the program's
accuracy as you dictate, by correcting its mistakes in
transcription. Another way these programs improve in accuracy is by
analyzing existing documents for new words and for your syntax.
These three steps _ initial training, making corrections and
vocabulary analysis _ are common for NaturallySpeaking, IBM's
ViaVoice and L&AMP;H's Voice Xpress. Both Voice Xpress and FreeSpeech
sometimes balk at adding new words or phrases to the software
vocabulary when those words or phrases are introduced during the
correction process.
</P>
<P>
   Features vary within and between the product lines. The products
to buy for more than a dalliance with speech recognition have a
street price of $100 to $150 or so: IBM's ViaVoice Millennium
Professional or Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred version 4, or
L&AMP;H's Voice Xpress Professional version 4. Although FreeSpeech 2000
is a contender _ something that could not be said of its
predecessor, FreeSpeech 98 _ its sales are small compared with
those of the other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Which program is the most accurate? There is no way to answer
that question given the huge mix of variables involved in speech
recognition on the Windows platform, not least of which is the
human being with the microphone. As the initial ViaVoice training
script points out, ``No one ever says a word in exactly the same
way twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound cards and microphones vary; computers vary in speed,
memory and noise. Environmental factors come into play. ``All
things being equal'' is a state that cannot really be reached
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   That said, experienced users participating in Internet speech
recognition forums have found that ViaVoice Millennium and
NaturallySpeaking version 4 are both capable of accuracy rates
exceeding 98 percent. Voice Xpress trails a bit, but even saying
this seems somehow unfair _ and points up another difficulty in
making comparisons. The current version of Voice Xpress was
released last May, months before the others, and for all the
programs, accuracy has been improving with every release.
</P>
<P>
   New features are introduced with every release, too, often going
one-up on something another product already has. Just wait long
enough and the program you know best will adopt something you have
eyed with envy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, when NaturallySpeaking was released, Dragon Systems
highlighted its ``select and say'' feature, letting the user select
a word or phrase by saying it. It was later adopted by IBM and L&AMP;H,
although in fact, IBM had a rudimentary selection feature like this
in its earlier Simply Speaking Gold program.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon has polished this feature so well for its users that you
can select a block of text in a single voice command. For example,
you can select the two preceding sentences in this article by
saying ``select it was through command period.''
</P>
<P>
   Commands that help you edit as you go are one reason
NaturallySpeaking is popular. Say ``cap that'' to capitalize the
word you just spoke, for example, or ``correct that'' to teach the
speech engine a thing or two. Say ``insert after  &UR; are one reason''
 &LR; then say ``that'' to edit the first sentence of this paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   The program does have its limitations. Its dictation boilerplate
is limited to one line; thus, a four-line address that would be
``typed'' by simply saying, for example, ``full address macro'' is
not possible as a shortcut. Other than that, NaturallySpeaking is
an excellent choice for writers.
</P>
<P>
   Although offering a full range of editing commands,
NaturallySpeaking has less comprehensive computing commands than
its competitors. Yet you can't make your own commands unless you
buy the $695 can-do-just-about-anything Professional edition, sold
through resellers. IBM's ViaVoice, L&AMP;H's Voice Xpress and
FreeSpeech 2000 all allow you to make your own commands (though
they are not as robust as NaturallySpeaking Pro's macros).
</P>
<P>
   FreeSpeech 2000 offers many editing and computing commands. A
difference from other programs is that FreeSpeech has a distinct
dictation mode.
</P>
<P>
   L&AMP;H's Voice Xpress Pro has the tightest integration with
Microsoft Office, hardly a surprise given Microsoft's 7 percent
stake in L&AMP;H. And it carries the natural language concept the
farthest.
</P>
<P>
   With natural language commands, you carry out an action by
saying a command naturally, and not necessarily the way you said it
the last time. ``Open a new document'' works as well as ``create a
new file'' or ``create a document.'' The natural language concept
has not been applied throughout the computer interface, so you use
these commands in some applications but you use the stiff and
choppy command style in others: ``File menu.'' ``New.''
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, Voice Xpress goes NaturallySpeaking one better
on the ``select by saying'' feature. You can do this in any
application, while NaturallySpeaking has this trademark capability
in only a handful of applications. Philips' FreeSpeech also has
widespread ``select by saying.'' IBM's ViaVoice has this only in
its own text editor and in Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   Another Voice Xpress favorite is that you can quickly tell the
speech engine to ``hear'' just commands, or just dictation, or just
letters and numbers. FreeSpeech is somewhat similar in this regard.
NaturallySpeaking can be limited to understanding continuous
spelling (and numbers) only in its correction window. The IBM
program has a spelling mode but is slow to switch to it.
</P>
<P>
   Both the L&AMP;H and IBM products provide for out-of-the-box number
entry and commands for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. In other
words, you do not need to make a command or switch modes. Just say
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's ViaVoice does not provide the range of word-processing
commands that L&AMP;H's Voice Xpress and Dragon NaturallySpeaking do in
their basic text editors, but it offers broad voice control of the
computer (except on Windows NT because of limitations in that
operating system). For example, you can close an application
without first switching to it. You can move a window with a simple
command. You can open Web site favorites as you would a program; no
need to open the browser first. The What Can I Say? window is
unique among the speech recognition programs in being able to show
what is available to say in whatever program is active.
</P>
<P>
   With ViaVoice you can make multiline dictation boilerplate on
the fly. Select that four-line address, say ``create macro,'' and
supply a name. More elaborate boilerplate is also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature points toward the future. Say ``send an e-mail
to Charles Jones about Allied proposal.'' The e-mail program is not
even open, but ViaVoice will open a blank e-mail message, put
``Charles Jones'' in the recipient field, put ``Allied proposal''
in the subject field and position the cursor in the message field
ready for your dictation. All you have to do beforehand is specify
the e-mail program (among five, including Netscape Messenger and
Microsoft Outlook) and have it inhale the contents of your address
book.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse and the keyboard cannot do this. With natural language
commands and features of this sort, speech recognition is no longer
emulating those devices _ it is coming into its own as a way to
command the computer.

<P>
   The first time Debra Sartore saw her husband-to-be, Dean
Morrell, he was wearing a kilt and a cape. ``Dean had blond hair, a
beard and a ponytail,'' she said. ``And, as always, had a bare
chest. He looked like a gigolo type even though he was always very
polite when he spoke to the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, whose first meeting took place at a mutual friend's
party, exchanged only pleasantries that day. Their chance meeting
was brief since Sartore was there with another man. In the next
year, the relationship progressed from friendship to love and
culminated in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Debra and Dean Morrell's story sounds like a million other love
stories, with one big difference. The party, the mutual friend and
even Morrell's ponytail do not exist. All are part of a virtual
world called Ultima Online, a popular game played over the
Internet. But the friendship and love, as well as the marriage
earlier this month in Minnesota, were real.
</P>
<P>
   Morrell, a 36-year-old department manager at a store in
Evansville, Ind., was no stranger to romance that blossoms over the
Internet. In fact, when she first met Morrell through Ultima, she
was living with another man whom she had met online.
</P>
<P>
   But for Dean Morrell, a 39-year-old Navy veteran living in
Seabeck, Wash., near Seattle, who specialized in electronics,
online courting was a new experience. Although he had played online
games for more than a decade, Morrell had never considered dating
someone he had met online. His opinion changed as he played Ultima,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultima Online is a role-playing game set in medieval times.
Players _ there are more than 160,000 of them around the world _
pay a one-time fee of $20 for the game itself and then $10 a month
to play. Players take on the role of a character (or more than one)
who has a skill or profession and slay monsters, earn virtual money
from their trade and, in some cases, participate in online
marriages and adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Games like Ultima Online are high-drama worlds where people
become immersed in the details of the game and in interacting with
other players, said Billy Pidgeon, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a technology research firm in New York.
Participants in multiplayer online games average more than 22 hours
a week of playing time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many romances have occurred between online game
players, but the Morrells' experience is not unique. Another couple
who met playing Ultima Online were recently engaged: Kristine
Baron, a 28-year-old Chicago resident, is in Denmark spending time
with Jan Christensen, whom she met 17 months ago. A reciprocal trip
is planned for June.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than some other online games, Ultima has qualities
that make it ripe for offline romance, Pidgeon said. ``Ultima is a
very social and ethical world, so people tend to believe that who
they are online is similar to who they are offline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis, a psychologist and professor at Haverford College
who is researching the psychology of online gaming, said the
connection goes deeper. ``Ultima has this tremendous involvement
that gives players the feeling that they get an immediate glimpse
into who people are,'' he said. ``People quickly feel that they are
learning something important about each other as they play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That, indeed, was the Morrells' experience. ``You can put on a
face, but your true self always shines through online,'' said
Morrell, who was known as Flint in the game. He said he was
attracted to Sartore's intelligence and altruism. Sartore, known as
Tess to other players, said she fell in love with Morrell's
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always so helpful to other characters,'' she said. ``He
gives money or armor to poor characters. He is always willing to
stop and help anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The first impressions stuck with them, said the Morrells, and
then on Sept. 3, 1999, their relationship began to change from
virtual to real.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Sartore heard from an online friend that Morrell
was retiring from the Navy that month and was planning on leaving
the game. ``I hated to hear he was leaving,'' she said. ``Our
friend, Dennar, said, `Let's marry him off before he leaves the
game.' I thought it was a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sartore went online and sent a message to Morrell, telling him
she had something to ask him. ``I blurted out, `Will you marry me?'
and that's when it began,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrell said he thought Sartore was asking him to marry her, not
for their two characters to wed. ``I was so shocked and amazed,''
he said. ``I had always had feelings for Deb and her proposal hit
home. It was just what I wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The two spent nine hours talking online that night until the
game's server went down for maintenance. Over the next five days,
they spent countless hours online, talking and sharing aspects of
their lives that had previously remained outside the game. During
that time, Sartore's character moved into Morrell's online house.
``After I moved in, I started sharing all of his belongings,'' she
said. ``It felt like something we should do.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was also a pivotal element of their first face-to-face
meeting. Sartore planned to attend an Ultima Online players'
luncheon on Sept. 18 in Seattle, so she flew there nine days early
to get to know Morrell. Their meeting prompted them to continue
their relationship outside the virtual world, Morrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was getting serious from our online discussions,''
Morrell said, ``so our first meeting was so important. No matter
what, when you're dealing with a virtual person, you're building up
a fantasy in your mind. As soon as I saw Deb, I knew the fantasy
matched the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sartore flew home after the user's meeting, and the two
continued their correspondence, even agreeing to a marriage of
their characters online in a ceremony attended by a large group of
their online friends. Shortly after the October virtual wedding,
Morrell went online again and asked Sartore to marry him in real
life.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Morrell's brother flew Sartore and her 10-year-old
daughter to Cottage Grove, Minn., where Morrell had moved, as a
surprise for the holidays. During that week, they began planning
their wedding and searching for a house. The wedding, small and
private, took place in their new house on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Williams, a senior vice president at Gerard Klauer
Mattison &AMP; Co., a financial analysis and consumer research business
based in New York, said that although the Morrells' experience is
somewhat unusual, relationships initiated online will become
increasingly commonplace. ``The social nature of the games will
make friendships and relationships more prevalent,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Davis of Haverford said, the Morrells'
experience is not a new phenomenon. It mirrors thousands of other
relationships started in the virtual world of written
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times did someone fighting in World War I write home
to the girlfriend of a buddy that died and fall in love?'' Davis
said. ``There's something about a virtual meeting that's very
seductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more of the Morrells' online characters, Levi Strauss and
Sable, will marry online in April. Since many of Morrell's friends
or relatives didn't attend the two previous weddings, virtual and
real, many will be online for that ceremony.

THINK DIGGING A HOLE IS SIMPLE? THINK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier
if you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your
local utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to
the site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical
and drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting
into one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill
you. These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you need to dig an ordinary hole for, say, planting a large
shrub, the best tool to use is a pointed spade shovel. Make sure
the blade is free of dried dirt and clay lumps. To make it easier
for the shovel to bite into the soil, sharpen the blade edge with a
metal file.
</P>
<P>
   Digging holes for fence posts or footings requires a different
tool because the holes should be deep and cylindrical with sides
that are flared at the bottom. A clamshell digger (also called a
post hole digger) is a good tool for this type of work.
</P>
<P>
   The clamshell digger is essentially two shovels hinged together
at the top of the blades. It works like a combination shovel and
tongs. To use the tool, push the handles together, then plunge the
blades into the dirt. Spreading the handles will close the blades
so they grab a clump of dirt. Lift the digger out of the hole,
keeping the handles spread apart, then dump the load by bringing
the handles together.
</P>
<P>
   Clamshell diggers are difficult to use in deep holes because the
narrow width of the hole makes it awkward to spread the handles
apart. For deep holes, you may have to use a breaker bar to loosen
the soil and a small trenching shovel to scoop it out, or you can
switch to another digging tool.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a hand auger to excavate holes. Hand augers dig as
you push them into the soil while twisting the handle. The parallel
jaws loosen the soil and churn it up to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   These manual diggers are fine for digging one or two holes but
if you have to dig a log of holes, you might want to consider
renting a power auger to do the job. The power auger is essentially
a giant corkscrew that twists dirt to the surface as it bores into
the ground. This sounds easy, but these machines are heavy and can
generate a lot of torque. You must maintain a strong grip on the
handles or the auger can twist out of control. In addition, power
augers are heavy, so moving them into position can be hard on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Power augers are available in different diameters, from 6 to 12
inches, and lengths, and in one- or two-person models. They are
powered by gasoline engines.
</P>
<P>
   As the auger digs deeper into the ground, you must lift it
periodically so it can spin out the loosened dirt. This can be
tiring because the gasoline engine is heavy. If you are working
alone, you might consider renting a flexible shaft auger. This
model has a remote engine that sits apart on the ground. A flexible
shaft transmits the power from the engine to the auger.
</P>
<P>
   Two-person augers are easier to operate because there are four
hands gripping the handles and two people to lift and maneuver the
tool. Still, it is essential that both operators maintain a firm,
even hold on the handles at all times. This will ensure that the
final hole is straight and allow adequate control in case the auger
hits a hidden rock.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of holding on to a twisting power auger sounds a
little dangerous, one type of power auger is much easier to
control, although it takes time to set up. It is called a mobile
digger and can be operated by one person. The mobile digger is
mounted on a small trailer that must be towed to the job site. Then
it must be secured in place with heavy chains and ground spikes.
The auger is enclosed in a vertical housing. The operator raises
and lowers the auger bit into the ground by turning a steering
wheel. He has total control of the tool at all times.
</P>
<P>
   As with all power tools, it is essential that you understand how
power augers operate. Make sure the dealer at the rental store
explains all the features of the unit before you take it home. Do
not start the hole with the engine at full throttle. Instead, start
slowly and increase the speed as the auger digs deeper. When you
hit a large rock, stop digging and remove it with a breaker bar.
When operating augers, always wear proper safety gear, including
ear protectors, goggles, heavy-duty gloves and work boots.

   Greenwood is a mighty small Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   It's so small, it barely has two players for a domino game.
</P>
<P>
   It has the Greenwood Grocery, though, and a narrow country road
leading to thick cheeseburgers and home-baked meringue and fruit
pies that are stirring talk across four counties.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood, population 76, is in the ultimate North Texas middle
of nowhere. It's between Slidell and Rosston, near the Denton
County-Wise County line. Take Interstate 35 north to Sanger and
turn west, or take U.S. 287 north to Decatur and turn east. Look
for Texas 51 and then for Farm Road 1204.
</P>
<P>
   Cook-owner Virginia Mann and her husband, Carlton, both
Bridgeport school employees, took over the 60-year-old Greenwood
Grocery Jan. 1. They quickly beefed up breakfasts and lunches, and
word of the fresh-ground cheeseburgers spread quickly across area
farms and horse pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking runs in the family, Virginia Mann said proudly: ``I'm a
Pinkerton'' _ a Decatur grocery family known for homemade Pinkerton
Peanut Patties.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at the Denton County Courthouse told me about great
pies in Greenwood. On the Saturday when I finally found the town,
the Greenwood Grocery pies included chocolate meringue, coconut
meringue and buttermilk. Another recent Saturday offering included
pineapple cream.
</P>
<P>
   Weekday lunch specials include soft tacos and sandwiches.
Cheeseburgers and pie are great any day. The Greenwood Grocery is
open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays, until 6 p.m. Saturdays.
It's at 102 Main St. &QL;

MUSICAL TRIBUTE TO SELENA PROMISING BUT UNPOLISHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past year in the Metroplex, musical biographies have
immortalized Al Jolson, Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Buddy Holly
and Dinah Washington. The problem is that these musical bios
typically take a `` ... and-then-this-happened'' approach, loosely
stringing together the artist's greatest hits with bits of dialogue
in a straightforward chronology. The result is usually less than
the sum of its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Selena's turn _ and the creators of her stage
biography, opening this week in Dallas, are taking a slightly
different approach, combining elements of a revue with those of
traditional musical theater. As an ambitious hybrid, ``Selena
Forever'' earnestly tries to bring as much personality to the stage
as did the late Tejano superstar. The good news is that, given the
material seen at the world premiere in San Antonio last week and
the quality of the performances, it could achieve that _ and more.
The bad news is that it's not there yet. It could use a little more
workshopping and a lot more rehearsal, from the staging and
technical ends, before it makes its hoped-for run at Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Composer Fernando Rivas and playwright Edward Gallardo have
written 20 songs that tell the events of Selena's life and are
linked with several of her hits. Few, however, live up to Selena's
magic onstage. The mother, Marcela, has the best songs with
``Living on a Bus'' and ``To Him She's a Woman,'' beautifully sung
by Margo Reymundo. In fact, the most memorable numbers are
performed by everyone other than Selena: the brother, A.B. (Maxx)
sings ``You're Gonna Die Today, Brother'' and the sister, Suzette
(Liza Ybarra) does a lovely job with ``Amame, Quireme.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the voices of these performers are
stronger than that of Veronica Vazquez in the title role. Reymundo,
Maxx and David Casanova, who plays Selena's husband, Chris Perez,
all have powerful, textured voices. Vazquez's voice is pretty and
precise, but she simply doesn't match the magnitude of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Acting-wise, the performances are fine. Daniel Valdez, who plays
Selena's father, Abraham, is a better actor than singer and does a
nice job of conveying compassion and love for his family. However,
he also plays the part more sternly and crankily than did Edward
James Olmos in the movie about Selena's life. Maxx gets several
chances to overact and comes away being the comic relief, and
Reymundo's performance shows her pathos well. Eleven-year-old
Denise Gonzalez plays the young Selena and is perfectly charming.
</P>
<P>
   There's much that's promising, but there's also much work to do
to get the show where it enthralls the entire time. As it is, those
moments are few and far between, and technical problems experienced
opening night, mostly with sound, didn't help. As it is now,
``Selena Forever'' often feels like it lasts that long.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the bassist Edgar Meyer
and the violinist Mark O'Connor take the stage on Wednesday at
Avery Fisher Hall to play selections from their best-selling album,
``Appalachia Waltz,'' and its new sequel, ``Appalachian Journey,''
most eyes will be on Ma.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's celebrity, its meal ticket, he is a classical-music
superstar, perhaps the greatest string player of our time. But he's
not as remarkable a musician as his ensemble-mate on violin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Connor's unfinished trajectory, from largely self-taught
fiddle player to concert-hall virtuoso and classical composer, is
already one of the most spectacular, if underpublicized, journeys
in recent American music. A onetime prodigy, O'Connor, 38, spent
his teens and 20s moving through successive musical environments,
managing always to convey _ not through arrogance but through a
surfeit of talent _ that he was only passing through.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago he finally encountered a challenge big enough to
last him for the rest of his career: forging what he calls ``a new
American style,'' a musical vocabulary that makes full use of the
classical tradition without sacrificing the folk and jazz that
nourished him in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, who has known O'Connor since 1988, considers his friend's
technical command equal to that of any of today's classically
trained virtuosos. ``Mark is a supreme master at what he does,'' Ma
says. ``Between thought and execution there are no impediments,
zero. But what really interests me is that this is a person in
constant development, hungry to develop. The intriguing question
is, `Where is Mark O'Connor going?'''
</P>
<P>
   Here is where he has been.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor grew up in a rundown section of Seattle. His father was
an alcoholic, his mother a semi-invalid whose few indulgences
included a big collection of classical, jazz and folk LPs. Music
was the boy's escape. Picking up the violin at 12, he became the
terror of the fiddle-contest circuit, a natural who absorbed music
with astonishing ease, who remembers he could improve just by
thinking about playing.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 17, he won the country's most prestigious fiddling
contest in Weiser, Idaho; a few months later, he joined the jazz
mandolinist David Grisman's top-flight quintet _ as a guitarist. At
19, he was playing electric violin with the virtuoso jazz-rockers
the Dregs. He moved to Nashville at 23, and before he was 30 he was
the most celebrated musician in a city crawling with them, the
Country Music Association's Musician of the Year from 1990 through
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995 he had already molted again. Jaded by the endless
round of country-music record dates, he had begun investigating
classical composition at the beginning of the '90s. In 1993 he
presented his Fiddle Concerto (as he pointedly titled it, to assert
the compatibility of folk and classical music) with the Santa Fe
Symphony; he has since played the piece 150 times. His second
concerto, ``Fanfare for the Volunteer,'' had its premiere in 1996,
the same year as the release of ``Appalachia Waltz,'' a pleasant if
unchallenging collaboration whose sales of 190,000 copies made it a
classical smash hit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 came O'Connor's unaccompanied solo album, ``Midnight on
the Water'' (to which this writer contributed liner notes), its
core the fiendishly difficult ``Six Caprices,'' homages to Paganini
that are both pyrotechnic and emotionally resonant. ``The American
Seasons,'' a concerto for violin and chamber orchestra, was first
performed last month at the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Troy,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12 the violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and the
Chicago Symphony will help O'Connor introduce his Double Concerto
for Two Violins at the Ravinia Festival. The two violinists will
tour the piece with the Nashville Symphony, stopping at Carnegie
Hall on Sept. 25. On Sept. 8 in Stuttgart, Germany, O'Connor will
be the featured soloist in a new ``St. Matthew's Passion'' by the
composer Tan Dun, part of the commemoration of the 250th
anniversary of Bach's death.
</P>
<P>
   To offer an impromptu definition: fiddling simply means an
aural, i.e., folk-based, approach to the violin. There are
countless fiddling styles, from eastern European to eastern
Canadian. So-called Texas fiddling, which the young Mark O'Connor
learned at the feet of his only teacher, a sweet-tempered auto
mechanic and unsung musical hero named Benny Thomasson, is a
sophisticated, blues-tinged style with ample room for virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hallmarks of O'Connor's playing _ two-part
polyphony, a whiplike bowing arm, frequent use of open strings and
an emphasis on wringing inspired variations from a melodic phrase _
are a result of his apprenticeship in the Texas style.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas fiddling never claimed him wholly, O'Connor insists;
he called it merely a staging area, a foundation. At the same time
he was perfecting his version of the style, he was playing lead
guitar in his own Seattle fusion band; absorbing Menuhin, Gershwin
and Beethoven from his mother's records; traveling to Nashville to
appear on the Grand Ole Opry; and touring with the great jazz
violinist Stephane Grappelli.
</P>
<P>
   By the time O'Connor was 18, his playing owed as much to jazz,
blues, country and rock as to Texas fiddling. When he began his
immersion in classical music 10 years later, he broadened his
vocabulary still further (refining his vibrato, for instance).
Today, his playing is beyond category; he is ``an artist who has
crossed over so many boundaries,'' as John Henken recently wrote in
The Los Angeles Times, ``that his style is purely personal.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE)
</P>
<P>
   O'connor could have built a career as an itinerant solo fiddler,
plying his trade across America. That's what he did, in fact, when
he first quit session playing, and he still performs several dozen
solo shows a year. But having composed for solo violin and string
quartet, he was eager to tackle larger forms. There was also an
iconoclast's desire to prove lowly fiddling's adaptability to the
most hallowed of Western ensembles, the classical orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiddle music contains some of the most complex, sophisticated
things I've ever had to play,'' he says. ``Yet I've listened my
whole life to classical-music people scoff at the very idea of a
fiddler meeting a classical orchestra on an equal footing.'' So he
set out to disprove the scoffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fiddle Concerto'' is the orchestral work as autobiography,
its three movements reflecting O'Connor's own journey. As the piece
unfolds, solo fiddle and classical orchestra do an elaborate mating
dance: they're introduced, clash, nurse their wounds and finally,
via a jig _ a form shared by classical music and fiddling _ are
reconciled. O'Connor has solved his problem, uniting the two
supposedly hostile traditions (if a bit schematically _ jigs aren't
exactly vital currency in today's classical music).
</P>
<P>
   The second concerto, ``Fanfare for the Volunteer'' (commissioned
for Tennessee's bicentennial celebration), picks up where the first
left off: if the first sealed the union of classical music and
fiddling, the second celebrates it. The fiddler has absorbed a
degree of classical technique, the orchestra a measure of
O'Connor's richly melodic, folk-rooted sound.
</P>
<P>
   As a piece of writing, the second concerto is a big step beyond
the first. The earlier piece is a bit stiff, an apprenticeship in
orchestral composing, but the second cascades luxuriously, an
evocation of America's land, history and myth that invites
comparison to Copland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's next two orchestral pieces leave folk music behind
for a new challenge. ``I don't feel that anyone has effectively put
jazz'' _ the second musical language of his youth _ ``into an
orchestral work,'' he says. ``Gershwin and Bernstein tried, but
they don't convince me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Concerto for Two Violins'' hasn't been performed yet,
but ``The American Seasons'' was introduced memorably, on a chilly
night four weeks ago in Troy, by O'Connor and the Metamorphosen
Chamber Orchestra. A four-movement reflection on the stages of life
(hence the ``seasons'' of the title), it is a very different piece
from the first two concertos, with their largely consonant
harmonies. ``Seasons'' is bracingly dissonant. Angular and
bristling, it scuttles along, off center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its dissonance and density (at one point in the
final movement, violins, violas, cellos and O'Connor each play an
entirely different theme _ a very heady stew), ``Seasons'' is
wholly listenable, buoyed by its jazzy rhythms and by O'Connor's
unstoppable melodic gift.
</P>
<P>
   At the premiere, O'Connor came out to play a solo encore: a
medley of the two Texas fiddle tunes ``Midnight on the Water'' and
``Bonaparte's Retreat.'' ``Midnight on the Water'' is a beautiful
rubato song with a plaintive, insistent drone and a sad melody.
O'Connor accelerated into ``Bonaparte's Retreat,'' and kept
accelerating, until he was playing almost impossibly fast, so fast
that the simple, repeated melody became an abstract whir, a blur of
machine noise like a 747 taking off, and finally O'Connor thrust
his bow up and away from the strings, finished.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was on its feet. I'm certain that at least some of
the concertgoers were moved not merely by O'Connor's solo, as
exciting as it was, but by its having come on the heels of the
orchestral piece.
</P>
<P>
   They were moved by O'Connor's journey without maps, cheering for
the only musician today who can reach so deeply first into the
refined, then the vernacular, giving his listeners a complex,
sophisticated piece of early-21st-century classical music and then
knocking them dead with the brown-dirt whine of a Texas fiddle.

MORE BODIES FOUND NEAR CULT LEADER'S HOME

   RUGAZI, Uganda _ Another 53 bodies were discovered Wednesday
crammed into a small pit inside the house of a Ugandan cult leader.
A total of 81 bodies have been found in the pit in the past two
days, 48 of them children.
</P>
<P>
   With each day bringing some new horror in one of the largest
mass murders in recent history, the police said Wednesday night
that they believe they have found yet another mass grave at a
building about 50 miles south of here, in southwest Uganda.
Excavation will begin Thursday morning, the police said. But even
before that work begins, the death toll already stands at more than
600.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the home of an excommunicated Roman Catholic priest,
Dominic Kataribabo, investigators unearthed 74 bodies in the back
yard on Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, another 81 bodies were
found inside the indoor pit, covered over with concrete in one of
the stone house's 10 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The space for so many corpses was incredibly small: The pit,
lined with banana leaves, was just six-feet deep and four-feet
square, and the corpses were packed together in a dense,
interlocking heap.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 17, at least 654 bodies have been recovered in the
wreckage of a cult, Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, splintered off from the Roman Catholic church.
The cult demanded strict adherence to the Ten Commandments,
required members to sell their possessions and preached that the
world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The police originally suspected mass suicide by more than 300
followers found burned to death in a church in the town of Kanungu,
less than 50 miles from here. But since then, more bodies have been
found, a number with unmistakable signs of strangulation _ some by
rope or banana leaves, others by hand. Many bodies have shown no
sign of violence, leading some investigators to suspect mass
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The police are increasingly calling this an organized slaughter,
though they have not speculated publicly about how so many people
could have been killed or by how many executioners.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the house here Wednesday was particularly wrenching
because so many bodies of children were found. Workers with rubber
gloves pulled out the bodies one by one and placed them in a row on
the lawn for a quick examination by a police pathologist. Then they
were dragged to the rear of the compound to be buried in a long
trench with the 74 bodies found earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the police gave no details about the sight they
intend to search Thursday except to say that it is in the village
of Kabira, where they said cult members often stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   A Ugandan police spokesman, Mugenyi Assuman, said investigators
also expected to take soil samples from the various mass graves,
particularly the original site in Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what investigators would be testing for, Assuman would not
say exactly: ``Maybe poison,'' he said.

 &HT;    Despite shortcomings, Putin provides hope for nursing Russia to
health
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Very much in character for a former KGB spy, Vladimir
Putin managed to win the 11-man contest for Russia's presidency
without revealing a lot about his personality or program. That is
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   So too was the low road the state-run TV networks took in
promoting Putin's candidacy, mostly blacking out coverage of his
rivals and sinking to anti-Semitic slurs against one of them. The
election may have been reasonably fair; the campaign wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   These stains on Putin's election victory pale, however, beside
the issue that won him the favor of many Russians: the ruthless
military offensive he ordered in Chechnya. Never mind that many
civilians have been killed and a quarter-million of them uprooted
from their homes. From a typical Russian's viewpoint, it was
payback for terrorist bombs planted in Russian cities and a
breakaway uprising that a diminished Russia cannot countenance.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for all his shortcomings, Putin is a fact of life.
The United States must deal with him and the fumbling and fractious
nuclear-armed nation he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for him. He is sober, focused and fit, the antithesis
of Boris Yeltsin. To his credit, Putin seems serious about
establishing the rule of law, pushing for economic reform and
fighting graft.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, his KGB experience and the cronies he brings
with him into his administration strike most Russians as the right
antidote for Russia's rampaging corruption, which costs the country
an estimated $20 billion a year, about the size of its 1999 federal
budget. If stanching that hemorrhage is the KGB alumni's overriding
mission, good luck to them.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has yet to spell out his economic agenda, but he has made
it clear he plans to strengthen the courts, overhaul the tax system
and fight crime in order to improve Russia's business climate and
make it attractive to foreign investors. He is no Marxist-Leninist
throwback.
</P>
<P>
   True, he does believe in rebuilding Russia's armed forces,
having boosted its military budget as much as 50 percent. To put
that in perspective, though, the increased spending is still less
than 3 percent of the annual U.S. outlay for defense. And Russia's
military establishment has become so decrepit and disordered that
an overhaul could be a positive development, giving this fallen
power a feeling of stability and self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's relations with the West, especially the United States,
have deteriorated since the heady days following the Communist
collapse. Many there are disappointed with outside aid and advice,
just as the West is unhappy about how its help has been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Washington has to persevere in coaxing Moscow to minimize
the dangers of weapons of mass destruction, to remove impediments
to an effective economy and to find accommodations with its
rambunctious republics. These should be priorities if Putin means
to make good on his vow to raise Russia's standing in the world.

 &HT;    A nonsmoker again - one day at a time
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It started with just one. I was going to
smoke one _ just one _ just that one time, I swear. But that was
all a pipe dream, which is to say, that was all a lie. A
cigarette's not exactly a Lay's potato chip. Someone should tell
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It's pathetic, really. A week from today, I would have been
smoke-free for two years. Two years! I'd finally gotten myself to
the point where days, even weeks, could fly by without me so much
as thinking about a cigarette. When I finally broke down and told
my kid I'd been cheating, I felt as though I was in the second
grade kneeling inside the dimly lit confessional at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in Leetonia, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you mad at me?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said the 9-year-old, the same dear child who had
cheered me on with such pride in April of 1998. ``I have to say I
thought we'd moved past all that.'' A priest couldn't have said it
any better.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYONE ELSE WAS SMOKING
</P>
<P>
   I'm not really sure how it happened, except that I was in a room
far away with people I'd just met while traveling in Cuba. Everyone
was smoking. Nothing seemed real. So when I took that cigarette, it
was as though it wasn't even me. I lived somewhere else and wore
different clothes and ate different foods.
</P>
<P>
   Except it was me, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 18, 2000. Lighter, please.
</P>
<P>
   It was filterless. And strong. It made me nauseated and
lightheaded. At one point, I thought I was going to pass out.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I smoked an entire pack.
</P>
<P>
   I got back from my trip, gave them up, carried on. And then when
I got to feeling a little better, when all the disgusting side
effects had passed, I smoked again. And before I knew it, in no
time flat, smoking was driving my life again. I was thinking about
it all the time, always looking for a light, always waiting for
just enough time to pass so I could have another. It happened one
cigarette at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Over spring break, on a trip to visit my parents in Ohio, I
smoked outside in the freezing rain. The cigarettes made my head
throb and my stomach all queasy. Afterwards, I'd walk to the end of
the building, where the weather whipped around the corner, and I'd
stand, arms flapping, so the wind could blow away the awful stink.
Then I'd go inside, brush my teeth and spritz myself with my
mother's perfume. And so it went, off and on, on and off, like I
was 18 again, until I could actually smoke a cigarette without
wanting to throw up. I'm sure you can imagine my pride.
</P>
<P>
   WEARING THE PATCH AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   So, there you have it. My stupid, awful, predictable
predicament. Two weeks shy of what was supposed to be my big
good-for-you anniversary, I'm wearing the patch. I've written down
all the reasons I hate smoking. I'm chewing gum. I'm cranky. I'm
miserable. I want just one.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news is, it was all different this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Holding it, flicking it, smelling it, inhaling it. The stomach
pains. The headaches. The fibs. None of that seems like me anymore.
For the first time in my grown-up life, I feel more comfortable as
a nonsmoker. Not smoking finally feels like the real me. It's that
thread of fragile sanity that got me through yesterday. And the day
before that. I'll have to let you know about today.

   Greenwood is a mighty small Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   It's so small, it barely has two players for a domino game.
</P>
<P>
   It has the Greenwood Grocery, though, and a narrow country road
leading to thick cheeseburgers and home-baked meringue and fruit
pies that are stirring talk across four counties.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood, population 76, is in the ultimate North Texas middle
of nowhere. It's between Slidell and Rosston, near the Denton
County-Wise County line. Take Interstate 35 north to Sanger and
turn west, or take U.S. 287 north to Decatur and turn east. Look
for Texas 51 and then for Farm Road 1204.
</P>
<P>
   Cook-owner Virginia Mann and her husband, Carlton, both
Bridgeport school employees, took over the 60-year-old Greenwood
Grocery Jan. 1. They quickly beefed up breakfasts and lunches, and
word of the fresh-ground cheeseburgers spread quickly across area
farms and horse pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking runs in the family, Virginia Mann said proudly: ``I'm a
Pinkerton'' _ a Decatur grocery family known for homemade Pinkerton
Peanut Patties.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at the Denton County Courthouse told me about great
pies in Greenwood. On the Saturday when I finally found the town,
the Greenwood Grocery pies included chocolate meringue, coconut
meringue and buttermilk. Another recent Saturday offering included
pineapple cream.
</P>
<P>
   Weekday lunch specials include soft tacos and sandwiches.
Cheeseburgers and pie are great any day. The Greenwood Grocery is
open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays, until 6 p.m. Saturdays.
It's at 102 Main St. &QL;

<P>
   Woody Allen got it right nearly 30 years ago. In ``Play It
Again, Sam,'' the most memorable character is Dick Christie, a
workaholic who cannot let a minute pass without phoning the office
to report his location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be at 362-9296 for a while,'' Dick calls in to a
colleague. ``Then I'll be at 648-0024 for about 15 minutes. Then
I'll be at 752-0420.'' Upon overhearing the conversation, his
exasperated wife quips, ``There's a phone booth on the corner. You
want me to run downstairs and get the number? You'll be passing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dick Christie lived and worked in 2000, he would undoubtedly
own a pager that sends and receives e-mail, a personal digital
assistant, a cell phone with Web access, and perhaps even an
electronic assistant able to pass phone calls and e-mail to him
wherever he is. Then again, they might own him.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, wireless devices are instruments of liberation. They
lend an unprecedented degree of flexibility to the workday. At the
same time, whatever line people have drawn between work and
leisure, between office and home, is growing thinner than ever as a
sense of obligation to stay connected to work at all hours
continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford Motor Co. and Delta Airlines recently announced plans
to give their employees personal computers and Internet connections
at highly subsidized prices. Many companies, like Cisco Systems,
already give employees home Internet connections. Some workers are
given high-speed service. Others are likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But social scientists and business experts are beginning to
revisit some familiar questions: What is the cost to an employee's
psychological well being if that employee is constantly within
reach? Will a connection from home _ one provided by an employer _
increase the pressure to check in with work during off hours? When
is one's own time truly one's own?
</P>
<P>
   Throw wireless devices into the mix, and those questions become
all the more pressing. Pagers and cell phones and laptop computers
with wireless modems are often now packed along with the rest of
the vacation gear. Cell phones are a common fixture on tables at
restaurants, whether the meal is for business or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think wireless devices enhance their control over their
lives,'' said Arlie Russell Hochschild, a professor of sociology at
the University of California at Berkeley and the author of ``The
Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work,'' recently
out in paperback (Owl Books). ``I don't think it's clear that
that's true. In fact, what you could argue is that you're losing
control because it means you're responding to other people's
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochschild said she had observed that in places where strangers
used to interact with one another _ the hairdresser's, cabs, the
grocery store _ people are now busy having cell phone
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Huemer is a latter-day Dick Christie. Huemer, 32, is the
proprietor of User-Friendly Computing, a small, successful computer
service and installation company in Santa Cruz, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of Huemer's job to have to stay in touch, but
even he admits that in the name of serving his customers, he has
taken things to extremes. Not only does Huemer own both a cell
phone and a pager, but they are at his side every minute of every
day. He also checks his e-mail compulsively.
</P>
<P>
   Huemer knows that he no longer has a life outside work. While he
and his wife, Valerie, a 30-year-old accountant, were in church
recently, his pager sounded twice during the sermon. ``It was kind
of a large congregation so I was hoping no one knew it was me,''
Huemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners in restaurants, Huemer said, are often marred by
incoming cell phone calls. That leaves her to pick at her food
while her husband spends half an hour coaching someone through a
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Huemer is not unsympathetic to his wife's concerns. ``She's
unhappy about what she sees as a constant intrusion,'' he said. ``I
walk in the house and instead of saying hello, I have a phone on my
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   So blurred has the line between work and home become that the
Huemers are in marriage counseling. Huemer takes both cell phone
and pager to the sessions. When they go off, the therapist insists
that Huemer place both devices outside, where they stay for the
remainder of the hour, beeping and ringing piteously on the other
side of the door.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma people face is perhaps best summed up, albeit
unwittingly, by an advertising campaign by the cellular carrier
Sprint PCS for what it calls the Clear Wireless Workplace: cell
phones that not only can gain access to the Web and send and
receive e-mail but can give employees access to their companies'
internal networks, including inventory and sales information. One
of the campaign's slogans is ``Your employees don't have to be in
the office to stay productive.''
</P>
<P>
   While telecommuting has brought a new level of flexibility to
the workday, hyperconnectedness does not necessarily mean that
people are going into the office less. More often than not, it
means that when they leave the office, they keep at least part of
their minds focused on work.
</P>
<P>
   Howard A. Tullman, chairman of The Cobalt Group, an Internet
marketing company and e-commerce service for auto dealers, said in
most of the companies he had run over the years, employees were
required to check voice mail and e-mail seven days a week. America
Online occasionally announces e-mail-free weekends, usually around
a holiday, when employees are not expected to check e-mail. On all
other weekends, of course, they are expected to check their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, that's just fine. John Volkmann, president of
the Brand Momentum Group, a consulting company in Austin, Texas,
and Palo Alto, Calif., was interviewed for this story as he sat in
a daylong workshop in Denver and answered questions sent directly
to and from his Motorola Skytel pager via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt that he had to be accessible at all hours,
if he ever felt as though he had no time to himself, Volkmann
tapped out this response: ``I've found that this connectivity
allows more blending of what used to be fixed-time periods, e.g.,
working on a weekend so you can play golf on a weekday.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely that blending that has some experts
concerned. ``Blending is a bland term that disguises what is really
a new mind-body problem,'' Hochschild said. ``For some people, like
your neighbors and sometimes your children, your body is there but
your mind is not. And for others, like your workmates, your mind is
there but your body is not. Sometimes it's nice to have both your
mind and your body present.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a paradox in wireless technology,'' said Professor
Pekka Himanen, a researcher and lecturer who studies the philosophy
of technology at the University of Helsinki in Finland, a country
besotted with cell phones. Originally, Himanen said, mobile
computing devices were based on the need for doing things on the
move, when working by any other means was impractical. Now, he
said, they supplement one's regular workday at the office,
extending the time spent working.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, it frees people to do things whenever and
wherever they like, and this is great,'' he said. ``But on the
other hand, the end result can easily be that life starts to move
faster and faster, and it becomes a kind of extreme sport where you
take more and more out of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Time zones pose another challenge. Carolyn Layne, a vice
president at Informix, a database software company based in Menlo
Park, Calif., travels frequently, and a recent trip to Brazil made
her modern predicament painfully clear. ``I had meetings from 7
a.m. to midnight,'' she said, ``then from midnight to 3 a.m., I
would check e-mail and voice mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Layne, who was interviewed by cell phone for this article while
she was in a car on her way to a long weekend of skiing at Lake
Tahoe, Calif., said she often made an effort to reserve downtime,
not only for herself but also for her employees. She said she had
recently noticed that an employee who reports to her, Pamela
Vitale, was having particular trouble disconnecting from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at her and said, `This woman is killing herself,'''
Layne said. Vitale deals with people around the world for a unit of
Informix.
</P>
<P>
   So one Friday morning, she called Vitale into her office. ``I
said, `I'm going to keep your cell phone and computer in my office
for the weekend, and I want you to go home right now and plant
flowers.''' Layne told Vitale she wanted to watch her leave an
auto-reply message on her e-mail, and a similar outgoing voice-mail
message, to say she would not be checking messages until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Vitale still seated in her office, Layne called
Vitale's husband to tell him to monitor his wife and to make sure
that she did not try to use the telephone or his computer. She
followed up with a phone call over the weekend to make sure that
Vitale was complying. (She was.)
</P>
<P>
   Vitale said she had emerged from her communications-free period
with a new perspective. ``It was like a splash of cold water,'' she
said. ``Quite honestly, and I mean it truthfully, I didn't see I
was starting to slip into a black hole. Being without these things
for several days caused me to stop and reflect and say, Wait a
minute, I need to reinstate some balance in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Layne said she often wondered what people used to
do before their lives were consumed with communicating with work.
She was reminded of the answer one morning recently when she found
herself with enough time to sit down and read the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I'd been able to do that in a month or
two,'' she said. ``It felt like taking a bubble bath. It felt nice,
just to have some silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubble baths, both real and metaphorical, experts say, are
crucial for an employee's psychological well being and, ultimately,
for that person's productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really may have a secret backfire for employers,''
Hochschild said. ``What they're getting are more frazzled, less
priority-driven workers who are always interrupted. They're soaking
in a culture of interruption. That's the bubble bath they're really
in.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hagel, who leads the e-commerce practice in Palo Alto at
McKinsey &AMP; Co., a consulting company, agreed. ``Everyone has gone
into more and more of a reactive mode,'' he said, ``making it hard
to focus on what direction they're heading and losing sight of
what's important. Connectivity is great, but not if you don't have
time to synthesize the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Huemer said he was acutely aware of the activities that have
disappeared from his life. In the years before his preoccupation
with being available 24 hours a day, he said, he was an avid
reader, and he jogged and bicycled regularly. He went to movies and
maintained a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   But he was recently turned down for life insurance when his
cholesterol level registered dangerously high. Even his sleeping
hours have been consumed by work. ``Bad dreams aren't about some
awkward social moment or being chased by something,'' he said.
``They're about being on some endless computer problem, where one
thing goes wrong and then another.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that people are starting to draw the line, that
a small insurrection may be in the making. Kevin Wassong, a New
York advertising executive, recently went into a Sprint PCS store
in Manhattan to check on the Wireless Web phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the sales guy and I said, `Do I really want to be
that connected?''' Wassong recalled. ``We looked at each other and
together, we said, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wassong did not buy the phone. &QL;

   UGANDA-CULT (Rugazi, Uganda) _ Another 53 bodies were discovered
Wednesday crammed into a small pit inside the house of one of the
Uganda cult leaders. A total of 81 bodies have been found in the
pit in the last two days, 48 of them children. With each day
bringing some new horror, the police said Wednesday night that they
suspected yet another mass grave at a building about 50 miles south
of here, in the southwest of Uganda. Excavation will begin on
Thursday morning, the police said. By Ian Fisher.

   SCOTUS-NUDE (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that cities and states may ban nude dancing as a way of combatting
crime and other ``negative secondary effects'' associated with
establishments that offer this kind of entertainment. In its 6-3
vote upholding an Erie, Pa. ordinance that requires exotic dancers
to wear at least pasties and a G-string, the court's fractured
majority did not explain how that requirement would reduce the
crime, prostitution, sexual assaults or other problems associated
with places where dancers appear fully nude. By Linda Greenhouse.

   FLAG-DESECRATE (Washington) _ The Senate considers a

TWO FLORIDA COACHES FOLLOW SAME PATH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a striking similarity in what two coaches with diverse
backgrounds have been able to do in two different sports at one
success-driven school.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Donovan and Steve Spurrier have much more in common than
the success they have had in their respective sports at the
University of Florida and the way they have turned on Gator fans to
those sports.
</P>
<P>
   It is more the journey than the destination that connects these
two brash leaders who accept nothing less than complete commitment
and the pursuit of perfection. They have each made a practice of
breaking down barriers. Winning was not enough. Proving people
wrong while doing it fueled the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier heard how the Florida football team couldn't win big
games. He listened to how the Gators couldn't win on turf, how they
couldn't win on the road. Or in a dome. Or in cool weather. Or beat
Florida State. Or win a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   One by one the barriers fell. Each obstacle the Florida football
team overcame was accompanied by a Spurrier glare that said, ``I
told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan has that same look these days. It's a little less
powerful, perhaps, but it's still a look of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, going to the Sweet 16 was a shock to everybody,''
Donovan said Monday. ``I think going to the Final Four is a shock
to people now. They think we were a year away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Donovan. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Like Spurrier in football, Donovan came to coach at Florida when
the basketball program was floundering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spurrier, who was a Gator long before he was named coach,
Donovan came to Florida as an outsider, with slicked-back hair and
a rapid-fire way of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan followed Spurrier's recipe for winning games, attracting
athletes and satisfying fans.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan brought in a wide-open Fun, Run and Gun offense that put
points on the scoreboard and fans in the seats. He sold his players
on the system, convincing recruits that winning was more important
than playing time. With that, he began breaking down his own
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan heard how Florida couldn't recruit in the state and the
Gators couldn't win big games, how they couldn't win on the road,
or in domes, or how they couldn't beat ranked teams, or win close
games.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in this NCAA tournament, his Gators beat Butler at the
buzzer, then beat Illinois and Lon Kruger, the coach who took
Florida to its only other Final Four in 1994, in Winston Salem,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   They then went to the Carrier Dome in Syracuse and knocked off
No. 1-ranked Duke, then punched a ticket to Indianapolis by beating
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   They got to the Final Four a year earlier than most expected by
beating the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 seeded teams in the East
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so gratifying to return to the Final Four,'' said Florida
athletic director Jeremy Foley, who looked for a Spurrier clone
when he went searching for a new basketball coach four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been talking about, being in the hunt every
year, contending for a national title. Billy has assembled a team
that the entire University of Florida community can be proud of.
And we are not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a heck of a start. Donovan got his team into the Sweet
16 a year ago and has taken a team made up primarily of freshmen
and sophomores two steps farther this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now this team is two strides short of a national championship,
something Spurrier got in his seventh year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan insists that more important than getting to a Final Four
is having the chance to get there year after year. It was hoped
that would happen after the Gators got there in 1994, but that
appearance proved just a tease. Two years later the Gators were on
the outside looking in, with little hope of getting another
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Then Donovan arrived with his frenetic style on the court and
his incredible ability to sell his program to players who had no
reason to believe there was something special in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan went right to work, determined to keep the top
players in the state from leaving. The first week on the job he was
in the halls at Miami Senior High, a place Kruger was never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got an early commitment from Teddy Dupay, a McDonald's
All-America player and high school legend, who said he ``had a gut
feeling.'' Udonis Haslem and LaDarius Halton climbed aboard, with
Haslem saying he believed.
</P>
<P>
   That took care of the state of Florida, and Mike Miller took
care of everything else when he left South Dakota to take a chance
on Florida. Miller turned down Kansas and Kentucky to go with the
Gators. He decided he wanted to lead a team to the promised land
and start a tradition rather than be a part of one that had already
been established.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan knows basketball. He lived in the gyms growing up,
played in a Final Four at Providence under Rick Pitino. He then
coached in one at Kentucky as Pitino's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Donovan and Miller walked arm in arm after knocking down
one more barrier. Donovan looked at Miller, grinned, and said,
``And people wondered why.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he knew why when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. People were wondering why,'' Miller said. ``Now
they are all looking and saying, `Wow, he must've known a lot.'
Well, I told everybody I knew more than they did, and that's what
made the decision easy.
</P>
<P>
   And living in the shadow of football is an easy thing to do for
Donovan, who embraced Spurrier when he got to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He told Spurrier he admired the way he coached. Spurrier, in
turn, helped Donovan recruit Miller by hosting the recruit in his
office shortly before Florida played Tennessee in a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the football here is a tremendous bonus to us
basketball-wise,'' Donovan said. ``I am part of a team here.''

 &HT;    BILL WOULD REMOVE BARRIER TO WORKERS' STOCK OPTIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers will be free to continue granting stock
options to hourly workers under a bipartisan bill introduced
Wednesday in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, backed by the White House, would clarify labor laws to
ensure that companies can grant stock options without having to
include stock gains in overtime pay calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an estimated 6 million hourly wage earners have stock
options, which give them the right to buy or sell their companies'
stock at a specified price by a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Such options can become extremely valuable if a company's stock
price shoots up. If a worker's windfall were included in his base
pay, overtime pay would rocket up too.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, employers assumed they did not have to worry
about calculating gains from options. But last year, the Labor
Department issued an opinion saying the Fair Labor Standards Act
does require them to count options in calculating a worker's base
pay.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that opinion doesn't get enforced, the Worker
Economic Opportunity Act would amend the labor law to exclude from
base pay any income derived from a stock option, stock appreciation
right or employee stock purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill simply says: It makes no difference if you work in
the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor. Everyone should be
able to share in the success of the company,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.

   HAVANA _ Felix and Barbara Garces don't dream of moving to the
United States. Loyal supporters of the ideals of the Cuban
Revolution, they love their country, its culture and the richness
of their daily interactions with friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also weary. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the end of its billions in annual aid to Cuba, day-to-day life
for many Cubans has been a ceaseless grind. Trips to the state-run
store to pick up monthly rations sometimes yield empty shelves,
leaving people scrambling to earn American dollars so they can
purchase life's necessities in the free-market stores that now dot
Havana's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' said Barbara Garces, who despite her worries is a
jolly woman with a quick laugh. ``Prices are high and salaries are
low.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials blame the 40-year-old U.S. economic embargo
against the communist island for the problems, saying it has
crippled Cuba's economy and led to shortages and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Garces don't talk politics. Far from criticizing the
government, they appreciate the things their country has provided
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Garces was sent for two years of study in Russia, where he
learned the language. When he returned, he became a translator,
earning a salary of about US$14 a month.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is an example of two of Cuba's proudest
accomplishments: its education and health care systems. Trained for
more than eight years in Cuba's university system, Barbara Garces
is a physician. An internist at a government clinic, she earns
about US$16 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Cubans, the Garces and their 16-year-old son, Iran,
have free housing and medical care _ although medicine is not free
and is often too expensive to buy. They have a ration book that
entitles them to a monthly allotment of staples such as rice,
beans, bread, soap and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   But often the staples simply aren't available in the store. So
Barbara Garces, 40, ventures out each day into Havana's teeming
markets, looking for bargains _ fruit, grains and other nutritious
food to round out the family's diet.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Felix Garces, 54, has turned to the tiny
private sector that the influx of tourists has spawned in Havana.
He managed to save enough to buy a three-wheeled bicycle that he
converted into a rickshaw-like taxi. He's covered the rig with a
roof to shelter his passengers from Havana's broiling sun and
summer thunderstorms, and over the years he's added a battery,
lights, even a sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this job,'' he says, proudly wheeling around the narrow
streets of Old Havana, dressed in distinctive bicycle racing togs
and cap. ``It's important to take pride in your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces averages about US$5 a day in fares, which come both from
Cubans and tourists. But it's not all profit: he must buy an annual
license to run his taxi, which costs about US$100 a year. There is
also a monthly fee of about US$18.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has more than tripled his old salary, and the family
now eats well. They figure their monthly costs are about US$50, so
there is a tiny bit of extra money. They have a television set and
a small stereo in their cramped, one-bedroom apartment. A tiny
entry-way serves as a living room, where visitors sit on an old but
very clean couch.
</P>
<P>
   Garces doesn't want to leave Cuba for the United States because
he loves his country _ and because he has a daughter living in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really would like to come home, I think,'' he says. ``She
says she has to work all the time. She has two or three jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Garces also loves the Cuban way of life, which is
intensely social. She tours the local market, chatting with
everybody, her sunny disposition bringing smiles as she jokes with
the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   But the frustrations are always present. On a recent afternoon,
she listened as a visitor talked to a man who runs a small business
refilling butane cigarette lighters. Despite the country's poverty,
smoking is very popular in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The man earns about 30 pesos a day _ about US$1.50 _ or 900
pesos a month, which is around US$45.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the news, Barbara Garces breaks into laughter, saying,
``That's about triple my salary, and I'm a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such jarring contrasts are common in Cuba today. Barbara knows
others professionals like her husband whom have given up the jobs
they were trained for in order to make more money in the tiny
private markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trained to do one thing and may love it, but they do
what they have to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his budding enterprise that depends largely on tourists,
Felix Garces feels somewhat ambivalent about the changes that the
flood of visitors has brought to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here don't want to work,'' he said. ``Now with the
tourists, they might steal things like cigars to sell illegally.
It's leading to a lot of dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garces believes in the ideals of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a revolutionary of the heart,'' he said. ``For me, there
is no better country than here.''

 &HT;    IN TIGHT RACE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF MEXICO'S RULING PARTY
FIGHTS IMAGE AS 'MORE OF THE SAME'

<P>
   MEXICALI, Mexico _ Francisco Labastida's jaw tightens just a bit
when asked to respond to being mocked as ``More of the Same.''
</P>
<P>
   It obviously bothers him. But the man who has the best chance to
become Mexico's next president quickly recovers his generally
confident composure. His political party _ Mexico's omnipresent
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI _ has controlled Mexico's
highest office since 1929. After more than 70 years controlling the
presidency, the PRI holds the world's record for domination by one
party.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's race for president, which culminates in a July 2
election, could be the toughest ever for the party that emerged
from the Mexican Revolution and has always espoused a mixed
ideology of nationalism, socialism and capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida leads in most independent opinion polls, but only by
about five to six percentage points. His challenge is to convince
voters that despite the PRI's stained reputation _ stemming from
repeated scandals and economic policy failures _ he is still the
best option Mexicans have.
</P>
<P>
   Up to election day, Labastida is in for a bruising war with his
chief rival, the National Action Party's charismatic Vicente Fox, a
tall who has derisively referred to Labastida as ``shorty'' and
``More of the Same.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, is an economist and a former governor of Mexico's
northern Sinaloa state. He is courtly, mild-mannered man who
brightens when describing his ideas for boosting farm subsidies for
embattled country folk, as well as proposals for putting computers
in every school ,and reforming Mexico's notoriously corrupt and
inept police.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Labastida came directly from the ranks of the
current PRI government _ serving both as agriculture minister and
interior minister, which put him in charge of law enforcement _ he
is portraying himself as the candidate of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greeks said that we should never bathe twice in the same
river,'' Labastida said during a recent interview with Cox
Newspapers as he criss-crossed northwestern Mexico on one of his
weekly campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Labastida sometimes takes pre-emptive aim at
Mexico's obvious difficulties _ too much poverty and corruption _
but he is careful not to blame the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those to deny problems,'' Labastida recently
told a conference of Hispanic-American journalists in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-on-one interview with Cox Newspapers, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that everything inside the party has been good.
I'm not blind. I'm not deaf. I know the party's problems and the
country's problems. I know people have committed acts of
corruption,'' he said, as his bus rolled toward a rally with
farmers near this agricultural and industrial border city.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, given Mexico's explosive population growth,
the PRI's previous governments have also made ``substantial
improvements in some areas,'' such as health services, potable
water and highways. The party has a historic link to farmers
because it distributed land after the Mexican Revolution, Labastida
said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded: ``Problems with public safety, pollution and
corruption have grown in recent years. . . . I am aware of and
taking responsibility for the demands of society to fight what's
bad. I don't want to be president so things will continue as they
are. I don't want to be a conformist president.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is viewed as a candidate who can attract a
cross-section of the PRI because he's not an Ivy League-educated
free-market ``technocrat'' like the Mexico's last two presidents,
nor is he a ``dinosaur,'' one of the party's old-fashioned
autocratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign, he's using modern television commercials,
polling under the counsel of President Clinton's adviser James
Carville and the PRI's vote-mobilizing political machine.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has to ``strike a balance that's very difficult,''
said Mexico City political scientist Jose Antonio Crespo. ``He has
to offer something that's different from the PRI, but still is the
PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's acknowledgment of PRI failures may seem bold, Crespo
added, but ``it's actually become a tradition now for every PRI
candidate to engage in (party) self-criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the election, Labastida's party is promoting
itself as ``a new PRI'' that is more internally democratic, attuned
to citizens and fiscally responsible. For at least a generation,
Mexicans have witnessed their economy go into a tailspin after PRI
presidents finished their terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't do well,'' Labastida said, ``is that to pay
attention to (social) demands we relied on deficit spending . . .
We took credit without any backing. . . Well, that generated
inflation and a lack of confidence in economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Revelations that PRI politicians not only mismanaged, but also
pocketed exorbitant sums of money hasn't helped the party's
reputation either.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1988-1994 term of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, Mexicans' hopes soared as the country relaxed
protectionist trade barriers and invited foreign investment. When
an overvalued peso collapsed in December 1994, however, Mexicans
aimed their wrath at the PRI and the party started losing key
elections. Salinas' brother was charged with murdering a party
rival and stealing money.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has stabilized the economy and
recovered some public trust, but a hard core of voters is now
anti-PRI. Sentiment against the ruling party has also been fueled
by more recent unsavory revelations about other PRI politicians,
such as Mario Villanueva, former governor of Quintana Roo state,
who escaped the country before he could be arrested for consorting
with drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, Mexico's Reforma newspaper published a poll showing
that only 39 percent of voters prefer Labastida. More voters prefer
opposition candidates, but are divided between the PAN's Fox, with
32 percent, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution
Party with 11 percent. Seventeen percent are undecided and 1
percent prefer lesser-known candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll published the same day by El Universal newspaper
shows a preference of 45 percent for Labastida, compared to almost
40 percent for Fox and almost 13 percent for Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as part of its image makeover, the PRI held its
first-ever primary election to select a presidential nominee.
Labastida won, but many analysts said the election was stacked in
favor of Labastida because he was the party elite's favorite
choice.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1968 from Mexico's National Autonomous
University, Labastida worked as a federal budget and public
investment manager, as well as energy secretary in the
administration of President Miguel de la Madrid. Under Zedillo, he
was an agricultural minister, a post that put him in contact with
leaders of PRI-affiliated farmers' groups that expect special
attention in exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent stop here, near Mexicali, Labastida met with
about 1,500 farmers wearing cowboy boots and hats and listened to a
litany of complaints about low cotton and wheat prices, the high
price of electricity and business debts few can afford to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hopes of the farmers are with you, Francisco Labastida,''
shouted Rodolfo Fierro, Baja California state leader of the
PRI-affiliated National Confederation of Farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida was in his element among the northern Mexican farmers,
who appeared to be more like small businessmen rather than
peasants. To cheers from the crowd, he would at least double a
federal farm subsidies program and pass a law to help alleviate the
high cost of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's experience as agriculture minister could garner him
votes, or it could be an Achilles' heel since many Mexican farmers
have grown disenchanted with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for his tenure as governor of Sinaloa, a state
that remains notorious for drug trafficking although Labastida
publicly battled criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse the comment,'' Labastida said, getting defensive when
asked about the PRI's poor reputation for cracking down on crime.
``But I have acquired a reputation for making changes in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started to make changes in public safety in my state,
the first thing I did was clean up the police,'' Labastida said.
``The judicial police were protecting delinquents. We put three
groups of them in jail, and there were reprisals. They killed my
state security chief . . . I myself was threatened.''

 &HT;    BILL WOULD REMOVE BARRIER TO WORKERS' STOCK OPTIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers will be free to continue granting stock
options to hourly workers under a bipartisan bill introduced
Wednesday in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, backed by the White House, would clarify labor laws to
ensure that companies can grant stock options without having to
include stock gains in overtime pay calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an estimated 6 million hourly wage earners have stock
options, which give them the right to buy or sell their companies'
stock at a specified price by a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Such options can become extremely valuable if a company's stock
price shoots up. If a worker's windfall were included in his base
pay, overtime pay would rocket up too.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, employers assumed they did not have to worry
about calculating gains from options. But last year, the Labor
Department issued an opinion saying the Fair Labor Standards Act
does require them to count options in calculating a worker's base
pay.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that opinion doesn't get enforced, the Worker
Economic Opportunity Act would amend the labor law to exclude from
base pay any income derived from a stock option, stock appreciation
right or employee stock purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill simply says: It makes no difference if you work in
the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor. Everyone should be
able to share in the success of the company,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.

   HAVANA _ The sound of jackhammers echoes along the famous
seaside walk called the Malecon as construction crews transform
priceless but crumbling 16th-Century buildings into pricey
five-star hotels. Nearby, tourists jam an artists market in
picturesque Old Havana while guides discourse about Cuban art in
Italian, English and German.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after experts predicted the collapse of the Soviet
Union would send Fidel Castro's communist Cuba to the graveyard of
broken socialist dreams, Havana is bustling with workers, visitors
and a tourist invasion that poses stiff competition for its
Caribbean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While life for everyday Cubans is still a struggle, this nation
of 11 million has clearly turned a corner since the dark days of
the early 1990s, when the end of $6 billion in annual Soviet
subsidies left Castro and his followers scrambling to keep their
island afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the economy grew a robust by 6.2 percent, Cuban
officials say, leading most other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the rolling power blackouts that left portions of the
country dark each day during the post-Soviet crisis. The
transportation meltdown that saw Cubans packed onto everything from
dump trucks to bicycles for daily commutes has eased somewhat,
while long lines at government-run stores that dispense rations of
bread, rice and other staples are no longer an everyday sight.
</P>
<P>
   There is food in the stores now _ along with luxury items like
televisions and stereos _ and there are free spending tourists in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are barred from visiting Cuba _ although an
estimated 40,000-50,000 visited illegally last year _ but tourists
from other countries are coming in droves. Last year, a record 1.6
million visitors pumped about $2 billion into the economy, and
there are ambitious plans to lure up to 7 million visitors annually
by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of the visitors are European and Canadian, they
bring American dollars to spend in Cuba because the currency is
accepted more readily even than Cuban pesos at tourist
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   For all its progress, though, Cuba has a long, hard road ahead.
Houses and buildings everywhere are crumbling. Ration stores often
lack basics like cooking oil and soap. Salaries for government jobs
are abysmally low, and prices for goods are high. Meanwhile, the
state security apparatus is still a powerful force, stifling any
calls for change.
</P>
<P>
   But the influx of foreigners and their money is rapidly changing
parts of the island in both subtle and dramatic ways. There are now
a tiny number of new opportunities for people long accustomed to
relying solely on the government, and there are new challenges to
that government's tight control of the populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Cuba, there are things good and bad, like in any
country'' said Yohiry Acosta, 21, who was trained as a mechanic but
is studying English in hopes of getting a tourism job. ``We have
free health care and education, but there aren't enough good jobs.
I just want to work and better my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dreams are fueled by the tourist invasion. Cuban boys who
pledge loyalty to the revolution each morning in school may spend
the afternoon hustling as guides for tourists, eagerly chatting in
broken English about music, sports and other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they don't even want dollars, asking instead for a
Tommy Hilfiger or Nike shirt, mildly subversive status symbols in a
country built on the principle that materialism is evil.
</P>
<P>
   But the tourists are bringing more than just designer shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has helped spark the creation of two Cuban economies _
and two classes of people.
</P>
<P>
   Those still stuck in the old economy subsist on government jobs
and an average salary of 200 pesos _ about $10 _ a month. For them,
putting enough food on the table and keeping properly clothed is
still a struggle, despite government handouts.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy is based on dollars _ American dollars. When
Castro legalized the U.S. currency during the depths of the crisis,
he tossed a lifeline to millions of Cubans with relatives abroad.
Family-to-family remittances now top $900 million a year, according
to unofficial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But ``dollarization'' also opened a hairline crack in the
state-controlled economy. As tourism has grown, a tiny class of
entrepreneurs has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Industrious Cubans are renting spare rooms to tourists, opening
small private restaurants in their homes and serving as guides for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a thriving black market _ both for everyday Cubans
who want shoes, jewelry and food, and for tourists who want cheap
cigars, rum or coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The black market has inevitably spawned corruption and theft, as
workers swipe boxes of expensive cigars to sell on the street,
while more ambitious thieves nab goods off of trucks to sell to
Cubans. Crime is far from the problem a tourist might face in
Caracas or Miami, but in Cuba it is a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded by deploying scores of police
officers in the tourist districts. A bustling prostitution trade
has been moved off the streets. Officials are also charging private
entrepreneurs for business licenses. Still more police sweep
neighborhoods where Cuban black markets thrive, rounding up
violators.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also limited the access of average Cubans to
tourist districts like Varadero, a gleaming beach resort two hours
from Havana. The restrictions keep a lid on crime and the black
market, but have stirred resentment among Cubans who can't visit
their own country's newest attractions.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the potential for a growing jealousy between the
dollar-haves and have-nots. In a country where all were once equal,
some families now own television sets and video players, while
others scramble for bread, rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban officials express confidence that the changes brewing
in their country and the influence of foreign tourists won't
undermine their socialist ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban people really believe in the ideas of socialism, and
that does not frighten us,'' Central Bank President Francisco
Soberon recently told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the crumbling buildings, shoddy housing and the struggle
for day-to-day survival facing millions of Cubans, officials blame
the 40-year-old U.S. embargo. In a drama run nightly on news
broadcasts, a Cuban court is taking testimony about the embargo's
damages, with the tally steadily mounting by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the embargo has hurt, but other countries are rushing to
fill the void. Most of the classy new hotels and restaurants in Old
Havana and Varadero have been funded by partnerships between
Castro's government and investors from Europe and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is enormous,'' said Gus Garrisen, a Dutch
business consultant who recently toured Cuba. ``The Americans are
missing a huge opportunity. I consulted with one Dutch company that
built a hotel in Havana, and it is very profitable. I now live in
Bonaire, and everyone there fears the day Cuba opens to the
Americans. It could wipe us off the tourism map.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the embargo will fall burn brightly in Havana, from
government officials to people on the streets eager for a flood of
American dollars. They are encouraged by visiting U.S. politicians
and statements from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which
favors lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba is still wavering somewhere between its past and an
uncertain future. The tiny private sector could easily be snuffed
out, and entrepreneurs fear government crackdowns, higher licensing
fees and tighter restrictions on contact with foreigners.
Meanwhile, Cubans with no access to dollars lament their stagnant
salaries and ever- rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   And hovering over everything is the imposing figure of Fidel
Castro, now 73, who has run his country with an unyielding hand for
40 years. While sidewalk murals extolling the revolution are fading
and billboards advertising Japanese electronics are now popping up,
Castro's revolution _ and his powerful security forces _ are still
very much in control.
</P>
<P>
   But now, perhaps for the first time in decades, new forces are
at play. Huge air-conditioned tour buses jam the parking lots near
Old Havana each day. The crowds line up to tour museums, browse
gift shops or tour the stunning historic district. Varadero's
hotels are jammed with Canadians and Germans who find a Cuban beach
holiday cheaper and just as fun as Cancun or Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Sunburned foreign college students in soiled cut-offs and
scraggly beards take mountain-bike treks across the countryside,
while scuba-divers marvel over Cuba's gorgeous reefs.
</P>
<P>
   The trickle of free contact between tourists and everyday Cubans
seems likely to grow, creating more opportunity, more friendships,
more business transactions and more desire for change in Cuba. Even
if Cuba's leaders want to turn back the clock, they have cast their
lot on a future built largely on tourism, and they can only exert
so much control over their visitors without scaring them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is so curious about what's going on outside
Cuba,'' said Nathan Russell, who visited recently with a Canadian
student group. ``The kids here all have such fresh eyes. It's a
fascinating place.''

hotels are jammed with Canadians and Germans who find a Cuban beach
holiday cheaper and just as fun as Cancun or Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Sunburned foreign college students in soiled cut-offs and
scraggly beards take mountain-bike treks across the countryside,
while scuba-divers marvel over Cuba's gorgeous reefs.
</P>
<P>
   The trickle of free contact between tourists and everyday Cubans
seems likely to grow, creating more opportunity, more friendships,
more business transactions and more desire for change in Cuba. Even
if Cuba's leaders want to turn back the clock, they have cast their
lot on a future built largely on tourism, and they can only exert
so much control over their visitors without scaring them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is so curious about what's going on outside
Cuba,'' said Nathan Russell, who visited recently with a Canadian
student group. ``The kids here all have such fresh eyes. It's a
fascinating place.''

BUJONES WILL RETURN TO CENTER STAGE _ AT TCU AND IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fernando Bujones, long renowned as a dancer
and now establishing himself as a choreographer and ballet
director, made one thing clear when he recently accepted a new job
as artistic director of Southern Ballet Theatre in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to maintain my affiliation with TCU,'' he said in a
recent interview on the Texas Christian University campus, between
classes and rehearsals for the scholarship benefit dance concert
that will be held at Ed Landreth Auditorium through this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Along with works by faculty members and a restaging of a famous
Paul Taylor work, the program includes the premiere of Bujones'
``Greek Breeze and Tease,'' a setting of music of modern Greek
composer Mikis Theodorakis, who did the score for the film ``Zorba
the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Bujones has been associated with the TCU ballet and modern dance
program since the mid-1990s, when he was a visiting teacher. Since
then, he has returned to Fort Worth about five times a year to
teach and stage ballets, and to try out ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of the students motivates me to do my best
work,'' Bujones says. ``A student here can be more motivated than
some professional dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance students like the fact that Bujones sets the bar high.
``He's highly demanding,'' says Colleen Comer, a third-year ballet
major from Atlanta. ``But in a good way. He expects
professionalism. He says, `If you can work with me, you can work
with any professional choreographer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bujones' career originated in the volatile world of Cold War
politics and American-Cuban hostilities. Born in the Cuban-American
community in Miami in 1955, before Castro's takeover of Cuba, he
traveled back and forth between Cuba and the United States with his
mother during his preschool years. He ended up on the Cuban side of
the water after the Castro-led revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a U.S. citizen, he and his mother were allowed to
leave Cuba, going first to Prague, then Paris, then back to Miami
to rejoin relatives. Bujones has never returned to Cuba, and says
he probably won't until democratic government is established there.
</P>
<P>
   His mother hoped he would become a pianist. His nervous energy
dictated that he become a dancer, however, although he picked up
extensive musical ability from years of piano lessons. At 12, he
was offered the chance to go to New York on a scholarship to the
American School of Ballet, where he completed his training before
winning international fame by taking the gold medal for highest
technical achievement at the Seventh International Ballet
Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   One of his fondest memories as a touring artist is receiving a
pair of boots in Fort Worth at the end of a performance at the
Convention Center Theatre in 1976. When he began turning more to
teaching, directing and choreography in the 1990s, the dance
department at TCU offered him plenty of opportunities to do all
three.
</P>
<P>
   Dance careers often begin when youngsters are teen-agers,
because dancers, like athletes, reach their physical peak
relatively early. But college dance departments offer an
alternative approach, and TCU has long been a pioneer in
college-level dance studies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the school led the way with the first bachelor of fine
arts degree program in ballet. TCU added modern dance to its
program in the early 1970s, shortly before Ellen Page Garrison
joined the faculty in 1977. Garrison became department head in '91,
and today, TCU serves about 70 dance majors with a full-time
faculty of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our students have teaching as a goal,'' Garrison says.
``Our students become therapists, writers, artists and teachers at
all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Garrison points out, dance instruction at the grassroots
level _ out in the small town and suburban studios where
5-year-olds line up for early training _ is often low in quality. A
program like TCU's _ which offers complete training for a dancer in
modern dance and ballet, and in related academic studies _ helps to
raise the quality of dance education when college-trained dancers
begin to teach at the beginner level.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's performances will reflect the dance department's
insistence on diverse training, including modern dance and ballet,
for all undergraduate dance students. Taylor's ``Aureole,'' of
1963, will be staged by Mary Chochran, a former TCU dance student
who became a principal dancer in the Paul Taylor company. Other
works will include modern dance pieces, as well as new works in the
ballet tradition and an interpretation of swing dance.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bujones is also a part of the program as choreographer
in residence. Still lean at 5 feet 9 inches and 145 pounds, he is
constantly accompanied by his wife of 10 years, Peruvian-born Maria
Arnillas Bujones, whom he met while dancing in ``Sleeping Beauty''
at the Stuttgart Ballet, where she was a member of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, with a company comparable in size to the Fort Worth
Dallas Ballet, will become the Bujones' home base, but Fort Worth
will be a home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the city,'' he says of Fort Worth. ``And I like that
TCU is part of the city's cultural life.''

<P>
   HAVANA _ Felix and Barbara Garces don't dream of moving to the
United States. Loyal supporters of the ideals of the Cuban
Revolution, they love their country, its culture and the richness
of their daily interactions with friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also weary. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the end of its billions in annual aid to Cuba, day-to-day life
for many Cubans has been a ceaseless grind. Trips to the state-run
store to pick up monthly rations sometimes yield empty shelves,
leaving people scrambling to earn American dollars so they can
purchase life's necessities in the free-market stores that now dot
Havana's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' said Barbara Garces, who despite her worries is a
jolly woman with a quick laugh. ``Prices are high and salaries are
low.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials blame the 40-year-old U.S. economic embargo
against the communist island for the problems, saying it has
crippled Cuba's economy and led to shortages and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Garces don't talk politics. Far from criticizing the
government, they appreciate the things their country has provided
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Garces was sent for two years of study in Russia, where he
learned the language. When he returned, he became a translator,
earning a salary of about US$14 a month.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is an example of two of Cuba's proudest
accomplishments: its education and health care systems. Trained for
more than eight years in Cuba's university system, Barbara Garces
is a physician. An internist at a government clinic, she earns
about US$16 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Cubans, the Garces and their 16-year-old son, Iran,
have free housing and medical care _ although medicine is not free
and is often too expensive to buy. They have a ration book that
entitles them to a monthly allotment of staples such as rice,
beans, bread, soap and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   But often the staples simply aren't available in the store. So
Barbara Garces, 40, ventures out each day into Havana's teeming
markets, looking for bargains _ fruit, grains and other nutritious
food to round out the family's diet.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Felix Garces, 54, has turned to the tiny
private sector that the influx of tourists has spawned in Havana.
He managed to save enough to buy a three-wheeled bicycle that he
converted into a rickshaw-like taxi. He's covered the rig with a
roof to shelter his passengers from Havana's broiling sun and
summer thunderstorms, and over the years he's added a battery,
lights, even a sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this job,'' he says, proudly wheeling around the narrow
streets of Old Havana, dressed in distinctive bicycle racing togs
and cap. ``It's important to take pride in your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces averages about US$5 a day in fares, which come both from
Cubans and tourists. But it's not all profit: he must buy an annual
license to run his taxi, which costs about US$100 a year. There is
also a monthly fee of about US$18.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has more than tripled his old salary, and the family
now eats well. They figure their monthly costs are about US$50, so
there is a tiny bit of extra money. They have a television set and
a small stereo in their cramped, one-bedroom apartment. A tiny
entry-way serves as a living room, where visitors sit on an old but
very clean couch.
</P>
<P>
   Garces doesn't want to leave Cuba for the United States because
he loves his country _ and because he has a daughter living in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really would like to come home, I think,'' he says. ``She
says she has to work all the time. She has two or three jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Garces also loves the Cuban way of life, which is
intensely social. She tours the local market, chatting with
everybody, her sunny disposition bringing smiles as she jokes with
the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   But the frustrations are always present. On a recent afternoon,
she listened as a visitor talked to a man who runs a small business
refilling butane cigarette lighters. Despite the country's poverty,
smoking is very popular in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The man earns about 30 pesos a day _ about US$1.50 _ or 900
pesos a month, which is around US$45.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the news, Barbara Garces breaks into laughter, saying,
``That's about triple my salary, and I'm a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such jarring contrasts are common in Cuba today. Barbara knows
others professionals like her husband whom have given up the jobs
they were trained for in order to make more money in the tiny
private markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trained to do one thing and may love it, but they do
what they have to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his budding enterprise that depends largely on tourists,
Felix Garces feels somewhat ambivalent about the changes that the
flood of visitors has brought to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here don't want to work,'' he said. ``Now with the
tourists, they might steal things like cigars to sell illegally.
It's leading to a lot of dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garces believes in the ideals of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a revolutionary of the heart,'' he said. ``For me, there
is no better country than here.''

BUSH, WOMEN AND GUN VIOLENCE: AN OPPORTUNITY, NOT A WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Campaign
Countdown commentary column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

Countdown, a rotating campaign-commentary column written by former

MSNBC host Laura Ingraham.)
 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sometimes it's not a bad thing to let your opponents shape the
campaign agenda _ as long as you can turn it to your own advantage.
 &HT;    George W. Bush has been doing his post-primary best to keep the
campaign focused on issues that he knows well: education and
Clinton-Gore 1996 fund-raising abuses.
 &HT;    But come Mother's Day, when thousands of pro-gun-control women
will descend upon Washington for the so-called ``Million Mom
March,'' Al Gore is going to have some major help in changing the
subject to an issue he thinks is a plus for the Democrats.
 &HT;    We already know how Gore will handle the gun issue _ he'll
indulge in demagoguery and play loosey-goosey with the statistics
to justify ever-more-intrusive restrictions on gun ownership by
law-abiding Americans.
 &HT;    Bush, on the other hand, has said precious little on the
subject, other than that he favors trigger locks.
 &HT;    Many of the same people urging Bush to ``make a deal'' with John
McCain are also telling him to ``move to the middle'' on guns. Both
ideas are bad advice, yielding control of the campaign dynamic to
Bush's rivals, past and future.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's no need for Bush to seek middle ground _ he
can be true to his pro-gun principles and still close the gender
gap in the coming election.
 &HT;    Right now Bush trails Gore only slightly among women _ he lags
by only five points in the latest voter.com/Battleground 2000 poll.
Bush is already doing well among mothers, married women and white
suburban women, while Gore holds the upper hand among minority
women, single women and retirees.
 &HT;    But gun control isn't the way to those voters' hearts. Despite
what antigun forces would have us believe, women don't rank
gun-control legislation among their greatest concerns.
 &HT;    In fact, according to the mid-March Battleground Poll, the
issues that most worry women are tailor-made for Bush: ``Restoring
moral values'' drew 18 percent, and ``improving education'' 13
percent. Social Security/Medicare, at 11 percent, and health care
at 10 percent came in third and fourth, respectively. Gun control
ranked down at No. 5.
 &HT;    Does this mean that George W. should steer clear of the gun
issue?
 &HT;    On the contrary _ Bush should use this hot-button issue to show
that he won't run and hide when the going gets tough and the media
pressure is on. The ``Million Mother March'' provides exactly that
opportunity.
 &HT;    Everyone knows Gore will be there, railing against the NRA and
the GOP-controlled ``Do Nothing'' Congress. But few expect Bush to
show up to face a largely hostile crowd _ which is just the reason
he should. Standing up in the face of opposition shows just the
kind of courage Americans are looking for in a president.
 &HT;    Besides, organizer Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D.-N.Y.) told the New
York Times, ``We're working very hard to make sure it's not a
Republican or Democratic event.'' Bush should help her guarantee
that.
 &HT;    So, if he does show up, what should the Texas governor say?
 &HT;    With so many women concerned about our country's moral decline,
Bush should put the hideous phenomenon of children shooting
children in the context of the greater national problem, an overall
decline of respect for human life.
 &HT;    Fifty years ago, more Americans owned more guns than today, yet
school shootings were unthinkable. Since then, however, divorce,
illegitimacy, drug use, abortion and rampant sex and violence in
entertainment have created a toxic atmosphere for our children.
 &HT;    Women on both sides of the political aisle have seen how the
culture can corrode the values that they try to instill in their
children. That's why so many women yearn for a leader who carries
himself with dignity and decency _ John McCain understood this _
even if they don't always agree with him.
 &HT;    As far as gun control is concerned, Bush should talk about
lapses in enforcement and also point out the dangers of
partisanship on issues such as gun violence.
 &HT;    Last year, after all, the White House urged House Democrats to
kill a bill, supported by a bipartisan coalition, that would have
included provisions for trigger locks and a juvenile Brady Bill, as
well as a 24-hour waiting period for purchases at gun shows.
 &HT;    It didn't go far enough, the Democrats said _ which conveniently
allows Gore to rail against Congressional foot-dragging on
``sensible gun laws.''
 &HT;    Finally, wouldn't it be refreshing if Bush spoke of gun
ownership as a ``women's issue''?
 &HT;    Thousands of women across the country have, at one time or
another, felt threatened, been attacked or needed a restraining
order against a violent boyfriend or ex-husband. If antigun forces
win out, these women won't be able to choose to defend themselves.
 &HT;    Women are every bit as concerned about protecting their homes
and families as men are. To many women, gun ownership is an
antidote to the sense of powerlessness that a woman feels when she
or her children are threatened.
 &HT;    When Gore talks about ``choice,'' he means abortion _ a stance
that will keep him in good stead with the Planned Parenthood
constituency.
 &HT;    But Bush can use the rhetoric of ``choice,'' too, and in the
process he just might capture a majority of the women's vote. He's
already gotten good results talking about choice in terms of
education. Now it's time for him to extend the concept of choice to
another important American value _ self-defense.

REMEMBERING A SENSATION IN CINCINNATI  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exactly 10 years ago this Friday, Dennis Barrie woke up in a
good mood, went to work and became the first American museum
director known to be indicted for doing his job. Barrie, then 42
and director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, was
well aware that there were objections to the new exhibition there:
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, which included depictions of
sadomasochistic homosexual acts and portraits of nude children.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders had pressured the center to cancel the show,
but the opening for museum members the evening before had gone
smoothly, so Barrie was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very triumphant that we had opened successfully, that
people had stood in line in terrible weather; there were thousands
of people there,'' Barrie recalled in a recent telephone interview.
``The next morning I went to work, probably having been up too
late, and walked in there, casually thinking everything would be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon learned otherwise. Reporters, who were already camped
out at the arts center, informed him that the local police were
going to make their move that day. Barrie gathered his lawyers and
other advisers to talk about how to handle the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, law-enforcement officials arrived, cleared the
museum of its 500 or so visitors and shut it down long enough to
videotape the exhibition. Barrie and the art center were indicted
on obscenity charges (pandering and using minors in pornography).
As Barrie was escorted out of the museum, protesters, according to
news reports, shouted ``Fascists!'' and ``Gestapo, go home!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dirty Pictures'' _ the television film version of Barrie's
story, scheduled to have its premiere next month on Showtime _ the
protesters shout ``Stop the art police!'' Barrie is played by James
Woods. Between scenes of the first criminal trial in the United
States over the content of a museum exhibition, the likes of Salman
Rushdie, William F. Buckley Jr., Barney Frank and Fran Lebowitz
talk about censorship. And scores of Mapplethorpe photographs,
including the most controversial, are shown on camera.
</P>
<P>
   When Showtime first began developing the film, a lot of people
(particularly Barrie) thought the story and the issues it dealt
with were old news, but events soon proved them wrong. Last
September, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York threatened to cut
off financing to the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and even evict the
museum from its building, because of the ``Sensation'' exhibition,
which included a rendering of the Virgin Mary accented by elephant
dung.
</P>
<P>
   And in the current Biennial at the Whitney Museum, one artist,
Hans Haacke, appears to tell Giuliani what he thinks of that
incident in ``Sanitation,'' a piece of installation art that seems
to compare Giuliani and other American politicians to Hitler, and
their comments on public financing of the arts to the Nazis'
``Degenerate Art'' exhibition of 1937.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Dirty Pictures'' could not have been better timed, and it
gets as political as it wants to be. Although the script
personalizes what could have been a traditional courtroom drama, by
going home with Barrie and showing the tensions affecting him, his
wife (played by Diana Scarwid) and their two sons, the dangers of
censorship in the arts, not one man's nightmare, were always the
film's central theme. At least that was true for the producer,
Michael Manheim, who trod similar political ground with the NBC
docudrama ``Roe v. Wade'' a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it,'' Manheim said of the new film, ``because I believe
in the First Amendment. I think the lesson of our age is that you
don't silence the idea, no matter how abhorrent it is. You argue it
down in the marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as both Manheim and Barrie observe, the lesson has been a
difficult one for many Americans, and the censorship wars are still
raging.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our case,'' Barrie said, ``I really did think the battle
had gone in different directions: the mass media, the V-chip. But
now it's cycling back to the museum world, the art world, the
cultural world. I think the groups that fight these battles see
this as holding the line on moral decay, or not even moral decay
but in keeping the status quo in a changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   To play a champion of the opposing liberal attitudes or a
defender of Mapplethorpe's work in particular, the outspoken Woods
might not be the first actor a casting director would think of. To
call his statements homophobic, for instance, would seem an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest things about this exhibit, I'm sure,''
Woods said in an interview between filming scenes in Toronto, ``had
to be that any reasonable adult with children would walk in there
and look at a picture of one man urinating in another man's mouth
and say: `You know what? Now I  &UR; know  &LR;  I don't want those guys
teaching my kids.' And I mean that. I don't want those people
teaching my children values.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods _ whose film and television roles have included the
notorious lawyer Roy Cohn in HBO's ``Citizen Cohn,'' H.R. Haldeman
in Oliver Stone's ``Nixon'' and Byron de la Beckwith, the man who
murdered Medgar Evers, in ``Ghosts of Mississippi'' _ seems to
enjoy getting interviewers' attention with unfashionably
conservative statements. He describes himself as having been a
liberal Democrat, like his parents, ``until I actually evolved as a
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his engagement to Melissa Crider earlier this
year, he defended the age difference (he's 52; she's in her
mid-20s) by comparing the coming marriage to the choice of a family
pet; most people, he said, want cute little puppies, not
13-year-old dogs. (Apparently his fiancee is willing to settle for
an older animal.) Woods does want to make it clear, however, that
he is ``totally, 100 percent, virulently anticensorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know,'' he added, ``I so wish that people who
luxuriate in their First Amendment rights would take just one
little bit of commensurate responsibility in enjoying those
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' opinion of Mapplethorpe is not particularly admiring.
``The two best things that ever happened to him,'' the actor said
of the photographer, ``was dying and having his work at the CAC.
And having the subsequent trial.''
</P>
<P>
   No artist's reputation ever suffered from a well-timed demise,
it's true, but Mapplethorpe was, in fact, much written about in the
decade before he died, in March 1989 at the age of 42. As early as
1981, critics were debating the value of his elegant style and
shocking subjects (and referring, in one instance, to an earlier
photographer as ``the Robert Mapplethorpe of his generation'').
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1983, Mapplethorpe had a new book in the stores
and pictures in three Manhattan gallery shows at once. As he
battled AIDS, he chronicled his own physical deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The work of his that still shocks, however, is from the ``X
Portfolio,'' photographs of sadomasochistic gay sex practices. In
``Dirty Pictures,'' when the Hamilton County, Ohio, sheriff (played
by Craig T. Nelson) gets his first look at these photos, he speaks
for many when he exclaims, ``Whoa, Nellie!''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie may defend those pictures, but the actor who plays him
does not. ``You can say all you want and be politically correct and
so on,'' Woods said, ``but I don't see the artistic merit of one
man bent over with his forearm inserted up another man's anus. What
is the artistry in that shot?''
</P>
<P>
   Expert witnesses from the art world answered that question in
the Cincinnati trial. Jacquelynn Baas, then director of the
University Art Museum in Berkeley, Calif., for instance, testified,
``It's the tension between the physical beauty of the photographs
and the brutal nature of what's going on in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Kardon, who had put the Mapplethorpe exhibition together
in 1987 at the Institute of Contemporary Art of Philadelphia,
described one photograph, of a finger inserted in a penis, as ``a
very ordered, classical composition.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week trial, the jury _ mostly working-class
suburbanites, only three of whom had ever gone to an art museum _
found those points of view plausible and acquitted Barrie after
only two hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pierson, the director of ``Dirty Pictures'' and a
self-professed political liberal, considers that outcome the real
beauty of the story: ``I thought it was wonderful that eight very
ordinary people, when push came to shove, voted for the
Constitution of the United States of America.'' And for art that
may have been personally offensive to them. ``It's very easy to
come out against the censors who want to throw `Huck Finn' out of
the library,'' Pierson added.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the verdict was announced, the exhibition had
already gone on to Boston, the final stop in its seven-city tour,
without major incident. Barrie left Cincinnati about a year after
the trial, becoming the first director of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland (where, he says, he experienced a touch of deja
vu when some people suggested that the history of rock music be
depicted without reference to sex, drugs or four-letter words).
</P>
<P>
   Today he is president of the Malrite Co., which creates hybrid
museum-entertainment complexes, with an emphasis on popular
culture. The Barries divorced after the trial. Their two sons, now
18 and 21, visited the film set in Toronto, where they met a host
of people who considered their father a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing that was very good for them,'' Barrie said. ``It took
a lot out of me, quite honestly, 10 years ago. For a long time I
didn't want to go out and fight those fights again. In a way the
film is like closure.''

   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth

   CHICAGO _ It was a freezing cold Sunday and the novelist Douglas
Coupland, chronicler of disaffected youth, was trawling Belmont
Avenue for midcentury American ceramics. He bought one piece after
another, never inquiring who made them or so much as glancing at
the prices.
</P>
<P>
   What he did not tell the store owners (``I don't have the
heart'') is that the vases aren't going to be vases much longer.
``They're an art supply,'' said Coupland, who studied sculpture
before taking up writing. His 1991 novel, ``Generation X,'' gave
20-somethings a catchy name and slacker reputation. Now Coupland
was in Chicago to promote his seventh book, ``Miss Wyoming''
(Pantheon Books, $23).
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Coupland planned to
sand the finishes off the vases, stiffen them with plaster, then
join them with metal rods and an adhesive he calls ``shoe-goo''
into Brancusi-like totems, with which he is filling his 1960
post-and-beam house to the point of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   The totems are one of a dozen or so art and furniture design
projects that consume him. All begin with favorite shapes. Or, as
he puts it, ``I have a morphological agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupland (pronounced cope-land) says he has never been in
therapy. How then to decipher his obsessions, which include plastic
bottles? While on book tours, he runs from drugstore to drugstore,
buying shampoos and detergents, which he then pours down the drains
of hotel bathrooms. Back home, he fills the bottles with brightly
colored resins, then peels the bottles away. Displayed against a
nearly white wall, the result resembles a futuristic Herbal
Essences museum.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite vases _ ``I guess I could drill a hole big enough for
one daisy,'' he said reluctantly _ the objects are familiar and yet
oddly unsettling, especially mixed in with a few empty bottles and
ikebana vases on Copeland's wall. ``Your brain can't reconcile all
three at once,'' he said. ``When people come into the house,
there's usually 15 or 20 seconds when their brains are trying to
catch up to what their eyes are seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   As he nears middle age (``I'm 38.3,'' he says with geeky
precision), Coupland is creating a cottage industry, which is as
much about recapturing the past as reconfiguring the present. He
has enlisted art-school friends to help bring the products of his
imagination, including pop culture inspired furniture, to market.
</P>
<P>
   Coupland plans to release five of his mutated bottles in
editions of 50. He may also make a set in bronze _ as doorstops or
bookends, perhaps. But functionality is an afterthought in his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day of art school,'' Coupland said nostalgically,
``was the first day in my life I could pick up an object and say
`That's so beautiful' without getting beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupland, who claims he is so out of sync with his own
generation that he does not bother to invest (``It makes me feel
parasitic''), uses his earnings to ``smooth out the peaks and
valleys'' in the lives of the Vancouver artists who are helping
him, some of whom he has known for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose our ability to make friends about the same time we
acquire our first expensive piece of furniture,'' he writes in
``Miss Wyoming.'' That might explain why he is surrounding himself
with his old friends, although he jokes, ``In my case, I'm still
waiting for the aphorism to kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in art school mode, he pulls all-nighters, as he recently
did with a trio of young entrepreneurs in Edmonton, Alberta, who
asked him to join their stable of designers that already includes
Karim Rashid and Nick Dine. Their company, Pure Design
(800-483-5643 or www.pure-design.com), now sells created laminate
tables in patterns inspired by the face-off circle of a hockey rink
(a Canadian obsession) and Roy Lichtenstein (a Coupland obsession,
along with the other Pop artists).
</P>
<P>
   Another piece is called the Henry Table; it is a homage to
Moore. The rotund forms of Henry Moore sculptures are immediately
recognizable, despite the fact that the $649 table is made of flat
sheets of lacquered fiberboard.
</P>
<P>
   That is Coupland's foray into mass marketing. At the same time,
he is looking to sell handmade pieces, including a giant fiberglass
chair inspired by the ``secret world domination headquarters'' in
the movie ``Men in Black.'' It costs $5,500, crated, but he resists
the suggestion that as a youth-culture chronicler, he has somehow
strayed by making expensive furniture. ``It's sculpture, and
sculpture has always been expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Janet, who raised four Coupland sons in West
Vancouver, says she has no idea where her son's artistic
sensibility comes from. ``I was afraid you were going to ask
that,'' she said, recalling that, as a toddler, ``Doug pretty much
lived with his Legos.'' But about the time he turned 10, she said,
all he wanted for Christmas was a Lichtenstein poster.
</P>
<P>
   At that point he was already a Pop Art devotee, having seen a
James Rosenquist collage in an encyclopedia when he was 7. The
collage was F-111, a powerful antiwar statement juxtaposing images
of small children and military hardware. As soon as he could afford
to, Coupland bought a limited-edition print.
</P>
<P>
   It hangs in Coupland's house in West Vancouver, 5 miles from
where he grew up, a doctor's son in a
moose-strapped-to-the-hood-of-the-Ford Fairlane neighborhood.
Designed by Ron Thom, a brand-name Canadian Modernist, the house
steps down a hillside; Coupland calls the style ``Alpine Neutra.''
Instead of a yard, there is a forest so thick, Coupland said, ``I
don't know what color the house is.'' He dislikes views, which he
explains by saying he is descended from cave dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he has modified the house with walls of
backlighted plexiglass and varnished madrona wood. He resurfaced
one wall in sheets of brightly colored plywood made especially for
road signs. ``It's unbloatable,'' he said. Gridded shelves were
made by an art school friend, Jud Beaumont, to Coupland's precise
specifications. One shelf holds geometric fantasies rendered in
metal by another art school classmate, Tim Lepp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can call Tim and say, `I really, really, really, really need
an 8-inch copper icosahedron,''' Coupland said, ``and he'll say
`Cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As to why he might need a copper icosahedron in the first place,
Coupland explained that he simply had no choice. ``It was a
`Richard-Dreyfuss-making-Devil's-Tower-out-of-mashed-potatoes
moment,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Coupland, who speaks calmly and patiently, even when describing
obsession, said he rearranges his furniture weekly. This after
observing, ``The interior of a person's house is the closest you're
going to get to the interior of that person's brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupland is an expert in the ennui of the middle-class slacker.
To write ``Microserfs'' (1995), he went to live with computer
programmers. For ``Shampoo Planet'' (1992), he depicted a world of
globally enfranchised teens. One of them, Tyler, is obsessed with
hair products, including bottled shampoos. (``Oh my God, I never
noticed that! Wow!'' he e-mailed a reporter who pointed out that
Tyler foreshadowed his own bottle collecting.)
</P>
<P>
   Although his books have sold hundreds of thousands of copies,
when he went looking for a new publishing house after leaving Regan
Books in 1998, he welcomed a 15-page critique of his writing by
Sonny Mehta, the head of Knopf Pantheon, and members of his staff.
The memo cited such things as his ``misuse of sentimentality'' and
``shifts in point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, Coupland took the Knopf Pantheon offer, although it
wasn't the most lucrative. ``At some point, if you're going to
evolve, you're going to have to work with someone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Wyoming,'' about a beauty queen turned television
actress, prompted by a 1998 National Enquirer article about the
marriage of Catherine Oxenberg and Robert Evans, has received mixed
reviews in the United States. While Tom Wolfe called him a
``Nathanael West with an eye for the year 2000,'' Tom Shone wrote
in The New York Times Book Review, ``For all its outward-bound
urges, `Miss Wyoming' remains a curiously clipped and uptight
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, Coupland lamented, ``like naturalistic books, with a
dollop of history and a sprinkle of folksy wisdom, and I can't
write that kind of book.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his best writing, including travel articles for
Wallpaper, is available on his Rosenquist-inspired Web site,
Coupland.com. Also available are collages created by Coupland from
the ephemera that fills his pockets while he is touring. (He
carries scissors and a gluestick everywhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration comes from what he sees around him. Looking at ice
breaking up on the Chicago River, says Coupland, who speaks more
readily in visual than in literary terms. ``It's just like that
laminate Ettore Sotsass did in the early '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who finds laminate in nature is a man who is always going
to follow his Modernist instincts. ``Just as you can't picture
Philip Johnson using a doily in the glass house,'' he says, ``there
won't be any antimacassars on Coupland.com.'' &QL;

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Carl B. Spence was a former Navy man who
sought odd jobs during the day and nestled under trees with a
bottle of booze at night.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless for more than a decade, Spence, 67, died while seeking
shelter from the tornado that roared through downtown Fort Worth on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Spence and his buddy John Barr were sheltering on the porch of
the empty Burns Graphics building on Seventh Street when a wall
behind them collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Both were buried under debris, but Barr, 70, escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if he had not been trying to head this way,''
John Suggs, director of the Presbyterian Night Shelter east of
downtown, said Wednesday. An estimated 500 homeless people sought
refuge from the storm at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's name was on a sheet of paper posted on the shelter
bulletin board, which meant that he had mail to be picked up, Suggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Spence made it to the shelter, he would have found a letter
from his older sister, Sarah Pentecost of Winder, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He mailed her a birthday card two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall that your birthday is sometime this month,'' Spence
wrote inside the card. ``Hope you are well. I do remember all of
you in my prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Pentecost said the family thought often of
Spence, who made money doing day labor. Police reports show that he
had been arrested a few times for disorderly conduct and public
intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't perfect, but we never discarded him because he was
homeless,'' said Pentecost, 75, breaking into tears upon learning
of her brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   Pentecost had heard about the tornado on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him on my mind all night,'' she said, her voice
quivering. ``He was a good person. He just had a disease,
alcoholism, that he couldn't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the letter that Pentecost sent to Spence was a
newspaper article about their eldest living sibling, Opal Deaton,
78, who recently retired from teaching Sunday school after more
than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I know you are as proud of her as I am,' '' Pentecost
said. ``I sent him another letter this morning because I was
concerned about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence, the youngest of five children, was a responsible man
before he became addicted to alcohol, Pentecost said.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of high school in Georgia to join the Navy.
Spence married and had a daughter who was killed in an automobile
accident about a decade ago, Pentecost said. Spence had three
grandchildren, Pentecost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never talked about his situation,'' she said. ``I had told
him many times that if I knew he wouldn't drink again, he could
come stay with me anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just let alcohol ruin him, take him over. But I never
failed to pray for him every day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the shifting sands. Fort Zinderneuf. Soldiers of fortune
with no past. Oui, mon capitaine. Buster Crabbe in ``Captain
Gallant.'' Gary Cooper in ``Beau Geste.'' Gene Hackman in ``March
or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you can remember all those men who joined to forget all
those women, because the French Foreign Legion did not march out
with the final credits. In fact, the legion is not only alive, with
recent service in trouble spots like Chad and Bosnia, but it also
has its own Web site
(www.info-france-usa.org/america/embassy/legion/legion.htm),
courtesy of the French Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1831, 902 officers, 3,176 noncommissioned officers and
more than 30,000 legionnaires have died for France, one-third of
them while fighting directly for the defense of the country,'' the
site reports. ``Foreigners by birth, the legionnaires have become
Frenchmen by the blood they have spilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy's site has a short history of the legion, from its
founding in Algeria to modern times. While it is most identified
with North Africa in cinematic imagination, its most celebrated
battle occurred in Mexico in 1863, at an inn named Camerone in Palo
Verde, near Puebla. There, at the French equivalent of the Alamo,
three officers and 62 legionnaires resisted 2,000 Mexicans. ``After
a day of heroic fighting, the last five survivors fixed bayonets
and charged.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also covers some of the legion's traditions, its code
of honor, its uniform and its music. But the English version of the
bilingual site is there for a practical purpose, not just
nostalgia: to answer the questions of would-be recruits (ages 17 to
40) about enlistment procedures. ``The legionnaire is seldom an
angel but never a criminal,'' the site says. ``Once he has joined,
under an assumed name if he wishes, the legionnaire enjoys an
unequaled protection for as long as he serves because of the
anonymity rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Less official but equally heartfelt sites, created by
ex-legionnaires or admirers, offer more information than the
embassy's. You can listen to legion songs at
home.talkcity.com/spiritcir/lediable, a site created by Collin Rae
Smith, a former legion corporal (1994-99). Those thinking about
joining, he says, should be able to run 2,800 meters (about one and
three-quarter miles) in 12 minutes or less and climb a 20-foot rope
using only the arms.
</P>
<P>
   Smith describes basic training at one of the legion's ``farms'':
running, French lessons, combat training, rope climbing and more
running. ``The evenings are usually spent by learning legion songs
(the legion takes singing very seriously) or night marches,'' he
writes. Then comes the Kepi Blanc march, 80 to 100 kilometers (50
to 62 miles) over two or three days in full gear. Basic enlistment
for those who make it is five years.
</P>
<P>
   The legion is not for weaklings, but despite the escapist image,
it is not for losers, either. It is a highly professional outfit,
now based in Aubagne, near Marseille. Most of its officers and
about 40 percent of its men are French. Specialized units include
underwater demolitions teams and an elite paratrooper regiment,
which is very difficult to enter and is based in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jungle Training School in French Guiana is the best on the
planet,'' Larry B. Lambert wrote by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert has perhaps the most thorough English-language legion
site on the Web 
(users.deltanet.com/users/llambert/public(underscore)html/legion(und
erscore)index.html), especially for military history . The legion
has 8,000 members and accepts 1,300 men for training each year out
of about 10,000 applicants, his site says. It chronicles the legion
in the world wars; Africa; Indochina, including the siege of Dien
Bien Phu; and Bosnia. The site is illustrated with color
photographs of historic legion recruiting posters, worth a visit
all by themselves. (Asked to say something about himself, Lambert
replied, in appropriate legion fashion, ``I'd rather not.'')
</P>
<P>
   There is also a biography of John Hasey, who enlisted in 1940 in
a Free French unit of the legion and was badly wounded the next
year. Among the 1,036 Companions of the Liberation, honored by de
Gaulle for having done the most to free France from German
occupation, there are two Americans: John Hasey and Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is still under construction, a site by Thierry de
Cervens, a surgeon (www.cervens.net), should be a required tour of
duty. It is partly a memorial to his father, Guy Rubin de Cervens,
a decorated captain of the legion's paratroopers who died in 1996.
It shows the legion's insignia, medals, uniforms and current
assignments. Its archives section has an open message board where
former legionnaires tell what it was really like. It lists famous
legionnaires, including Capitaine Danjou, hero of Camerone. And it
reprints a 1991 thank-you letter from a new honorary legionnaire,
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.

CODE RUSH: A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF A SILICON VALLEY SUPERNOVA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   (Eds: Michelle Slatalla is the co-author
(with Joshua Quittner) of ``Speeding the Net: The Inside Story of
Netscape and How It Challenged Microsoft.'')  
(lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no lack of drama in the history of Netscape, the
company that introduced millions of Internet users to the World
Wide Web and then was driven to its knees after locking horns with
Microsoft in a struggle known as the browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   When an independent film crew arrived at the company's offices
in Mountain View, Calif., in early 1998 to make an hourlong
documentary called ``Code Rush,'' scheduled to be broadcast by the
Public Broadcasting Service Thursday at 10 p.m. ET (check local
listings), Netscape was trying to resurrect its fortunes by
adopting a radical new strategy: giving away the source code, or
the underlying program instructions, to its browser in the hope of
blunting competition from Internet Explorer, which Microsoft was
giving away.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, looking inside a software company _ where employees
spend most of their time typing _ does not guarantee riveting
visuals even under the best of circumstances. But I can think of a
lot of moments in Netscape's history that might have been
interesting on film.
</P>
<P>
   There were, for example, the heady days of 1994, when the
company, still called Mosaic Communications, consisted mainly of a
handful of programmers who worked 120-hour weeks, napped fitfully
under their desks and refrained from bathing until the boss'
secretary implemented a forced hygiene regimen. And there was the
day in August 1995 when the success of Netscape's initial public
offering created instant millionaires among the ranks of the
company's young coders.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the ``Code Rush'' crew began its documentary,
Netscape's brief, wild ride had long been over. What remained was a
crippled company that had lost more than $85 million in the last
quarter of 1997. By 1998, Netscape had become a cautionary tale
about what can happen when optimistic entrepreneurs run into the
side of a big truck, especially a truck called Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, produced by Winton duPont Films and television
station KTEH of San Jose, Calif., follows a small team of Netscape
programmers engaged in open source code strategy. The idea was to
enlist the help of independent software writers to create bits and
pieces of a new and irresistible version of the Netscape browser
that would become the Internet standard. (It didn't happen, of
course.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead of capturing the thrill of a struggling company in the
throes of a desperate gambit, the cameras found sad-eyed
programmers working with an air of resignation on a project that
would not save their company. A viewer spends the better part of
the hour watching emotionless footage of programmers talking about
their work as they walk along claustrophobic corridors lined by
rows of the cookie-cutter cubicles where they live their lives.
Sometimes they talk about their work while driving. Oh, and
sometimes they type.
</P>
<P>
   Among the team's members were some of Netscape's earliest
employees, who had lived through the company's exhilarating early
days. But curiously, the film did not make much of the contrast
between what the company had been and what it had become. Only a
Netscape junkie will appreciate the painful scene in which
Netscape's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, tries to get past the
switchboard at Apple (ailing Apple) to get permission to use a bit
of code.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the grim loyalty the programmers exhibited toward
Netscape _ a lot of them appeared to own wardrobes that consisted
exclusively of clothing emblazoned with the company's distinctive N
logo _ made me wonder if this is what an inside look at the last
days of the Heaven's Gate sect might have looked like. Even after
the announcement in late 1998 that America Online would buy (or
more accurately, swallow) Netscape, some of the programmers were
insisting that the idea of Netscape would somehow survive. ``They
like us,'' one programmer says in ``Code Rush.'' ``They like what
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking-head commentary in the film rushes wildly through
shopworn themes: software as the new frontier, Silicon Valley as
the new gold rush, the difficulty of balancing work and family for
programmers who might stay at the office for 60 hours straight.
Somewhere in the confused narrative is the sad story of bright
people doomed to failure. It is hard to see how Netscape's
open-source gamble accomplished anything, either for the company in
the short term or for the open-source movement in general.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary points out that much of the Internet's early
growth was aided by programmers offering free code. But the big
question of how a commercial enterprise like Netscape would benefit
from releasing its source code remains. It shouldn't have. Not
after a year of filming.

<P>
   Even if you're on the lookout, tornadoes, blizzards, hurricanes
and floods are dangerous. But when storms sweep up suddenly,
perhaps in the middle of the night, it's all too easy to be caught
looking the other way.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is an early warning system, a way to learn that
dangerous weather is on the way. Even a heads-up warning only a few
minutes before catastrophe strikes is often enough time for someone
to figure out how to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system is available throughout most of the country,
thanks to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but
only a small part of the population listens to it. Most people
either don't know about the agency's network of 24-hour weather
radio stations, known as NOAA Weather Radio, or don't have radios
that can pick up the broadcasts. Or they don't want to wade through
maritime updates or irrelevant forecasts for areas far away.
</P>
<P>
   What would be really useful would be a system that could tell a
person's radio to wake up to issue a weather alert, so the radio
wouldn't have to be kept on all the time. It would also be
convenient to filter the weather information so listeners got only
the weather information they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Now NOAA has several new technologies that will do just that.
These advances come at a time when the damage from severe weather
is costing more than ever. The 10 most costly disasters in the
history of this country, including four hurricanes, have all
happened in the past decade, according to NOAA, which is part of
the Commerce Department. And as more people move to coastal areas,
more people will be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA's first weather radio station started broadcasting marine
and aviation advisories in the 1950s. Today nearly 500 transmitters
send out meteorological information gathered from the agency's 122
weather forecasting offices. Each transmitter can customize its
transmissions for its locale.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a local television weather forecaster announces a
``flash-flood watch'' or a ``tornado warning,'' that information
comes directly from NOAA, the only organization that uses those
terms to designate weather conditions. A watch means that current
atmospheric conditions could produce that storm, flood or tornado.
A warning means that such a danger has already been sighted.
</P>
<P>
   Often a few minutes' warning is all that is needed. In January
1999, the school superintendent in Beebe, Ark., Dr. Kieth Williams,
was monitoring NOAA radio and found out about a tornado watch. At 7
p.m., the tornado watch turned into a warning, Williams told 500
people at Beebe High School to evacuate the gym, which a twister
flattened 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 90 percent of the nation's population can get access to
weather service broadcasts _ as long as they have weather radios,
which can pick up one of the seven frequencies NOAA uses between
162.4 megahertz and 162.55 megahertz. About eight million weather
radios have been sold, only one for every 33 people. That includes
units on some luxury cars, like BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and Saabs,
as well as combination AM-FM weather radios from manufacturers like
Oregon Scientific, Midland Consumer Radio and Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   The use of weather radios is most important at night, when
tornadoes and floods can catch sleeping populations unawares, but
nobody wants to keep a radio blaring all night on the off chance
that a tornado might hit. So several years ago NOAA developed
technology that lets weather radios operate on standby, coming
alive only when a weather watch or warning is broadcast. An
inaudible subtone tells the radio to turn on, using a variation of
technology employed throughout Europe to activate car radios
automatically during dangerous traffic situations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the spoken warning that is broadcast over the
radio, weather radios that operate in standby mode also sound a
90-decibel alert tone, which is loud enough to wake just about
anyone. Certain models will also display a text message specifying
the exact weather event, like ``hurricane warning'' or ``flood
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers let users limit the number of times that a
report of an emergency will appear on the display. Or the user can
set the radio to display only certain emergencies; floods might
trigger the alert, for instance, while tornadoes would be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Still, information about severe weather in one area may turn out
to be irrelevant for a town 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that radios issue alerts for only local weather
problems, NOAA has created a digital technology called Specific
Area Messaging Encoding; radios with the SAME technology turn on
only when weather alerts are broadcast in specified areas.
</P>
<P>
   Radios can be set to respond to weather alerts for areas within
50 miles so they do not awaken people unnecessarily. ``Prior to
SAME technology, 50 percent of the weather alerts were false
alarms'' warning people of weather problems far away, said Jesse
Rotman, marketing manager for Oregon Scientific.
</P>
<P>
   To use the technology, a radio owner enters codes to specify the
areas of interest. The codes identify individual counties or parts
of counties; they are available on NOAA's Web site (www.noaa.gov)
or through a toll-free number, (888) 697-7263.
</P>
<P>
   Information about fast-moving dangerous weather does not lend
itself well to Internet transmissions. By the time someone logs on
to a Web site to learn about an approaching tornado, the computer
could be swept up in the maelstrom. But that does not mean that
weather-information technology will remain stuck in the analog age.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA envisions that weather radio capabilities will eventually
be embedded in cell phones and pagers (which could automatically
sound an alert tone in an emergency). Digital televisions, which
are designed to carry data as well as high-definition pictures,
could also be easily programmed to turn themselves on when they
received the right signal so they could sound a tone and broadcast
a weather alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a devastating tornado hit on Palm Sunday 1994, Vice
President Gore said that he wanted weather radios to be as
ubiquitous as smoke detectors,'' said George Wilcox, a NOAA
spokesman. ``That remains our goal.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Wow, talk about fund-raising
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush will collect a record-shattering $15 million in a
single night next month, lending his fund-raising prowess for the
first time to the Republican National Committee. Bush will headline
a black-tie gala in Washington on April 26 that will surpass the
previous one-day fund-raising record of $14 million set by his
former-president father in 1999, GOP officials said. And Bush's
one-day take will be nearly double the total President Clinton and
Al Gore together have been able to raise for the Democratic Party
in a series of fund-raisers across the country so far this year.
Turnout for the Bush affair is expected to be so large that it will
be held at a National Guard armory.
</P>
<P>
   YOU MEAN THEY MIGHT GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   At a time when campaign finances are a ballyhooed presidential
issue, George W. Bush's chief political strategist is a featured
speaker Friday for a group that is under fire for its fund-raising
to help elect Republican attorneys general across the nation. Karl
Rove is slated to brief the Republican Attorneys General
Association meeting in Austin, Texas. The Center for Public
Integrity and Texans for Public Justice criticized RAGA for
soliciting corporate donations and not disclosing specifically who
donates.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog groups contend that corporate donors are at least
potentially gaining influential allies and access, including access
to Rove.
</P>
<P>
   TOGETHER WHEN THEY NEED TO BE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and President Clinton plan to appear together April 15
at a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills for the Democratic National
Committee. The event's hosts will be the DreamWorks trio of Steven
Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. It'll be held at
Greystone, the fortresslike Tudor mansion built in 1928 and still
the largest home in Beverly Hills. Gore has kept his distance from
Clinton over the last few months. They last appeared at a
fund-raiser together Dec. 9 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   BEACHCOMBER RAKES UP MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Laguna Beach, Calif., for a
$2,000-a-plate luncheon at a private beachside home that raised
$90,000 for her Senate campaign on the opposite coast. The event
was organized by Janice and Roger Johnson, friends of the Clintons.
Roger, a former CEO or Western Digital Corp., once headed the
General Services Administration. The Los Angeles Times said the
three-course menu included pecan-encrusted chicken stuffed with
goat cheese, shrimp-and-crab enchiladas, lemon creme brulee, Louis
Roederer Reims champagne and souvenir candy bars embossed with
``HRC.''
</P>
<P>
   NO LITMUS TEST FOR WHITMAN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush suggested that support for abortion rights
wouldn't necessarily disqualify a potential running mate. Asked in
New Jersey on Wednesday about the chances of New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman as a possible No. 2, Bush said he isn't even
working on a list. But he also said their opposing views on
abortion were no reason ``we can't be pulling for the same thing,
being on the same team.'' Bush said, ``Good people can disagree on
the issue, and I understand that and I'm standing up here with a
friend of mine. ... I respect Governor Whitman's views, and I
respect her as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   REACH OUT AND TOUCH SOMEONE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John McCain talked by phone for the first
time in more than two weeks. They talked about getting together,
but set no date. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said his boss called
McCain from his car ``to reach out and to keep in touch and to be
in touch.'' The approach came after '96 GOP presidential candidate
Bob Dole lunched with McCain and then called Bush. Bush wants
McCain's endorsement, too, but McCain aides said it is too soon to
talk about that. Still, McCain adviser John Weaver said, ``The ice
has been broken.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME FAST TALKING NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party opened a campaign to rally enough public
support to enable expected nominee Pat Buchanan to qualify for the
nationally televised debates this fall. Party Chairman Pat Choate
said the step-by-step effort over the next six months is designed
to generate a 15 percent showing for Buchanan in nationwide polls
by September. The private Presidential Debate Commission requires a
15 percent threshold in the polls in order to win a place at the
debates. That's going to be tough: A CBS News survey out Monday
showed Buchanan drawing just 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY AND THE REFORMERS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party Chairman Pat Choate challenged Al Gore and George
W. Bush to prove they're really reformers by forgoing unregulated
campaign contributions. ``Either do the reform thing _ stop taking
soft money, stop taking PAC money _ or stop calling yourself a
reformer,'' Choate said at the National Press Club a day after a
federal judge upheld his chairmanship of the fractured
organization. But Choate said that stabilizing the party won't be
as difficult as skeptics contend: ``George Bush is going to have a
tougher time getting John McCain's endorsement than I am pulling
this party together.''
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY ON THE MOVE
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is in another search for a nominating
convention site. Party Chairman Pat Choate and party founder Ross
Perot had fought to hold it in Long Beach, Calif., this summer.
Their opponents, supporters of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, wanted
St. Paul. But while Reform Party members were fighting it out for
control, the Long Beach Convention &AMP; Entertainment Center was
rented to Jehovah's Witnesses immediately after the scheduled
convention. Now, not enough hotel rooms remain available, and there
won't be enough time to set up. Reform front-runner Pat Buchanan,
said sister and campaign manager Bay Buchanan, thinks Nashville,
Tenn., might be good.
</P>
<P>
   HANGING TOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says the Republicans are chasing their tails pursuing
questions about his missing e-mail and staff calls to the IRS, but
he offered little additional explanation about either in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``I hope they spend a lot of
time and a lot of energy on this,'' he said with a confident grin.
The AP said Gore appeared untroubled by the newest inquiries and
their implications for his presidential campaign, and was vague
about their details. Question: How much did he use e-mail in 1996
to communicate about fund-raising? Answer: ``Didn't.'' Q: Just
didn't? A: ``Well, first of all, I don't know. But whatever is
there will be disclosed _ fully and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   EXAGGERATING THE EXAGGERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Monthly explored how the media has been treating
Al Gore: An ``examination of dozens of these articles, which
purport to detail the chief cases of Gore's exaggerations and lies,
finds journalists often engaging in their own exaggerations or even
publishing outright falsehoods about Gore.'' The publication blames
the New York Times, Washington Post and other major news outlets
for taking Gore's comments out of context. For one, making it look
like Gore had claimed to have discovered the toxic-waste problems
at Love Canal in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO WASHINGTON FOR MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani raked in more than $100,000 at a Capitol Hill
fund-raiser for his Senate campaign in New York. John McCain put in
a brief appearance and nearly stole the limelight from the mayor.
McCain said he expects to campaign with Giuliani in New York next
week. ``I've been experiencing withdrawal from my defeat,'' McCain
joked. ``I've been spending all my time on the phone to Betty
Ford's place.'' Giuliani has raised $11.8 million for his race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton. She's raised $8 million, according
to federal election filings.
</P>
<P>
   REFORMERS AND PERCEPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll found voters believe Al Gore is more interested
in changing the system than is George W. Bush. Thirty-nine percent
said Gore wanted the status quo; 57 percent said Bush did. But 43
percent said Gore had made decisions based on campaign
contributions and 35 percent said Bush had. The poll had a margin
of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   CAN YOU PUSH A TAX INCREASE AND WIN?
</P>
<P>
   Republican challengers were expected. But New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen also will be facing a rival from her own Democratic
Party this year. State Sen. Mark Fernald, is planning to announce
formation of an exploratory committee. He's running, he said,
because the state is in a 27-month-old crisis over how to finance
its schools, and Shaheen has refused to consider an income tax as
the best source of money. Fernald is proposing an income tax
dedicated solely to paying for public education, and said that
polls showed that residents of New Hampshire, for all their
tax-hating habits, are ready for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE PUSHING AND SHOVING
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has been quiet about his future
political plans, but his lieutenant governor seems to be trying to
make Thompson's plans for him. Scott McCallum is telling voters
that Thompson, a Republican, will not seek re-election in two
years. McCallum, a likely Republican candidate for governor if his
boss steps aside, sent a fund-raising letter to 30,000 Wisconsin
voters recently saying that the governor is in his final term. The
New York Times said Thompson, apparently not pleased with the
letter, told his staff he wants to see McCallum's missives to
voters before they're sent.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The crawl space under our house has a dirt floor with poured
concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   We recently found a bunch of small insect wings that somebody
told us was most likely a sign of termite activity in or around our
house.
</P>
<P>
   Could termites be a threat to our house, even though the walls
are concrete and there is no wood in contact with the ground?
</P>
<P>
   A: Termites can sense cellulose (their principal source of food)
many feet away, including the wood floor beams across the top of
your crawl space.
</P>
<P>
   They can't go up through concrete (unless there are cracks that
they can travel through) but they can and do build mud tunnels
along the surface of the concrete, as shown in the illustration.
</P>
<P>
   These enable the termites to travel from the ground up to the
wood beams without exposing them to light and air (which they must
avoid).
</P>
<P>
   If you see such tunnels in the crawl space there is a good
chance that there are termites present.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the winter deep piles of snow accumulate around the bottom
ends of our downspouts which then often fill up with water that
backs up into the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn causes water to back up onto the roof, causing
leaks in our ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think that if I cut off the end of each downspout to
about 12 to 15 inches above the ground this will prevent them from
getting buried in deep snow and so allow better drainage?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trouble with doing this is that when there is no snow,
water will come pouring out in a heavy stream that will wash away
soil and/or turf. The water will also not get carried away from the
house as it would do if it had seeped into the soil slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in freezing weather ice can still form on the inside and
cause a blockage that will cause water to back up.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution to your problem would be to either install
heating cables along the roof edges, or to have a roofer install
proper flashing material along the bottom three or four rows of
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My old house has plaster walls and we removed the wallpaper
in our bathroom because we wanted to paint the walls and ceiling in
that room.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the wallpaper we found that part of the wall is
old plaster that is grooved (from tiles), part is dry wall and part
is wood that was put up to cover a hole where a former cabinet was
installed.
</P>
<P>
   What would you recommend to cover all this and end up with a
smooth surface suitable for painting?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds to me as though your best bet would be to install
drywall panels over everything, using panel adhesive and a few
nails (where necessary).
</P>
<P>
   You can fill and seal the seams with tape and joint cement sold
for this purpose, and you will end up with a smooth surface that
can be properly painted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My home has stucco on the outside that has been painted
several times with a popular type of powdered cement paint that is
mixed with water.
</P>
<P>
   I now want to repaint with a ready mixed latex paint that will
be simpler and easier to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Can this be done and, if so, are there any special preparations
or sealers required?
</P>
<P>
   A: It can be done, but you must remember that those old cement
paint finishes often develop considerable chalking and powdering as
they age, so you have to make certain all this powdery residue is
removed before painting _ preferably by power washing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, make sure you get rid of all peeling and flaking before
you apply the new coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Read the label on the can to determine if any type of sealer or
primer is required as a first coat.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``TERMITE MUD TUNNELS'' goes with this

</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Termites can sometimes build mud tunnels on the surface
of concrete walls to enable them to travel from the soil up to the
wood beams without exposing them to the air.

METAL ROAD WARRIORS PANTERA UNDAUNTED BY GAP BETWEEN CDs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For most of the '90s, Arlington metal heroes
Pantera worked, and worked, and worked some more: Record a new CD,
tour for months on end, record a new CD, tour for months on end.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked. The band went from playing Joe's Garage to
co-headlining Ozzfest and opening for Black Sabbath during the
band's farewell U.S. tour. Several of their CDs, most notably
1994's ``Far Beyond Driven,'' ascended to the national pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   So when drummer Vinnie Abbott is asked about the long gap
between 1996's ``The Great Southern Trendkill'' and the new
``Reinventing the Steel,'' he laughs a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had too many opportunities to play,'' he says. ``We
toured `Trendkill' for two years, and then Black Sabbath calls, and
there's no way we're turnin' 'em down, and we get back and they
call again. And then Metallica called and asked us to play in
Mexico before 70,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was last summer before the band members finally took a
breather. They spent most of that time crafting ``Reinventing the
Steel'' but, ``If you condense it down, we recorded for four to six
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted time to go away from the songs and evaluate them,
instead of being under a really tight deadline like in the past,''
Abbott says. ``We got a chance to rewrite some songs and get what
we felt was the best of them. `Trendkill' was released when metal
was at an all-time low, and we made the most abrasive, brutal
record we could, and we'd gotten that out of our system. We didn't
feel like we really needed to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   And true enough, ``Steel'' is not the hardest, most punishing
record in the Pantera catalog _ which is not a slight. There's
certainly enough of the band's pummeling thrash, but there's also
more than a hint of the blues-boogie of ZZ Top, as well as touches
of Thin Lizzy and Judas Priest, bands whose glory days predated the
'80s, when thrash came to the fore via Slayer, Metallica and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title is a play on Judas Priest's `British Steel'
record,'' Abbott says. ``Yeah, there are some songs that use that
shuffle vibe; it's been way overlooked, and not enough bands use
it. There's nothing wrong with us grabbing our roots. There's a
void for our music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trendkill'' addressed people jumping on musical bandwagons
lyrically; ``Steel,'' Abbott says, does it musically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much reinventing anything _ you can't reinvent the
wheel _ but it is about doing metal music played by people,'' he
says. ``So much music is made by drum loops and synthesizers. And
we're staying with hard music played from the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never follow this trend or that trend, and we've never
written a song for the radio. The record is 10 songs, a straight-up
rock record. It doesn't have to have drum loops or a drum machine
to make it sound like it's from the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``Revolution Is My Name,'' would seem to prove
the point. The song is getting more airplay than anything else the
band has done, Abbott says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 'N Sync wasn't coming out this week, I think we'd have the
potential to have a No. 1 CD,'' he says. ``I think the support will
be there. I know there's people out there saying, `It's been four
years. Pantera's going to fail.' I just want to put that to rest.''

PRESIDIO EVOLVING INTO HYBRID OF NATIONAL PARK AND PRIVATE
DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Optional sidebar at end of article . )  
 (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The bugles are silent now. But in secluded vales
of eucalyptus and along once-dusty parade grounds lined with
red-brick Victorians, history still stands watch over the Presidio,
the windswept 1,480-acre former Army base wrapped by the headlands
of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when this National Historic Landmark _ about twice
the size of New York's Central Park _ became a national park, a
novel and much-debated experiment in preservation and park planning
has been underway at the 200-year-old military garrison. Once the
northernmost point of the Spanish Empire, it is a place that,
though part of the city, still feels like the edge of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Home to some 470 historic structures and now about 2,000 people,
the Presidio is, as one resident puts it, an ``oddball'' national
park _ the only one that is required by Congress to pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of this vast, wild urban terrain of
wildflower-covered sea cliffs and extraordinary architecture _
officers' homes, cavalry stables, airline hangars, a psychiatric
ward _ is presided over by the Presidio Trust, a corporation
created by Congress that assumed control over 80 percent of the
park two years ago (the park service controls the rest).
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio is a delicate work in progress, and the trust a
controversial landlord. Born in a cost-cutting Republican Congress
that had seriously considered selling off this verdant jewel, the
trust has a dual, and, some critics say, impossible mission: to
preserve and protect the Presidio while making the park
economically self-sufficient by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The Force may be with them. To create an ``economic engine''
generating around $5 million a year toward the $36 million the
trust estimates it will cost annually to maintain the park, the
filmmaker George Lucas, after a heated competition, recently won
preliminary approval to build a 23-acre Digital Arts Center on the
site of a dilapidated 1960s hospital. He envisions a ``Lincoln
Center West,'' he has said, a corporate campus, stylistically
drawing on Presidio military architecture that would house five
Lucas enterprises, including Industrial Light and Magic, his
special effects and animation company.
</P>
<P>
   Where enlisted men once exchanged war stories in mess halls,
there is now talk about ``synergy'' and wireless Internet access.
So far, about 80 historic structures have been rehabilitated. Among
the new tenants, a quirky array of businesses and not-for-profits,
are Fiber Futures (dedicated to tree-free paper), the Pachamama
Alliance (protects indigenous Amazon cultures), Trash Talk (a waste
prevention radio show) and the San Francisco Film Center, a group
of 14 film-related businesses and organizations that spent $6
million to restore a sprawling mission revival barracks built by
the WPA. The Sundance Institute is eyeing a mission revival post
theater as a potential cinema for independent films.
</P>
<P>
   Development has long been planned for the site. But some charge
that the Lucas proposal, along with the rental of some houses for
upwards of $5,000 a month, signifies the intrusion of a business
culture into a national park. And that the need to generate income
may irrevocably change the nature of the place, recasting the
Presidio as an elite city-within-a-city for wealthy individuals and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Presidio, Congress looked at one thing and one thing
only _ how much would it cost?'' said Brian Huse, Pacific Region
director of the National Parks Conservation Association, a private
watchdog group. ``The question has become: Is it possible to
preserve the Presidio's natural and historic treasures unimpaired
with a mandate to raise money off the very resources we're trying
to protect?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be inspired here,'' said Mark Lindner, who
is the unofficial ``mayor'' of his neighborhood, called Simon's
Loop, and president of Food, Land and People, an environmental
organization. ``Being in the Presidio helps us to think bigger than
we normally think.''
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of dotcoms like WebMD with the still-operating
Army PX, the Sustainability Art Show with Burger King _ not to
mention a nudist beach beside a string of bunkers with retractable
cannons _ gives the latter-day Presidio a sort of loopy charm. It
has always been a place of secret corners awaiting discovery, like
the tombstone in the pet cemetery that reads ``SKIPPER: Best Damm
Dog We Ever Had.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's longest continuously operating military base until
1994, the Presidio parallels America's growth as a world power.
Established in 1776 as El Presidio de San Francisco, an isolated
garrison (a fragment of the original adobe foundation can be seen
inside the Officers Club), the Presidio was briefly controlled by
Mexico prior to 1847. It was not then a place of beauty. ``The view
of the bay is fine from the high hills,'' noted a visiting Army
officer. ``But everything looks dirty and sandy; you cannot void
the impression that it is a mean country.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Civil War, it had become one of the nation's most
important military complexes, adding a central parade ground
surrounded by rows of enlisted men's barracks and Officers' Row, a
Civil War streetscape that survives essentially unchanged. The
Presidio was the central deployment point for the Indian campaigns,
the Spanish-American War and Pacific operations.
</P>
<P>
   Its winding, thickly forested landscape _ highly unusual for a
military base, where roads and terrain are usually flat and
straight _ was strongly influenced by the late-19th-century City
Beautiful movement. A foresighted Army engineer, Major William A.
Jones, planted the now-historic forests of eucalyptus, cypress and
pine in orderly rows, like soldiers in formation.
</P>
<P>
   A role model for the rest of the new Presidio is the Thoreau
Center for Sustainability, where some 50 organizations, most of
them nonprofit, have taken over a dilapidated hospital complex and
restored it according to green principles. At its heart is a
three-story white clapboard hospital (1899), where pressed tin
ceilings and Victorian banisters now commune with a glass canopied
entryway with photovoltaic panels.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest success story so far may be at Crissy Field, a 1921
airfield from which Army aviators and De Havilland biplanes once
patrolled the skies. After decades of environmental abuse, this
mile-and-a-half stretch of waterfront beside the Golden Gate Bridge
has been reborn as one of the country's most ambitious public
spaces, under the aegis of the National Park Service, which still
oversees the base's perimeter, and the Golden Gate National Parks
Association, which raised $32 million in private funds to reclaim
the site. It opens this year, replacing 70 acres of asphalt with a
recreated tidal marsh and native grasses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But this is not Yellowstone or Yosemite. The Presidio sits on
prime real estate in one of the world's most desirable cities. The
Lucas proposal, and the decision to rent historic buildings at
fair-market prices, have tenants like Dorie Heeren, 49, who is
married to a park service ranger, frankly worried. ``This is no
longer going to be a national park,'' Heeren said. ``My feeling is
that this will be a gated community.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust, overseen by a seven-member presidentially appointed
board, is obliged to follow federal environmental and historic
preservation guidelines. It was created based on Congress' view
that the scope and complexity of the Presidio required real estate
expertise that was beyond the National Park Service. Board members
include Donald Fisher, founder and chairman of the Gap, and William
K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions have come to roost recently around the question of
who gets to live in the Presidio's 1,100 housing units. Right now,
the full-time Presidio community is a hodgepodge of park service
employees, office workers, students, park police and firefighters,
about 150 remaining military families (who will be phased out over
five years), and members of the public who can afford the rents,
which range from $450 or so for a student single to $6,000 a month
for an officer's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Jim Meadows, the trust's executive director, is a
community of people who live and work in the Presidio, from low
earners to CEOs _ people like Leanne Hoadley, 32, who lives in a
complex mostly for students. ``I live in an ugly apartment,'' she
said. ``But I'm looking over the Pacific Ocean 10 minutes from
Robin Williams' house.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the trust has not established a strong connection with
the community or the National Park Service. ``There's an insularity
that's unfortunate,'' said Ed Blakely, a former board member who is
now dean of the School of Management and Urban Policy at the New
School in New York. ``The trust is hunkering down rather than
opening up.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand test case may be the Letterman Digital Center, as the
Lucas complex would be known, where local environmentalists and
others have raised concerns about traffic, water quality and the
appropriate scale and density for a national park. Speaking at the
University of California at Berkeley last month, Lucas said, ``I
think the park should stay a park.'' But he also observed: ``One of
the prominent issues is: What is the park? There's no Old Faithful,
there's no Half Dome, there's no Grand Canyon there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm Ltd., described a
corporate campus with underground parking for 1,500 cars, various
public spaces from cafes and coffee bars to a tuition-free digital
training institute, and a special-effects visual archive open by
appointment. ``No one wants to create Universal Studios at the
Presidio,'' he said. But in a private filmmaking campus some
foresee a waning of the soul and spirit of America's great national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant departure for a national park,'' said
Drummond Pike, president of the Tides Foundation, in the Thoreau
Center, which funds environmental and social justice projects. ``I
don't believe the public interest is served by having Lucas as a
tenant, though it will be nicer to have Lucas than a bunch of
venture capitalists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Meyer, a board member and Bay Area environmentalist, argues
that the Lucas plan, which must still pass various environmental
and design reviews, creates a financial entity that will keep the
rest of the Presidio intact as a park. She agrees with Meadows of
the trust, who says that preservation and self-sufficiency aren't
mutually exclusive. ``If we do our job right,'' he said, ``the
Presidio will look a great deal like it does today, with 20 percent
more open space and historic buildings all renovated to code.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kennedy, a former director of the National Park Service,
noted that other parks aren't expected to pay for themselves and
that the trust concept, born of political compromise, must be
watched zealously. ``The question,'' he said, ``is how many
transactions do you consummate during the course of this process
toward self-sufficiency that you will regret later?''
</P>
<P>
   The park service, which will still be largely responsible for
interpreting the park to visitors, has recently brought in a team
from the Smithsonian Institution to help dream up new museums and
exhibits for the site.
</P>
<P>
   For all the future-thinking, wireless or otherwise, it is still
the past that will anchor this place, where soldiers' tombs peek
through eucalyptus trees. Sensitive reshaping is not for the meek,
but it seems well worth the fight to Richard Moe, president of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, who is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not trouble free,'' he said, ``and there are and will be
inevitable tensions in the formula.'' The good news, he said, ``is
that nobody is talking about tearing down historic buildings, but
rather, preserving them in innovative ways.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the Presidio contains the architecture of
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many empty buildings here,'' said Marcia
Smith-White, head of the neighborhood association, ``you find
yourself thinking, `Why not?'''

 SAN FRANCISCO: `Why not?''' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1,480-acre Presidio of San Francisco, on the Golden Gate,
was a military post from 1776 to 1994. Today it is a national park
featuring historic forests, rare plants and an outdoor museum of
American architecture. By 2013, its 470 historic buildings will
house a community of organizations and businesses that should make
the park self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery Street Barracks Visitor Center in the 1890s brick
barracks facing the parade ground is the best place to start
exploring the park. The mile-long self-guided walk circling the
heart of the post spans 200 years of military history and American
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1917 Presidio Fire Station was sensitively updated in 1997.
The National Military Cemetery dates from 1884. The 1932 Spanish
colonial-style Post Chapel , nearby, has a WPA mural visible from
the outside. The 1.5-mile Golden Gate Promenade offers spectacular
views of the bay and the city. It leads to the Crissy Field Marsh
Restoration, a stretch of restored beach, tidal marsh and
native-plant-covered dunes that replaced 70 acres of asphalt from a
1921 airfield. This $32 million restoration has been a decade in
the making.

REDS AND WHITES, AND SHIPPING BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To avoid frivolous online purchases that I might later regret, I
follow a simple rule: Before buying, I close my eyes and conjure an
image of my husband. I see him arriving home in the dark and
tripping over yet another parcel that UPS has left on the front
stoop. Then with his endearing, trademark look of deep suspicion,
he sniffs the package before gingerly handing it to me and asks,
``This isn't a bomb, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   If I cannot imagine myself reassuring him in that same calming
tone I use to trick the baby into a bath that the adorable green
glass bunny dish I bought from Martha Stewart's Web site is
absolutely essential to the efficient functioning of our household,
then I know I should not buy the item.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this rule does not always work. I did recently sneak
the bunny dish into the house and, although charmed by his little
ears, I am disheartened that I so easily fell prey to temptation. I
know that it is better in the long run to restrict myself to those
practical products that we both agree are necessary to keep our
household running smoothly. And that is why I spent much of last
week searching online for wine.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't looking for just any wine but a red wine from the
Franciacorta region of Italy. In the hills near Lake Iseo,
Franciacorta often arrives at the table in a wide-mouthed ceramic
pitcher that would be more likely, in this country, to hold ice
water.
</P>
<P>
   The wine tastes like violets, only better because you do not
have to chew the petals, and is not widely available in the United
States. The reason for the scarcity, according to one of the
informative sites I found at www &QL; 
.cucina.italynet.com, is that the region's 179 producers of red,
white and sparkling wines inhabit only a small geographic area in
the province of Brescia (``number of hectares inscribed: 636.14'').
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for wine, I realized how much the Internet has spoiled
me. While I do not know how big a hectare is _ and frankly, do not
care _ I have come to believe that I can buy just about anything I
want, from just about any hectare on earth. Emboldened by past
triumphs (French cheeses and Chinese art posters come to mind), I
gamely spent a couple of hours hunting for an Italian wine seller
who would ship Franciacorta to me.
</P>
<P>
   I was not even deterred by the fact that most Italian Web sites
are written in Italian. That is, until after I pasted a phrase into
AltaVista's free Italian-English translator and realized that
instead of ordering wine, I had been on the verge of applying for
admittance to a sanatorium called the House of Clinical Private
Cure Saint Rocco di Franciacorta. As I glanced at the green bunny
on my bookshelf, I realized that an extended stay might not have
been a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to communicate my wishes in Italian, I turned,
reluctantly, to the small group of online wine retailers whose
headquarters are in the United States. I have in the past avoided
them for several reasons: the shipping costs always seemed
extremely expensive, it could take up to 10 business days to
receive an order and, most important, the selection had been
extremely limited by the regulatory climate in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That is a nice way of saying it is impossible to understand the
mishmash of state laws that govern liquor distribution. After
Prohibition, the federal government mandated a three-tier system of
distribution requiring wine producers to sell to wholesalers who
sell to retailers, and then put the states in charge of
implementing it as they saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some wines are for sale in some states but not in
others. Depending on where you live, half-bottles may be illegal,
or containers larger than a gallon may be illegal, or even asking
your neighbor to pick up a bottle for you while he is at the store
may be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, a bottle may have to pass through all three
tiers before it reaches your doorstep. In others, the wine may be
shipped directly, but the paperwork must pass through all the
tiers. And some states like Georgia and Utah and Tennessee so
heartily discourage direct shipments to individuals that online
wine sellers find themselves scratching their heads in trying to
devise legal routes around the roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who were paid to understand how the system works
told me they often could not. ``I genuinely try to understand the
market and I really gave up after talking to some people who knew
it well,'' said Ken Cassar, a senior retail analyst at Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know, the more involved and confusing it gets,''
said Michael J. Rusinko, a partner in Andersen Consulting's retail
division.
</P>
<P>
   Some brave online merchants like Wine.com, Winebins.com,
eVine-yard.com and Ambrosiawine.com have managed in the past few
months to put together more sophisticated shipping systems and can
send wine to 17 to 45 states, depending on the seller. With
inventories as large as 2,500 different wines (compared with the
400 or so that an offline store might stock), the selection is
getting much better.
</P>
<P>
   But then consider that the nation annually produces 10,000
varieties of wine under 2,100 brands. ``The promise of availability
on the Internet is not yet fulfilled when it comes to wine,'' said
Jeremy Benson, the executive director of Free the Grapes, a
coalition of consumers and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit an online wine seller, the first thing you should
do is look for a query box on the home page where you can type in
the name of your state. Had I done that at eVineyard.com, I could
have avoided the heartbreak of learning that the site sells
Bellavista's sparkling Franciacorta for $28.39 but not to people
who live in New York. None of the other three sites I visited
offered Franciacorta either.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Wine.com's chief executive, Bill Newlands, to
complain, he said: ``One of our wine merchants just came back from
a run-through of many of the European areas because we want to
broaden our selection. Don't lose faith.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt mollified enough to browse on Wine.com, where I found an
article called ``Twelve Little Known Facts About Wine,'' which
included the heartening news that dry wine may be a significant aid
in the treatment of obesity, the claim that the majority of
hospitals in California have wine on their menus and the reassuring
information that moderate drinkers are on average of higher
intelligence than nondrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   So how could I not take a serious look at the site's selection
of 15 labels from the Bonny Doon winery in Northern California?
Only 10 were available to New Yorkers, but that was nine more than
my local wine store usually offers. I ordered three bottles, for a
total of $40 (including $10.95 for shipping).
</P>
<P>
   At least I know UPS will not leave the box on the stoop for my
husband to trip over. The law requires a signature from a recipient
who is 21 or older. Those glass bunnies are starting to look better
already. &QL;

   AL-AMIN _ ATLANTA _ Security has been beefed up at the
Montgomery County Jail since Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin checked in.
Sheriff D.T. Marshall won't say how many additional deputies are on
duty, but he says some additional security measures have been put
in place. Marshall continues to say Al-Amin isn't being treated
unfairly in jail. A chaplain from the Ga. Departmetn of Corrections
seems eager to make accommodations for Al-Amin to practice his
Muslim faith when he is brought back here. He visited Al-Amin
recently to talk that over. The extradition papers, in the
meantime, were delivered today. But they were missing some
important document. It is being brought to Alabama this afternoon.

   ARCHIVES-SAVED _ ATLANTA _ A buildings fire investigator said
Wednesday that there was no damage to the National Archives and
Records center in East Point, which is near the site of a large
factory fire Tuesday. Meanwhile, archives directors say they are
moving forward and not set back by the fire. We also offer more
color about the noteworthy center, which opened in Atlanta in 1951
and moved into its present site in 1954. The building houses
records of the CDC, NASA, the Tuskegee Institute's syphillis study
and court papers for numerous civil rights cases. (Carter, Atlanta

   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Listen closely. The dead might be talking. But
don't be alarmed. It's not the chain-rattling, haunting kind of
talking. Instead, the dead are spinning their tales into the web of
history even as they rest in local cemeteries _ cemeteries that
play an important role in preserving the past, according to Dr.
Norman Black. Black is a Longview, Texas, dentist who has headed
the Gregg County Historical Commission for 15 years. ``We don't
have anything spectacular here, but we do have some oddities,''
Black said. Among those oddities is a mystery that captivated
Longview in 1975. (Hammer, Longview News Journal). MOVED.

 &HT;    It's a Yearwood to remember
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her most mature album to date, the Monticello songstress
pours stunning depth and emotion into 12 tracks that weave the
accessibility of pop melodies with the earthy traditionalism of
country. Unlike many of today's crop of Nashville albums, this CD
isn't cluttered with cheaply sentimental electric piano and B-drama
strings. Most tunes are built on the beautiful simplicity of James
Taylor-esque acoustic guitar, with dobros, mandolin, fiddle and
pedal steel dripping around Yearwood's warm honey vocals like
barrel-aged whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Like Linda Ronstadt in the '70s, Yearwood has a knack for
finding great writers and interpreting their work with nearly
hypnotic emotional seduction. When she wails ``Where are You Now,''
the lump-in-the-throat opening tune by Kim Richey and Mary Chapin
Carpenter, it's like reading a tear-stained diary. ``Some Days (Are
Better Than Others)'' is the weary resignation of the next morning.
Yearwood yodels Bruce Springsteen's ``Sad Eyes'' as a sweet
seduction, her voice flirting with a pedal steel like strangers
exchanging glances at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   On the title track Yearwood confidently sings, ``I offer no
apologies for the things I believe and say.'' Trisha, you don't
have to. Just keep it up.

 &HT;    Thriller packs otherworldly wallop
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    ''c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety, but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on what the
relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to the living
world might be. Plus, this film has the best, and loveliest,
last-act twist of last year.
</P>
<P>
   `The Sixth Sense'
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13 / Our critic's grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   OTHER RELEASES:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Last Night'' (R) _ A lovely, offbeat look at the end of the
world. Unlike Hollywood's special-effects behemoths, Canadian
writer-director-actor Don McKellar treats the final apocalypse with
a dry wit and a sense of decorum that consciously tweaks that
nation's reputation for civility. A strong ensemble cast
(especially Sandra Oh) relate a variety of tales that are simple on
the surface, but cut deep. Grade: B +
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Crazy in Alabama'' (PG-13) _ An odd mix of civil rights
drama and Southern Gothic comedy that goes down just fine. The
movie splits time between the wild adventures of Lucille (Melanie
Griffith), who breaks out of a small Alabama town and heads West
and a graver story back home, about the struggle for civil rights.
Griffith does her best work since ``Working Girl,'' and hubby
Antonio Banderas' direction is professional, even if it doesn't
ever fully catch fire. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Body Shots'' (R) _ Here's proof positive that being
twentysomething isn't pretty. Eight party-hearty twentysomethings
(including ``Scream 2's'' Jerry O'Connell) traipse L.A. nightlife,
get superdrunk and start having rampant sex. The big question for
two in the group: was it consensual sex or rape? Quick, brutal and
ugly, the movie may not be any fun, but it sure delivers the
dramatic goods. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Omega Code'' (PG-13) _ The evangelical Trinity
Broadcasting Network made this big-screen film, starring Michael
York and Casper Van Dien in an overly talkative tale reminiscent of
the biblical book of Revelation. As a wealthy businessman, York
steals and uses a secret biblical code to effect a world takeover.
The hammy Van Dien plays a glam gadabout and motivational leader
who uncovers York's plot and must act to save the globe.The movie
has no obscenities, no sex, little blood and a minimum of bullets.
It also doesn't have much of a script. Priced to buy: $22.95 VHS,
$24.95 DVD. Grade: C

two, you can do what Drag-On does, fade into the stars' backdrop.
Though this is his debut, the 20-year-old rapper is familiar
because he's performed on DMX's multi-platinum albums and Eve's
million-selling debut. They are all part of the Ruff Ryders, a
hip-hop circle known for both party anthems and the occasional
meaningful tune, neither of which Drag-On does well here. Like all
the Ruff Ryders' records, his has the keyboard-crafted horns and
strings that have become producer Swizz Beatz specialty. But apart
from DMX's hefty growl and Eve's confident approach, Drag-On's
commonplace delivery is hardly fire _ the ``Opposite of H20.''

   Drag-On will perform on the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money tour April 9
at Philips Arena.

   As she first proved on her 1975 debut, ``Horses,'' Patti Smith
is, to borrow a phrase from Todd Rundgren, a wizard and a true
star. She coaxes pure gold from the base elements of rock 'n' roll
and poetry. That's a deadly combination in lesser hands, but Smith
is that rare successful alchemist. On her eighth album in 25 years,
Smith sounds re-energized. The rockers are up there with her best.
``Glitter in Their Eyes,'' with backing vocals from Michaal Stipe,
and ``Persuasion,'' highlighted by a sinuous guitar solo from
Smith's teenage son Jackson, compare favorably with Smith classics
such as ``25th Floor'' and ``Free Money.'' Her softer side comes
through in ``China Bird,'' a sweet lullaby that showcases Smith's
powerful vocals. Her imperfect, emotionally rich voice is a
remarkable instrument. Though it's rarely described as pretty, it
conveys more raw feeling than any '90s pop diva.

   Pray for a miracle to get through this cloying collection of
sugar-pop tunes from the upcoming mini-series about the life of
Christ. With the exception of an opening fanfare by Patrick
Williams and the angelic ``Pie Jesu'' closing hymn from diva Sarah
Brightman, this CD sounds like Galillee has become an Orlando theme
park and we are visiting Holyland. Most tunes from artists such as
Edwin McCain (``Jesus, He Loves Me'') and Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish
(``City by a River'') are uninspired pop puff pieces. Edgier
tracks, such as a cover of ``Spirit in the Sky'' by DC Talk, sound
ridiculous when imagined alongside healing lepers and raising
Lazarus from the dead. The single from Leann Rimes, ``I Need You,''
is soaring up the pop charts, but sounds like typical
closing-credit melodrama. Sure, ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' used
rock and roll to tell the Christ story, but at least it was an
opera built on dramatic plot development and creative original
music. This is just Jukebox Jesus.

 &HT;    Tamar not resting on sister's laurels
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder Tamar decided not to boost her solo debut by adding
the heft of her last name. All you have to do is fast forward to
the bridge of track number six, the ballad ``If You Don't Wanna
Love Me.'' The breathy vibrato and phrasings say _ shout, even _
that this is definitely someone who shares the same impressive gene
pool as R&AMP;B singer Toni Braxton. The difference between Tamar and
big sis is you're not likely to find Toni on a record with Jermaine
Dupri and Amil rapping, as Tamar is on ``Get None.'' And somehow
the profane language Tamar uses on ``No Disrespect'' would probably
be startling coming from her sibling, inoffensive enough to do a
Disney-produced Super Bowl halftime. But that's what distinguishes
Tamar not only from Toni but from many in her peer group who don't
offer this vocal, lyrical and musical range.

 &HT;    Oscar ceremony spurs a look at an earlier generation
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' showed a lot of flower power at
Sunday/Monday's Oscars (host Billy Crystal is right; the ceremony
is a two-day affair). That turned out to be oddly fitting since the
rest of the evening was dotted with reminders of the flower-power
generation, the young Turks of the '60s and '70s who've become the
Old Guard of the '90s. Consider a few of these connections and have
your own '60s film festival.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Angelina Jolie, winner of best supporting actress for ``Girl,
Interrupted,'' acknowledged her father, Jon Voight, saying,
``You're a great actor, but you are a better dad.''
</P>
<P>
   You could rent: ``Midnight Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Voight won his Oscar (making them father-daughter Oscar-winners
like Henry and Jane Fonda, John and Anjelica Huston and Vincente
and Liza Minnelli) in the late '70s for ``Coming Home,'' but the
world discovered him in 1969's ``Midnight Cowboy,'' the first _ and
so far, only _ X-rated movie to be named best picture. As Joe Buck,
the naive hustler who comes to New York and is befriended by the
seedy but streetwise Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), Voight is all
dumb-hick gullibility. The lessons he learns are about users and
losers, loyalty and the lies of the good life. Ironically, Voight
was not the first choice of director John Schlesinger. He wanted
Michael Sarrazin, but the actor was tied up on another project.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michael Caine, winner of best supporting actor for ``The Cider
House Rules,'' earned a standing ovation and a place in future
Oscar clips with his gracious acceptance speech: ``I'm here to
represent you as what I hope you'll all be _ a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   You could rent: ``Alfie.''
</P>
<P>
   Caine had made almost a half-dozen films before his star was
born in this madly mod, very Swinging '60s flick about a Cockney
hustler (hmm, do we sense a trend?) seducing and abandoning a
variety of women. However, unlike Joe Buck, Alfie is a knowing cad
whose life lesson is more like a comeuppance. But like Voight,
Caine wasn't first choice for the role. It was offered to his pal
Terence Stamp and in his memoir, ``What's It All About'' (taken
from the title song of you know what), Caine recalls trying to
convince Stamp to take the part. He didn't think he had a chance
because he'd failed to be cast in the play. Stamp refused and the
next thing you know, Caine had the role. And, a few months later,
his first Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best actor Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') cited the
inspiration he'd gotten from seeing Jack Lemmon in ``The
Apartment'' when he accepted his award. He was followed by his
director and fellow Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, who paid homage to
Billy Wilder. Who just happened to have directed Lemmon in ``The
Apartment'' (1960). Which just happened to win an Oscar for best
picture and best director.
</P>
<P>
   You could rent: ``The Apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon is a faceless clerk in a huge Manhattan conglomerate who
realizes he can get ahead by making his tiny in-town apartment
available to a number of philandering senior execs (among them,
Fred MacMurray, who hasn't been this sleazy since he made ``Double
Indemnity'' for Wilder in the '40s; at the time of ``The
Apartment,'' he was more into his Disney ``Absent Minded
Professor'' mode). Shirley MacLaine is the pixieish, victimized
elevator operator who ends up at Lemmon's place more than once. An
interesting everybody's-a-critic aside: In the original script,
Lemmon has tickets to ``The Sound of Music,'' but Wilder saw the
musical while filming in Manhattan and hated it so much he switched
the tickets to ``The Music Man.''

 &HT;    Modern design trickles down to tickle the workaday world
 &HT;    By Michelle C. Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Target has designs on you _ not to mention a stampede of other
big box stores eagerly following the lead. It's hard to miss the
design revolution taking place in the aisles of the nation's mass
merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Cindy Antila of Lilburn was perusing a
selection of clocks by Robert Abbey and Michael Graves at the
Snellville Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them! They are all beautiful, different, modern
designs,'' says Antila of the designer items. ``I come in to buy
one thing, and I could redo my house.''
</P>
<P>
   At Target, established designers including Graves, Abbey,
Philippe Starck and Peter Max are creating something of a design
sensation. Linens &AMP; Things, Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond and the Container
Store have joined the fray with designs by Umbra, Thomas Stender
and Guzzini. And don't forget Martha Stewart, whose designs for
Kmart have prompted some to call the store ``Kmartha.''
</P>
<P>
   What's with designer looks at discount prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``America is ready to recognize good design at a good price,''
says Michele Caniato, vice president of Culture &AMP; Commerce. As
Starck's U.S. agent, Culture &AMP; Commerce was instrumental in forging
the connection between the French designer and Target.
</P>
<P>
   Starck's first foray into mass-market design is a minimalist
chair reflective of his signature style. It has a $89.99 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The design world is taking notice of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited a long time for this,'' says Lorianne Justice,
director of the industrial design program at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who served as a juror in the Designs of the Decade
awards sponsored by Business Week magazine and the Industrial
Designers Society of America last winter, applauds U.S. efforts to
catch up with Denmark, Italy, Germany and Japan in design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really pleased that people are becoming attuned to having
things that are well-designed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, good design means good business. In a market
saturated with retailers, cost-cutting alone isn't enough to
attract shoppers. You've got to stand out. ``Target has been on the
forefront of establishing a distinctive identity,'' says Candace
Corlett, a principal with WSL Strategic Retail consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable sophistication'' is what Gerald Celente, director
of Trends Research Inc., calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Target is giving people what they want before they know they
want it,'' says Celente.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's a marketing strategy that works.
</P>
<P>
   Starck recently signed a contract with Target for about 100
items to be released in January of 2001. Wal-Mart has a deal with
Noritake Co. Inc. for a line of china, Epoch Exclusives, due to
arrive in select supercenters this spring.
</P>
<P>
   And look who else is hopping on the design trend bandwagon:
Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse. The company is working with
fashion designer Alexander Julian to develop a line of home
improvement products to hit stores this summer.
</P>
<P>
   10 items
</P>
<P>
   Stylish home accessories don't have to cost as much as your
monthly mortgage. Heck, a few are even less than a fill-up in your
SUV. Here are 10 of our favorite designer items found at mass
merchandising stores.

 &HT;    'N Sync batters Boys with record CD sales
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not content to merely break the Backstreet Boys' first week
sales record, 'N Sync's ``No Strings Attached'' smashed it to bits.
</P>
<P>
   The band's label, Jive, reports that the album sold a whopping
2.4 million in one week, dwarfing the 1.13 million first-week sales
of the Backstreet Boys' ``Millennium,'' a record set last May. ``No
Strings Attached'' also set a record when it topped the 1 million
mark its first day out. The album has taken up residence at the top
of the heap for online retailers Amazon.com and CDNow.com. With
numbers like those, a debut at the top of Billboard's Top 200 is
pretty much assured.
</P>
<P>
   At Tower Records in Atlanta, general manager John Montes reports
that the album has done ``very well,'' though not the
record-breaking numbers seen nationally. ``I kind of thought (the
numbers) would be a little higher. But, I think it's a record
that's going to have some longevity, especially with the tour
coming up. Because of the single (``Bye Bye Bye''), it crossed over
to a lot of people. Non-'N Sync listeners like that record.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen dreams are no slouch on the ticket sales front, either.
Ticketmaster reports selling more than 600,000 'N Sync tickets
nationwide on Saturday. In Atlanta, the two Philips Arena dates,
May 18 and 19, sold out in under an hour.

   Q: When shopping each week, I use many coupons, and my folder is
in tatters. Usually I can order one from Carole Martin gifts but
they no longer have them. I have tried to find one at the local
stores, to no avail. You are my last resort. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carole Smith, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We like to be the last resort. For coupons, we found two
organizers, both in plastic. The purple one from Mead Expandables
($4.99) is at CVS Pharmacy, 1610 Mount Vernon Road, Dunwoody
(770-671-2792). It measures 5 1/8 inches by 10 3/8 inches. The
other is a clear, compact Expandable Coupon File with 12 tabs that
divide each section ($5.99). It's available at the Container Store,
120 Perimeter Center West N.E. (770-351-0065) and at 3255 Peachtree
Road N.E. (404-261-4776). Or you can order at 1-800-786-7315.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for the fragrance New West Skinscent for her by
Aramis. Several stores in the area used to carry it but no longer.
I have tried other scents but they just don't seem to please me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandra Mallory, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Out of the West comes a fragrance _ for her _ inspired by the
mountains, desert and sunshine. This fruity-floral from Aramis
combines jonquil, marigold and hyacinth with accents of thyme,
basil and oregano and middle notes of plum, pimento and clove.
Background notes: sandalwood, patchouli, amber and tonka. We found
a 3.4-ounce bottle ($45) at Macy's Lenox Square (404-231-8910). You
can also order it through Nordstrom's beauty hotline:
1-800-723-2889.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find parchment paper for cooking and baking? I
was buying it at specialty cooking stores and sometimes at Kroger
but now I can't seem to find any brand at any store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christine McLaughlin,
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: When baking and microwaving with parchment paper, you are
helping the environment. Beyond Gourmet makes unbleached parchment
paper (a 71-square-foot roll is $6). It is available at Cook's
Warehouse, 549-1 Amsterdam Ave. N.E. (404-815-4993). No chlorine is
used in the making of this product, says the manufacturer.
Therefore, ``no harmful byproducts are released into our
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In baking, you can use parchment paper to line baking sheets and
cake pans to prevent scorching. No need to grease, either. Also,
tightly wrap the paper around fish or veggies for oven poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for McCann's Quick Cooking Microwave Oatmeal. It
came in one big bag and you could scoop it out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marcia Duffy, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon you will be starting the day with a healthful bowl of
McCann's Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal, a microwave product. All you
do is add milk or water and zap in the microwave for 1-2 minutes.
It's available in a 1-pound box for $2.49 at most Harry's in a
Hurry and Harry's Farmers Market stores, including the one at 1180
Upper Hembree Road, Roswell (770-664-6300). ``This is a natural
product,'' says the manufacturer, ``made from the whole grain of
Irish oats. Oatmeal is an excellent source of fiber, contains no
salt or cholesterol and is naturally low in fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find Sprayway ammonia-free glass cleaner, which
is the best glass cleaner that I have ever used! The last place I
had purchased it was Costco on Peachtree Dunwoody Road. But they no
longer have it. The product is made by Sprayway Inc. in Addison,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan McGeough, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Spray away! We found your cleaner at Action Glass &AMP; Mirror,
890 Avon Ave. S.W. (404-753-0810). A 19-ounce can is $3.25. The
company will also ship orders. In addition to making glass shine,
Sprayway can also be used on chrome, tile and porcelain.

 &HT;    Crazy, mixed up world of psychiatric facility is fascinating in
ABC's new series ``Wonderland''
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's ``Wonderland'' is more wondrous than wonderful, its
through-the-rabbit-hole title a wryly insufficient signal of the
madness to come.
</P>
<P>
   This is some high-test TV. Set in a New York City psychiatric
hospital, it's an exhausting, unsparing, gets-to-you drama that is
not your mother's ``E.R.,'' the NBC bulldozer that ``Wonderland''
has the awful luck to compete against tonight at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Peter Berg (``Chicago Hope'' doc, ``Very Bad Things''
writer and director), ``Wonderland'' makes it clear early that
insanity is not restricted to the hospital's cracked clientele.
We're all nearly crazy, is the not-so-subtle theme, including the
psychiatrists whose high-stress urban lives have them teetering on
the brink.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pressure of modern society becomes too great for a
person, when one's chemical dynamic becomes such that ... they
cease painting within the lines, they come to us,'' one doctor
explains of the wee gap between the so-called sane and insane.
``These are the shadow people _ the shadow people that project on
us their shadow and remind us just how tenuous mental health is.
They remind us how easy it is to slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's premiere is a nonstop series of people slipping all
over the place: one guy shoots five strangers in Times Square after
mistaking his role in the ancient struggle between Zeus and the
Titans; a patient wakes to see a small rhinocerous sniffing around
his sandals; a stockbroker driven by his divorce to slice his
wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Another day in ``Wonderland,'' which also includes one doctor's
child custody fight, another doctor's distress over gaining weight
during pregnancy and another doctor's girlfriend tearing up his
apartment when she discovers he's sleeping around. There are no
easy answers here to any easy questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all right?'' one doctor asks another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm fine,'' says the doctor due at a custody hearing.
``I just have to play with my kids for about three hours under the
observation of a court appointed psychologist so I can be deemed
unfit as the primary guardian of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if you're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast is a cooly eclectic ensemble that never overplays a
note: Ted Levine (``Silence of the Lambs''), Michelle Forbes
(``Homicide: Life on the Street''), Martin Donovan (``The Opposite
of Sex''), Billy Burke (``Without Limits''), Michael Jai White
(``Tyson''). (Berg isn't in it.) They move between the personal and
professional without taking a breath; by the end of tonight you'll
know them better than your best friend.
</P>
<P>
   It can get a little headachey; when the camera isn't frantically
following the action, it's following a whim, darting up and down
and all around. Don't they know we're watching from a couch?
</P>
<P>
   It can also get disorienting. ``Wonderland'' is never unmanic,
unloud, unbureaucratic ... unmad. Either a phone's ringing or a
patient's babbling or a bureaucracy needs to be tamed.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Wonderland'' is also rarely less than brilliant at paring
down to a sharp dramatic point the politics, personalities and
insanity of this astonishingly realized world.
</P>
<P>
   It might be too much to fit inside network TV. The wonder is
that it made it at all.
</P>
<P>
   TV REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' tonight at 10 on ABC.

PHONES WITH NO CORDS BUT MANY OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although electronic mail is now the preferred means of
communications for many people, the telephone is still an
indispensable tool. How else are you going to call people to find
out if they got your e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   In the hopes of finding a new cordless phone that makes me feel
like a teen-ager again, I've been auditioning several of them for
my home office: the Plantronics 900-megahertz CT10 cordless headset
telephone, the Siemens 2.4-gigahertz Gigaset 2420 cordless phone
and answering system, and the 2.4-GHz BeoCom 6000 cordless phone.
Each has a particular appeal. Each has a particular annoyance. The
trick is to find the one that is least annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Why cordless?
</P>
<P>
   Cordless phones now outsell corded phones, which shows that
people like to stay connected to everyone without being connected
to anything. The newer models have many of the features of corded
phones, like built-in answering machines, Caller ID, speakerphones,
speed dialing, intercoms, paging and two-line support.
</P>
<P>
   But they also depend on batteries, which are finicky and require
recharging and special treatment. They are subject to interference
from nearby electrical devices, and, at least in their traditional
form, they are very hard to hold between one's shoulder and ear.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cellular phones, which operate on their own wireless
networks, cordless phones require a nearby base station that is
attached to a conventional phone line. The handset communicates
with the base station by low-power radio waves. The frequency of
those waves determines, at least in part, how far the handset can
roam from the base and how clear the signal will be. The first
generation of cordless phones operated at frequencies from 43 to 49
megahertz and were often subject to interference from fluorescent
lights, electric toys and personal computers. They also had a
fairly short range and signals were often blocked by walls or
floors.
</P>
<P>
   An aside: Although the phone's range was short, the range of a
police scanner is long. A snoop with a scanner could listen in on a
neighbor's cordless conversations from up to a mile away. If the
neighbor had a baby monitor, a cordless phone set to the right
channel could eavesdrop on conversations taking place in the house,
even if the occupants were not using the phone. That is why we all
owe a debt of gratitude to the late actress Hedy Lamarr, who was a
co-inventor of spread-spectrum technology. (Completely true, as I
will explain later.) But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of cordless phones moved to the less crowded
and more secure 900-MHz spectrum and provided greater range, up to
150 feet in a typical house, even through walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cordless phones operate at 2.4 GHz, which in theory
provides neighborhood-roaming range, freedom from most interference
and the best voice quality. As pleased as I am with the 2.4-GHz
cordless phones, I do have a nagging concern each time I hold one
to my ear. After all, microwave ovens use the same frequency to
boil water.
</P>
<P>
   That is why I started my search with a 900-MHz headset phone,
Plantronics CT10, which will go on sale in early May. It is a
marvel of miniaturization, with a pager-size keypad that clips onto
a belt or slips into a pocket, plus a lightweight headset with a
boom microphone connected to the keypad by a thin wire.
</P>
<P>
   The CT10 includes a base station that takes up only a few square
inches of desk space. Once the system is set up _ it takes less
than a minute _ the user can roam around the office, house or yard
making and receiving calls while using both hands for work. The
headset is light enough to wear all day, and the combination is the
best hands-free, untethered phone solution I've found.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the CT10 works with only a single phone
line, which is an annoyance in two-line houses. The numbers on the
keypad are dinky and require nimble fingers, but then, so do the
keypads on a cell phone. The most serious fault is that even a
gentle knock can separate the phone from its clip-on battery,
causing a lost connection or an unexpected tumble. If the tiny
phone should accidentally fall into some nearby liquid _ a cup of
coffee, say, or perhaps a toilet bowl, well, let me tell you, the
hisses, crackles and pops of a small, drowning phone are truly
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Plantronics CT10 will cost $129.95 when it reaches stores
this summer, and if I were to buy one, I would also buy the
extended warranty plan that offers a replacement phone in case
something unfortunate happens to the original.
</P>
<P>
   In the form-over-function category, the BeoCom 6000, from Bang &AMP;
Olufsen Telecom of Denmark, has the most striking design. The base
station is a brushed aluminum pyramid, and the handset, with its
asymmetric but ergonomic swoop, is a brilliant and comfortable
design. This is functional desk sculpture, and it is priced like
fine art, too. The base station and one handset cost $475,
available only from B&AMP;O dealers, and additional handsets are $325
each. The system can handle up to six handsets so rich people can
scatter extra sets all over the house.
</P>
<P>
   However, like other B&AMP;O audio products, the BeoCom 6000
practically cries out to be carefully placed in isolation on an
uncluttered desk, which immediately puts it at a disadvantage in my
office. The sound quality is superior, the 2.4-GHz range is
excellent, and it has a modest list of features, including built-in
caller ID, a 200-entry phone book and the ability to forward a call
to a specific handset.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the BeoCom 6000 is a work of art, it lacks the art of
work. It is a single line device, and it comes with a belt clip but
no headset option. When properly docked with its base station, the
Caller ID display is facing backward and downward, away from the
user, which means that you cannot just glance to see who is
calling. In short, it is not a phone for the home office, unless
you wear Armani suits around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The best balance of style, function, features and cordless
convenience was the Siemens Gigaset 2420, a 2.4-GHz system. It is a
two-line, corded and cordless modular phone and answering system
that can use as many as eight cordless handsets, which means
big-business phone features for a small office, home office or big
family system.
</P>
<P>
   The base station and one handset cost about $350; extra handsets
are $120 or so apiece. Its many features include a digital
answering machine that answers each line separately, a digital
speakerphone, three-way conferencing, call transferring, intercom
and a room monitoring function. If you subscribe to the phone
company's extra services, the Gigaset supports Caller ID and Caller
ID on Call Waiting, as well as distinctive ringing for voice and
fax calls. Unlike the BeoCom, the handsets work with standard
hands-free headsets.
</P>
<P>
   My two main complaints about the Siemens Gigaset are that the
answering system has just one voice mailbox per line, and that with
so many features, the instruction booklet should have been less
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, for my needs, the Siemens Gigaset 2420 answered the
call. Best of all, it employs frequency-hopping digital
spread-spectrum technology, which randomly changes channels 100
times a second. It is as secure from eavesdroppers as a cordless
phone can be.
</P>
<P>
   And that takes us back to Lamarr, the German beauty who died
earlier this year at age 86. During World War II, the actress, a
foe of the Nazis, and the composer George Antheil conceived and
patented frequency-hopping spread-spectrum technology as a way to
control remote-control torpedoes and protect them from radio
jamming. Today, spread-spectrum technology is the basis for many
forms of modern communication, including secure cordless phones.  &QL;

`JOURNEY' WORTH MAKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are that actor Roshan Seth's name won't ring any
immediate bells, and odds are that you won't catch his new movie,
``Such a Long Journey,'' until it arrives on video, because it's
receiving such a limited theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. As Gustad Noble, the beleaguered hero of ``Journey,''
Seth gives the year's first great performance as a man who tries to
maintain his pride while everything around him is falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journey'' is set among Bombay's Parsi community in late 1971,
shortly before one of India's wars with neighboring Pakistan. The
movie is as dense and disheveled as the city, but Seth's Gustad _
his bank-clerk uniform of white shirt and modest tie always neatly
in place _ stands out above the mess. We first see him chanting a
Parsi prayer before the movie becomes noisy; it's a bit of calm
before a rambunctious storm.
</P>
<P>
   Gustad is nostalgic for the old days, probably because the new
ones are bringing him nothing but grief: His son is suddenly
balking at a longtime family plan to attend a technical college;
his young daughter becomes ill; his wife no longer automatically
supports his every decision and has started consulting a
neighborhood mystic in an attempt to fix family problems. Outside
Gustad's house, the city is planning to knock down a wall that
separates his home from people who use the street as a public
bathroom. Gustad comes up with a solution to the sanitation
problem, with the help of a street artist, but he has a harder time
dealing with progress. And things just get more difficult when he
agrees to do a favor for an old friend, an estranged uncle who has
become involved in espionage.
</P>
<P>
   This is an ambitious movie, and it's so thick with plot that it
can be a little hard to get a grip on. It's interested not only in
Gustad's family and work problems, but in the Parsi situation in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sturla Gunnarsson, an Iceland native who grew up in
Canada, shows a keen eye for other cultures in his adept direction,
but his smartest choice was in casting. The film works because Seth
provides it with such a strong anchor: prideful, a little angry,
ambitious, scheming, weary and pained. The supporting cast is
strong, especially Soni Razdan as Gustad's wife and Om Puri as a
mystery man, but they all stand in Seth's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a Long Journey'' has so much going on that it might be
tough to take in all at once. Seeing it might involve a long
journey, but if you're in the right neighborhood, drop in and check
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a Long Journey'' is not rated, but is probably an R
equivalent for profanity, sexual situations and nudity. &QL;

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gary Paul Karr, the only person charged with the
alleged kidnapping and murder of atheist leader Madalyn Murray
O'Hair, appeared in federal court here Wednesday to get a
court-appointed lawyer in advance of his scheduled arraignment next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, of Novi, Mich., was indicted late last year on charges
that include kidnapping, robbery and extortion in connection with
the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, and her
adopted daughter Robin Murray O'Hair. He spent the last year
incarcerated in Detroit on federal gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in good spirits. He's going to plead innocent,'' said
David Weber, who represented Karr at the hearing before U.S.
Magistrate Stephen Cappelle.
</P>
<P>
   Cappelle appointed Thomas Mills of Dallas to represent Karr in
the upcoming trial before U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks. He also
set Tuesday as the tentative arraignment date and said he would
hear arguments then about setting bond for Karr.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark green jumpsuit from the Bastrop County Jail and
orange laceless slippers, Karr was clean-shaven and pallid and said
little during the brief hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement he made last year to the FBI, Karr admitted a
limited, non-criminal role in the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair and
her children, claiming he had been hired by David Roland Waters,
O'Hair's former office manager, to assist the family in fleeing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say Waters was the mastermind of the plot, but
the Austin man has not been charged with the disappearance of the
three. He is serving a lengthy state prison term for stealing
$54,000 from the atheist organization that O'Hair headed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities believe the O'Hair family was kidnapped,
held for a month in San Antonio, robbed of $500,000 in gold coins,
and then killed and dismembered. The three bodies have not been
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not charged with murder but he's been charged with
committing a crime of violence that resulted in the death of
another person, so you can draw your own conclusions,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth said of Karr.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Karr came to Texas from Florida in
late 1995 and over the next two months played an integral role in
the abduction of the family, including renting vans and hotel rooms
and accompanying Jon Murray on various financial errands in San
Antonio and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the five counts, Karr, 52, faces a life term in
prison. Talks between Karr's lawyers and Carruth over a possible
plea bargain in exchange for his testimony against Waters have so
far proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side, however, ruled out future conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never,'' Carruth said when asked about a possible
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on the government,'' Weber said. ``It depends on
what type of plea they might offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government is believed to have amassed a strong
circumstantial case against Karr and Waters, they do not have a
witness or the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Fry, a Florida man who also was allegedly involved in the
abduction and murders, was himself killed. Fry's headless, handless
body turned up on a Dallas riverbank two days after O'Hair and her
children were last seen in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair became widely known in the 1960s for her campaign against
prayer in schools.

 &HT;    A nonsmoker again - one day at a time
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with just one. I was going to smoke one _ just one _
just that one time, I swear. But that was all a pipe dream, which
is to say, that was all a lie. A cigarette's not exactly a Lay's
potato chip. Someone should tell the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It's pathetic, really. A week from today, I would have been
smoke-free for two years. Two years! I'd finally gotten myself to
the point where days, even weeks, could fly by without me so much
as thinking about a cigarette. When I finally broke down and told
my kid I'd been cheating, I felt as though I was in the second
grade kneeling inside the dimly lit confessional at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in Leetonia, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you mad at me?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said the 9-year-old, the same dear child who had
cheered me on with such pride in April of 1998. ``I have to say I
thought we'd moved past all that.'' A priest couldn't have said it
any better.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else was smoking
</P>
<P>
   I'm not really sure how it happened, except that I was in a room
far away with people I'd just met while traveling in Cuba. Everyone
was smoking. Nothing seemed real. So when I took that cigarette, it
was as though it wasn't even me. I lived somewhere else and wore
different clothes and ate different foods.
</P>
<P>
   Except it was me, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 18, 2000. Lighter, please.
</P>
<P>
   It was filterless. And strong. It made me nauseated and
lightheaded. At one point, I thought I was going to pass out.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I smoked an entire pack.
</P>
<P>
   I got back from my trip, gave them up, carried on. And then when
I got to feeling a little better, when all the disgusting side
effects had passed, I smoked again. And before I knew it, in no
time flat, smoking was driving my life again. I was thinking about
it all the time, always looking for a light, always waiting for
just enough time to pass so I could have another. It happened one
cigarette at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Over spring break, on a trip to visit my parents in Ohio, I
smoked outside in the freezing rain. The cigarettes made my head
throb and my stomach all queasy. Afterwards, I'd walk to the end of
the building, where the weather whipped around the corner, and I'd
stand, arms flapping, so the wind could blow away the awful stink.
Then I'd go inside, brush my teeth and spritz myself with my
mother's perfume. And so it went, off and on, on and off, like I
was 18 again, until I could actually smoke a cigarette without
wanting to throw up. I'm sure you can imagine my pride.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the patch again
</P>
<P>
   So, there you have it. My stupid, awful, predictable
predicament. Two weeks shy of what was supposed to be my big
good-for-you anniversary, I'm wearing the patch. I've written down
all the reasons I hate smoking. I'm chewing gum. I'm cranky. I'm
miserable. I want just one.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news is, it was all different this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Holding it, flicking it, smelling it, inhaling it. The stomach
pains. The headaches. The fibs. None of that seems like me anymore.
For the first time in my grown-up life, I feel more comfortable as
a nonsmoker. Not smoking finally feels like the real me. It's that
thread of fragile sanity that got me through yesterday. And the day
before that. I'll have to let you know about today.

FIFE (Phoenix) - Former Gov. Fife Symington will take the witness
stand Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the first time he has
testified under oath since his 1997 criminal bank-fraud trial. He
will face his toughest questioner ever in pension-fund attorney
Michael Manning. This is expected to be the climatic action in

STUMP (Washington) - Rep. Bob Stump, who likes blue jeans and plain
talk, sent out formal invitations announcing his moment of
immortality: The unveiling of his portrait for the Capitol. As a
committee chairman (Veterans Affairs), he is entitled to one at
taxpayer expense. He joins a small list of Arizonans accorded this
honor, including Barry Goldwater. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move

BOY (Undated) - Unlike Elian Gonzalez, a little boy from Guatemala
- David Juan Sebastian - sits trapped in a detention center in
Coolidge. Unlike Elian, the Guatemalan boy - like so many who enter
the U.S. illegally - has virtually no chance of remaining in this
country. While Elian is being afforded every possible consideration
to remain in the United States, the reality for thousands of
unaccompanied minors is they are either immediately deported or
kept in detention centers. By DANIAL GONZALEZ. Story will move in

SUMMIT (Gilbert, Ariz.) -Gilbert hosts its second public meeting on

   It may be the biggest pay-per-view event in history when the WWF
presents an unprecidented 12 hours of programming this weekend.
Fans can order an ``all-day'' coverage package for $49.95 or just
the match coverage for $34.95. The ``all-day'' coverage includes:
``WrestleMania 2000'' matches, highlights of the best matches from
``WrestleManias I-XV,'' interviews with some of the WWF superstars
from the past and present, exclusive backstage access to
``WrestleMania 2000,'' features from WWF Axxess: The Fan Festival
from the Anaheim Convention Center, and exlcusive post-show
interviews with some of the winners and losers.

   With Bill Busch's resignation last week, the WCW is searching
for a new leader again. Although he will be working with Vince
Russo in the creative end of the show, Eric Bischoff is not
considered a candidate for the executive vice president position by
Time Warner, the parent company that runs WCW. Some people feel
that if WCW can turn things around in the next couple of months,
Time Warner may change its mind.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who have seen the documentary ``Beyond the
Mat,'' there was a pleasant surprise at Monday's ``Nitro'' show.
Independent wrestler Mike Modesti, who has a tryout with the WWF in
the movie, earned an impressive first victory for WCW and appears
to have a bright future with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Looks as though WCW spared no expense in making their movie,
``Ready to Rumble,'' which will be in theaters nationwide next
weekend. David Arquette, Scott Caan and Oliver Platt star along
with WCW wrestlers Diamond Dallas Page and Sting.

 &HT;    Once shunned for the superstar, tag teams growing in popularity
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Eds. WITH WRESTLING-KOWALSKI, WRESTLING-TAGTEAMS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What goes around comes around. After years of playing second
fiddle to the superstars, tag team wrestling is becoming the rage
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the Hardy Boyz, the Dudley Boyz, Christian and Edge,
and Degeneration X's Road Dogg and Billy Gunn have led a resurgence
in the WWF of tag team wrestling. The popularity of the teams have
allowed matchmaker Vince McMahon to increase his roster and improve
the quality of matches.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that McMahon was instrumental in tearing apart
the tag team division.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, McMahon's company was
struggling to find a top singles' wrestler. Hulk Hogan's ride at
the top was starting to fade and no lone wrestler seemed to grab
the audience's attention. So McMahon turned to his most popular tag
team, the Hart Foundation _ Bret Hart and Jim Nienhart. McMahon
split them up and Hart grabbed the fans' attention and was soon the
WWF champion. He would reign for several years, but soon ran out of
competition. That's when McMahon split up another successful tag
team, The Rockers _ Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, and worked
Michaels to the point that he and Hart were the two most popular
wrestlers in the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Their successful careers, coupled with the relative failure of
Nienhart and Jannetty, made tag team wrestling a risker venture for
the wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, McMahon has used the tag team arena to bring in
new talent from other organizations (the seven-time ECW tag
champion Dudleys), allow his young talent to find their niche
(re-packaging of the Hardy Boyz) and sell a lot of merchandise (the
very successful Rock-n-Sock connection).
</P>
<P>
   Such success makes it financially possible for group wrestling
to grow. In fact, WWF's main event for its Super Bowl of
pay-per-view, ``Wrestlemania,'' will feature more than half the
matches with three or more combatants.

 &HT;    Dynamic duos once were the main attraction in wrestling
 &HT;    By Kevin Braun
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In biblical times, anyone searching for an expert on pairs would
probably look up Noah. In pro wrestling, the most likely source of
expertise on twosomes is Captain Lou Albano. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Albano has managed 19 tag-team champions, including several duos
that held the titles more than once. And he even wore a tag-team
championship belt around his own ample waist at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for guys that were a good size and could work
together in the ring,'' said Albano, now a 67-year-old grandfather
(he has 13 grandchildren to go with his four grown children). A
rundown of Albano's list of champions reveals that ``good size''
might be putting it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest were the Wild Samoans, Afa and Sika, whom
Albano said would probably come out on top if all his tag champs
competed against each other in a tournament. Then there were the
Moondogs, Rex and King, whom Inside Sports magazine once described
as ``640 pounds of gap-toothed mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moondogs stowed menacing-looking bones in their corner, and
they inevitably were used as weapons. During the Moondogs' reign,
Rex was replaced by Spot, and a wrestling magazine said that Rex
had to step aside because he had come down with rabies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Albano's other teams that reached the tag title included
The Executioners (Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd), The
Blackjacks (Mulligan and Lanza), The Valiant Brothers (Tarzan Tyler
and ``Crazy'' Luke Graham) and (after Albano became a ``babyface''
manager) The British Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Tag-team matches aren't as prevalent today, and it seems the
wrestling associations focus their promoting on individual stars.
Because tag-team wrestlers have to sacrifice some of their
individuality, observers might think the emphasis on singles
matches is ego-driven.
</P>
<P>
   But Kowalski, who donned a mask as Executioner No. 1 when he and
Studd teamed to win the titles in the 1970s, offered a simple
explanation for the reduced role of tag teams: Singles matches are
a bigger attraction. ``Whatever draws people,'' he said. ``Pack
those houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski, now 73, was also a tag team champ in the 1960s with
400-pounder Gorilla Monsoon. He won singles titles all over the
world, but he said it wasn't difficult for him to shift to tag
teams, and there were never any clashes. ``Not with me and my
tag-team partners. We were always good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kowalski, who at 6-foot-9 was an inch shorter than Studd,
didn't sacrifice much of his ego to be part of the team. ``I was
the image then,'' he said. ``I was the star then. It was me the
people were noticing. My whole career was like that. Make the
people notice me.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting the fans' attention, Kowalski also got
the referee's attention, distracting him by climbing on a
turnbuckle. And while the ref's back was turned, Kowalski's partner
would pummel the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That distraction factor is especially important in tag matches,
and having Albano outside the ring as a manager made his teams even
more effective. Albano's verbal skills didn't hurt, either. ``He's
a good talker,'' said Kowalski. ``He can talk anybody out of their
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Albano, who wrote ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pro
Wrestling'' with Bert Sugar, also sees quick tags in and out as
important. ``You don't want to let your partner get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Before turning to managing and commissioning himself as ``The
Captain,'' Albano earned his stripes in the ring. He and Tony
Altamore, known in tandem as The Sicilians, held the belts in the
1960s. During their first television interview, he and Altamore
held up black-gloved hands and shouted ``Mafia!''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that interview aired, Albano said, they were paid
a visit, and ``We were told there's no such thing as Mafia.'' Of
course, he and Altamore quickly agreed with that observation.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was managing, Albano donned the tights
occasionally. Once when Sika got hurt, he joined forces with Afa in
a Wild Samoans match. With a chuckle, Albano acknowledged that his
abilities were best used outside the ring. ``I was never a great
wrestler,'' he said. ``I did mostly running.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all his tag champs were heels, and Albano was reviled.
``Albano is a bum'' was a frequent chant at matches, and he clasped
his hands over his ears in an attempt to tune it out. But the fans'
view of Albano changed after ``Wrestlemania I.'' He was managing
the Fabulous Moolah, the longtime women's champion, and Moolah lost
the title to Wendy Richter, who had rocker Cyndi Lauper in her
corner. The Captain had to apologize to all women, and all of a
sudden he was a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   He's still a good guy. Among the personal appearances he makes
are at churches or to steer youngsters away from drugs. ``If you do
drugs, you go to hell before you die,'' he tells them. Overall, his
schedule is lighter, even with the promotional appearances and
occasional movie roles. ``I don't want to do it full time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's troubled by the current state of wrestling, in terms of the
violence, profanity and sexual nature. ``The kids look at that and
it sets a bad example,'' he said. ``You've got 5-year-olds holding
their finger up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Albano said he's dropped 100 pounds, but those who think they
might not recognize him don't have to worry: The trademark rubber
bands still adorn his face, even around the house.

 &HT;    COURT QUIZZES ATTORNEYS ON PRE-GAME PRAYERS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supreme Court justices plunged eagerly Wednesday
into a Texas controversy over the constitutionality of allowing
student-led prayers before public school football games.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of coping with the justices' barrage of swift,
pointed questioning, lawyers and their supporters on all sides of
the issue agreed on one thing: They expect a complex new national
policy to emerge in the decision the court is due to hand down by
early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line?'' Justice Stephen Breyer asked his
colleagues at one point in the arguments over the first case the
court has taken up on pre-game prayers.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the three attorneys quizzed by the justices was
willing to predict how a majority of the justices will balance the
public school students' right to freedom from religious coercion
with their rights to free speech and religious expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to tell'' what the court will decide, said
Washington attorney Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and
Justice, a veteran of eight appearances before the high court.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's case, he defended the policy of his client, the
Santa Fe Independent School District in rural Galveston County,
Texas, to allow the pre-game prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The district's procedures start with an election in which
students decide whether to have a pre-game ``invocation or
message,'' followed by an election in which students pick a student
who then writes and delivers the message to the crowd over the
loudspeakers just before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do we allow a message, even if it's a prayer,
to be given before a football game,'' Sekulow said. ``I think the
answer is yes, if it's student-initiated and student-led.''
</P>
<P>
   But that amounts to letting ``majoritarian rule'' impose prayer,
which would violate the rights of the smaller number who object,
argued Anthony Griffin, the Galveston attorney from the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who represented the Catholic and
Mormon families who challenged the district's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made our points, and I hope the court accepts
them,'' Griffin said as the rival lawyers circled the plaza in
front of the court, giving post-battle sound bites to more than two
dozen camera crews.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn appeared on behalf of
himself, Gov. George Bush of Texas and officials from seven other
states who intervened on the district's side.
</P>
<P>
   If the court clarifies a jumble of decisions that now lead to
constant lawsuits over school-related prayers, school districts
could lower their legal bills and concentrate on educating their
students, Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope for is a clear decision here, to trace a pathway
of neutrality neither favor nor disfavoring religion, but at the
same time not requiring a policy of official hostility to religious
expression,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The court session opened with traditional solemnity, all nine
justices standing behind their chairs as a clerk intoned, ``God
save the United States and this honorable court.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mood quickly lightened after they sat down.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg shot her opening zinger at Sekulow.
She asked him whether the student-written prayer could have this
wording: ``Break their necks, make them wrecks, buckle down,
boys!''
</P>
<P>
   That would violate the school's requirement that the student's
message, whether or not it is a prayer, promote good sportsmanship,
Sekulow said. He denied, however, that this meant the school
officials were unconstitutionally controlling the text of a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The election of the student message-giver might turn into
campaigns between one student claiming to be well-trained in prayer
and another claiming to oppose prayer in schools, said Justice
Anthony Kennedy, a frequent swing vote when the court is closely
divided. He said that could have the unfortunate effect of ``the
school becoming a forum for religious debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another justice asked Cornyn whether the policy might sometimes
lead to the election of a student whose pre-game message would be,
``Religion is bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respectfully, your honor, we just don't know,'' the attorney
general replied.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffin said his clients didn't want to be forced to listen
to another religion's prayer, Chief Justice William Rehnquist told
the ACLU attorney, ``Nobody has to go to a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin said one of his clients is a band member who, like
team members and cheerleaders, is required to attend the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anybody forced to be a cheerleader, football player or band
member?'' the chief justice asked.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin drew appreciative laughter from the hundreds of
spectators by replying, ``When you're a teenager, yes.''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA REGULATOR RENEWS ATTACK ON GERMAN INSURER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the world's leading reinsurance companies
once had strong ties with Adolf Hitler and is now ``hiding out''
overseas to avoid an investigation of Holocaust-era insurance
claims, state officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations by the California Insurance Commission against
Munich Reinsurance Company surfaced this month in a legal petition
that has become the center of a court battle in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, who has been
investigating Holocaust-era insurance claims since 1998, wants a
judge to order Munich Reinsurance to turn over insurance policies
that it and its affiliates issued from 1920 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Munich Reinsurance has filed its own detailed legal complaint,
claiming Quackenbush doesn't have the right to sue the German
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Quackenbush and Munich Reinsurance has been
going on for more than a year, but the telephone book-sized
petition filed on March 20 represents the first time the state has
asked a judge to act as an enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the petition is scheduled for April 11 in San
Francisco Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that Munich Reinsurance had close ties to
the Nazi regime, claiming a former president for the company was
also an Economic Minister for Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Munich Re was a Nazi collaborator and it and its affiliates
then victimized, and are still victimizing these persons today,
many of whom are residents of this state,'' the petition contends.
</P>
<P>
   Munich Reinsurance lawyer Martin Checov called those allegations
``irrelevant'' to the case, and in a letter accused Quackenbush of
seeking publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Checov claims Munich Reinsurance had a U.S.
branch that started doing business in California in 1959, but
stopped three years ago when its license ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Munich Re is a reinsurer organized under the laws of Germany
with its headquarters in Munich, Germany; it maintains no office
employees or license to do business in California,'' Checov said in
a court declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Checov added: ``A subpoena issued under the law of this state
cannot compel a person . . . located in a foreign country to attend
a deposition in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner is investigating whether any Holocaust
survivors or their heirs in California are entitled to long-dormant
policies that were not honored under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers have tried to settle the claims, while others have
not cooperated with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commission spokesman Ryan Staley said Munich
Reinsurance has been ``seriously uncooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Munich Reinsurance pointed out in court papers that it turned
over information last year, after company officials entered into a
stipulation with Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush claims the company did not turn over enough.
</P>
<P>
   As a reinsurance company, Munich insures more than 5,000 other
insurance companies, according to its Web site.

 &HT;    Echoes of Selena's spiritBy Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ This is the time of year when this
popular Texas beach city could more aptly be named
Selena-by-the-Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity seekers and fans of the late, great Selena stream here
in honor of the Grammy-winning Tejano music superstar who was shot
to death by her former fan club president in a
blink-and-you'll-miss-it interstate motel.
</P>
<P>
   They come every day of the year. But springtime is High Selena
Season.
</P>
<P>
   This is when hearts open fullest for the young Hispanic woman
whose musical talent, work ethic, belief in education and stance
against drugs and gangs turned her into a wholesome role model.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the fifth anniversary of Selena's murder, and April 16
is Selena's birthday. This year, she would have turned 29.
</P>
<P>
   So let's grab the official Selena map handed out by the Corpus
Christi Area Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau and join the pilgrimage
to the land of ``Bidi Bidi Bom Bom'' (Selena's catchiest pop
lyric).
</P>
<P>
   The map, with ``SELENA'' labeled in half-inch letters that shout
like blinking neon, shows four sites to visit:
</P>
<P>
   Selena's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Selena's life-size memorial statue.
</P>
<P>
   The recording studio run by her family.
</P>
<P>
   Selena's Etc., the boutique and salon opened by Selena.
</P>
<P>
   But enterprising Selena fans use their own knowledge or tips
passed along by other buffs they meet to add more locations:
</P>
<P>
   Selena Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Selena's house.
</P>
<P>
   Selena murals.
</P>
<P>
   Her former school.
</P>
<P>
   And, the most uncomfortable location of all: the Days Inn where
Selena was shot in Room 158 shortly before noon on March 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the management has changed the room numbers so the room
where Yolanda Saldivar shot Selena now is Room 150. But the new
numbering system apparently doesn't fool enough memento-seeking
fans. The number plaque on Room 150 looks cheaper than the plaques
on the other rooms _ as if it has to be replaced more often.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a warm welcome at the Days Inn at exit 3A off
Interstate 37 (Navigation Boulevard). Only registered guests are
allowed to linger, and, one day last week, a clerk at the front
desk became angry when we asked one Selena question too many.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said hotel staff had bent over backward to be nice to
Selena fans for four years, but now they are weary of the
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's dead! She's dead! I don't care anymore!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's off the record,'' she tried to add before
disappearing into a back room.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Barbara Schultz, who placed the 911 call when
Selena collapsed in the motel's lobby five years ago, said
employees have been instructed to answer ``no comment'' when Selena
questions are asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel has gone to a great deal of trouble to move on, and
we would prefer that we not even get mentioned,'' Schultz said.
``This hotel really had absolutely nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough bad memories. Let's head for the water.
</P>
<P>
   The most-visited Selena site is her memorial statue along the
Corpus Christi bayfront promenade. The bronze statue captures
Selena in a reflective moment, leaning against a white pillar and
holding her microphone on her left leg. She's clad in her trademark
tight pants and bustier under a short leather jacket with
decorative studs. Guitar-shaped earrings 4 inches long hang from
her ears, and cowboy boots boost her 5'5'' frame to 5'8''.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vivacious entertainer of international fame had begun to
mainstream a style of music called Tejano when her life tragically
and senselessly ended,'' the inscription reads in part.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes by saying, ``Selena Quintanilla-Perez was a role
model all communities need for their youth, and we are proud she
was a citizen of Corpus Christi.''
</P>
<P>
   Four signs ask fans to refrain from writing on the Selena
monument, but the request goes ignored. The white pillar Selena
leans against is covered with scrawled messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like your songs Babe,'' says one. ``To My Beautiful Angel
Selena, you have given me so much inspiration and because of that
me and my sisters dreams are coming true. ... I love you so much,''
says another.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Kim Malloy topped off a vacation in South Padre Island
last week by bringing their 5-year-old daughter, Cheyenne, to see
Selena's statue. Cheyenne became a pint-sized Selena fan a few
years ago after her parents rented the video of ``Selena,'' the
movie starring Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just fell in love with it. We had to buy a microphone and
move the coffee table out of the way,'' said Mike Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne has watched the movie dozens of times, and still
doesn't understand why anyone would kill Selena. ``Why did that
happen?'' Cheyenne asks her parents. Her father said it's difficult
to explain why Saldivar shot Selena during a dispute over whether
Saldivar had been stealing money from Selena's company. Saldivar
was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a long time ago to a child. Right now, all Cheyenne
wants is a photo of her parents posing by the Selena statue. She
grabs the family camera, backs up, instructs her parents where to
sit and pops off her souvenir picture.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the Selena map shows another site just a few miles
away. It's Seaside Memorial Park, where the music star is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Here, fans leave flowers and trinkets of affection: seashells,
pennies, colorful stuffed animals, Happy Meal toys from McDonald's
and even Pokemon cards. Some have carved or written messages on the
young mesquite tree at the head of her grave marker.
</P>
<P>
   Selena's grave is adorned with a flat bronze sculpture of
Selena's face, and the eyes are hollowed out. When it rains, fans
say, water runs like tears from her carved eyes. One day last week,
a tiny gold crucifix had been placed in one of Selena's hollow
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-minute period, three families drive up to pay
respects.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Lorena Garcia runs up and checks out the gifts
that have been left. She squats down and lovingly rubs her small
hand over Selena's sculpted face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not old enough to know what's going on, but she likes
her songs,'' said Lorena's father, Eddie Garcia of Mathis, 30 miles
from Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Selena is a good role model for his daughter because the singer
lived in the barrio and grew up to conquer the international stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everyone she met, she touched that person in some way,''
Garcia said. ``It means something to come back (to her grave) and
try to keep her music alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's head to the Selena museum.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Q-Productions, the recording studio run by Selena's
father, often bump into the well-known stage dad who pushed Selena
and her brother and sister into a family band when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Quintanilla works the phones and walks the halls in his
trademark straw hat and dark glasses. After Selena's death, he
gathered her self-designed performance dresses and award gowns and
put them on display in a museum at the back of the production
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the free museum are Selena's Grammy and other music
awards, her red convertible Porsche with the 1995 car registration
forever frozen in time on the front windshield, scores of
photographs of Selena on stage and with fans. On the back walls are
Selena's dress designs drawn when she was 15. Quintanilla even
threw in a newspaper clipping showing her as the second-place
winner in a fifth-grade spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dad first wanted to put the museum up, I thought it was a
great idea. But at the same time it was real difficult going in on
a day-to-day basis for me,'' said Selena's older sister Suzette
Quintanilla Arriaga, who played drums in Selena's band. ``It was
very depressing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you see people come in and you see how happy they
are, and then you start to look at it from their perspective and it
becomes cool,'' she said. ``It becomes easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum is definitely a celebration of her life,'' she
said. ``It keeps her alive in our own little way.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena's parents plan no official activity on the fifth
anniversary of their daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of Selena every day, and that's one day I don't want
to remember,'' Quintanilla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is a painful thing, but time heals,'' he said. ``You'll
never get over that, but you eventually have to cope with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena's family understands that the singer's music was so
powerful that it continues to attract young and old fans to Corpus
Christi. But the adulation becomes a problem when the Quintanillas
visit Selena's grave. So many fans have tried to photograph the
family at the grave site that they do not visit it as often as they
would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days you just can't,'' said Marcella Quintanilla,
Selena's mother. ``Other days you're drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   She worried last week about when she would get the next
opportunity to visit the grave and not be bothered. She wants to
place new flowers there so people coming to town next month for the
new Selena musical will see fresh bouquets rather than weather-worn
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the Selena store beckons.
</P>
<P>
   Selena's sister oversees the boutique and salon that Selena
opened in 1994. (And she recently opened her own children's
clothing shop called MoonChild, which was what Selena called her
designs when she was a teen.)
</P>
<P>
   Selena, Etc. stocks clothing with the Selena label, which also
can be found in many Sears and JCPenney stores. The boutique also
sells Selena T-shirts, dolls, perfume, postcards, hats, calendars
and more. Across the room, customers can get a manicure or a
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 13-year-old Letty Rico from Dallas was all smiles as
she sat in a salon chair and had her hair styled by Celia Macias, a
makeup artist and stylist who was hired by Selena when the shop
opened. Macias used to give Selena manicures.
</P>
<P>
   Letty is shy and overwhelmed that she is in Selena's shop while
Selena's sister is there. Letty's brother, Alex, 11, asks Suzette
Arriaga to autograph the Selena calendar his family just bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans keep constantly coming in,'' Arriaga said. ``They
come here because they love her and they want to know more about
her.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, the boutique was so full of customers that they
bumped into one another as they browsed.
</P>
<P>
   Let's move to the next stop on the Selena tour: the barrio.
</P>
<P>
   Selena and her husband, guitarist Chris Perez, lived in a tidy
brick home next door to Selena's parents in the Molina barrio, at
705 Bloomington St. On the other side of her parents lived Selena's
brother. All three brick houses now are rented out by the
Quintanilla family.
</P>
<P>
   After Selena's death, a suggestion was made to rename
Bloomington in honor of Selena, but then someone realized that
Yolanda Drive, a chilling reminder of her killer's first name,
would intersect with the street named Selena, and the idea was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from Selena's former house is the 7 Till Late
convenience store, where a mural of Selena was painted after her
death by students at nearby West Oso High School.
</P>
<P>
   One of the store's clerks, Mario Gomez, knew Selena and has
become a one-man fan machine. He volunteers to paint over the
graffiti on her bayfront statue, offers to take fans on free tours
of the Selena sites and every year helps organize a Selena tribute
on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as in previous years, the street in front of the
convenience store will be blocked off and a stage will be erected.
Then, one by one, little girls dressed like Selena will sing her
songs and perform for the barrio crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who as a then-security guard at the Days Inn stood watch
at Room 158 after Selena's murder, hands out maps to the Selena
sites and often leaves a bundle of them tucked into the Selena

<P>
   Anthony Powell, the English novelist whose 12-volume work, ``A
Dance to the Music of Time,'' is regarded as one of the great
achievements of postwar literature, died Tuesday at his home near
Frome, Somerset, England. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Powell _ his name rhymes with Lowell _ was a contemporary of
Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell and Cyril Connolly. He began his career
as a novelist in the early 1930s chronicling the doings of
Britain's bright young things and their Bohemian hangers-on. His
middle period, the quarter-century that begins with the publication
of ``A Question of Upbringing'' in 1951, was given over to ``A
Dance to the Music of Time,'' an ambitious effort to trace the
fortunes of a group of schoolmates from their adolescence at the
outbreak of World War I to old age in the Britain of the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In his late 70s and early 80s, Powell surprised critics by
producing two novels that compare favorably with the best of his
work, ``O, How the Wheel Becomes It!'' and ``The Fisher King.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Powell was born on Dec. 21, 1905, in Westminster,
London, the only child of an Army officer, P.L.W. Powell, and the
former Maude Welss-Dymoke. At Eton, he fell in with a
self-consciously arty set that included Harold Acton and Henry
Green.
</P>
<P>
   By temperament, Powell was an observer rather than an actor.
``He is a little different from the other boys, and I feel that his
quiet reserve and dignity may prevent him from having any strong
influence upon others when he gets to the top of the house,'' one
teacher reported to his parents. ``I hope this may not be so, but I
sometimes fear that they may regard him as superior and coldly
critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell himself later said, ``The whole of my life at Eton was
spent in well-deserved obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a third-class degree in history at Balliol
College, Oxford, where his classmates included Acton, Waugh, Green,
Connolly and Graham Greene, Powell found work as an editor at
Duckworth, the house that published four of his five early novels,
beginning with ``Afternoon Men'' in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   While at Duckworth, he published Waugh's first book, ``Rossetti,
His Life and Works,'' and, through a series of reissued novels,
helped spur a revival of interest in Ronald Firbank.
</P>
<P>
   In his early fiction, Powell deftly satirized the social milieu
he knew best _ the minor aristocrats, members of the polite
professions and their artistic hangers-on, whose lives were defined
by parties, outings and the ever-present specter of boredom. It is
telling that ``Afternoon Men,'' which relates the story of a
mild-mannered junior museum official's search for love in a
rapacious, shallow world, begins and ends with an invitation to a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Like Firbank, Ernest Hemingway and E.C. Cummings, three early
influences, Powell made use of clipped, often inane dialogue to
create a distinctive brand of comedy that relied, as he later put
it, on ``purposeless exchanges that are their own purpose,'' made
meaningful by ``an undercurrent of innuendo and irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Afternoon Men'' was followed by ``Venusberg'' (1932), ``From a
View to a Death'' (1933) and ``Agents and Patients'' (1936), a
novel whose title neatly suggested one of Powell's great subjects,
the ineffectual, cultivated Englishman out of step with a world
shaped by cut-rate mass culture and cutthroat commerce, here
represented by a film director and a psychoanalyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he left Duckworth to write movie scripts for Warner
Bros. of Great Britain. A brief trip to Hollywood in search of
screenwriting work led nowhere, although he did meet F. Scott
Fitzgerald. In 1939 he published ``What's Become of Waring?'' a
comic novel about a publishing house's search for its prize author,
who is reported missing but whom no one in the company has ever
actually met.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's novels, although critically well received, sold only a
few thousand copies each, and his only steady income came from book
reviews for The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator. His financial
situation eased in 1934, when he married Lady Violet Pakenham, a
daughter of the fifth Earl of Longford. She survives him, along
with their sons, Tristram and John.
</P>
<P>
   With the outbreak of World War II, Powell relied on his family
connections to enlist with the Welch Regiment, in which his father
had served. He spent two years as an infantry lieutenant before
transferring to the Intelligence Corps, with which he served in
London until 1945. He was a liaison officer with the Allied Forces
in exile, achieving the rank of major and earning the Czechoslovak
Order of the White Lion and the Belgian Order of Leopold II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Powell resumed work on ``John Aubrey and His
Friends'' (1948), a biography of the 17th-century antiquary, who,
Powell wrote, stood out among his contemporaries in his
appreciation of ``the oddness of the individual human being.'' With
Aubrey, Powell shared a fascination with genealogy, peculiar
anecdotes and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell returned to fiction writing, he made a decisive
break with his early manner. In a later interview, he said: ``I
decided that the thing to do was to produce a really large work
about all of the things I was interested in _ the whole of one's
life, in fact _ for I have no talent for inventing plots of a
dramatic kind in a comparatively small space.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He embarked on a comprehensive social study of Britain's
upperish classes, a nebulous social stratum consisting of minor
aristocrats, the members of the ``right'' professions, assorted
Bohemians and academics. This genteel milieu, defined more by
schooling and temperament than by money, is seen through the
writer's alter ego, Nicholas Jenkins, a detached, even passive,
observer who takes up a position on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Although the series includes hundreds of characters across some
70 years of time, three fellow classmates play major roles in most
of the books. Peter Templer and Charles Stringham, whose
aestheticism and eccentricity hark back to a more genteel age,
struggle to find a place in the new England. Kenneth Widmerpool, an
object of scorn to his classmates, emerges as a powerful, decisive
force, the right man for a mean and mercenary age.
</P>
<P>
   The title and inspiration for the series came from Nicolas
Poussin's painting, ``A Dance to the Music of Time.'' The painting,
which Powell saw in the Wallace Collection in London, depicts four
outward-facing nymphs dancing in a circle. Tantalizingly ambiguous,
their dance suggested to Powell the way that time and circumstance
bring people together and then push them apart. ``An almost
hypnotic spell seemed cast by this masterpiece on the beholder,''
Powell later wrote. ``I knew all at once that Poussin had expressed
at least one important aspect of what the novel must be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next quarter-century, beginning with ``A Question of
Upbringing'' in 1951 and concluding with ``Hearing Secret
Harmonies'' in 1975, Powell worked on this grand project, its
underlying pattern ruled by what he called ``the inexorable law of
coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Buyer's Market,'' the second volume of ``Dance,''
Nicholas Jenkins muses on chance and fate, the connection of
opposites and the different worlds one encounters in life: ``Nearly
all the inhabitants of these outwardly disconnected empires turn
out at last to be tenaciously interrelated; love and hate,
friendship and enmity, too, becoming themselves less clearly
defined, more often than not showing signs of possessing
characteristics that could claim, to say the least, not a little in
common; while work and play merge indistinguishably into a complex
tissue of pleasure and tedium.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Powell rejected complicated interpretations of
``Dance,'' insisting it dealt with ``things as they are.'' He
disliked suggestions that he based his characters on particular
people. He worked hard at making sure that every title, every name,
every place was accurately set down.
</P>
<P>
   While working on ``Dance,'' Powell served as an editor and
contributor at several publications. After the war he took a
part-time position with The Times Literary Supplement, supervising
the fiction reviews, and from 1953 to 1959 he was the literary
editor of Punch. He also continued to review regularly for The
Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's later style, described by one critic as Proust rendered
into English by P.G. Wodehouse, was feline and elliptical,
alienating some admirers of his earlier work. ``Some critics
dislike its subtle elaboration of manner, preferring the crisper,
more immediate effect of the prewar comedies,'' the critic Bernard
Bergonzi wrote of ``Dance.'' For admirers of the series, Powell, in
abandoning the quick, satiric strokes of his earlier novels,
created a far more complex and compelling social drama. In his
precise delineation of English manners, he searchingly explored
emotional territory that he had treated flippantly before. In 1997,
the series was adapted for television by Hugh Whitemore.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1982, Powell completed four volumes of memoirs,
under the title ``Keep the Ball Rolling,'' which include memorable
vignettes of friends like George Orwell, Cyril Connolly, Malcolm
Muggeridge and Kingsley Amis. Three volumes of diaries, covering
the years 1982 to 1992, were published between 1995 and 1997 under
the title ``Journals.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell also edited or contributed prefaces to several volumes
that shed light on his literary influences, from the high-society
novels of Disraeli and Ouida to the works of Firbank and the Swiss
essayist Henri-Frederic Amiel. A selection of his criticism was
collected in ``Miscellaneous Verdicts'' (1990) and ``Under Review''
(1992).
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 he was made an honorary fellow of Balliol College at
Oxford University. He received honorary doctorates from Oxford and
from the Universities of Sussex, Kent, Leicester, Bristol and
Wales. In 1977, he was named an honorary member of the American
Academy of Arts and Letters. From 1962 to 1976, he served as a
trustee of the National Portrait Gallery in London.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire
in 1956 but refused a knighthood in 1973. A knight, he wrote in his
journal, was ``rather an awful thing to be.'' He was happy to be
made a Companion of Honor in 1988, however. ``Rather cheered,'' he
wrote in his journal, ``as CH eminently respectable order (65
members), which most people have never heard of. Those who have
know its standing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Thailand's tough and powerful interior
minister resigned Wednesday after a newly formed anti-corruption
agency charged that he had concealed his assets by fabricating a
million-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the minister, Sanan Kachornprasart, is the
most effective action by the National Countercorruption Commission,
which was formed in 1997 as part of a wide-ranging attempt to
reform politics. It was a severe blow to the ruling party at the
start of an election year in which Sanan had been expected to play
a major role as the leading wheeler-dealer of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am innocent,'' Sanan said in his resignation statement. ``I
will prove the truth in the Constitutional Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of the charges against him, the fact that an
independent body toppled one of the most influential figures in
Thai politics was a sign that the landscape of the nation's deeply
corrupt political system has begun to shift.
</P>
<P>
   A separate commission, also formed under Thailand's new
constitution, that monitors electoral fraud has in recent weeks
disqualified 78 of the 200 winners in an election last month to the
newly formed Senate. One of those disqualified was Sanan's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Sanan, 64, said he was resigning from all his
government positions, which include a deputy premiership and a seat
in Parliament. He said this would avoid any suggestion that he was
influencing the conduct of his case, which now goes before a
special Constitutional Court. The court was also recently formed
and adjudicates issues involving the country's new liberal charter.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against him, he could be banned from any
political activity for five years, whether or not he holds any
office.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a severe blow to the Democratic Party, which came
into office in the depths of the Asian economic crisis in late
1997. The party, led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, is credited
with cleaning up the country's fiscal affairs and restoring
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition _ which was notoriously corrupt during the
years it held power _ has leveled continuing charges of corruption
against the Democratic Party. One of those charges led to the
investigation of Sanan.
</P>
<P>
   Sanan said Wednesday that he would remain as the party's
secretary-general and would play a key role in the party in advance
of the elections that Chuan must call before November.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's political future and its coalition government
have now been thrown into uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the whole coalition is also at stake, given
the fact that Sanan, the government's Mr. Fixit, is such a central
figure,'' The Bangkok Post, the English-language daily, said
Wednesday in an editorial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The question of replacing Sanan as interior minister is expected
to be a difficult political challenge for Chuan as he balances the
forces of his coalition, and it has led to speculation that the
prime minister might call an early election.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Ong-art Klampaiboon,
said, ``There is no reason to think there will be any change in
government for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the countercorruption commission, Sanan falsely
claimed to have borrowed 45 million baht, or $1.21 million, from a
company in an attempt to conceal his assets.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is complex, and Sanan could be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a surprise. He has frequently been accused of
corruption and has a reputation as the Democrats' street fighter,
the man who will carry out the dirty work for a party that has
built its reputation around taking the high road. Without him, some
political experts said, Chuan could not have put together the
rough-and-ready seven-party coalition that brought the Democrats to
power.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell in parts of upstate New York on Wednesday as a
slow-moving low-pressure system over eastern Canada delivered a
brisk flow of air to the interior Northeast. Conditions will
gradually improve across the Northeast on Thursday, with ample
sunshine expected near the coast and brighter conditions over the
interior.
</P>
<P>
   A late-season snow will blanket parts of the southern Rockies
and southern Front Range on Thursday as a jet stream disturbance
intercepts a moist flow of air from the east. Farther west, breezes
from the east will bring unseasonably warm air to the coast of
Central California. These offshore winds will direct unseasonable
warmth to the coast of Southern California on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will end over the Southeast on Thursday, though residual
moisture in the lowest parts of the atmosphere will cause clouds to
linger for much of the day.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TORNADO SHIELD
</P>
<P>
   Urban environments have often been called shields against
tornado formation. Yet, in the past few years, strong twisters have
been observed in Nashville, Tenn., Birmingham, Ala., and Salt Lake
City. The two twisters that ripped through Fort Worth on Tuesday
further challenged this notion. There is some indication that the
roughness associated with tall buildings interferes with the
establishment of the circulation of weak tornadoes. But when a
potent mixture of atmospheric ingredients come together, cities are
not safe from tornadoes. &QL;

Wednesday that physicians follow ``individualized'' strategies,
rather than routine bone density screenings, in deciding whether
patients should receive preventive therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, characterized by loss of bone calcium, places
millions of Americans, especially older women, at increased risk of
devastating fractures.
</P>
<P>
   However, a consensus panel convened by the National Institutes
of Health said too little is known about the benefits of mass
screenings to recommend them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn more about screening, which population should
be screened and how to best do this,'' said Anne Klibanski, a
Harvard University professor of medicine who chaired the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of bone density examinations, one involving ultrasound
on the heel and the other using an X-ray of the femur just below
the hip, have been shown to detect increased risk of osteoporotic
fracture, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it noted that among women between 50 and 59, an
estimated 750 bone density tests would be required to prevent a
single fracture over a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee said doctors and their patients should
decide on case-by-case bases whether to use the scans, it declined
to recommend guidelines for physicians to use in those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis, and
another 18 million have bone mass low enough for them to be
considered at risk of the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Among elderly persons, a fracture can have devastating
consequences. Dr. Scott Boden of Emory University in Atlanta, a
member of the panel, noted that surveys indicate 80 percent of
women over 75 ``would rather be dead than have a bad hip
fracture.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel called for research on a wide front, including genetic
factors leading to osteoporosis, the manner in which widely-used
glucocorticoid drugs appear to induce the disorder in some persons,
and the effectiveness and long-term safety of various drugs used to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Although hormone replacement therapy, in which postmenopausal
women take estrogen, is a common treatment, the panel said more
information is needed on how estrogen alone or in combination with
other drugs reduces the incidence of fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Newer drugs, including a class known as biphosphonates, have
been shown to increase bone density, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists said there is no evidence that so-called ``natural
estrogens,'' such as those found in food supplements and some plant
products, such as soy, reduce osteoporotic fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Weight training, even in elderly persons, increases bone mass.
Non-impact exercise, such as walking, does not build stronger bones
but may be valuable in improving balance and preventing falls.
</P>
<P>
   The panel called for increased emphasis on diet and exercise
among children, noting that only about 25 percent of boys and 10
percent of girls between the ages of 9 and 17 meet National Academy
of Science recommendations for daily calcium intake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Childhood is also a critical time for the development of
lifestyle habits conducive to maintaining good bone health
throughout life,'' the panel said in its final ``consensus
statement,'' noting that ``cigarette smoking, which usually starts
in childhood, may have a deleterious effect on achieving bone
mass.''

ISRAELI COURT SAYS PALESTINIANS EVICTED FROM CAVES CAN RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
hundreds of Palestinian cave dwellers from the West Bank who were
evicted by the army more than four months ago can return while an
investigator examines their right to live there.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, in response to a petition by Israeli human rights
lawyers representing scores of the evicted Palestinians, overruled
military and defense officials who had refused to allow the cave
dwellers to return.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Palestinians were expelled from cave hamlets in
the rocky hills southeast of Hebron on the grounds that they were
living in a military firing zone. Most were evicted on Nov. 16, a
few days after militant Jewish settlers were removed from Maon
Farm, an illegal outpost nearby. The settlers had demanded that the
Palestinians also be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The evicted Palestinian families found shelter in tents and
empty buildings in neighboring villages. The Israeli human rights
group B'Tselem said that it had counted more than 700 people who
were displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military government in the West Bank, known as the
Civil Administration, argued that the cave-dwellers could be
legally evicted from the firing zone because they were not
permanent residents in the area, but seasonal farmers who lived in
the caves a few months a year while maintaining homes in the
neighboring village of Yatta.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians asserted that they had been living in the caves
year-round for generations, grazing sheep and farming nearby land.
They said they had no other homes, noting that they had been forced
to move into makeshift shelters in nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel headed by Chief Justice Aharon Barak ruled
that the cave-dwellers could return while their residence rights
were examined by an investigator accepted by the Palestinians and
the Israeli authorities. The results of the examination are to be
submitted within two months from the appointment of the
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Palestinians, Shlomo Lecker, said the court's
decision to return the cave-dwellers to their homes was ``an
unusual victory, because the court rarely orders a change in the
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella council of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip called for the immediate return of the evicted settlers
to Maon Farm. ``Any other decision by the government means racial
discrimination,'' a spokesman for the council said. A group of
settlers who tried to reach the site a few hours later was turned
back by soldiers.

AN ANTHONY POWELL SAMPLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (With OBIT-POWELL)  
(lh) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On F. Scott Fitzgerald, seen at the MGM commissary in Hollywood
in July 1937 (from ``Faces in My Time'' (1980), Vol. 3 of ``To Keep
the Ball Rolling: The Memoirs of Anthony Powell''):
</P>
<P>
   He was smallish, neat, solidly built, wearing a light gray suit,
light-colored tie, all his tones essentially light. Photographs _
seen for the most part years later _ do not do justice to him.
Possibly he was one of those persons who at once become
self-conscious when photographed. Even snapshots tend to give him
an air of swagger, a kind of cockiness, which, anyway at that
moment, he did not possess. On the contrary, one was at once aware
of an odd sort of unassuming dignity. There was no hint at all of
the cantankerous temper that undoubtedly lurked beneath the
surface. His air could be, though, a trifle sad, not, as sometimes
described at this period, in the least broken-down.
</P>
<P>
   On Cyril Connolly (from ``Infants of the Spring'' (1976), Vol. 1
of ``To Keep the Ball Rolling''):
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that any alteration in the Connolly myth would have
made little ultimate difference to its dramatic overtones, their
inspiration deriving not so much from the author's relative success
or failure in early life, as from a passionate interest in himself.
True interest in yourself is comparatively rare, sharply to be
differentiated from mere egotism and selfishness; characteristics
often immoderately developed in persons not in the least interested
in themselves intellectually or objectively. Indeed, not everyone
can stand the strain of gazing down too long into the personal
crater, with its scene of Hieronymus Bosch activities taking place
in the depths.
</P>
<P>
   In self-inspection, Connolly could endure more than most. Not
unnaturally, he tends to concentrate on specific areas below, in
preference to others not necessarily less worth analysis, but from
his chosen angles he can be absolutely ruthless in drawing
attention to what many persons would be very willing to leave
concealed. The sheer intensity of this self-interest makes
everything Connolly writes about himself interesting; even when, as
in some of the later book reviews (much of his literary criticism
being a branch of autobiography), touches of self-fantasy from time
to time obtrude.)
</P>
<P>
   On meeting George Orwell for the first time, in 1941 (from
``Infants of the Spring''):
</P>
<P>
   Tall _ as has more than once been remarked, closely resembling
Gustave Dore's Don Quixote _ Orwell also looked uncommonly like
Cezanne's portrait of Monsieur Choquet, the painter's friend in the
Custom House. The deep grooves in Orwell's cheeks ... were at once
apparent on either side of his mouth. He wore a narrow moustache,
neatly clipped, along the lower level of his upper lip. The
moustache, as long as I knew him, was always a bit of a mystery to
me. I never had quite sufficient courage to ask about it. Orwell's
approach to life was always strictly controlled, so that this
feature must have possessed some special meaning for him. Perhaps
it was his only remaining concession to a dandyism that undoubtedly
lurked beneath the surface of self-imposed austerities. ...
</P>
<P>
   On Evelyn Waugh in the 1920s (from ``Messengers of Day'' (1978),
Vol. 2 of ``To Keep the Ball Rolling''):
</P>
<P>
   Where smart life was concerned, Waugh himself would speak with a
love/hate not unlike Thackeray's; a state of mind not in the least
averse from receiving chic invitations, if any were going, but
always flavored with a certain animus against what was grand, rich,
fashionable. In due course, when he adopted quite another approach,
something always remained beneath the surface of a kind of social
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   I think there is nothing mysterious about either standpoint.
Waugh was, in his way an extraordinarily uncomplicated man; so
uncomplicated that even in those days _ far more so in later life _
it was often hard to accept that some of his views and attitudes
were serious. That was mistaken. They were perfectly serious to
himself; within the limits that, possessing his father's powerful
taste for self-dramatization, all Waugh's energies were
concentrated on any role he was playing, however grotesque or
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   This simplicity of approach was particularly true in Waugh's
manner of looking at social life. He really did believe in entities
like a ``great nobleman,'' ``poor scholar,'' ``literary man of
modest means.'' Of course, in one sense, such stylized concepts may
certainly exist, but at close range they usually require a good
deal of modification. At the same time their acceptance _ allied to
gifts like Waugh's _ can be by no means a disadvantage to a
novelist, clearing the air automatically of extraneous detail that
can clog a narrative. ...
</P>
<P>
   A conversation from ``Afternoon Men,'' between Atwater, the hero
of the novel, and Frotheringham, an acquaintance, who is drunk:
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is it all going to lead? I ask you that, Atwater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. You don't know. I don't know. None of us know. We just go
on and on and on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit here when we might be doing great things, you and I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Might we.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what we are doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shall I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are wasting our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think so?''
</P>
<P>
   Frotheringham said: ``Every minute the precious seconds flit by.
The hour strikes. Every moment we get a little nearer to our
appointed doom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you bear to hear it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you. It is too horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I insist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, the corner seats in clubs under the meager covering
of a sheet of newspaper. For others, the voices of little children
often and deafeningly shrill.''

   Spring Treat
</P>
<P>
   Q. A bowl of steamed fiddleheads is my idea of the perfect
spring celebration. I have only a few ostrich ferns, and it takes a
lot of fiddleheads to make the meal worthwhile. If I harvest all of
the fiddleheads, will it kill the ferns?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fiddleheads, or crosiers, are a spring delicacy that makes it
worthwhile getting mud on your shoes. As the new fronds of the
ostrich fern, Matteuccia struthiopteris, reveal themselves, but
before they unfurl, they form a tightly curled spiral that really
does resemble the head of a violin or a bishop's staff.
</P>
<P>
   They are tender and delicious, but don't celebrate to excess.
Dr. John Mickel, senior curator of ferns at the New York Botanical
Garden in the Bronx, said not to cut more than three or four from a
fern crown, which typically produces about a dozen fiddleheads. If
you harvest them all, the plant will send out new fronds, but
perhaps at a price. Producing the second set reduces the supply of
nutrients stored in the fern's rhizome, weakening the plant. A
droughty summer or a hard winter and the fern, especially an older
one, may not make it. Since ostrich ferns spread rapidly by
underground runners, have patience. In a few years, you'll be able
to move from clump to clump, harvesting all the fiddleheads you
want without endangering the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Look for upright, dark green fiddleheads clothed in a few tan
scales to make sure they really are ostrich ferns. Other ferns have
fiddleheads that are tough and more scaly or woolly, and won't make
your meal cause for celebration. Ostrich fern fiddlehead scales rub
off easily when you wash them. Take special care to avoid royal and
bracken ferns, which Mickel said are highly carcinogenic. As with
any food gathered from nature, don't eat anything you can't
absolutely identify.
</P>
<P>
   Shady Garden
</P>
<P>
   Q. Living in a wooded area, we have very little sunshine for
gardening. I have an area, facing west, where very little grass
grows, mostly moss. I want to put in a small garden, just for shade
plants, but have heard that any ground that had moss will not be
good soil for a garden. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Just because the moss is outcompeting the grass doesn't mean
nothing else will grow there. The most likely reason the moss is
winning is the shade, which grass dislikes. While some mosses like
full sun, most prefer shade and need moist, reasonably
well-drained, acidic soil. Primitive plants going back nearly 400
million years, mosses have survived this long because they figured
out how to take advantage of their niche. Because their leaves are
only one cell thick, they can absorb all the oxygen and moisture
they need directly from the air. Not needing the water-drawing
roots of more advanced plants, they grow a form of rhizoid that is
just a holdfast, letting them cling to rocks and other hard
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   You can remove the moss and the struggling grass and plant a
traditional shade garden, but why not take your cue from nature and
encourage the moss? A visit to the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll
Garden in Mill Neck, on Long Island, will open your eyes to the
extraordinary beauty of a well-designed garden that uses moss and
other shade plants to their best. The garden is open on weekends
from the end of April to the end of October. For information: (516)
676-4486.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage moss to fill in areas, take some of your existing
moss and mix it with water in a blender, then spread it around and
keep the area moist. Adding buttermilk, which is often mentioned,
isn't necessary unless you want the moss to grow on a rock or
container. The buttermilk isn't a nutrient or an acidifier, it just
dries into a glue that lets the moss adhere to a slippery surface. &QL;

<P>
   ``I hope that's not the renovation,'' said a young woman wearing
a black crochet cap and light purple lipstick, a leopard-print
satchel on her shoulder, as she peered through the glass of the
Lenox Lounge into the dark glitter of the unlighted bar. A nicked
and scuffed cafe chair with a zebra-stripe seat stood by the
window, the photographer Art Kane's ``Jazz Portrait, Harlem 1958''
above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks the way it was,'' the young woman said, rolling her
eyes and walking down Lenox Avenue toward 124th Street. What she
could not see were the 22 cans of oven cleaner that took three
millimeters of gummed nicotine off the gold mirrors and chrome
trim. What looks antique now had been an authentic dirt-brown. The
fake fur is fresh.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months of renovations and $600,000, the Lenox
Lounge, the legendary Harlem night spot built in 1939 _ the year
Billie Holiday first sang ``Strange Fruit'' _ is reopening Thursday
night: the sole surviving Art Deco club interior in New York City.
Holiday, a regular, sat in with musicians there in the 1940s; her
table in the Zebra Room beyond the bar, beneath the mock-zebra
wallpaper that gave the room its name, was the first on the left
through the swinging doors. She is said to have loved Art Deco, as
genuine as glamour ever got. Malcolm X was also a customer.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the lounge has been a featured location in
fashion magazines, music videos and movies, from Madonna's 1995
``Secret'' to the remake of ``Shaft,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson,
opening this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers will appreciate the fact that Shaft hangs out at
the Lenox Lounge,'' said John Singleton, the film's director.
``It's a Harlem landmark; he's a very uptown kind of cat. You think
about Holiday, or Billy Eckstine, walking through those doors, way
back in the day. I couldn't resist having a glass of Hennessy
between shots.''
</P>
<P>
   If the new Lenox Lounge looks faded, it's a fade-in, not a
fade-out.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin M. Reed, a retired policeman and postal worker who has
owned the lounge since 1988, decided last year to bring the club,
which he said was struggling to stay profitable, back to life. His
strategy was to restore its glass-finned, turbine-shaped lighting
towers, black and white hide walls, Bakelite-plated leather ceiling
and other original details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person of the past; I love the past,'' he said. ``When I
first took over, I had some people who didn't really appreciate the
decor of the place. They were like, `Oh we're glad it's a new
owner. Now you can modernize this place.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 60, wearing a black satin baseball jacket with ``Lenox
Lounge: A Cocktail Lounge for the Elite'' stitched across the back
with its picture, was standing by the bar on Saturday with Fred
Ruffin, a friend, who was at the lounge's grand opening party in
1942. Reed said that a trademark dispute with El Morocco over the
use of a zebra motif, for which that storied supper club was
famous, had kept the lounge from opening officially in 1939.
Ruffin, who was one of the few blacks in the crowd that night at
the club, which like many was conceived for white patrons coming
uptown, recalled that it was ``a grand night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beer was 30 cents a bottle,'' he said. ``We were kicking on
that because it was 10 cents cheaper in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an economic boom uptown that many are calling a
second Harlem Renaissance, Reed said he believed there was also a
renaissance in the wings for Harlem night life and its jazz scene.
</P>
<P>
   With a $450,000 loan from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone _
a development corporation created by the federal government in 1994
that is also assisting Minton's Playhouse and other Harlem
institutions _ Reed closed the lounge in September to begin work.
Yui &AMP; Bloch, an architectural team that specializes in restaurant
interiors, drew plans to renovate as well as to restore the lounge
as a bar and dining room with a program of live jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised around here, about 10 blocks down,'' Reed said.
``You could go into any club and there was a set going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Community preservationists' concerns about the Disneyfication of
Harlem (in particular, the not-unlikely threat of
theme-restaurant-style at period clubs like the Lenox Lounge)
reached Reed through newspaper articles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his architects retained historical restoration
experts, confident that existing details, which matched 1939
postcards, could guide replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been an easier thing to rip it out and put fresh
sheetrock in,'' said Jimi Yui, the architect, whose office is also
at work on Le Bernardin's new private dining rooms. ``It's a
restoration in spirit only. Historical restorations are incredibly
expensive to do. But it's so rich in history. There's nothing that
you could have created that would have been better than the history
of what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its physical fact _ in continuous operation since 1939,
the lounge was never stripped for sale or vacant _ documentation of
the design is scant. The designer may have been Judson E. Schnall,
a Brooklyn-based architect whose name appears on a city
construction permit for the address, 288 Lenox Avenue, in 1938.
Reed bought the club from Dominick Greco, a nephew of the family
that built it, after seeing it listed for sale in The Amsterdam
News.
</P>
<P>
   Memory of what was there from the start was hazy, too, as thick
and stubborn to clear as the smoke on the walls. An
Egyptian-inspired mural in the Zebra Room, left behind by the
television crew from ``New York Undercover'' that created it in two
hours in 1992, endeared itself inconveniently to patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more flack over that,'' Reed said. ``Everybody said,
`Please don't tell me that's not original; I don't want to hear
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was replaced by zebra wallpaper, based on a scrap discovered
in the room.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The program from Day 1 was to upgrade the building's systems,
but keep the feel of the original bar,'' said Zachary Kaplan, the
president of the ZMK Group, the general contractor. A new
restaurant kitchen was created at the back, with prep areas in the
basement; the lounge's scarred wooden bar was left intact, not
refinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger part of that was driven by aesthetics, but some of
it was driven by money, too,'' said Kaplan, who grew up on
Riverside Drive at 116th Street and visited the lounge as a student
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity played its part in the renovation, too.
Frosted-glass fins to replace those missing in light fixtures were
found under five inches of mud in the basement. A box of glass
ashtrays used as decorative studs in the diamond-square upholstered
ceiling panels in the Zebra Room also appeared in the debris as new
vinyl was being put up to replace the tarred leather.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   When applicable, neighborhood subcontractors were hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was important to work with as many locally based
people as possible,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Reed's clientele will be another issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them really did not want me to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices will go up, and the staff will change. Reed's loan was
dependent upon his creating 15 new jobs. Tourists and downtowners
are likely to be the immediate mainstay of the Zebra Room. Reed has
a 15-year lease, but he is three months behind on his rent, and
``stretched out,'' as he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came in and said, `Make sure you keep this and that,'

&HT;     EX-OWNER OF 49ERS SAYS HE REGRETS INVOLVEMENT IN RACKETEERING
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Getting mixed up with a smooth-talking
politician like former Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards was the
worst thing he ever did, and he's paid a dear price for that
involvement, the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. left the witness stand Tuesday after two
days of testimony that was alternately forceful, pathetic,
persuasive and contradictory in Louisiana's epic riverboat casino
licensing racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son Stephen and five associates are accused of
rigging the award of 15 riverboat licenses by making applicants
ante up some $3 million in bribes as a prerequisite to tapping into
a Louisiana gambling gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, who raised the San Francisco 49ers to professional
football's heights _ five Super Bowl victories in the 22 years he
owned the team _ said that the damage caused to his life by the
riverboat licensing scandal was irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   He can't vote or own a firearm and will always be remembered as
a felon whose crime cost him his beloved 49ers, not the business
tycoon and respected sportsman he aspired to be, DeBartolo told
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Polozola, presiding over Edwards'
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, ``it caused me to become estranged from my only
blood relative, my sister,'' he said. Denise DeBartolo York is now
sole owner of the 49ers, crown jewel of the billion-dollar Edward
J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo insisted throughout an often brutal cross-examination
by Edwards' attorney, Dan Small, that he had feared, distrusted and
been corrupted by the former governor, who has been a dominant
political figure in Louisiana for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo conceded that it was his word against Edwards' on the
question of whether Edwards had demanded a $400,000 payoff as a
condition of winning the license for a riverboat casino in Bossier
City, La. Although wiretaps and videotapes have played a big part
in the prosecution's case so far, there is no taped evidence of the
March 5, 1997, meeting between the two men at the Radisson Hotel in
Baton Rouge, where the demand was allegedly made.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can harass me, and you can try to make me change my mind,
but what happened on March 5 and what happened on March 12 (when
DeBartolo delivered $400,000 in $100 bills to Edwards) is done, and
that's why I'm here, and that's why I pleaded guilty,'' a visibly
angry DeBartolo told Small.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo is the linchpin of the prosecution's case against
Edwards, because he is the only witness able to testify that
Edwards took money from him in connection with a riverboat casino
license.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution hoped to wrap up its case on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo acknowledged that he had continued to do business with
Edwards after winning the license _ almost up to the day when FBI
agents raided Edwards' Baton Rouge home and seized cash from his
safe. Why not? he asked. ``His influence and his involvement were
still there,'' DeBartolo said. ``I paid $400,000 in extortion for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo-as-victim played heavily on both ends of the counsel
table, with the prosecution portraying Edwards as having conned the
younger man with his patented brand of Louisiana guile, and the
defense saying, in effect, that DeBartolo had been done in by his
own greed and deception.
</P>
<P>
   Small also made repeated reference to the absence of threats by
Edwards to DeBartolo during their many taped conversations, in
which DeBartolo was usually the initiator of the call, and to the
many friendly activities they engaged in together to debunk the
notion that DeBartolo was a victim.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo said that Edwards' political prowess held him in
thrall. With each phone call discussing the Bossier City riverboat
casino project, Edwards ``was telling me he's got all his hands and
all his tentacles right where he needs them,'' DeBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
   When Edwards slid a slip of paper with $400,000 written on it
across a table in the Radisson bar on March 5 and warned him of
problems with the license, ``it was a demand. It was a threat. And
it was paid on March 12,'' DeBartolo said. The license was awarded
to the DeBartolo Entertainment-Hollywood Casinos Inc. partnership
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   When Small probed two conspicuous inconsistencies in the
prosecution's case _ DeBartolo's petition for the lifting of his
one-year suspension from the National Football League and reporting
the $400,000 payment to Edwards on his income tax _ DeBartolo
disclaimed responsibility, although he signed both documents.
</P>
<P>
   The petition to NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that
DeBartolo had pleaded guilty only to ``a highly technical
violation'' of the law. ``I didn't tell the NFL anything,''
DeBartolo said. ``That was a submission by my lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's 1997 Internal Revenue Service form 1099 listed the
payment to Edwards under ``non-employee compensation.'' But
DeBartolo said that was the work of ``my attorneys and
accountants,'' without explaining how they would have known to list
it unless he had instructed them.

   Not Just a Monitor: The Price of Coolness &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flat-panel monitors have a higher ``cool'' factor than just
about anything else you can plug into a personal computer. They
also carry about the highest price tag of anything you can plug
into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics has not dropped the price, but it has hit
upon an interesting compromise. It has made its new line of
flat-panel devices more than mere computer monitors. The SyncMaster
150MP (15 inches) and 170MP (17 inches) are designed to have lives
of their own, apart from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plugged into a PC, the SyncMaster delivers sharp text and images
at a maximum resolution of 1,280 by 1,024 on the 17-inch model.
Plug in a coaxial cable and its built-in tuner and speakers turn
the monitor into a free-standing television. Actually, it does not
even have to stand. Its slim metallic body comes with a wall mount.
</P>
<P>
   The SyncMaster can also be used as a display for a VCR, a
camcorder or a DVD player. It has a picture-in-picture that can be
resized and a continuous zoom, up to 64 times, and is the first
monitor on the market to offer a wireless remote control.
</P>
<P>
   None of these feature-rich flat-panel monitors, which were
released this month, are cheap. The SyncMaster 150MP sells for
about $1,285, and the larger 170MP is about $2,620. That,
apparently, is the new price of cool.

   Handspring Is Set to Sell Visor Digital Assistants in Stores &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it has yet to completely shake complaints about
shipping delays with its telephone and Web sales operations,
Handspring said this week that it would sell its Visor digital
assistants through retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   When the gadgets were released last fall, Handspring's Web site
was not ready to take orders, and a toll-free number the company
provided was overwhelmed. To round things out, several orders
placed by customers who actually got through were corrupted by a
software glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all, from the CEO down, spent our holidays calling end
users back,'' said Greg Woock, Handspring's vice president for
North American sales, ``and I think we're now beating everyone in
the industry in customer support. Try getting through to
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Woock said that customers are now receiving orders within a
week. Some comments on an independent Web site
(www.visorcentral.com) support Woock's delivery estimate, but
others still complain about delays.
</P>
<P>
   The Visor was developed by several former employees of Palm
Computing and licenses the Palm operating system. But unlike Palm
products, the Visor accepts add-on hardware modules that adapt it
for different functions.
</P>
<P>
   Woock said the move to stores doesn't mean the Visor is giving
up on the Web as its main sales point. ``But the reality is that
there are customers who can't transact that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the two most expensive Visor models, the $179 Visor and the
$249 Visor deluxe edition, will be offered by retailers. The $149
Visor Solo will continue to be available only from Handspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to stores because the price is so aggressive we
can't afford to put it there,'' Woock said.

   New Web Site Will Track Bird Migrations With Radar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most nonscientists are familiar with Doppler radar as a system
that tracks precipitation and excites television meteorologists.
But a Web site starting on April 1, Birdcast.org
(www.birdcast.org), will adapt the technology to bird watching on a
large scale.
</P>
<P>
   Using software developed by GeoMarine, a private engineeringcompany, the site will map spring bird migration across a band
running roughly between Cape May, N.J., and western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The site will offer a daily migration forecast and practical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to warn people not to spray lawns if a movement
of birds is coming,'' said Steve Keating, director of Bird Source,
a databank operated by Cornell University and the National Audubon
Society. Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Academy of
Natural Science in Philadelphia are part of the coalition behind
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will also be looking at the data, Keating said, to
identify areas that are important resting spots for migrating birds
and then press for their preservation. Since the entire country is
covered by Doppler radar, Keating said, the Birdcast coalition
hopes to have a national network.

   Company Offers New Service To Warn Internet Shoppers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dictum ``caveat emptor'' has never rung more true than when
shoppers venture onto the Internet with open wallets. The reason,
experts say, is not to suggest that electronic merchants are less
scrupulous than their brick-and-mortar counterparts, only that
there are fewer shopper-comfort factors online: you can't look a
salesman in the eye, you can't feel the merchandise and you can't
walk around the store.
</P>
<P>
   Now ShopAssured, a free Web browser plug-in, promises to alert
shoppers almost instantly when they enter an e-commerce site that
has a poor reputation. It is being offered by WebAssured, based in
Indianapolis. Its president, Travis A. Morgan, described WebAssured
as a consumer protection service that has been giving e-merchants
with solid reputations a seal of approval since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the service alert shoppers, Morgan said, but it
also offers reports on the business' performance and provides
shoppers with a means to register complaints or praise for the
e-commerce site. The site's background reports come by way of an
alliance between WebAssured and Dun and Bradstreet, the commercial
credit information company.
</P>
<P>
   The ShopAssured plug-in requires shoppers to use Windows 95, 98,
NT or 2000 and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0. Morgan said
the software would soon be compatible with Netscape Navigator. It
can be downloaded at www.WebAssured.com. &QL;

SHELTER PACKED WITH 500 HOMELESS PEOPLE DURING STORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CRAIG 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As the storm raged, hundreds of homeless
people huddled inside the Presbyterian Night Shelter, some praying,
others trying to calm their crying children.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County's largest walk-in shelter has no windows. But the
echoes of rain and hail pounding the tin roof Tuesday night made
the killer storm a terrifying experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``These walls are the only place many of these people call
home,'' said Julie Walkup, associate pastor for mission at First
Presbyterian Church. Walkup was volunteering at the shelter at the
height of the storm. ``We could hear sheets of rain coming down.
Soon the lights went out ... and we could hear the tornado roaring
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was harmed at the shelter, but the tornado took its toll
on the homeless and needy in other ways. Neighboring shelters,
which were unoccupied, were damaged. At least one downtown mission
that feeds the poor could not open Wednesday because the area was
shut off.
</P>
<P>
   One homeless woman, who is believed to have paranoid
schizophrenia, wandered from the Safe Haven for the Homeless before
the storm hit and was still missing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shelter was packed with over 500 people,'' said John
Suggs, executive director of the night shelter. ``People were
spilled into our lobby. It's a miracle no one was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, glass from downtown businesses cluttered the back
yard of the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Battering winds mangled the roof and sucked the heating and
air-conditioning unit from a Veterans Affairs building at 2320
Cypress St.
</P>
<P>
   A program partly funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs
offers work to homeless veterans. The tornado damage will prevent
veterans from working in the warehouse until the roof can be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, the Presbyterian Night Shelter board declared
victory on its capital campaign, saying the project is nine months
ahead of schedule and $4 million over the target.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $1.9 million in cash and pledges was raised by the
end of February, primarily for a facility for homeless women and
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the facility, scheduled to open in June, lost its roof in
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structural engineers estimate that the damage to this roof
will put us behind now about a month,'' said Lee Ann Embry,
development director for the shelter. ``In the grander scheme of
things, we were blessed that none of our residents were hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Smith, director of the First United Methodist Mission at
First and Henderson streets, arrived at the mission building around
7 a.m. Wednesday to check for damage, but police barricades blocked
access to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock right now,'' she said. ``I don't know what the
damage is in the building. My concern is the people who come here
for help.''

MAYOR USES `POLICE POWER' TO CLOSE OFF FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ An ancient and seldom-mentioned law gave
Mayor Kenneth Barr the authority to use ``police power'' to keep
people away from the storm-ravaged streets and buildings of
downtown Fort Worth, an assistant city attorney said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police who barricaded the perimeter of downtown for much of
Wednesday stopped onlookers and people trying to reach their
offices as emergency crews assessed damage _ and shards of glass
fell from high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the storms, city officials said they would close
the hardest-hit areas because of broken glass, fallen power lines
and the possibility of looting.
</P>
<P>
   Some people got through, but officers were told that the
downtown area was ``basically off-limits to everybody for safety
reasons,'' police Detective S.A. Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr called on a law derived from a doctrine that says, ``The
government is there to keep the peace and protect the public's
welfare,'' Assistant City Attorney Hugh Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dates way, way back. It's been called the police power for
at least three or four hundred years,'' Davis said.

BOOK TALK: A NEW HOW-TO FOR WANT-TO'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one can help you. A writer is alone with it, by the nature
of it.'' This is a quotation from the novelist James Jones (``From
Here to Eternity''). One very likely could find a similar plaint
from the ghosts of all the authors past and in the petition of all
the writers present and all those to come. Nonetheless, there are
easily a hundred how-to books in print offering coaching in the
intricate technicalities of the writing craft.
</P>
<P>
   The genre could be loosely defined as literary mechanics, and it
includes manuals on how to plot, on beginnings and middles and
ends, on how to develop characters and viewpoints, on action, on
creating suspense, on the narrative. And there are guides to the
use of the American language like Strunk and White's ``Elements of
Style'' (Allyn &AMP; Bacon).
</P>
<P>
   The latest, one with an interesting variation of theme that
takes it beyond writerly mechanisms, went on sale last week. It is
``The Forest for the Trees: An Editor's Advice to Writers''
(Riverhead Books) by Betsy Lerner. In the book, Lerner, now a
literary agent but previously a publishing house editor, doesn't
preach on how to write a book but rather tries to help writers and
would-be authors cope with such problems as being ``alone with
it.'' It's a survival course. Or, as she said in an interview:
``It's not really on how to write. It's how to use your personality
and keep your personality; how to use your neuroses and not let
them overwhelm you; how to tap into self-promotion.'' In sum, there
is great creative power in using your personal craziness as a
tangible asset when writing.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner is not the first one to try to help a writer be
comfortable with the uncomfortable. Mark Twain wrote on writing and
publishing, and Flannery O'Connor has a collection of letters,
``The Habit of Being'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1979), a number of
which were about writing. Indeed, the first such book about writing
may have been the one written in China around A.D. 200, ``The Art
of Writing'' by Lu Chi. In soothing the writer concerned about
repeating themes, he reminded him that ``a common song sung to a
great melody is another way to find beauty.'' Think of that when
you find yourself imitating Hemingway. (Lu Chi's book, from
Milkweed Editions, is available through Amazon.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's book similarly tries to ease the writer's psyche. She
explains in its introduction that she wants to help the writer who
cannot get started embark, the writer stalled between projects
ignite. She asks: ``Is your neurotic behavior part of your creative
process or just ... neurotic behavior?'' She wants you to be ``an
effective self-promoter'' and not ``a self-saboteur.'' In the book
she contrasts Walt Whitman, the great self-promoter, with Emily
Dickinson, who Lerner feels could barely slip the pages of her
poetry out the front door of her house. The book is also an
affirmation that late bloomers can become successful writers, which
certainly will appeal to the millions of amateurs who before they
slip off to sleep at night half dream of writing novels.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, can one learn from a book how to be a
writer? Certainly those who teach writing courses at the graduate
level answer with a ``no'' as pounding as cannon fire, although to
be fair it must be said that probably none had yet read a book
quite like Lerner's message to the writer's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Conroy, the novelist who heads the Writers Workshop at the
University of Iowa, said: ``We never use a book that teaches you to
write; we never even read them. I don't think you can learn writing
from a book, except from reading literature.'' Jean McGarry, who is
chairwoman of the writing seminars at Johns Hopkins University, and
Melissa Hermerle, who heads the master's program in creative
writing at New York University, agree.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching process in the three programs revolves mostly
around students' writing, and fellow students and teachers'
discussing and criticizing their work. And reading literature.
McGarry said: ``We use novels and short stories and poems. The
student has to learn to read like a writer. He has to read a
paragraph by Hemingway and ask himself why it is so vivid and mine
is not? Why is a story shapely and suspenseful and mine is not?''
</P>
<P>
   That thought was reiterated by Hermerle. ``The closest we come
to craft books in fiction and poetry,'' she said, ``are the texts
of novels and poetry books.'' Still McGarry said, ``The students
don't know that they have lives and episodes.'' Which, of course,
is part of what Lerner hopes readers will realize from her book.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't learn to write by reading a how-to book, can you
become a novelist by going to school? The percentages are better.
Many students do get published; most don't. Those that do justify
the courses. ``Nathan Englander slouched around here for a couple
of years,'' Conroy said, ``and then went out and published this
incredibly good book, `For the Relief of Unbearable Urges.''' The
book, a collection of stories brought out a year ago by Alfred A.
Knopf, received wide critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said of would-be writers in the Iowa program: ``We guide
them. Maybe this should be in the third person, not the first
person. We try to get them to write the same time every day; even
to write in the same place every day. But we try to stay out of the
psychology part.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Into Eternity'' (Houghton Mifflin &AMP; Co., 1985), a
biography of James Jones, Frank MacShane quotes the writer as
having said: ``I'm working in the dark all the time. Whenever I
write something, that black, forbidding doubt is in, making me
wonder if I'm just some damned egotistical fool, or I really have
that spark of genius it takes to be a really great author like
Wolfe. If I only had some way of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones concluded, ``Sometimes I get so damned low I feel like
blowing my brains out.'' Maybe a little psychology wouldn't hurt in
these writing courses. Perhaps some of Lerner's survival stuff
would help a future Jones get past such forbidding moments, and
even use them.

&HT;     CLINTON CALLS OIL PRICE SHOCK `WAKE UP CALL' FOR FUEL
EFFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, welcoming OPEC's agreement to
boost the flow of crude oil Wednesday, called the recent oil price
shock a ``wake up call'' for America to intensify the quest for
energy independence with greater fuel efficiency for vehicles,
homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his administration and Congress should seize on the
``sobering experience'' of suffering 60 percent price increases in
gasoline to step up efforts to promote development of alternative
fuels and energy-saving technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked `till I was blue in the face about this for
years,'' lamented Clinton, who is now in the final 10 months of his
eight-year presidency. ``I hope very much that this is a little bit
of a wake-up call for all of us and that we can put this on the
front burner and get some action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the White House and Congress ``should do more'' to
reduce America's reliance on oil for 39 percent of its daily energy
needs. Foreign oil accounts for 52 percent of the nation's daily
oil consumption _ the highest reliance on overseas suppliers in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments at a White House news conference followed a
decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
increase the flow of crude oil by 7 percent in response to
entreaties by the Clinton administration. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
two nations defended from Iraqi aggression by the United States in
the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991, provide roughly one-third of
OPEC's daily crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's action, coupled with increased crude oil production by
non-OPEC nations such as Mexico, will add more than 1.7 million
barrels a day to the international flow of crude oil. The added
production is expected to cut the soaring cost of gasoline in the
United States where the price at the pump has jumped from about $1
a gallon last year to an average of $1.60 a gallon _ and nearly $2
in some regions.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC nations, suffering economic difficulties of their own, had
drastically cut back crude oil production over the past year in an
effort to drive up prices of about $10 a barrel 14 months ago. They
succeeded in pushing the price of oil to $34.37 a barrel earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, Clinton urged the nation's oil companies
to immediately give America's consumers the benefit of lower
gasoline prices rather than waiting for the increased flow of crude
oil from abroad to drive down costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge the oil companies to do everything they can to bring
the savings to consumers as quickly as possible,'' Clinton said.
``Right now, I think the prudent thing is to see how quickly these
prices can come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hickman, a spokesman at the American Petroleum Institute,
said the oil industry had no immediate comment about the
president's statements.
</P>
<P>
   It ordinarily takes about two months for Middle Eastern oil to
reach the United States, be refined into gasoline and shipped to
gasoline stations around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   John Llewellyn, global chief economist for the Lehman Brothers
securities firm, told reporters in New York that the increased flow
of crude oil from OPEC and non-OPEC countries will bring the oil
market ``back into balance'' with per-barrel cost edging downward
in the weeks ahead to between $20 and $25 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed OPEC's action as ``good news for our economy,''
adding that the increased flow of crude oil would reduce home
heating oil costs and gasoline costs ``in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to immediately reauthorize the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, an underground stockpile of crude oil stockpiled
by the United States for national emergencies. The Clinton
administration has declined to tap the emergency supply of oil to
help drive down consumer prices, saying that the reserve is only
intended to be used for national emergencies such as wartime oil
embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also rejected the suggestions of Republican lawmakers,
led by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that the federal
government ought to suspend the 4.3 cents per gallon federal
gasoline tax to help ease the burden on consumers. Clinton said
such a cutback may not get ``passed along to the consumers'' by the
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   In citing steps that the federal government could take to
strengthen America's energy independence, Clinton urged passage of
tax breaks to encourage the development of ethanol, a grain-based
alternative fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited steps to encourage production of highly
fuel-efficient vehicles that rely upon self-regenerating batteries
or duel fuels such as electricity and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of things we can do but we need to create some
markets for doing this,'' Clinton said. ``And there hasn't been a
lot of interest in it, I think, probably since the high prices of
the `70s.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arab oil embargo on crude oil shipments to the United States
in retaliation for U.S support for Israel during the 1973
Arab-Israeli War drove up oil prices for the remainder of the
1970s, prompting President Jimmy Carter to launch a fuel efficiency
crusade that called on Americans to turn down their thermostats in
the winter and turn them up in the summer. Carter wore cardigan
sweaters to symbolize his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ardent call for national self-discipline coupled with
higher oil prices set the stage for a generation of more fuel
efficient cars. But the fluctuating price of oil has hampered
federal efforts to mount a sustained campaign for energy efficiency
and alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that Americans are buying and driving gasoline
guzzling sports utility vehicles, adding: ``They want to drive
those vehicles. They like those big vehicles. But if they're going
to drive them, we're either going to have to find a way for them to
get batter mileage or run on alliterative fuels over the long
run.''

`SHOWER': REDISCOVERING WISDOM   IN A HOME LEFT BEHIND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an updated version of the parable of the prodigal son, the
black sheep who returns to the bosom of his family after a long
absence is less likely nowadays to be a sated sybarite than a rich,
snobbish yuppie revisiting the humble background he fled in shame.
Reconnecting with his roots, his shuttered heart opens, and he
discovers that indeed there's no place like home.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yang's sweet but serious comedy, ``Shower,'' offers an
uplifting, witty variation on this scenario. Set in contemporary
Beijing, the movie tells the story of Da Ming (Pu Cun Xin), a
sharply dressed young businessman who returns from the southern
Chinese region of Shenzhen to visit his aged father, Master Liu
(Zhu Xu).
</P>
<P>
   For decades Master Liu, whose health is fragile, has run a
bathhouse in a dilapidated district of Beijing. His right-hand man
is his mentally retarded younger son, Er Ming (Jiang Wu), who takes
a childlike delight in all the ritualized sloshing.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the worldviews of Master Liu and his
elder son is craftily suggested by an opening scene in which Da
Ming puts himself through a coin-operated automated shower that
resembles a human carwash. By contrast, at Master Liu's spacious
establishment everything is done slowly and by hand. Much more than
a steam bath, the place is a popular community center where the
neighborhood men pass the afternoon hours in conversation and games
of chess while drinking tea and being massaged. Two regular patrons
stage heated contests between fighting crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Lolling about in one of Master Liu's steamy pools is a little
like attending a languid group therapy session in which people
confide their secrets and work out their anxieties. In one running
subplot, a shy, chubby teen-ager preparing to appear in a local
pageant loudly rehearses ``O Sole Mio,'' but he is comfortable
singing only when he is under a spray of water. When Er Ming
playfully turns off the shower, the precocious belter instantly
buttons up.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's quirky characters are its best defense against
sentimentality. Besides the operatically inclined teen-ager and the
promoters of fighting crickets, they include a debt-ridden patron
who is chased into a pool by shady creditors and a henpecked
husband for whom the bathhouse is the only refuge from his
screaming harridan of a wife. The ever-patient Master Liu ends up
playing marriage counselor and sex therapist for this frustrated
couple.
</P>
<P>
   As Da Ming's visit lengthens, he begins to absorb his father's
wisdom by a kind of osmosis. He also begins to take responsibility
for the younger brother, whose existence he had kept secret from
his wife. The father-son strife is powerfully conveyed in calm,
sorrowful performances that establish the movie's bittersweet mood.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a daring imaginative leap, ``Shower,'' which New
Directors/New Films is screening Thursday and Saturday at the
Museum of Modern Art, also reaches beyond the present to meditate
on water as a precious natural resource. Interwoven with the story
of Da Ming's return are visionary scenes of earlier generations of
the same family, struggling against drought in northern China's
arid climes. These scenes, staged as quasi-mythical vignettes,
deepen the movie's ambivalent attitude toward progress and the
drastic effects it can have on a settled community.  &QL;

 &HT;    Delta to buy up to 500 more regional jets over next decade
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines will buy as many as 500 more regional jets for
its Delta Connection carriers over the next decade, at a cost of
$20 million per plane, or up to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded aircraft order, announced as expected on Wednesday,
reflects Delta's embrace of the new class of minijets.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are using the planes to replace turboprops on some
feeder routes and to open new long-haul markets that don't justify
big-jet service. They fly faster and farther than turboprops and
are regarded as more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Delta described its deal with Montreal-based jet maker
Bombardier Inc. as ``the largest regional jet order in aviation
history.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes firm orders for 94 RJs for delivery through 2004. Of
those, 52 will go to Atlantic Southeast Airlines, which feeds
Delta's hubs in Atlanta and Dallas-Forth Worth, and 42 to Comair,
which feeds its Cincinnati hub and flies in Florida. Both operate
under the Delta Connection banner.
</P>
<P>
   Those orders will be in addition to 57 previous orders at ASA
and Comair, which already have about 130 of the planes in their
fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal also gives Delta options to buy another 406 RJs
through 2010. Options are reserved production slots that must be
confirmed or dropped by certain deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The planes will include a mix of Canadair Regional Jet models
with 40, 44, 50 and 70 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded order could enable ASA, which still flies more
turboprops than jets, to convert to an all-jet fleet over the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would certainly be our dream,'' said David Siebenburgen,
chief executive of Delta Connection Inc., which oversees ASA and
Comair.
</P>
<P>
   Comair, which was the first regional carrier to use jets, is
scheduled to be all-jet by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has been among the most aggressive carriers in deploying
RJs, in part because its pilots' union contract doesn't limit how
many its feeder subsidiaries can operate. Contracts at some other
carriers have tighter restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots union may seek tighter limits in new contract
talks now under way, but so far the union has not disclosed its
negotiating position on the issue.

 &HT;    'On-time' contract between Delta and pilots' union seen as
unlikely
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contract negotiations between Delta Air Lines and its pilots'
union are unlikely to produce an ``on-time'' deal by May 1 as had
been hoped, company and union officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very tough to get it done by that deadline,''
said Delta Chairman and Chief Executive Leo Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances have diminished because of the pace of the past
four weeks or so,'' said Charles Giambusso, chairman of Delta's Air
Line Pilots Association unit.
</P>
<P>
   The two spoke in separate interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and ALPA opened contract talks in September, six months
ahead of schedule by mutual agreement. The goal was a deal by May
1, when the current contract becomes amendable.
</P>
<P>
   So far, several technical sections of the new accord have been
negotiated and scheduling issues are now being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the stickiest issues _ pay rates among them _
haven't even hit the table.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' union, still smarting from what it views as a
concessionary contract inked in 1996, is expected to seek hefty pay
increases, as well as a voting board seat and new limits on Delta's
use of regional jets flown by lower-paid pilots employed by
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good and I think the union feels good about the talks
so far, but the problem is discussions on the really tough elements
of compensation have not yet occurred,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe we can get it done by May 1, but if
not I hope it will be soon thereafter, and certainly there's
nothing in terms of attitude holding us up,'' he said. ``It's just
a work issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambusso said he proposed last month that talks be accelerated.
``The company responded to some degree but it still hasn't really
accelerated progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with talks starting early, an on-time pilot contract would
have been highly unusual for the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Typically such talks run for more than a year and usually result
in federal mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Under airline labor law, union contracts don't expire at the
amendable date but continue until a new deal is struck or a strike
occurs.

FINDING NEW CRACKS IN AN EXPOSED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio)  (lh) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the voice of Judy Garland, back from the dead. And it's
coming from all the speakers in Gerald Clarke's big house in
Bridgehampton, N.Y. ``No more `Over the Rainbow' for me,'' Garland
says in a throaty drawl. ``I've grown up. Those days are over.''
Garland made those tapes during the mid-'60s for a possible
autobiography, said Clarke, whose own biography of her, ``Get
Happy: The Life of Judy Garland,'' is being published by Random
House this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's where she's spaced out,'' said Clarke, listening
intently. Clarke had bought the tapes, he said, from one of the
many Garland fans among whom they circulate. ``I am an angry lady.
I'm a lady who is angry,'' Garland says. ``I've been insulted,
humiliated.'' Garland, who died in 1969, was angry at her agent,
David Begelman, who she thought was stealing money from her, and at
reporters who chronicled her every stumble. ``The world has turned
against her,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been at least four full-scale biographies of
Judy Garland, plus several memoirs by those who knew her. Indeed,
Garland's life is a well-known soap opera. There was the unhappy
childhood, the overdoses, the suicide attempts, the exploitative
relationships with men, the five husbands, the tantrums and her
seemingly erratic mothering of her children, Lorna and Joey Luft
and Liza Minnelli. But for those who don't already know enough
about Garland, there is more in Clarke's book.
</P>
<P>
   During his research, Clarke stumbled on what could only be
called pure gold for a biographer. He said he found an unpublished
manuscript of Garland's 68-page autobiography in the Random House
archives at Columbia University. It was begun by Garland with her
friend Fred Finklehoffe in 1960, when ``she was ill with
hepatitis,'' said Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said that the autobiography included an account in
Garland's own words of her being groped by Louis B. Mayer. ``He'd
say, as he came up close to me. `This girl is great _ just great.
Nobody sings better than she does, and the reason is that she sings
from the heart,''' Garland wrote, or rather dictated, to
Finklehoffe. ``And with that he's (sic) always find my left breast
with his hand _ and that wasn't difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The autobiography also held clues to what happened to Garland's
first marriage to David Rose, the composer. ``Nobody really knew
what was going on with her first marriage,'' said Clarke. In the
manuscript, he said, she reveals that when she became pregnant
around age 20, Rose and her mother pressed her to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Garland never finished her autobiography, said Clarke. She
recovered from hepatitis and began performing again, her career
reaching its peak with her 1961 concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, the author of a 1988 biography of Truman Capote, said he
began the Garland biography because ``it's a story that people
thought they knew but they really did not. It's a little bit like
the Edgar Allan Poe story where everybody is searching for a
missing document. They scour the room, and the missing document is
right there hanging on the wall in a frame.''
</P>
<P>
   A tweedy figure who speaks in soft, educated tones, Clarke, 62,
spent 10 years researching the book. One discovery, he said,
involved Garland's beloved father, Frank Gumm, an entertainer who
in the early part of the century moved almost constantly from town
to town. From interviews with people who had known him, Clarke
said, he learned that Gumm had made sexual overtures to young men
and had twice been forced to leave towns because of that.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he had also discovered new information about
Garland's drug use. ``One of the keys to Judy was the drugs which
ended her life,'' he said. ``One of the main concerns was, how did
she get started on drugs? Everybody thought it was MGM that was the
culprit. It took me awhile to discover it was her mother, and that
changed the picture altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most other biographers said Judy was making up all this about
her mother; she called her the `real wicked witch of the West.' But
the mother was as bad as Judy said she was, even worse in a way.''
Clarke says that Ethel Gumm plied Judy and her sisters, Mary Jane
and Virginia, with pep pills to keep them alert and then gave them
sleeping pills to help them sleep. ``I've got to keep these girls
going!'' Clarke's book reports she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Clarke writes of Garland's long history of
involvement with gay men and her problems with her husbands. None
of Garland's children cooperated with the biography, said Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was able to interview Garland's fifth and final husband,
Mickey Deans, whose real last name was DeVinko. He said that Deans
documented the final months of Garland's life, her efforts to
establish a real marriage with him, and her constant demands. It
was Deans who discovered Garland dead in her bathroom in their home
in London, from an overdose of barbiturates. The death was ruled a
result of ``incautious self-overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pretty picture, but ``I'm a biographer, not an
acolyte,'' said Clarke. ``There are fans, I've met a lot, who will
hear nothing bad about Judy. They're furious I've written about her
sex life _ `Oh no, no, no!'''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was brought up in California and Ohio, the son of an
aircraft engineer. He graduated from Yale and spent a year at
Harvard Law School. ``My year at Harvard Law School did me very
little good,'' he said, ``except for the fact that I don't accept
that which I don't believe, or things that aren't provable. I

   In 1965 Clarke went to work for Time magazine, where, he said,
writing a cover story on Liza Minnelli paved the way for the
Garland biography. He quit in 1987 to write his Capote biography,
which became a best seller. A year ago Clarke moved from New York
City to live full time in his house in Bridgehampton, which he
built with Lawrence Saul, his partner of 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's personal life may have been tawdry at times, Clarke
said, but her greatness lay in her sincerity. ``You never feel
she's acting,'' he said. ``It's the same when she's singing.
There's nothing between her and the audience. It's raw emotion.''
While most singers put the music before the words, ``Judy put the
words before the music. It was as if she were telling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always as if you were hearing it for the first time,''
Clarke said. ``She was a miniature Scheherazade.''

   BUENOS AIRES, Ariz. _ We spent the night sleeping on the grass
under a full moon, with Baboquivari Peak, the Tohono O'odham's
sacred mountain, looming to the north, and the high-pitched barking
of coyotes breaking through our dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Astorga, a Comcaac medicine woman, had massaged sore legs
and blistered feet with a salve made from the leaves of the
creosote bush. We had made camp at the Buenos Aires National
Wildlife Refuge, a few miles north of the Mexican border, and a
soothing tea of desert lavender helped aching bodies sleep. The
next morning, after a little pinole, thin porridge made of
chapalote, the oldest corn in the Southwest, nopalitos (prickly
pear cactus, which tastes a bit like okra, a bit like beans), eggs
and tortillas, we set off for another 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 ``desert pilgrims,'' as they called themselves _ a
multicultural group of O'odham, Comcaac and Yoeme Indians, as well
as their botanist-ecologist friends _ had started out March 10, to
walk 240 miles from El Desemboque, a Mexican village on the Sea of
Cortez, across the Sonoran Desert in the footsteps of their
ancestors. Ranging in age from 17 to 70, they walked into the
Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, in Tucson, 12 days later on the heels
of the spring equinox. Tears streaming down their faces, they may
have been limping, but their hearts sang from what they found in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Eating only native foods and treating their ailments with wild
plants from the desert, they walked to raise awareness of diabetes,
which affects half the O'odham people of southern Arizona
(historically known as the River Pima and Papago), the highest rate
in the world, and which is now filtering into the remote Mexican
villages of the Comcaac (also known as the Seri).
</P>
<P>
   Many had relatives or friends with diabetes, which affects
250,000 American Indians in the Southwest, even children 6 years
old. And yet, before World War II, when those tribes began to trade
their native diet for white bread and high-fat foods, the disease
was virtually unknown. And so these pilgrims were going cold turkey
on soda and beer, cheeseburgers and doughnuts and all the other
high-fat, high-sugar foods that exacerbate the disease, living
instead on the foods that desert people had evolved with for
thousands of years, like tepary beans, squash, cactus and mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   These foods are low in fat and sugar but high in the complex
carbohydrates and soluble fibers that studies among desert
dwellers, both in Arizona and Australia, have shown to lower blood
glucose, insulin and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   But their connection to desert tribes is more complex than the
dance of biochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could can these foods and make McDonald's burgers out of
them, but you would lose the connection between people and the
land,'' said Dr. Gary Nabhan, a director of conservation and
science at the Desert Museum, as we walked one morning along an
arroyo bordered by saguaro, live oak and ocotillo just beginning to
open its blood-red flowers. Those plants hold the key to myths,
sacred ceremonies and self-identity. And the march, inspired by
Nabhan's own year of living off the land honored those connections.
</P>
<P>
   It also shone a light on the plants and animals that are
vanishing, as development eats the desert. The number of ironwood
trees, for example, which have sustained desert people for
thousands of years while providing habitat for more than 500
species of plants and animals, is being sliced in half by suburban
growth.
</P>
<P>
   At night, as Adolfo Burgos, a Seri elder, shook his tin-can
rattles, festooned with colorful ribbons, and sang in a nasal,
high-pitched staccato, Seri youths took turns dancing on a board
that signified the carapace of a sea turtle. Their feet playing
counterpoint to the ratcheting song, each tried joyfully to outdo
the other. It was like tap dancing from the other side of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   When the O'odham dance, they join hands around their elders, who
sing seated in the middle of the circle. Christine Johnson heard
her son, Tony, sing the songs she had nearly forgotten, after a
feast of rabbit, venison, beans, giant tortillas and mesquite
cookies at an O'odham community center in the settlement of Little
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry with me for not teaching him the old ways,''
said Johnson, who is a diabetic. He went off to college and came
back one summer, to ask his uncle to teach him the ancient songs.
When her brother died, Tony apprenticed himself to Danny Lopez, an
O'odham elder, giving up graduate studies at Harvard to learn from
the living treasures before they disappear. And before he left for
the desert walk, he told his mother: ``I'm walking for you. Take
your medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson watched him go as she ate a bowl of cholla cactus buds,
which are full of the complex carbohydrates and soluble fibers that
doctors now think can not only protect her from diabetes, but
control the disease by regulating glucose and insulin levels.
Native foods, in other words, may be her best medicine.

<P>
   The two tribes once traveled this same route, the O'odham
trading squashes and watermelons for the Seri's sealskin sandals
and pelican skin robes. Sometimes they fell in love and had
children. And these modern-day walkers, who have replaced smoke
signals with satellite phones and who post daily pictures and notes
on the Web, recalled long-lost relatives and horrors of mass
killing.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, after leaving the coast, where dolphins brought
good weather, they stood at a rocky hillside full of petroglyphs,
fascinated by the drawings of men, rattlesnakes and family marks of
their own people. Two of the Seri elders recalled a massacre more
than 150 years ago. An O'odham cowboy had married a Seri woman, and
her relatives arrived at the ranch he managed for a Mexican
landowner. He killed a few cattle to feed them all, and the rancher
called out soldiers. The Seri woman and her clan escaped, but the
O'odham, who were sleeping behind some yuccas, were crushed by huge
rocks the Mexicans rolled down from the mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When other O'odham arrived days later, they found the bodies
of their relatives, but no sign of any Seri,'' said Nabhan, who
often translated for the Seri. ``So they thought the Seri had
killed their people, and they never returned.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 years later, both tribes stood at the wall and
wept over the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Seri, one of the last hunting and gathering tribes in
the world, number only 650. They are prohibited from hunting sea
turtles around the islands and coastal lands to which they have
been restricted by the Mexican government. Many of their wild
resources, like the ironwood trees that have provided them with
food, medicine, long-burning fuel and durable carving wood, are cut
and chipped for ``mesquite'' charcoal, and cut down with chain saws
to make knockoffs of Seri carvings.
</P>
<P>
   The O'odham have abandoned the crops they once planted after the
rains came to the desert flood plains. They no longer gather the
fruits of the saguaro cactus for the sacred rain dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``During World War II, O'odham men entered the military,'' said
Tristan Reader, a co-director of Tohono O'odham Community Action,
one of the sponsors of the walk. Then they worked in commercial
cotton fields, with little time or energy to prepare their own
fields for the summer monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not planting your fields, you're not going to care
as much if the rain comes,'' Reader said. So the O'odham stopped
picking saguaro fruits and making wine for the rain ceremony. It
was a lot easier to go to the commodities store. And diabetes came
to the O'odham.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, young O'odham men made this same journey to gather
salt from the Sea of Cortez, and to pray for strength and personal
acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Although these modern-day pilgrims had a backup of several vans
that carried their gear, extra water and cholla buds out of a can,
many were experiencing the shock of walking 20 miles a day, not to
mention gravity's pull on all those accumulated cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was hot, and it was easy to stumble on the cobbles of
the steep trail that headed toward the great pointed peak of
Baboquivari Peak, the home of I'itoi, the O'odham's creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the earth was newly made ... ,'' Lopez sang out in his
native tongue, the voices of his young apprentices rising with the
creation song. His eyes were moist, but there was a decisiveness in
his ironwood walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   Far ahead, the long-limbed young Seri men streaked along a
switchback, their bodies silhouetted against the mountain like
figures in a cave painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them,'' Lopez said softly. ``They still hunt and fish.
They are so slender. And look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few silent paces, he added: ``I've been doing a lot of
thinking these past few days. All the food we gobble. The macaroni
and cheese, the canned stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more silent paces. ``It seems to me we're always standing
there with our hand out,'' he said. ``We don't even make our own
houses anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, diabetes has reached the Seri too, along with the
convenience stores near Kino Bay, 20 miles from their villages.
It's the only place where you can get a cold drink. And when you
live without running water or electricity, you know what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister died of diabetes four years ago,'' said Guadalupe
Lopez Blanco, 70, president of the Comcaac council of elders.
`People started getting it about 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoholism riddled Terrol Johnson's family, but his father, an
O'odham who worked as a mechanic for 30 years, always put food on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up with television and white bread. But a year in
Australia as an exchange student changed his life. ``I saw that the
Aborigines were just like my people,'' he said. ``Stuck on
reservations, with diabetes and alcoholism. That's when I realized
I'm not white. I'm O'odham.''
</P>
<P>
   He came home, dropped out of school and apprenticed himself to a
basket weaver, discovering the threads of culture in the ancient
designs. Now his work sells for up to $5,000 for large gourd
baskets, but he spends most of his time teaching weaving and the
traditional medicine he learned from his grandfather, a medicine
man.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Tohono Cultural Action in his own home, with Tristan
Reader, and the group now runs an alternative school that focuses
on native foods, agriculture and traditional arts. Lopez, who has a
master's degree in language arts, is teaching at the same school,
and last year his students learned the songs and dances that bring
the rain (it came) and planted tepary beans in the drenched fields.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, in El Desemboque, Angelita Molina, a Seri weaver,
had shown O'odham weavers how to prepare the long stalks of
limberbush for making baskets. And both had lamented the scarcity
of materials, like beargrass, devil's claw and yucca.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to pick yucca around Three Points,'' said Johnson,
referring to the town in Arizona. ``But people have bought land
there, and they're just bulldozing our yucca.''
</P>
<P>
   One hot morning, under a glaring sun, Nabhan pointed out an
agave known as the century plant, which had bloomed and died along
the arroyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plant's roots are full of a starch called inulin, which is
more slowly released into the bloodstream'' than simpler starches,
said Nabhan, an ethnobotanist who received a MacArthur Foundation
grant 10 years ago for his work linking the health of desert people
to native seeds and crops.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that ``the gooey stuff'' in prickly pear and
other cactus plants, is extracellular mucilage, which helps the
plant conserve water and continue the process of photosynthesis
under a beating sun.
</P>
<P>
   Those same gooey substances help to slow digestion and to stem
any sudden rise of blood sugar, he said, ``and the O'odham
metabolism may have adapted, after centuries of dependence on these
foods.''
</P>
<P>
   We came to a shady grove of Emory oaks and ironwood trees, where
the ruins of four stone houses lay abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom herded her cattle up here in the summer,'' said Elaine
Lopez, who remembered picking apricots and pomegranates from the
trees and shrubs that once grew on the terraced beds right outside
the door. `We spent the summer up here because it's cool and the
rains hit here first, in June.'' The Lopezes planted corn and
melons in the wet fields below, chilies and cilantro in the shade
of the fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   We rested a while by the door of her parents' house. Its thick
walls kept things cool in summer, but most nights, Lopez said, they
slept outside under the watto, an arbor made of mesquite and
ocotillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has a Crock-Pot and a microwave now,'' Lopez said.
But the flavor of tepary beans cooked in an iron pot over coals
still calls to Lopez.

`THE DAUGHTER OF' IS ON HER OWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL WELIN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get this out of the way, right up front: Shana Morrison is
the daughter of lyricist-novelist Janet Planet and legendary rocker
Van Morrison. Yes, ``Here Comes the Night,'' ``Gloria,''
``Brown-Eyed Girl,'' ``Tupelo Honey,'' that Van Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   But his daughter chose another path. The 29-year-old holds a
degree in international business from Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved math when I was a kid,'' Morrison said by telephone
from her home in Mill Valley, Calif. But ``I sat in front of a
computer too long _ no offense.'' Stifling a throaty laugh, she
continued, ``That last year in college was too hard. When I
graduated, I knew I wanted to get a job, so my dad offered me a job
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, she's got a voice, she writes intriguing songs and the
business degree is helpful, but is a thing of the past. Morrison
and her band, Caledonia, have a recording contract with Monster
Records, have cut their first CD, have a second in the works and
are on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always sang ... in choir and in school musicals ... that
sort of thing. And I always wrote poetry. It all seemed to come
together one day, and I just began putting the poetry to music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Caledonia'' is an solid, eclectic first effort, ranging from
airy modern pop (``I Spy'') to a more-classic sound (``Yes, Yes,
Yes,'' ``Can't Hold On'') to bluesy rock (``House of Mirrors''),
all with a sweet, country influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's a definite country tinge there,'' Morrison said.
She said about half of her records are Irish, and ``Irish music is
country music.''
</P>
<P>
   She included ``Sweet Thing,'' a tune from her father's classic
1968 song cycle, ``Astral Weeks,'' and managed to one-up the old
man for passion and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first song I can remember from when I was very, very
small,'' Morrison said, sighing from the memory, or perhaps because
she's been asked to talk about it so frequently. ``The band wanted
to put it on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Risking another sigh, another tired question: Just how much has
her father helped her career?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a big `advice guy,' but he's definitely helped me. I
sang with him for records and on a soundtrack. Singing with him on
the Rock `n' Soul Revue and on the soundtrack added to my
confidence as to what I can do, and to say _ for any musician to
say that they've worked with him _ is a thing of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still I didn't want to be too-much billed as `the daughter
of,' you know?''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't occur too much longer.
</P>
<P>

A PERFECTIONIST WHO CAN LAUGH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Joseph Carman's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the choreographer Doug Varone.)  
(af) 
 By JOSEPH CARMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choreographer Tere O'Connor was patiently administering
notes to his dancers during a recent rehearsal of his new work,
``Hi Everybody!'' ``One, two, three,'' he intoned, patiently
counting the beat as his six dancer-actors whirled around him.
``Chrysa, there's a step before that attitude turn. Greg, can you
make the Southern guy more of a big old redneck, like you used
to?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some choreographers, who bark like drill sergeants at
their dancers, O'Connor seldom raises his voice, although inside,
he says, his vision of what should be sometimes collides with his
realization of what is, pushing him to the point of a scream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Everybody!,'' which opens on Thursday for a three-week run
at Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan, is a poetic, absurdist
combination of dance and what O'Connor calls ``the theater of the
obvious,'' meant to entertain the audience while disorienting it
and provoking it into a catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   The work, with an original score by James Baker and lighting by
Brian MacDevitt, was cited for its initial production at the
Kitchen last year when O'Connor received a Bessie Award for
sustained achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his previous pure-dance pieces, ``Hi Everybody!''
integrates text into the choreography and tosses around political
issues as well as dance and acting styles. With his veteran
downtown troupe (Nancy Bannon, Rob Besserer, Marc Kenison, Heather
Olson, Chrysa Parkinson and Greg Zuccolo), O'Connor has created a
distinct theatrical voice that is simultaneously humorous and
ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   As for the title, O'Connor explains that ``Hi Everybody!'' is
his metaphor for the way he acknowledges everything that crosses
his mind. ``I have a very multiplicitous thought process,'' he
said. ``Accidentally, that is quite aligned with the culture right
now. There is much too much to take in. But fortunately I already
have way too much going on, so I have a similar structure.'' Here
he broke into a belly laugh worthy of Falstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantello, the director of ``The Vagina Monologues'' and a
Tony-nominated actor in ``Angels in America,'' described the effect
of O'Connor's theatrical approach on the audience: ``The
juxtaposition of the formality of the choreography, which is so
beautiful, and then these strange little improvisational scenes
that the dancers break out of are so incredibly moving and yet are
so irreverent and funny. There is this fractured narrative that
goes on, and somehow by the end you've had this complete and total
experience that defies logic and words.''
</P>
<P>
   In one segment of ``Hi Everybody!'' a female dancer stops the
choreographic momentum to cajole the five other performers into
forming an impromptu grief support group. After a series of
dramatic confrontations that range in acting style from 1950s
Tennessee Williams to television sitcom, she is comically swept
into the undertow of an ensemble dance phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers later break into an unexpectedly campy fandango,
followed by a Greek chorus of ``three flamboyant, stereotypical
fags,'' as O'Connor describes them, who comment on gay-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Connor, 41, the combination of text and choreography is a
recent development. Before the premiere of his work ``Mother'' in
1996 he confined himself to dance steps. Five years ago, Mikhail
Baryshnikov saw his work and was impressed by his choreographic
craftsmanship. Baryshnikov, on a break from his own rehearsals last
week, explained why he admired O'Connor's talent: ``His works are
deeply personal, quirky and utterly amusing, but beneath the humor
lies tenderness and truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, in 1995 Baryshnikov commissioned O'Connor to
create an abstract dance work for the White Oak Dance Project. That
became ``Greta in the Ditch.'' There came a point, however, when
O'Connor lost interest in the formal aspects of dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped looking at my own internal world and started looking
at the world around me and was upset by many things,'' he said. ``I
consider theater as a place to exorcise fears. I thought I would
fully confront that, and writing seemed to be the next logical
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he now subjects his text to the same kind of
rhythmic scrutiny he has always applied to his choreography. This
year, he staged a new work, ``Orshi's Dilemma,'' for a dance troupe
in Budapest, for which his English script was translated into
Hungarian rap.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor introduces politics into ``Hi Everybody!,''
specifically issues like the disenfranchisement of the elderly and
the debate over gay marriages. But he does it in a way that doesn't
hit the audience over the head with messages. As Mantello says:
``It's more subversive in its politics. Tere leaves room for you to
come to it. There is air within.''

PRAGUE TO PRESERVE OLD JEWISH CEMETERY FOUND DURING CONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The Czech government said Wednesday
that it would pay to preserve a medieval Jewish cemetery that was
discovered underground during construction in Prague three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to accommodate the claims of Jewish groups in
Prague and the insurance company that is building on the land, the
government agreed to finance the rescue of several hundred graves,
some of which may date back to 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech minister of culture, Pavel Dostal, said he would
declare the whole area surrounding the site a cultural landmark and
promised to save undisturbed graves and to rebury bones that were
disturbed in the construction. The government will allocate $1.2
million to cover the costs, and the company agreed to pay any
additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of some 130 skeletons, unearthed in the last two
years, will be reburied at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups in Prague and abroad welcomed the decision. ``We
congratulate the Czech authorities and society for recognizing the
sacred interest over economic interest,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier,
president of the North American Boards of Rabbis, who had been
mediating the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that certain elements of the Jewish community
would accept the jurisdiction of the Prague Jewish community in
this matter,'' he added, referring to groups abroad, including
Orthodox Jews, who demanded that the construction be abandoned
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   According to historians, the cemetery officially operated into
the 15th century. In its day, it served as a central burial site
for all Bohemian Jews. The recent discovery of undisturbed graves
in the deeper layers caused great interest among archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   Ceska Pojistovna, the insurance company that owns the lot and
several adjacent buildings, had hoped to carry out speedy
construction of its new administration building. But it when it
found the graves, it halted construction and financed the dig.
</P>
<P>
   The underground graveyard, whose tombstones have been reused
over the centuries, will be sealed in concrete on all sides, and
the building will be built around it.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech government allocated less money than the company had
hoped for, but Ceska Pojistovna's spokesman Vaclav Balek said his
company would accept the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help to save a cultural landmark and make it easier
on taxpayers,'' he said. ``We have no problem with the decision. We
wanted to reach a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The small Jewish community in Prague also welcomed the
government's decision with relief. ``We are happy with the
solution,'' said Tomas Kraus, the director of the Federation of
Czech Jewish Communities. ``This is a victory of common sense.''

&HT;     COURT WRESTLES WITH SCHOOL PRAYER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tackling the controversial issue of school prayer,
the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether school
districts can let students lead stadium crowds in prayer before
high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades after the court banned officially sponsored
prayers in public schools, the justices struggled once more to
balance students' free-speech rights with the Constitution's
requirement for the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line?'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked
Jay Sekulow, a Washington-based attorney representing the Santa Fe,
Texas, school district.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the legality of the district's policy allowing
students to vote on whether they want to offer a pre-game message
to ``solemnize'' the event and promote good sportsmanship. School
officials contend that the students, not district officials, choose
who will deliver the message and that the deliver decides the
content of that message.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall during football season, senior Marian Ward was elected
by the student body to present the pre-game message at all home
games. Ward chose religious themes. The adopted daughter of a
Baptist minister, Ward received a standing ovation when she stepped
before the public address system and asked for God's blessing for
the players and spectators.When school officials said they wanted
to review her message before she presented it, she filed suit in
federal district court and won an injunction allowing her to say
what she wanted during the pre-game ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit struck down the
practice last year, ruling that any policy that allows
proselytizing benedictions and invocations was unconstitutional.
The court also looked at a revised district policy that would
require the messages to be ``nonsectarian and nonproselytizing''
but concluded that under no circumstances could pre-kickoff prayer
be proper for a high school football game.``Football games ...
[are] hardly the sober type of annual event that can be
appropriately solemnized with prayer,'' the appeals court declared.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before high court Wednesday, Sekulow said that while the
football policy doesn't exclude religious messages, it doesn't
specifically promote them either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school has no say whatsoever in what the student's message
is,'' he said. ``There's nothing in the school's policy that says,
`Do talk about God or don't talk about God' it's completely
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen Kennedy said using elections to choose the
speaker _ who could then hold a prayer _ at a school function could
lead to a ``majority of students imposing their beliefs on the
minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said students could choose not to attend the game if
they objected to a prayer. Chief Justice William Rehnquist made it
clear later that he agreed with that statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice David Souter told Sekulow that members of the band,
cheerleaders and the football players were ``obligated'' to attend
the games and thus ``forced'' to listen to the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the fact that a student is forced to
listen to a prayer is as far as we have to go to in deciding this
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, in defending the school
district's policy, insisted that the case is about free speech and
preserving ideals of Santa Fe _ a town of 8,600 residents that has
more churches than restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He said the school's policy is ``viewpoint neutral'' and said
that striking it down could lead to ``viewpoint discrimination''
against students who want their message to be a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged his assertion that
the policy is really neutral. ``I very much doubt whether the
school would allow a student to get up before the game and
proclaim, `All religion is bunk,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Griffin of Galveston, Texas, representing students and
parents who challenged the policy, said that that even though the
school asks the students to vote on whether to have some message,
religious or otherwise, at games, the policy is designed ``to
achieve a single, majoritarian answer ... and to impose that answer
on everyone in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said that students should be allowed to ``pray before,
after and even during the game'' but that their prayers should be
``a private discussion between them and God, and not something done
over a microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who seemed most sympathetic to the
now-suspended policy, noted that it would allow a student to give a
``message or invocation.'' But he added, ``You have no idea whether
that student is going to say anything about religion. The student
could talk about anything.'' He also said that ``you can't say that
in every case it's going to produce a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin argued that because of the town's deeply-held religious
beliefs, it was ``almost a certainty that sooner or later the
elected student would begin a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   When the high court last took up the subject of school prayer
eight years ago, it ruled 5-4 that prayer at a public school
graduation violated the First Amendment's rule that government
``shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.'' In
that Rhode Island dispute, the court emphasized that school
officials had organized the prayer exercise and that students were
obligated to attend the graduation ceremony. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has filed
briefs backing the school district. On the Texas Republican primary
ballot earlier this month, voters were asked whether they approved
of student-led prayer at school sports events. More than 94 percent
did.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS FAST, EFFECTIVE, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TORNADO-TEXAS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GINGER D. RICHARDSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The unthinkable has happened in Fort Worth _
twice.
</P>
<P>
   As haggard city officials gathered Wednesday at the Police and
Fire Training Academy just west of downtown, the scene was eerily
similar to one just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado tears through downtown, leaving death and destruction in
its wake. Lone gunman opens fire at Wedgwood Baptist Church,
killing seven and then himself.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, Fort Worth leaders implemented a disaster response
plan that they, and some state officials, are saying saved lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city should be praised for the way they handled this,''
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said during a news conference Wednesday
morning. ``This could have been a tragedy of monumental
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 5 p.m. Tuesday, the city was staffing its emergency
management office in the City Hall basement. After monitoring
weather reports, city workers first sounded the emergency sirens at
6:11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado touched down four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty police and fire personnel, who were recalled to search
buildings and assist injured victims, received additional help from
the Texas Urban Search &AMP; Rescue Team, a state-funded group created
by the Legislature to help in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Transportation Authority supplied five buses to
take people out of downtown, paramedics treated the wounded at a
triage center at the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the city set
up a hot line through its Water Department to take calls from
panicked residents.
</P>
<P>
   In less than six hours, 911 personnel dispatched officers and
firefighters in response to 2,100 calls. Normally, emergency
personnel don't respond to that many calls in 24 hours, Police
Chief Ralph Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the resources to handle it, and we didn't have a
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of those things would have happened, officials said, if not
for the extensive destruction training done by Fort Worth's police
and fire departments and its emergency response team.
</P>
<P>
   Fire, police and emergency management personnel have has
training sessions in places such as Oklahoma City, shortly after
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was bombed April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And they have had six months to analyze their response to the
Sept. 17 shooting at Wedgwood Baptist, where Larry Gene Ashbrook
fatally shot seven people before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation makes you a little smarter, gives you a little
additional experience,'' Mendoza said. ``This one will, too. You
just hope you don't have to be in another situation where you need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Mayor Kenneth Barr said extensive training paid off _
both at Wedgwood and during Tuesday's destructive tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we learned that disaster strikes suddenly, and you
better be ready for it,'' Barr said. ``We were ready then. We
tested the system and it worked, and it will work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everything went according to plan. There were reports
Wednesday that Fort Worth's emergency siren warning system did not
sound in some parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two years, City Councilman Clyde Picht has urged
his colleagues to invest in a new system. The item was cut during
last year's budget discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Picht said he believes that the disaster Tuesday underscored the
need for a new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to say `I told you so.' ... I don't think
that's necessary,'' Picht said. ``But I think the city will be like
the family that puts in an alarm system after their heirlooms are
stolen. We'll put in the system after we have the tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials have repeatedly advised the
council that a new siren system is not necessary, but Barr said
Wednesday that the city will review the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was lots of warning about this storm and enormous media
coverage,'' Barr said. ``We're going to be looking at our ability
to notify people and whether an early siren system would have made
a difference.''

   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ Hours before a crucial meeting between
immigration officials and Elian Gonzalez's relatives, the mayor of
Miami said Wednesday the city would not offer any help _ including
police resources _ to help federal officials remove the child from
his home. (Summary from wires) By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GIULIANI-POLICE (New York) _ Even at a time when he is
defending his police force daily from what he has described as
``bashers,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is facing increasingly vocal
criticism of his style and tactics on law enforcement matters from
an unlikely quarter: police officers. Although many appreciate his
support for the officers involved in the recent police shooting of
an unarmed black man, many also say that Giuliani's zero tolerance
approach to crime, his limited outreach to the black and Latino
communities and his criticism of the dead man, have needlessly
deepened the divisions between the police force and many
communities. By Laurie Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-ARMY (Aadaisse, Lebanon) _ As Israel readies a withdrawl
from south Lebanon later this year, the South Lebanon Army. a
3,000-man force of Lebanese Muslims, Christians and Druze long
allied with Israel, worries about its future. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-NUDE (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that cities and states may ban nude dancing as a way of combatting
crime and other ``negative secondary effects'' associated with
establishments that offer this kind of entertainment. In its 6-3
vote upholding an Erie, Pa. ordinance that requires exotic dancers
to wear at least pasties and a G-string, the court's fractured
majority did not explain how that requirement would reduce the
crime, prostitution, sexual assaults or other problems associated
with places where dancers appear fully nude. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   JUDIASM-SAMESEX-UNION (Greensboro, N.C.) _ In a move likely to
resonate strongly within the national debate over the place of gay
men and lesbians in religious organizations, the rabbis of
Judaism's Reform branch on Wednesday declared that gay
relationships are ``worthy of affirmation'' through Jewish ritual,
and that Reform rabbis who officiate at same-sex ceremonies will
have the support of the branch's rabbinic body _ as will those who
do not. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-SMITH (Undated) _ Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's oldest and
largest handgun maker, is struggling with industry opposition to
its agreement to restrictions on the way it makes and distributes
its handguns. The company agreed on March 17 to a wide array of
restrictions in exchange for ending many of the 30 lawsuits filed
against it by cities and counties across the nation. By Fox
Butterfield and Raymond Hernandez.

`LE MARIAGE': A FRENCH CONNECTION, UNDER STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All tragedies are finish'd by a death, / All comedies are
ended by a marriage,'' wrote Byron in ``Don Juan.'' By these
definitions, whether Diane Johnson's entertaining new novel, ``Le
Mariage,'' is a tragedy or a comedy remains in doubt until its
final pages.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could be resolved either way in this story of
French-American misalliance, loosely a sequel to Johnson's amusing
``Le Divorce,'' in which one or two of the same minor characters
appeared. Thomas Ackroyd (Tim) Nolinger, a half-American,
half-Belgian journalist, is engaged from the opening pages to
Anne-Sophie d'Argel, a dealer in ``horsey artifacts, a hobby since
girlhood,'' who has a flea-market stall in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Their engagement suffers severe strains in the course of ``Le
Mariage'' _ misunderstandings, misapprehensions, false
expectations, differences of temperament, cultural clashes and the
usual anxieties attendant on impending nuptials. The charming,
well-situated apartment Tim finds for them is one flight up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined living on the premier etage,'' Anne-Sophie
exclaims. ``You don't understand the French attitude about the
premier etage.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Sophie, a literal-minded person, relies on books for much
of what she knows about life. She looked in Henry Miller for
anatomical slang words in English to upgrade her erotic vocabulary,
but ``trying one or two of Miller's phrases had not had much effect
on Tim, she had concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, the worldly and practical Estelle d'Argel, a
novelist, is not quite pleased by her daughter's fiance, having
hoped for ``a count or a promising politician, or a future
Academician, or at the least a sports figure _ if from a
respectable sport like tennis.'' Or ``at least someone French.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Tim and Anne-Sophie's relationship is challenged by
the elaborate concatenation of events Johnson contrives to test
them: a stolen medieval manuscript from the Morgan Library in New
York; the murder of one of Anne-Sophie's neighboring flea-market
vendors; the intrusion into their lives of a couple from Oregon who
are vaguely linked to ``black-helicopter people'' and survivalists
and religious fundamentalists and Y2K fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these complications seem rather far-fetched and
unintegrated in a novel that lacks the focus and elegance of ``Le
Divorce,'' perhaps because French-American relations lend
themselves better to metaphors of sundering than to those of
uniting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the new novel's overstretched plot does serve several
valuable purposes. For one thing, it links Tim and Anne-Sophie to
Serge Cray, a renowned if somewhat reclusive American film
director, and his wife, Clara Holly, a film actress who has retired
to run the couple's venerable chateau outside Paris, which was once
occupied by Madame du Barry, the mistress of Louis XV. Serge and
Clara's tense union is another referent of Johnson's title.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, what happens to Serge and Clara sets up one
of the novel's most pointed themes. The French in the story are
always complaining about the shortcomings of Americans, their lack
of subtlety, their fanaticism, their simple-mindedness and, above
all, their insidious effect on French culture. Yet how the French
behave in response to the Americans in the novel is, if anything,
even more egregious.
</P>
<P>
   Because Serge and Clara deplore the killing of wildlife, they
try to prohibit local hunters from shooting on their hectares. In
response, the townspeople declare war by accusing Clara of
desecrating her chateau even though it was a previous owner who
removed and sold its ``boiseries and cheminees _ its paneling and
fireplaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all logic, Clara is arrested and sentenced to prison.
French opinion becomes inflamed: ``L'affaire Cray, said Clovis
Mornay, a leading French intellectual, on a panel on French
television's Canal Plus on l'antiamericanisme, was a perfect
example of how the innate American desire for hegemony, expressed
by private citizens as much as in actions by the state, was
attempting to interfere with the centuries-old traditions of
France. It also was an example of Hollywood arrogance, and
Hollywood was itself an informal arm of the American state, perhaps
even, covertly, an actual arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet regardless of how cluttered the plot of ``Le Mariage'' may
be or how littered it is with misleading portents and developments
that never get resolved, the book is never dull to read. This is
thanks to the cynical delight that Johnson takes in her characters,
whether she is depicting Anne-Sophie's enchantment with American
commerce (``Oh, Teem, I have been to Circuit City. ... It is
heaven, what is left for me in life?'') or listing the small stock
of books in English in the library in the Crays' village (``by Poe,
William Styron, Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, and Erica Jong'').
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people sleep in Paris?'' one jet-lagged character
complains. ``Horns, sirens that warble in a way that vibrates the
nasal passages, loud car alarms setting themselves off in series,
like jungle messages being passed along. Enormous clashings of
broken glass, as if tons of bottles were being crushed, cars,
voices laughing under her windows, motorbikes starting up.''
</P>
<P>
   A little like all that goes on in the plot of ``Le Mariage.''
Except that it's not at all unpleasant because the one thing you
don't feel like doing is sleeping.

   Arecent San Francisco Chronicle story described  &UR; Charles &LR; 
 &UR; Liteky &LR; , an Army chaplain who received the Medal of Honor for
saving the lives of comrades in Vietnam and returned it to protest
American foreign policy and practices.
</P>
<P>
   A specific target of Liteky's protest has been the School of the
Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., at which the U.S. Army trains Latin
American officers and noncoms. Returning the medal voluntarily
meant that Liteky gave up a tax-free lifetime monthly pension of
$600.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the story ran, reporter  &UR; Michael Taylor  &LR; got a
message for Liteky from a Bay Area lawyer (who wished to remain
anonymous): ``Enclosed please find our check for $600 _ one month's
worth of the Medal of Honor pension you gave up _ as a small token
of our appreciation for your valor as a soldier ... and as a highly
principled civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer told Taylor that he had been ``reading a book about
Silicon Valley, and I saw that one fellow who was an avid sailor
had a $126,000 model of one of his yachts. The model was 38 inches
long, and he had it on his mantelpiece.
</P>

Globe award in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angelina Jolie won, I lost,'' she said. ``They love her there.
I was really starstruck and I loved to see all the stars, but I
don't know, awards, they're not for me. It was too soon. I don't
even know what I was doing there, really. It's nice to be
acknowledged, but I don't know, it's too soon in my career. Lucky
for me, it was a really bad year in film.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny, who wore  &UR; Yves St. Laurent  &LR; to the Golden Globes, said
``The whole dress thing was such stress. ... I don't know if I want
to go through that again.'' Sevigny said that &UR; Joan Rivers &LR; 
described her as looking as though ``I was going to a tea party,
but what does she know?'' She wore St. Laurent again last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As to the Oscars themselves, she said she didn't ``really care''

`WONDERLAND': WRUNG OUT, STRUNG OUT IN BEDLAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To watch ``Wonderland,'' the unsettling series set in a New York
psychiatric hospital, is to step into a world of pure chaos.
Everyone races, everyone yells, doctors scream instructions,
patients scream delusions, somebody dies, someone is saved and at
the end a viewer is wrung out. It is a perverse compliment to say
that near the end of the first episode you may wonder if you'll
ever want to enter this hellish atmosphere again.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is so gripping and often so dazzling in its visual
command that if you had two episodes on tape (as reviewers did) you
might watch them back to back, against your expectations. Whether
viewers who have a week to decompress will choose to re-enter a
landscape of such excruciating intensity is the big question ABC
and ``Wonderland'' are staring at.
</P>
<P>
   This new series is the anti-``E.R.,'' and the fact that it is
running opposite that other medical show is the least of the
reasons. ``Wonderland'' defies the conventions of episodic
television. When someone dies on ``E.R.,'' a doctor's heroic
struggle offers redeeming light and uplift. The doctors of
``Wonderland'' are dedicated, but the very first episode reveals
that one has made a medical mistake that will haunt and maybe ruin
lives, including her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' (originally called ``Bellevue'' for the hospital
where it was researched) is even more directly the anti-``Chicago
Hope.'' It was created, written and directed by Peter Berg, who
played the volatile Billy Kronk on that series. Berg's wily new
series turns his old one upside down. While the ``Chicago Hope''
doctors thrive on up-to-the-minute medical wizardry, the
psychiatrists of ``Wonderland'' are simply trying to keep
themselves, and their patients, afloat. With ``E.R.'' aging into
predictability, ``Chicago Hope'' ready for the scrap heap and the
new ``City of Angels'' already a stale imitation of the others
(despite its largely black cast), ``Wonderland'' comes at just the
right time to reinvigorate the hospital genre.
</P>
<P>
   Because the patients in ``Wonderland'' are psychiatric cases,
the series has a surreal aura, sparing and effectively used. Here a
patient behind barred windows looks down at his slippers and sees a
tiny rhino step around them. Because these shots from the patient's
perspective are rare, watching the show is not like existing in
some mad state of mind. The effect is more jolting, as if the
sanity of the doctors and the illness of the patients were present
in the air, at times colliding with a physical force.
</P>
<P>
   What saves the series from total bleakness is the shaky order
the doctors impose. They are played by a spectacular cast. Ted
Levine is the head of the criminal psychiatry department, Dr.
Robert Banger, who is battling his ex-wife for custody of their two
small sons. Levine is still best known for his chilling performance
as the killer in ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Add to that his
ominous deep voice and large presence and Banger is not instantly
likable, even though he is first seen making Mickey Mouse-shaped
pancakes for his sons. But Levine is remarkable in making the stern
and thoughtful Banger the sympathetic center and conscience of the
series without moving an inch toward sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Donovan is calmly powerful as Dr. Neil Harrison, also a
forensic psychiatrist. His pregnant wife, Dr. Lyla Garrity
(Michelle Forbes, once the coroner on ``Homicide''), is the head of
the emergency department at the hospital, called Rivervue here.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Thursday night's premiere, as a man walks through Times
Square during morning rush hour, his thoughts are heard in
voiceover: He babbles about Zeus and transmitters. Abruptly he
takes out a gun and shoots half a dozen people. When the police
take him to Rivervue, it turns out that Garrity, cranky, exhausted
and wrong, had examined and released him the week before.
</P>
<P>
   There are horrifying scenes in ``Wonderland'': the shooting in
Times Square and the aftermath in the Rivervue emergency room, when
the pregnant Garrity is stabbed in the stomach. But individual
scenes are not what make the series hard to take; the
relentlessness of its nervous energy does. The cacophony of people
yelling seems constant; the jangly visual style mirrors the
unrelieved tension and high-voltage impact of the story. When
Garrity is attacked, the camera picks up isolated images as she
sees them: one patient's bloody leg, another's bleeding neck.
</P>
<P>
   Berg also wrote and directed ``Very Bad Things,'' a 1998 black
comedy about murders. The film didn't completely pull off its
humor, but Berg was not afraid to go over the edge trying. He
brings that daring and a touch of dark wit to ``Wonderland,'' but
the series is also shrewdly connected to the world of real people.
When the Times Square killer, Wendell Rickle (Leland Orser), is
arrested, he recites his own Miranda rights, ``like `N.Y.P.D.
Blue,''' he says. The line astutely captures the way so many people
gain any knowledge about the police, and also winks at television
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' poses significant questions in a dramatic,
unpreachy manner. Banger tries to protect and treat Rickle in the
second episode; earlier Harrison had tried to strangle him. Should
a mad killer be forgiven or punished?
</P>
<P>
   And the show sheds light on the rest of network television. This
series makes the pablum of typical happy endings understandable;
they're easier. Here, even the commercials may come as a relief
from the tension. ``Wonderland'' asks viewers to be discomfited
week after week and trust that the effort will be rewarded. Even
the toughest series tend to get soft over time, but for now the
uncompromising ``Wonderland'' is worth every demand it makes.

said Wednesday that it would pay to preserve a medieval Jewish
cemetery that was discovered underground during construction in
Prague three years ago. In an attempt to accommodate the claims of
Jewish groups in Prague and the insurance company that is building
on the land, the government agreed to finance the rescue of several

`PAPA'S SONG': A DYSFUNCTIONAL TRANS-ATLANTIC FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For its first half, ``Papa's Song,'' which opens
Thursday at Anthology Film Archives, is an interesting drama of
domestic tension and cross-cultural misunderstanding. Nico Verema
(Rene van Asten), a decorous, somewhat gloomy Dutch magistrate,
lives happily with his wife, Shirley (Romana Vrede), who is from
Curacao. Shirley's two young nephews, in the Netherlands to escape
a bad situation at home, complete the household.
</P>
<P>
   Its atmosphere of calm bourgeois propriety is soon upended by
the arrival of the boys' mother, Magda (Lisette Merenciana). To
describe Shirley's and Magda's relationship as volatile would be an
understatement: They careen from screaming recrimination to tearful
tenderness without stopping for breath. Nico tries to mediate and
soothe, but when Shirley, who cannot bear children, demands that he
impregnate her sister, the good judge finds himself entangled in an
intergenerational, trans-Atlantic web of family dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa's Song,'' directed by Sander Francken from a script he
wrote with Norman de Palm, touches on a number of fascinating and
difficult themes, including the state of race relations in the
contemporary Netherlands, a subject American audiences are likely
to know little about, and one that Francken, at first, treats with
admirable subtlety. Unfortunately, when Magda's estranged husband,
Hugo (Victor Bottenbly), arrives from the Antilles to claim her and
their children, the film takes a disastrous turn toward overwrought
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Magda and Shirley share a family history so
baroque in its horrors that it wrecks not only their psychological
stability but the film's coherence as well. The degradations that
the women suffered at the hands of their father _ glimpsed in
nightmarish flashbacks confusingly rendered from Nico's point of
view _ are meant to explain their current problems. Instead, the
more we learn about their lurid childhood in Curacao, the more
baffling their present behavior seems.
</P>
<P>
   Nico's psychology is similarly opaque. His inner life is
conveyed through dreamy flashbacks to his Caribbean childhood and
the pained smile of earnest liberalism he wears around black
people, including his wife. His behavior, including his habit of
siding with the erratic Magda and the abusive Hugo against his own
wife, is often inexplicable, even within the terms that the
filmmakers set out.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the contrast between his uptight, rule-bound ways and the
sensuality, music and violence of Shirley and her kin trafficks in
tired stereotypes about frigid Europeans and the hotblooded,
passionate people they once colonized. A powerful psychological
drama might have been wrung from this story. But ``Papa's Song''
is, in the end, drearily literal-minded and depressingly
predictable in its ideas of cultural conflict, sibling rivalry and
childhood trauma.
</P>

ART GALLERY IS SHATTERED BY TORNADO'S FURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Holding a tiny cross of wood and metal,
Carol Henderson shakes her head. The owner of the Carol Henderson
Gallery, which was all but gutted by a tornado Tuesday, can't quite
fathom how this tiny artwork clung to its fragile hook. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only piece of art in its series that didn't get blown
away,'' Henderson says. ``The artist calls it a `milagro,' which
means miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson could have used lots of little miracles in the face of
the tornado's capricious power. The Carol Henderson Gallery was the
only business in the Seventh Street Chicotsky's Center to suffer
extreme damage. By the time Carol Henderson returned to her gallery
Wednesday morning, an ankle-deep pile of glass lined the front of
her exhibit spaces. Her once-pristine storefront was boarded up
like a tenement, her white interior walls gashed as if a predator
had struck. Acoustic tiles and a mass of electric wires, outlets
and track lighting fixtures sagged from the ceiling, clinging to a
plaster thread.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and artists with a long history with Henderson descended
on the gallery to bubble-wrap paintings, take inventory and offer
free food and some solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just tell me when you want lunch, and I'll deliver it,''
said Evelyn Siegel, who owns a neighboring gallery. ``Thank God you
weren't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much,'' said Henderson, allowing herself to cry
for perhaps the first time in a harrowing 24 hours. ``It's just so
upsetting and sad.''
</P>
<P>
   All Henderson can do now, buoyed by a stream of unanticipated
kindness, is to keep digging her gallery out of the detritus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that a man showed up not long after the tornado
hit with his hands full of the our jewelry that had just been
carried away by the wind,'' Henderson said. ``And several of our
prints, which had blown hundreds of yards away behind the nearby
coffee shop, were also returned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carol Henderson Gallery has long been acknowledged as one of
the city's most noted exhibit spaces. Now, the only sign of its
famously eclectic art collection is the dozens of hooks dimpling
the walls. Still, in the wake of the ferocious twister, much of
Henderson's collection of paintings, works on paper, blown glass
and fine-art jewelry survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just calling all the artists to let them know what's going
on,'' Henderson said. ``I feel so badly because these artists all
entrusted their work to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth Cultural District, Carol Henderson Gallery
apparently received the lion's share of the tornado's fury. The
rest of the Arts District was virtually unscathed by the twisters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell Museum reported downed and split cedar elm trees and
branches littering its grounds, but neither its building nor
artwork suffered any damage. The Amon Carter Museum and the Modern
Art Museum of Fort Worth main construction sites weren't damaged.
The Carter's downtown annex was also untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern at Sundance Square was less fortunate. The popular
downtown museum and gift shop, currently housing 26 works of art by
Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Helmut Newton, among others, was
hosting a private party when the tornado destroyed seven large
windows along its south side. A hail of glass shards chased the
more than 60 partygoers to the back of the museum. No one was hurt,
and none of the art, which was immediately wrapped up, was damaged.
The windows have been boarded up. and it will be at least five days
before the Modern at Sundance Square reopens.
</P>
<P>
   It could take many weeks for the Carol Henderson Gallery to
regain its footing as one of the Cultural District's most
frequented galleries. Shovels, garden rakes and an industrial
strength vacuum cleaner are being used to scour the billions of
glass particles that encrust its interior.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson can't even speculate on how much it will cost to bring
her gallery back to life. All she can do is keep repeating, like a
well-worn mantra, ``No one was hurt; no one was hurt.''

   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ As hundreds of people milled past in the
lobby of the Radisson Deauville Resort Hotel here, Kenny Bobien, a
dance-music disc jockey and producer, assessed a homemade CD
through the silvery headphones attached to his portable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track is hot!'' he said ``I'm feeling that!''
</P>
<P>
   S. Mnrat Uncuoglu, who had produced the track, was not content
with praise. ``I need distribution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that would repeat itself with variations
throughout the 15th annual Winter Music Conference, which took over
Miami Beach for five days of nearly nonstop music to conclude after
dawn on Thursday. The conference brought together disc jockeys,
singers, producers, managers, broadcasters, Web site makers,
equipment manufacturers, graphic designers, journalists and others
connected to the music, most of it electronic, that makes bass
speakers go boom around the world. They are the movers and shakers
in a business that makes people move and shake.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding an occasional pop hit, like Eiffel 65's current
``Blue,'' dance music accounts for only a small percentage of the
recording market in the United States. (The figure is higher in
European countries, where instrumental dance tracks can become
radio favorites and pop hits.) Hits by Prodigy, the Chemical
Brothers and Fatboy Slim raised hopes in the American recording
business that a newly named category, electronica, might become the
next big thing in the late '90s. But the hits worked as novelties,
not standard-bearers for the genre. Of course, some disc jockeys
and producers seem to make it a point of honor not to market
themselves. They perform tucked away in sound booths and often
change names from project to project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many fans prefer to enjoy the music as a momentary pleasure
on the dance floor, not as a permanent acquisition, and clubs are
thriving. A star disc jockey can draw thousands of people for the
night, then move on to the next stop on an international circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is already an alternative culture,'' said D.B. Barkenham,
a producer who is a co-founder of F-111 Records and the owner of
Breakbeat Science, a Manhattan record store. ``It doesn't need to
be hyped. It's going to grow organically.''
</P>
<P>
   Because dance music can be produced cheaply, in a home studio or
on a personal computer, a dance single can be profitable with sales
that barely register on the pop charts: a major success if it sells
35,000, a runaway hit with 100,000. And because disc jockeys,
soundtrack compilers and advertisers are constantly searching for
new material with a beat, countless small labels are eager to
supply it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a need for dance music,'' said the disc
jockey and producer Touche, also known as the Wiseguys. ``And it
will go wherever it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other businesses, dance music has high hopes for the
Internet. Judge Jules, a BBC radio disc jockey and dance music
tastemaker, said that Webcasts of disc jockey sets direct from
clubs had the potential to expand the audience greatly, bypassing
the lack of dance music on American commercial radio. Web sites
like www.ministryofsound.com, www.betalounge.com,
www.raveworld.net, www.groovetech.com, www.remixLive.com,
www.netmix.com and www.platform.net are among those that make dance
music available online.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Music Conference expanded to 5,000 people this year
from 3,500 last year, each paying up to $395 to hear panel
discussions and read one another's name tags. They toted stacks of
12-inch vinyl discs and wielded shiny little gadgets, from CD
players to video cameras to computers. They huddled over tour
plans, production budgets, demo discs, international licensing
deals and Internet promotions. Then they went out to hear the
results of their transactions in a dance-music marathon with two
dozen events each day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbathers by the Radisson's pool were serenaded by dance-pop
divas and disc jockey battles. Fifty blocks away, in South Beach,
showcases started shortly after noon and extended well past dawn.
There was house music in theater-size clubs, hip-hop at poolsides,
neo-lounge in courtyards, jungle in basements, funk on a rooftop,
ambient music in hotel suites. Nearly every top disc jockey in the
business was in town to spin records; one event, scheduled for 8
Monday night through noon on Tuesday, had a lineup of more than 44
disc jockeys. Along with those who paid to join the conference,
many more people descended on South Beach just for the music.
</P>
<P>
   When electronic dance music started percolating out of drum
machines and synthesizers more than 20 years ago, it was touted as
the sound of the future. Now it also has an extensive past, tinged
with nostalgia. In a show on Monday night the revered disc jockey
Danny Tenaglia celebrated his 25th year in the business with a set
that stretched about 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the music that pounded out of the South Beach clubs _
and in a noon-to-midnight beach event on Saturday afternoon, timed
to coincide with both the conference and spring break, that drew
15,000 people to hear music on five stages _ stuck to established
genres. The disc jockeys generally improvised within familiar
beats. Their job was to please the crowds, not trip them up, and
the disc jockeys willingly stayed within the bounds of house
music's boom-chicka-boom, trance music's marching 4/4 stomp and
jungle's skittering, fractured mixture of double-time and half-time
rhythms. Audiences knew their parts; when George Acosta played a
trance set on the beach and stopped the beat for a long sustained
note, the whole crowd threw its hands in the air and whooped.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The disc jockey Towa Tei, formerly with Deee-Lite, said his job
was about biofeedback with the crowd. ``Disc jockeys have been
researching how records work for people to dance,'' he said. ``But
there's a danger in the music being too functional. Before it's
functional, music has to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the conference, and of the dance music it
gathered, is house music, the Latin-tinged 4/4 beat that survived
when disco music was laughed off the pop charts. Forged in a
Greenwich Village club called the Paradise Garage, house music has
gone on to spawn countless subgenres that disc jockeys distinguish:
deep house, progressive house, hard house, tech house, trance,
hip-house, garage, speed garage. The seemingly simple 4/4 beat and
moderate tempo of house music make it both durable and flexible; it
impels dancers into motion and meshes with a whole family of
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Masters at Work, a New York-based production, songwriting and
disc jockey team, marked its 10th anniversary with an elegant
demonstration of house music as a generously recombinant beat and a
musical embrace of multiethnic possibilities. In disc jockey sets,
David Morales and Little Louie Vega segued from house music into
salsa, funk, disco and reggae. Then a live band backed up the
singers they had produced, pushing toward pop and gospel. In club
sets, disc jockeys transformed the house beat from a brutal,
austere thud to an ebullient swing; topped it with jazzy flourishes
and eerie dissonances, and even used it to back up hip-hop-style
record scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Some showcases hinted at newer possibilities. Live musicians
performed as if they were in the hands of disc jockeys. A band
called Faze Action, including strings and horns, played '70s funk
as it had been revived by acid-jazz disc jockeys a decade later:
adding a steady dance beat, overlaying the tunes with synthesizer
swoops and pausing for extended percussion breaks. Supreme Beings
of Leisure set Geri Soriano Lightwood's slinky, jazz-tinged vocals
above drum machine rhythms from jungle and hip-hop, as if she were
part of a producer's extended mix.
</P>
<P>
   Jungle, from the mid-'90s, still has some variations left. D.J.
Craze demonstrated turntablism _ the virtuoso refinement of hip-hop
record scratching _ and then combined it with jungle in a set that
sounded jubilantly reckless. James Hardway, an alias of David
Harrow, used samples of jazz trumpet, Cuban percussion and Jamaican
voices to humanize the cold, hurtling momentum of jungle. He said
his next album, though it would be full of computer manipulation,
used no electronic sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenecia, a duo from Miami, explored dance music as electronic
improvisation. Using laptop computers, a drum machine and a mixing
board, they played pieces that sounded like madcap contraptions:
buzzing, beeping and ratcheting with dizzying syncopation. Implying
the beat instead of pounding it out, they sent dancers into
frenetic motion.
</P>
<P>
   Freq Nasty, the disc jockey alias of Darin McFadyen, has been
anointed in Britain as a standard-bearer for an emerging subgenre
called nu skool breaks. In one of his three sets Tuesday night, he
knocked together idioms and fearlessly changed tempos and textures,
from electronic blips to buoyant Caribbean soca to slow dub reggae
to an overlaid rap, like a latter-day version of the master hip-hop
disc jockey Grandmaster Flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the funk and dance element, and you have to
have the hooks,'' he said. ``But at the same time you can be
twisting up the genres, mashing things up. What I'm trying to do is
to bring sounds to people that make them dance first. And then they
think, `What was  &UR; that? &LR; '''

&HT;     NUDE DANCERS MAY HAVE TO COVER UP COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nude dancers at some of the nation's 3,000 strip
clubs may have to put on some clothes in the wake of a Supreme
Court ruling Wednesday that local governments may force them to
wear G-strings and pasties.
</P>
<P>
   In a splintered decision, the court said cities may ban fully
nude dancing as part of an effort to fight such ``negative
secondary effects'' as crime and traffic problems caused by adult
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, requiring dancers to wear pasties and G-strings
may not greatly reduce these secondary effects, but (the court)
requires only that the regulation further the interest in combating
such effects,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   With its decision, the court upheld a public-indecency ordinance
in Erie, Pa., that was designed to stop traffic and prostitution
problems around the Kandyland nude-dancing club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erie's efforts to protect public health and safety are clearly
within the city's police powers,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's highest court had struck down the ordinance in
1998, ruling that it unlawfully restricted freedom of expression
protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.While acknowledging
that nude dancing is ``expressive conduct,'' O'Connor said it
``falls only within the outer ambit'' of First Amendment
protection. She said the Erie law did not violate the Constitution
because it was aimed at combating the ``negative secondary
effects'' associated with adult entertainment rather than at the
erotic message of nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Sprenkle, Erie's assistant city solicitor, praised the
decision. ``We didn't ban any expression. What's being regulated is
the means of expression,'' she said.Sprenkle said dancers at a nude
dancing club in the city ``will be required to cover up to the
extent required by the ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   However, John H. Weston, attorney for the former Erie
nude-dancing club owner who challenged the ordinance, said the
ruling may lead to many attempts to ban nude dancing, but that
``sexually oriented businesses will always thrive'' because of
their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision helped clarify a 1991 Supreme Court
ruling that allowed Indiana to ban all barroom-style nude dancing
under a state law generally prohibiting public nudity.The court
said then that nude dancing is subject to some First Amendment
protection but that community interests of safety and morality may
present overriding concerns.Since that ruling, many lower courts
have complained that the decision was too vague for them to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Wednesday's decision, the high court was seriously split,
with several of the justices agreeing on some issues and
disagreeing on others. As a result, it may not provide the lower
courts with as much clarity as they hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, six other justices joined O'Connor in agreeing to
allow a ban on nude dancing to prevent ``negative secondary
effects.'' Those justices were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia,
David Souter and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia and Thomas argued that the court should go further
and allow cities to ban nude dancing on the grounds of ``good
morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter also had problems with the O'Connor's opinion, writing in
his own opinion that he believed the city had not shown the
so-called negative secondary effects of the strip club. Therefore,
Souter said, while he accepted a ban on nude dancing to prevent
such effects, he could not endorse the Erie ban because city
officials had not proved that these effects existed.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented
from the ruling completely. Stevens wrote in their opinion that the
court had incorrectly decided that secondary effects ``justify the
total suppression of protected speech.''``Indeed, the plurality
opinion concludes that admittedly trivial advancements of a state's
interests may provide the basis for censorship,'' Stevens wrote.

   In a land of letters ruled by a playwright presiding from his
castle on the hill over a dreamy city that has brought out the
absurd in writers from Kafka to Kundera, Jachym Topol is hailed as
a bright new literary star.
</P>
<P>
   His 1994 novel ``Sestra'' (``Sister'') won plaudits from writers
like Ivan Klima and President Vaclav Havel himself. His poetry and
second novel, ``Angel,'' have also earned the eclectic Topol a
place in Prague's pantheon of those who chronicle its ever fertile
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense Topol was born to his task. His father, Josef, a
friend of Havel, is a playwright, poet, Shakespeare translator and
dissident; his grandfather, Karel Schulz, was also a writer. Raised
in the aftermath of the Prague Spring and formed by the
intellectual dissenters around him, Topol became, at age 15, the
youngest person to sign the Charter 77 human rights document.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Topol was at the Kitchen, an arts center in
Greenwich Village, reading to an enthusiastic crowd drawn by the
publication of the English-language version of ``Sestra,'' titled
``City Sister Silver'' (Catbird Press). Reading in Czech, Topol
delivered the staccato somersaults of his text with the pace and
energy of a guitar riff; his American translator, Alex Zucker,
followed with a more measured English delivery of two passages, one
a mocking account of how a famous writer came to pen his novel, the
second a far more serious deliberation on poverty set on a garbage
dump that Topol said was inspired by a real dump he visited on the
outskirts of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The book's main character lives through the Velvet Revolution,
which ended Communist rule, and all the weirdness that has
followed, but there is also a dream sequence set in Auschwitz and
innumerable leaps of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Lanzillotto, the host for the program, freely compared the
work to Salman Rushdie's ``Midnight's Children.'' ``Sometimes,''
she said, ``we are caught up in form: we go to fiction school, to
poetry school. This guy goes to the revolution and busts through
form like through skin itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Topol's first poems became lyrics for the rock band Psi
Vojaci (Dog Soldiers), which is led by his younger brother, Filip.
After the 1989 revolution, Topol did investigative reporting for
the weekly Respekt, then founded his own review, Revolver. Nowadays
he is almost settled, living in Prague with his wife and 3-year-old
daughter, of whom he said: ``Three days, it's good to be away from
a child. On the fourth day it's already difficult. After that it's
terrible.'' He professes amazement that he, a child of what he
terms ``the monster,'' or Soviet Communism, himself has a child who
will go to an ordinary Prague kindergarten and immediately start
learning English.
</P>
<P>
   His own English is good, but with the precision of a man whose
very life is words, he criticizes his inflection as he orders a
spinach omelet in a Polish-American diner in Brooklyn. His Czech is
a mixture of fact and fantasy, say aficionados and his translator,
Zucker. The language traces the history of its land, the backdrop
that has given birth to much rich writing with resonance far beyond
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Topol writes in ``Sestra'': ``The tongue I use is one of
Czechs, of Slavs, of slaves, of onetime slaves to Germans and
Russians, and it's a dog's tongue. A clever dog knows how to
survive and what price to pay for survival. He knows when to crouch
and when to dodge and when to bite, it's in his tongue. It's tender
and cruel, and has some good old words of love, I think, it's a
swift and agile tongue, and it's always happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even the Avars could get this tongue of mine, not tanks or
burning borders or the most repulsive human species of all:
cowardly teachers. What will eventually get it is cash in a
shrinking world.''
</P>

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Armed with large brooms, Fort Worth street
crews began about 6 a.m. Wednesday, cleaning streets that were
pelted with glass, rooftops, trees, plastic foam and dirt the night
before. Dumptrucks and bulldozers backed them up, hauling large
debris out of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   A slight breeze moving through at midafternoon did little to dry
the sweat that cleanup crews had earned working since early
morning.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm hit Tuesday night, workers were called in to
clear blocked drains that were flooding streets. They erected
barricades for police and moved trees that were sprawled across
roads, working until 2 or 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laid down and had to get right back up,'' said street
services employee Darrell Clakely, who said he awoke at 5:40 a.m.
to head back downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is our hometown, and we gotta take care of home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the shade of a city dump truck, Stephen Mock quickly
ate a late lunch that the Red Cross provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been nonstop,'' he said, his face glistening with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   His crew started on Houston Street, sweeping debris from
sidewalks onto the street so the heavier machinery could pick it
up. A chipper was brought in to dispose of downed trees
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in all the chaos, though, the work has gone pretty
smooth,'' Mock said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his crew cleaned up after the 1995 tornado that hit the
Texas Christian University area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all different debris this time,'' street services
employee Nicholas Mendoza said. ``All glass.''
</P>
<P>
   As the workers finished off hamburgers, a call came about a
downed tree blocking Fifth Street and Summit Avenue. The crew
climbed into the truck and took off.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, other Transportation and Public Works crews boarded up a
gaping hole in the corner of the public library building, stapling
plastic over the boards to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at Hunter Plaza, Water Department workers
pumped water out of the apartment building. Four sprinklers had
been set off, flooding the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Private cleanup companies began the arduous process of picking
through the buildings and private parking lots downtown.
</P>
<P>
   As they moved, the crews left behind clean patches in the debris
field.

<P>
   TOKYO _ For 12-year-old Kenji Nakanishi, watching the New York
Mets and the Chicago Cubs play their opening season game at the
Tokyo Dome Wednesday night was better than opening presents at
``Kurisumasu,'' Japanese for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream come true,'' the sixth grader said, trying
to control his emotions. ``I got to see my baseball heroes Sammy
Sosa and Mike Piazza, and I feel so excited, so tingly inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese in the sellout crowd of 55,000 roaring spectators,
who paid as much as $120 for a ticket, would seem to disagree with
young Kenji's assessment of the first regular season major league
baseball game to be played outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   Motoharu Yanamoto, managing editor of Weekly Baseball Magazine,
said that for Japanese fans, holding a major league season opener
in Tokyo was ``a monumental, unbelievable event.'' The game was a
rare opportunity to witness two of America's top teams in real
competition, he said. In the past, only major league exhibition
games have been held in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   American and Japanese organizers of the event have said they
hope the games will create new markets for major league baseball
overseas while increasing interest in Japan's professional baseball
leagues and improving the level of play.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was euphoric over the opening of Japan's
normally highly protected borders to a prominent foreign product
like major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Mets and Cubs arrived here last weekend to great
fanfare, many Japanese teams were expressing concerns that allowing
the immensely popular major league into Japan could be devastating
to the country's own professional baseball leagues, siphoning off
its top talent and fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Kanai, secretary general of the Japan Professional
Baseball Commissioner's Office, said that the commissioner's office
agonized over whether to allow the major leagues to stage the games
but eventually decided to grant approval because Japan could no
longer resist the growing globalization of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japanese baseball is to survive, it has to also make its
debut on the global stage, and we need to gain experience competing
at that level,'' Kanai said. ``So we decided to open the door to
major league baseball so we could raise the technical level and
interest in the game in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   With attendance at many Japanese baseball games already on the
decline, due to the country's stubborn recession and waning
interest, some team officials are afraid that given a choice, fans
will spend less money on local games and save their precious yen
for the major league season games. The officials are also upset
over the high price of the major league tickets, which cost $120
for the best seats, compared with $59 for comparable seats at a
Yomiuri Giants game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money fans have is limited these days, and I wonder if
fans who bought expensive tickets to the major league games will
come to our games, too,'' an official of a Tokyo-based baseball
team told the Asahi Shinbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with revenues from ticket sales, merchandising, and
broadcast rights flat or falling at many of Japan's 12 baseball
franchises, the teams can scarcely afford to match the high
salaries that their top players can make in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some local sports commentators and reporters said that the
concerns of local Japanese teams are not entirely unjustified,
especially if the number of major league baseball games staged in
Japan increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger for Japanese baseball is if we start to see a
repeat and expansion of major league games here and if we see a
growing exodus of top Japanese players to America,'' Yanamoto, the
magazine editor, said. ``That could rob us of local talent and
focus the attention of Japanese fans to the major league teams
where our local boys will be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints about major league baseball are coming
from Japanese teams that are struggling economically and have
limited national television exposure. Japanese baseball is divided
into two leagues, each with six clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the Central League are profitable because they have a
huge fan base, mainly because they compete against the Yomiuri
Giants, who are backed by a powerful media organization that
broadcasts all its games. Clubs in the Pacific League are generally
not profitable and have trouble filling their stadiums. To be
profitable a team must generate about $50 million in annual
revenues. Some baseball watchers are concerned that if the
situation does not improve, the sport could be reduced to one
league with as little as eight or even six teams.
</P>
<P>
   Masaru Ikei, a political science professor at Keio University,
who is considered an expert on Japanese baseball, said that it
remains unclear whether major league baseball would help or hurt
the sport in Japan. But Ikei said that he believes the way Japanese
play baseball will be greatly influenced by the staging of major
leagues games in Japan. He expects that Japanese baseball games,
which are notoriously slow, will become faster and that umpires,
who are not highly regarded in Japan, will gain new credibility as
the country adopts practices of the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brosnan, executive vice president in charge of international
business for major league baseball, sought to dispel any notions
that his franchise was trampling over Japanese baseball in its
efforts to expand internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese baseball has had some concerns about this project but
we've consulted with them and we've been very mindful to avoid the
downside of those issues,'' Brosnan said. ``Anyone who says these
major league games will make the fans think that Japanese teams
can't compete hasn't been at the same games I've seen this week.''
The Giants won in exhibition games this week over the Cubs and the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball officials and commentators believe that there is
enough interest in baseball in Japan that fans will watch both
local and international team play.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Izumida, a 22-year-old part-time worker, certainly
thinks so. At the end of Wednesday night's season opener, Izumida,
who attended two of the major league exhibition matches this week,
prepared to spend the night outside the Tokyo Dome to insure that
he could obtain tickets to the Giants' season opener on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like both the local teams here in Japan and those in the
major leagues, but the only problem is that there's not enough
money or time to see them all,'' he said.

COUNTING OUR BLESSINGS IN THE WAKE OF DISASTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The windows are broken.
</P>
<P>
   Our cities are not.
</P>
<P>
   When morning sunlight fell across crumbled homes and fractured
lives in Fort Worth and Arlington on Wednesday, we saw how
fortunate we were that so few lives were lost in Tuesday's storms.
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate to say ``blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate only because hundreds of families may not feel very
blessed after losing homes in suburban River Oaks, the struggling
Linwood neighborhood west of downtown Fort Worth or the smashed
neighborhoods of south Arlington and southwest Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet daylight showed us not only what the tornadoes hit, but what
they missed.
</P>
<P>
   In River Oaks, a twister descended first on tiny Cahill Oval and
cut across residential streets. Castleberry High School was
squarely in that path, but the tornado only brushed the back of the
school and damaged a locker room and band hall.
</P>
<P>
   The funnel turned south toward White Settlement Road. Inside the
Fireside Lodge retirement apartments and nursing center, 90
residents huddled in a hallway. The twister missed them by two
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing down on the upscale Rivercrest neighborhood of Fort
Worth, the twister slapped at a Tex-Mex restaurant on White
Settlement Road and uprooted decades-old trees in Monticello Park.
But it spared most homes until it descended again along West Sixth
and Seventh streets, bypassing evening classes at the University of
North Texas medical school and 150 patients in an adjacent
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A paint store on Seventh Street took a direct hit. So did a
7-Eleven and a barber shop. Two blocks south, the Kimbell Art
Museum and the Cultural District were largely untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado's harshest blow struck the same modest neighborhoods
flooded by the Clear Fork of the Trinity River 51 years ago in Fort
Worth's most deadly natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Homes along Merrimac Street and Mercedes Avenue were bashed
Tuesday, followed by the death of Arlington trucker Howard Thornton
at the Montgomery Ward rear dock and the death of Carl Spence
inside an abandoned building on Seventh Street. Yet no one died in
the crushed small frame homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cash America International headquarters and the Calvary
Cathedral International church took the last hard hits. Again, no
one died.
</P>
<P>
   Then the twister darted northward to West Third and Fourth
streets, scraping a new apartment complex and missing night workers
in the Radio Shack headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance Square, 220 moviegoers in two theaters and 300
reception guests at the Bass Hall lay next in the path. Instead,
the twister turned eastward again, peeling glass from the Bank One
Tower and Union Pacific Resources Plaza but sparing large crowds in
Sundance Square to the north and hotels to the south.
</P>
<P>
   East of downtown, the Riverside and Meadowbrook neighborhoods
received little more than hailstones, heavy winds, rain and a
shower of paperwork blown from downtown office towers.
</P>
<P>
   If downtown Fort Worth's destiny was to face down an oncoming
tornado, I can think of worse days and times than Tuesday at 6:15
p.m., when most office workers had gone home and the entertainment
district was less crowded.
</P>
<P>
   It might be difficult to convince the residents of River Oaks or
Linwood or south Arlington or south Grand Prairie that anyone here
is very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Just say that many of us are very blessed.

   ALGECIRAS, Spain _ Soon after sunset, every evening, Spanish
police boats set out to zigzag on the choppy Mediterranean, their
night vision scopes and infrared cameras at the ready to pierce the
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to intercept small motorboats, crowded with
clandestine African migrants, mostly young men who want to sneak
ashore and hunt for work in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Across the water, in Morocco, a fake Spanish visa may cost as
much as $3,000. But a network of smugglers offers secret night
rides for a third of that in rickety fishing vessels painted deep
blue for camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   The coast of southern Spain, like the U.S. border with Mexico,
is a fault line where the worlds of rich and poor people meet, a
magnet for migrants seeking a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Ship captains call the area of the Strait of Gibraltar, which
separates Europe from Africa near here, one of the world's most
treacherous sea passages _ a wind tunnel where the waters of the
Atlantic and Mediterranean mix with fury, producing high swells and
powerful crosscurrents. And yet, night after night, hundreds of
people risk their lives on a 10-mile crossing that may last two
hours, or stretch from dusk to dawn, or end in death by drowning.
</P>
<P>
   From just a trickle a few years ago, tens of thousands of
undocumented migrants are now taking this route every year, drawn
by the booming market in low-paying jobs that Europeans do not
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regular night,'' said Lt. Juan Fernandez at the
Spanish Civil Guard base in Algeciras one recent evening. At 11
p.m. the first patrol boat had reported back to base: it had caught
a 50-foot sloop with 20 men aboard and was bringing them ashore. At
2:30 a.m. a sloop was intercepted with 25 people. Earlier, the
police helicopter had signaled three other vessels, but they got
away in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, as on most nights, the majority of the men were
from Morocco. Others may come from as far away as central Africa.
Those who consider themselves lucky make it to farms in Spain,
restaurant kitchens in France or construction sites in the
Netherlands. But for a growing number the trip ends here. The Civil
Guard regularly pulls bloated bodies from the water or finds the
flotsam of the flimsy boats equipped with just small outboard
motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the boats are hit by big cargo ships that don't even
see them,'' said Fernandez, who has spent many nights patrolling
the water. ``Usually, boats are overloaded and they capsize easily.
These are the poor who dream of riches in Europe, but many can't
swim because they are mountain people. And they don't even have
life jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The price of lost European dreams is starkly visible in the
windswept cemetery of Tarifa, a village on the southernmost tip of
Spain. At the far end, a mass grave that bears no names is covered
with wildflowers. Juan Gallardo, the village gravedigger, said he
buried 14 drowned bodies here in 1997. He believed they were
Moroccans. Nearby, he had dug a tomb for five young black men. They
had also washed up on the rocks below Tarifa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked young, maybe 18 or 20,'' Gallardo said. ``Poor
things, no one ever came to ask for them. Their families must still
be waiting for news.''
</P>
<P>
   At Algeciras, 10 miles to the east, the cemetery has close to
100 graves of people who drowned in the strait. Almost all are
nameless. Only the date of burial and case number have been
scratched into the rough cement. Jose Sampalo, an undertaker, said
almost half of them were buried in the last three years. Seven
drowned just in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is really keeping track of all the dead,'' said Abdel
Hamid Beyuki, head of the Moroccan Workers' Association in Spain.
``Bodies also wash up on the Moroccan coast or they are just
lost.'' His group estimates that some 3,000 people may have drowned
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about the number of migrant workers who make it to
the Spanish shores and then deeper into Europe are equally
uncertain. ``We reckon we catch about one in four people, at least
on this part of the coast,'' said Lt. Ovidio Corredor at the
Algeciras Civil Guard base.
</P>
<P>
   Once detained, the undocumented migrants are are taken to
detention centers and, often on the same day, returned by ferry
boats to the Moroccan port of Tangiers. ``Some carry drugs to pay
for their passage,'' said Lieutenant Corredor. ``But they stay here
and go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interior Ministry in Madrid, Spain last year
expelled 17,000 undocumented aliens. The ministry said it estimates
that some 50,000 legal and illegal workers arrive every year, most
of them North Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Many travel on to France, Belgium and the Netherlands where they
can disappear and find support in the large established North
African communities. Others stay in Spain, where Moroccans are the
biggest contingent of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Interior Ministry concedes that it can only guess at the
number of undocumented people in the country, perhaps some 150,000.
But it recognizes that they often find work. They do the low-paid,
backbreaking jobs in the great expanses of hothouses that grow
winter vegetables. And they work in the olive and orange groves of
Andalusia or the factories around Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish employers can be fined for hiring illegal immigrants,
but they are often tolerated because they are needed,'' said a
government official who asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official was merely acknowledging the status quo: despite
high unemployment of 14 percent, prospering Spain does want the
cheap labor and the seasonal work provided by uncounted foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   So does much of Western Europe. It is why the story repeats
itself elsewhere along the Mediterranean: in recent years,
boatloads of Tunisians have been crossing to Sicily or used other
Italian islands as stepping stones into the European Union.
Albanians, Kurds and Iraqis by the thousands have been sneaking
ashore in Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap labor is only part of the economic equation: as Europeans
have fewer children and the population ages, they need immigrants
to help make up the pool of workers that will pay for the
Continent's costly social security and pension systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, demographers say that the need for foreign workers
will become particularly acute: Spain now has among the lowest
birthrates in Europe _ just 1.1 children per woman. (It takes an
average of 2.1 children per woman to keep the population from
shrinking.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Spain accepted only 30,000 immigrants last year.
Specialists say that it will soon have to import far more to
maintain the labor pool needed to sustain its elderly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But here, as elsewhere in Western Europe, there are signs of
rising xenophobia and racism in communities that feel besieged by
immigrants. In February, crowds attacked Moroccan laborers in
southeastern Spain. Last year, there were several racist incidents
near Barcelona. Human rights groups fear that extremists here could
build constituencies by campaigning against foreigners, as they
have in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has tried to enlist Morocco to stem the flow
of people coming illegally, and equipped the Moroccan coast guard
with new radar and boats. The Union is also offering more favorable
trade terms and is including Morocco among the countries _ along
with Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia _ that will get
special development aid in the hope of reducing the flight of their
people to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But European diplomats in Morocco said the Rabat government was
ignoring the problem. ``Migration acts as a safety valve for this
nation that has more than 40 percent unemployment and no welfare,''
one said, adding that Morocco received some $2 billion a year in
remittences from its citizens living in Europe. ``That's one of the
country's main sources of hard currency,'' the diplomat said.
``It's become almost indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccan officials have argued that it is better to regulate the
traffic across the Mediterranean by setting a quota for migrant
workers, rather than leave it to people smugglers. Talks have been
going on for several years.
</P>
<P>
   With Morocco needing to export labor and Europe needing to
import it, the flow seems destined to grow. That at least is the
perception of the Spanish Civil Guard that patrols this coast.
</P>
<P>
   At its base in Algeciras, Corredor showed half a dozen newly
confiscated boats. ``People used to cross only in the summer,'' he
said. ``January and February used to be totally quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   This January, the guards at Algeciras caught 615 people on the
water. Some were drug smugglers, most were migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Corredor pointed to one flimsy dark blue sloop. ``A floating
coffin,'' he said. ``This one was adrift with engine trouble and 25
people aboard. We had to revive some of them. They were half dead
with cold.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    McALLEN, Texas _ After losing two costly truckloads of
California almonds and one of Norwegian cod to marauders, Adolfo
Juarez knew it was time to fight back. So, the businessman from
Mexico City began hiring security guards to escort his goods from
the Veracruz coast and the Texas border to their final destination
in the stores and markets of the capital.
 &HT;    ``You have to adapt to the circumstances,'' says the owner of
the import business Encuentro S.A. de C.V. ``If circumstances say
you need more protection, then you should get more.''
 &HT;    On Mexico's roads, robberies of merchandise have grown almost as
common as gaping potholes. Organized bands of thieves steal
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods each year, spawning
a hostile climate for entrepreneurs, truckers and insurers alike.
 &HT;    The National Cargo Transport Chamber (Canacar), an organization
comprising some 180,000 truck owners, says an average of 800 trucks
are reported hijacked every year at a loss of US$253 million.
That's bad news for a country where 90 percent of all goods are
transported by truck.
 &HT;    The vast majority of robberies, however, go unreported,
officials say. In a few rural areas like Filo de Caballo, Guerrero,
local militias are even administering their own justice: They hang
hijackers.
 &HT;    The states of Queretaro, Michoacan, Puebla, San Luis Potosi and
Sinaloa are hotspots for robberies. But the roads leading into
sprawling, poverty-plagued Mexico City form the frenetic stage
where most thefts of cargo occur, says the transport Chamber's Vice
President Manuel Gomez. ``Eighty to 90 percent (of robberies)
happen in Mexico City and the surrounding metropolitan area,'' he
says.
 &HT;    While no product is safe, meats, wines, coffee, canned goods,
electronics and clothes are among the most attractive targets for
raiders. Such items get consumed quickly or are absorbed without
much notice into the bustling tianguis, or markets, of Mexico City
and other urban areas.
 &HT;    The hijackers are well-armed and highly organized, with brisk
distribution networks to fence the cargo. ``It's not easy to hijack
a truck and dispose of 25 tons of whatever product it is,'' Gomez
says. ``These are huge chains of illegal distribution.''
 &HT;    Fingers point in different directions over exactly who the
plunderers are, and who's tipping them off to oncoming freights.
Some see the hand of corrupt lawmen at work, particularly because
investigations into thefts rarely yield fruit. Others see evidence
of inside jobs by people in the very companies that own the goods,
the theory being that they know what's inside the vehicles and can
earn as much with a simple call to a crime syndicate as they can in
a month's honest work. Similar suspicions accrue to customs brokers
and the truck drivers themselves.
 &HT;    Whoever the guilty parties may be, robberies represent an
enormous headache for the companies whose products are stolen and
for the trucking company transporting the goods, says Jose Garduno,
owner of a Mexico City trucking company, Transportes Terrestres.
 &HT;    In October 1999, one of Garduno's drivers was moving more than
$50,000 worth of soap, detergent and other products for Procter &AMP;
Gamble when he was assaulted in the tiny central state of Tlaxcala
by armed bandits who made off with the 18-wheeler. Procter &AMP; Gamble
had insured the load, but Garduno says he still had to wade through
endless red tape to clear his driver _ the initial suspect in the
crime _ and recover his truck, which was later found two states
away in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    When Mexico City businessman Adolfo Juarez got hit a few years
ago, he lost $100,000 of almonds in a Mexico City heist, and
another load worth $100,000. He suffered a further reversal in 1996
when a $120,000 shipment of cod was hijacked in Veracruz. As usual
in such cases, the merchandise was never found. Juarez did recover
his financial losses but faced skyrocketing insurance rates.
 &HT;    Insurance companies have taken a big hit covering stolen cargo
and, increasingly, refuse to offer protection against robberies,
says Arnoldo Trevino, an insurance agent in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, a
city across the border from McAllen, Texas. ``On the border we
insure them, but not in the interior,'' he says, adding that
businesses that take preventive measures against thefts get better
rates.
 &HT;    After suffering his third robbery, Juarez took action to better
protect his goods. He began contracting only those trucking
companies equipped with Global Positioning System technology, which
uses satellites to provide a truck's location, and hired private
security firms to ride with his cargo. He hasn't lost a load in
more than three years. ``Why don't they rob me? Because I have an
escort,'' he says.
 &HT;    Private security firms are among the few beneficiaries of the
truck-theft problem. Companies like Grupo Diamante of Nuevo Laredo,
Tamaulipas have become expert at giving safe passage to rigs
bearing IBM computers, Estee Lauder cosmetics and a host of other
valued items.
 &HT;    ``It's a necessary service because of the crime problem we have
in this country,'' says Ricardo Hernandez, an administrator for
Grupo Diamante. ``There aren't enough authorities to stop it. In
many cases, it's the police themselves (doing the robbing).''
 &HT;    For roughly $1,500, Grupo Diamante will dispatch three guards in
a late-model Volkswagen to accompany a trucker during the 18-hour
journey from the border to Mexico City, or wherever else the client
needs to go. The guards cannot carry guns, but Hernandez says they
have a better weapon _ communication.
 &HT;    Over radios, the guards call the base frequently to update their
location, and maintain a steady dialogue with the truck driver as
well. When they spot anything out of the ordinary, such as a
vehicle lingering suspiciously behind the rig, they may ask
colleagues at home base to call the police.
 &HT;    Increasingly, trucking companies equip their vehicles with
satellite technology to monitor journeys. ``It doesn't stop
robberies, but it can make it easier to find the truck and the
goods,'' says Transportes Terrestres's Garduno, who installed a
global positioning system in his six trucks following a spate of
robberies.
 &HT;    But such technology exceeds the financial reach of many small
companies. Indeed, of the 300,000 trucks operated by cargo
transport chamber members, only about 4,000 have satellite
equipment, the transport chamber's Gomez says.
 &HT;    Many truckers opt for simple safety measures like traveling in
convoys or carrying a cellular phone. Members of unios frequently
trade information about dangerous roads. ``Being united, we
communicate more,'' says Damazo Villafranca Cantu, a representative
of the truckers' group Union de Transportistas del Norte de
Tamaulipas and owner of a small trucking concern. ``When you're
informed, it is possible to do things more safely.''
 &HT;    Even as more trucking companies go high-tech, some owners of
merchandise struggle to keep pace with the increasing costs of
safety, and would rather keep prices low for clients than pay top
dollar to hire security firms and trucks with fancy technology.
 &HT;    The threat of robberies does not outweigh the need to keep costs
down, says Luis Rivas of Comercial Izadora, a Reynosa company that
imports meats from the United States into Mexico. To shave
expenses, the company relies more on crossed fingers than special
security measures when shipping its beef and pork.
 &HT;    ``Our overhead would be higher, so we would have to raise our
prices,'' Rivas says, explaining why the company doesn't invest in
satellite technology or even theft insurance. ``We have to take our
chances because we have to take care of our clients.'' Rivas'
company has not suffered a robbery in the three years, he says.
 &HT;    Javier Flores hasn't been so lucky. The 23-year-old from
Saltillo, Coahuila, had been a trucker for only a year-and-a-half
when he fell victim to his first robbery.
 &HT;    It happened in May 1999, when the young man and his brother
formed a two-truck caravan freighting iron from Saltillo to
Mazatlan, Sinaloa. His brother's rig got a flat in the mountains of
Sinaloa. As they made roadside repairs, a car pulled up and four
men with pistols emerged barking threats. The assailants promptly
disappeared with the trucks, taking with them the expensive cargo
and Flores's peace of mind. ``You do your job as always, only
you're afraid,'' he says.
 &HT;    Truck hijackings appear to be on the rise, according to the
cargo transport chamber, which reported in early 1999 that heists
were up 15 percent from 1998. The problem reached sufficient levels
of concern in Mexico City for the Public Safety Ministry to create
a permanent force of motorcycle patrols to guard main trucking
routes.
 &HT;    But some people liken police protecting trucks to mice guarding
cheese.
 &HT;    Samuel Sepulveda, a 40-year-old Jalisco native who has spent
half his life driving rigs, still wonders who was behind the theft
of his cement truck in 1994. He was on his way to San Luis Potosi
when two men wearing the black uniforms of federal judicial police
stopped him and accused him of running unspecified contraband. They
took his truck and left him high and dry in the middle of nowhere.
To this day, Sepulveda wonders if they really were police.
``There's still that nagging question,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least one thing is for sure, though; Mexico's roads are
increasingly lawless.

security firms to ride with his cargo. He hasn't lost a load in
more than three years. ``Why don't they rob me? Because I have an
escort,'' he says.
 &HT;    Private security firms are among the few beneficiaries of the
truck-theft problem. Companies like Grupo Diamante of Nuevo Laredo,
Tamaulipas have become expert at giving safe passage to rigs
bearing IBM computers, Estee Lauder cosmetics and a host of other
valued items.
 &HT;    ``It's a necessary service because of the crime problem we have
in this country,'' says Ricardo Hernandez, an administrator for
Grupo Diamante. ``There aren't enough authorities to stop it. In
many cases, it's the police themselves (doing the robbing).''
 &HT;    For roughly $1,500, Grupo Diamante will dispatch three guards in
a late-model Volkswagen to accompany a trucker during the 18-hour
journey from the border to Mexico City, or wherever else the client
needs to go. The guards cannot carry guns, but Hernandez says they
have a better weapon _ communication.
 &HT;    Over radios, the guards call the base frequently to update their
location, and maintain a steady dialogue with the truck driver as
well. When they spot anything out of the ordinary, such as a
vehicle lingering suspiciously behind the rig, they may ask
colleagues at home base to call the police.
 &HT;    Increasingly, trucking companies equip their vehicles with
satellite technology to monitor journeys. ``It doesn't stop
robberies, but it can make it easier to find the truck and the
goods,'' says Transportes Terrestres's Garduno, who installed a
global positioning system in his six trucks following a spate of
robberies.
 &HT;    But such technology exceeds the financial reach of many small
companies. Indeed, of the 300,000 trucks operated by cargo
transport chamber members, only about 4,000 have satellite
equipment, the transport chamber's Gomez says.
 &HT;    Many truckers opt for simple safety measures like traveling in
convoys or carrying a cellular phone. Members of unios frequently
trade information about dangerous roads. ``Being united, we
communicate more,'' says Damazo Villafranca Cantu, a representative
of the truckers' group Union de Transportistas del Norte de
Tamaulipas and owner of a small trucking concern. ``When you're
informed, it is possible to do things more safely.''
 &HT;    Even as more trucking companies go high-tech, some owners of
merchandise struggle to keep pace with the increasing costs of
safety, and would rather keep prices low for clients than pay top
dollar to hire security firms and trucks with fancy technology.
 &HT;    The threat of robberies does not outweigh the need to keep costs
down, says Luis Rivas of Comercial Izadora, a Reynosa company that
imports meats from the United States into Mexico. To shave
expenses, the company relies more on crossed fingers than special
security measures when shipping its beef and pork.
 &HT;    ``Our overhead would be higher, so we would have to raise our
prices,'' Rivas says, explaining why the company doesn't invest in
satellite technology or even theft insurance. ``We have to take our
chances because we have to take care of our clients.'' Rivas'
company has not suffered a robbery in the three years, he says.
 &HT;    Javier Flores hasn't been so lucky. The 23-year-old from
Saltillo, Coahuila, had been a trucker for only a year-and-a-half
when he fell victim to his first robbery.
 &HT;    It happened in May 1999, when the young man and his brother
formed a two-truck caravan freighting iron from Saltillo to
Mazatlan, Sinaloa. His brother's rig got a flat in the mountains of
Sinaloa. As they made roadside repairs, a car pulled up and four
men with pistols emerged barking threats. The assailants promptly
disappeared with the trucks, taking with them the expensive cargo
and Flores's peace of mind. ``You do your job as always, only
you're afraid,'' he says.
 &HT;    Truck hijackings appear to be on the rise, according to the
cargo transport chamber, which reported in early 1999 that heists
were up 15 percent from 1998. The problem reached sufficient levels
of concern in Mexico City for the Public Safety Ministry to create
a permanent force of motorcycle patrols to guard main trucking
routes.
 &HT;    But some people liken police protecting trucks to mice guarding
cheese.
 &HT;    Samuel Sepulveda, a 40-year-old Jalisco native who has spent
half his life driving rigs, still wonders who was behind the theft
of his cement truck in 1994. He was on his way to San Luis Potosi
when two men wearing the black uniforms of federal judicial police
stopped him and accused him of running unspecified contraband. They
took his truck and left him high and dry in the middle of nowhere.
To this day, Sepulveda wonders if they really were police.
``There's still that nagging question,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least one thing is for sure, though; Mexico's roads are
increasingly lawless.

 &HT;    CLINTON PRESSES CONGRESS TO PASS GUN CONTROLS
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pressed Congress on Wednesday to
pass new gun controls by April 20, the anniversary of the killings
at Columbine High School last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likened the need for gun controls to the requirement for
metal detectors in airports and driver's licenses and speed limits
on highways, saying that simply punishing criminals for using
firearms will not stop the problem of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's just wrong to say that, because of the
Second Amendment, and because there are a lot of people who like to
hunt and sports shoot, that prevention plays no role in this,''
said Clinton. ``A sensible society has a balance between prevention
and punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks at a wide-ranging press conference he
called to try to focus Congress on a slate of domestic priorities
he hopes to get passed in the remaining months of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass his
requests for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax breaks meant to encourage development of energy-saving
technologies and petroleum alternatives such as ethanol fuels.
</P>
<P>
   _ A voluntary prescription-drug benefit for Medicare
participants.
</P>
<P>
   _ A so-called patients' bill of rights, strengthening the hand
of consumers in their dealings with hospitals, insurance companies
and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $1-an-hour increase, over two years, in the minimum wage,
which is currently $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permanent normal trade relations with China, ending the annual
debate over the terms of trade between the United States and the
world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal regulation of the tobacco industry by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Congress adjourns this summer, we ought to be able to
look back and say we took real steps to make America better,''
Clinton said. ``The American people want action and they deserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Headlining Clinton's list of legislative priorities was his
insistence that Congress pass a bill that would require childproof
gun safety locks, outlaw the import of large ammunition clips and
mandate background checks for gun purchasers at flea markets and
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions are contained in a Senate juvenile justice
bill, which the companion House version has no gun control
provisions. A conference committee has been charged with working
out compromise legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee hasn't met, however, since Aug. 5, and Clinton
accused the Republican-controlled Congress of dragging its feet on
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the opponents of reform have run out of arguments,
so now they're just trying to run out the clock,'' said Clinton.
``This makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has challenged Congress to pass the legislation before
the April 20 anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High School,
in Littleton, Colo., where 12 students and a teacher were shot dead
by two teenagers who then took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deadline can still be met,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has accused Clinton of failing to
aggressively prosecute criminals who use guns. Clinton has denied
that charge, adding that punishing criminals will not, by itself,
solve the problem of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I said, you know, most people who drive are good,
honest, responsible people, and we should just, we ought to repeal
the laws, the driver's license laws, and repeal the speed limits
and the next time somebody does something wrong and has a 25-car
pile-up, we'll just throw the book at 'em,'' said Clinton. ``I
mean, a sensible society has a balance between prevention and
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also addressed the difficulties he has faced in recent
days trying to get stalled peace talks restarted between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for three hours in Geneva on Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad, Clinton was unable to get him back to the
bargaining table with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton laid the blame for the impasse squarely at
Assad's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He now knows in great detail what the Israeli proposals were.
And I believe since they have made an effort to be specific and
comprehensive, if we're going to make progress, they should now be
able to know what his specific and comprehensive response is on all
the issues,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's auspices, Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa held a week of peace talks in January in
Sheperdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke up, though, after Syria refused to proceed until
Israel vowed to return the Golan Heights territories it captured
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel is seeking security
guarantees as the price of the Golan's return.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has declined to spell out the terms of peace, however,
unless Israel first pledges to return all of the Golan territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more than one issue here,'' said Clinton. ``And if
we're going to have a negotiation, I don't think it's enough to
say, 'I don't like your position. Come back and see me when I like
your position.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the way to address the dispute is through
negotiations, not stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how strongly he (Assad) feels,'' said Clinton.
``But if he disagrees with their territorial proposal, which is
quite significant, then there should be some other proposal, I
think, coming from the Syrians about how their concerns could be
handled.''

COMMENTARY: THE STRONGEST WEAPON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Thursday morning, Feb. 12, 1987, federal agents
arrested Richard B. Wigton, a balding, 52-year-old vice president
and senior arbitrager at Kidder, Peabody and Co. They arrested him
flamboyantly _ in full view of dozens of Kidder, Peabody
colleagues. They roughed him up and frisked him and walked him,
handcuffed, across the trading floor. It was as if they got a kick
out of publicly humiliating him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Wigton was escorted from the building, tears were
spilling down his face.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of securities fraud, but Wigton had not committed
any crime. He just had the misfortune to get caught up in one of
the celebrated investigations that propelled Rudolph Giuliani from
the post of U.S. attorney to the mayoralty of New York City. He was
a victim of Giuliani zealotry _ the compulsion to push the levers
of government power beyond the limits of fairness and decency and
even reason.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Wigton's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin,
said: ``They leaned on me very hard to have him plead guilty even
though I believed he wasn't guilty. And I wouldn't do it. I kept
asking for a trial, and ultimately, we faced them down and they
walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Wigton were dropped, but the damage to him
both personally and professionally was grievous.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin summed the matter up as follows: ``You arrest him like
he's some kind of hoodlum, based upon an amount of evidence that
turns out to be no evidence at all. And you destroy his career, you
ruin his reputation and you don't apologize. And you did that for
effect. You did that because it looked good, and it makes you look
like a tough prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin is no enemy of Giuliani. He thinks the mayor is
``brilliant'' and ``by and large, has done a quite effective job.''
But what happened to Richard Wigton was ``horrible,'' Arkin said.
He added: ``The strongest, most powerful weapon a prosecutor has is
fairness. And I think that unless you exhibit fairness, you end up
imposing upon people's sense of justice in a negative manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairness, as everybody knows by now, is not one of Giuliani's
strengths. The humiliation of Richard Wigton and the recent
relentless trashing of the memory of Patrick Dorismond are,
apparently, all the same to him _ no big deal. No different,
really, from the mass mistreatment of scores of thousands of New
Yorkers (mostly black or Hispanic males) who are stopped and
frisked and otherwise hassled by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is a bully with a tendency to degrade. It wasn't enough
to force Ramon Cortines out as schools chancellor. The mayor had to
play to nasty prejudices by characterizing Cortines _ a thoroughly
decent man _ as ``precious'' and the ``little victim.'' It was
unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness? Ask Richard Murphy about fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Another thoroughly decent man, Murphy was the Youth Services
Commissioner under David Dinkins. Giuliani replaced him with the
Rev. John E. Brandon, who, it turned out, had some embarrassing tax
and patronage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to those problems was deflected when the mayor's press
secretary telephoned reporters with bombshell allegations about
wrongdoing _ including financial chicanery, the improper awarding
of contracts and even charges of breaking and entering _ on
Murphy's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were an abomination _ no truer in Murphy's case than
in Wigton's. But nearly a year passed before the extent of the
smear against Murphy became clear. The New York Times' Joyce
Purnick wrote, in a column in March 1995: ``There has indeed been
mismanagement at the city's Youth Services Department. But it
wasn't in the Dinkins years. It was under Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, a new review shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, in an editorial, described the episode as a
``gross abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy told Purnick that in the period before he was exonerated
he lost out on prospective jobs and finally had to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Holding high public office is not a license to push anybody and
everybody around. There are patterns emerging that raise questions
about Giuliani's judgment and temperament and fitness for office.
Those patterns deserve much closer scrutiny.

COMMENTARY: THE 100,000 E-MAIL GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles Ruff, President Clinton's defense counsel
in the impeachment trial, was also the last special prosecutor of
President Nixon in Watergate; he surely must remember the furor
surrounding the unexplained ``18{-minute gap'' on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a lawsuit filed four years ago by Judicial Watch, we
now discover that Ruff presided over the concealment of the Clinton
administration's ``100,000 e-mail gap.''
</P>
<P>
   These were the messages sent to the White House between 1996 and
1998, all required by law to be archived, and all part of the
``universe of information'' required to be reviewed by the White
House counsel to respond to subpoenas by prosecutors and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff blithely claims ignorance of technology. When informed of
the ``glitch'' as the impeachment firestorm gathered in 1998, his
associates say, Ruff assumed the problem was fixed and the search
for subpoenaed evidence was under way. But it was not. And Ruff is
neither negligent nor prone to easy assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Three nongovernment technicians who were called in to examine
the White House computers testified that they had been told to keep
their mouths shut about the unsearched files, on pain of jail. One
of their harassers at first denied making such threats, before the
House Government Reform Committee this week, then changed her
testimony to admit she had told the dismayed technicians to stay
mum ``because it was sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investigators looking into Asian campaign
contributions, invasions of privacy and possible presidential
perjury have been kept in the dark for the past two years. There
can be no innocent reason for that deliberate decision by the
Clinton White House to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday about his e-mail problem, Clinton said, ``I
believe that was known years ago.'' Sure; he knew and Ruff knew.
But no grand jury or congressional committee was told.
</P>
<P>
   As this deliberate suppression of the truth about the unsearched
e-mails came to light, the Justice Department reacted with The Old
Reno Trick: obstruction by in-house investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it worked before. When the ``Asian Connection'' to
Clinton-Gore money-raising was broken in this space on Oct. 5,
1996, and The Los Angeles Times unearthed the Gore Buddhist temple
fund-raising scandal, the U.S. attorney in L.A., Stephen Mansfield,
moved quickly to investigate. But Lee Radek, Reno's chief protector
of higher-ups, informed him, ``your office should take no steps to
investigate these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Radek's Washington office assumed authority and allowed
witnesses to skip the country. He used the excuse that an
independent counsel might be needed, but, after the trail cooled
sufficiently, fought the attempt of a real prosecutor and the FBI
to appoint one. Result: wrist slaps for small fry, neither Clinton
nor Gore even questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Justice is now trying the same trick in the e-mail case.
Judicial Watch, in a civil suit, forced out the truth and a federal
judge is hitting pay dirt. Department of Justice lawyers may have
assisted a Clinton archivist in submitting a misleading affidavit
about the e-mails last year. But true to form, now that its
misfeasance is public, Reno Justice is launching its own ``criminal
investigation,'' the intent of which is to seize control of the
productive civil case until after the coming election.
</P>
<P>
   The same crew at Justice that kept the Asian fund-raising
scandal away from the White House is now throwing its protective
blanket over the White House aides who intimidated whistle-blowers
in the e-mail concealment. Justice's criminal division will
``investigate'' its civil division, and insiders will have a good
laugh at chairman Dan Burton's call for outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I pop off at these arrant cover-ups? Because popping off
at power abuse has a public-policy purpose. The investigation
triggered by published outrage at Filegate has ended such routine
invasion of privacy, and completely changed the slavish attitude
toward White House aides at the FBI. If that cost $10 million, it
was well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Same with concealing the 100,000 e-mail gap. Not all wrongdoing
is criminal. But when presidential counsel artfully skirt the law,
contemptuous of court or Congress or individual citizens, they must
be closely examined and called to public account.

WHEN THE AGE OF COURTSHIP ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LISA BELKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know it will end. It's only a question of when. Even the
longest economic expansion in history cannot continue forever.
</P>
<P>
   And when it ends, what will happen to the smaller revolutions it
has created? To the transformation of the office into a place where
workers are acknowledged to have families? To the growing
insistence of employees that their lives matter? Is all this talk
of work-life balance really a change to the social core, or is it
just cocktail conversation that will fade when the party's over?
</P>
<P>
   I recently spent a day in Boston at a company called Circles,
the ultimate icing on the work-life cake. If your employer
contracts with Circles, you are entitled to call a ``convenience
coordinator'' who will run your errands. Coordinators won't do
anything ``that isn't legal, moral or nice,'' says Janet Kraus,
co-founder and chief executive of Circles, but they will wait for
the cable repairman, plan your child's birthday party or take your
car in for servicing.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning I arrived, Kelly Medico, a coordinator, sat at
her computer searching for the perfect birthday gift for a Vietnam
veteran who collects war memorabilia. For nearly two hours, Medico
trawled the Web, choosing between a World War II wrist compass, an
unopened pack of Lucky Strike Greens and a Saddam Hussein
pincushion doll. And all the while the giver of the gift, an Ernst
&AMP; Young employee, was doing her own work, which is why Ernst &AMP;
Young was paying for this in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as a way to increase productivity,'' says Denise
Hoffman, the manager of work-life balance at Ernst &AMP; Young. ``It's
valuable in retention of employees, and we use it as a recruiting
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment, retention and the bottom line. Those _ not
generosity or love _ have always been the underpinnings of
human-resource policies, says Ann Vincola, a longtime work-life
consultant in Boston. She said that chief executives are not sold
on job sharing, or flex time or lactation rooms ``just because you
present this as the right thing to do; there has to be some
perceived advantage to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that companies are eagerly seizing that
advantage. The Society for Human Resource Management conducts an
annual survey, asking its members what benefits they offer. Three
years ago, there were 92 choices on the menu. Last year, there were
110. Not only does the survey show an increase in what are now
considered traditional benefits (53 percent offer flex time, an
increase of 7 percent from 1997), but the new perks are growing,
too. Massage therapy is hot now (8 percent of respondents say their
companies offer this), as are concierge services (now at 4 percent
and double the percentage a year ago).
</P>
<P>
   But if we accept that all this attention to our lives is spurred
less by enlightenment than by economics, what can we expect when
the economic realities change? ``There will,'' Vincola says, ``be a
tightening of the belt.'' Those programs that make financial sense
will remain, she predicts. Telecommuting, for instance, which frees
office space. Or compressed workweeks, which don't cost the company
more if they're done right. But things that simply make lives
easier will probably be cut.
</P>
<P>
   The people who make their living from work-life programs
understand this, and they are quietly preparing for the inevitable.
Two weeks ago, I attended a work-life conference, and the talk at
one lunch table was about a human-resource executive's push to get
on-site child care ``right now when times are flush because once
it's built they're less likely to take it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus of Circles is also storing nuts. ``We're diversifying our
risk,'' she says, describing a recent deal with a major credit card
company: sign up for their platinum card and get a free Circles
membership.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy stalls, she reasons, ``there is a future for us
in the customer loyalty market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, her coordinators keep fielding requests from
harried but pampered employees. Find a psychologist in Florida who
will perform an IQ test on a preschooler. Find a gym within five
miles of Harvard Square with a basketball court that is open past
10 p.m. A housekeeper with good references in New York.
Child-friendly hotels in Maui. Willie Nelson tickets any place
he'll be playing.
</P>
<P>
   We are standing on a sliver of a moment in a most unusual time.
It may be cold comfort, but you might never be more valued by your
boss than you are right this minute. Savor that while it lasts.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For more than two decades, Fort Worth's
downtown Central Library was underground and as safe as a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday _ less than six months after the opening of a $7
million street-level expansion complete with a colorful children's
section _ a tornado slammed into the building, shattering windows,
causing up to $1 million in damage and injuring two children,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of leaks and extensive remodeling, a new round of
construction work faces library officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again,'' said Gleniece Robinson,, Fort Worth
library director. ``But we're not in control of those situations,
so we deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was in the library when the tornado struck, said
she is just happy that the staff remained calm and the situation
wasn't any worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unreal. Unbelievable. Amazing. There was glass flying
everywhere,'' she said. ``The noise was horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Winds shattered a skylight, broke chunks off the outside wall
covering, and broke doors and windows on every side of the
two-block-long building.
</P>
<P>
   The storm overturned a library delivery truck and collapsed a
small wall between the library and the city cable TV studio. Water
damaged books and other parts of the library collection, Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons began screaming and running when the storm hit, and the
air filled with a shower of broken glass and dust, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of kids who were in the youth center, and
we believe they got hurt when the windows blew in,'' she said,
adding that both had minor cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Hunt, an intensive care nurse at Harris Methodist Fort
Worth, was in the lower level when the funnel hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All at once, simultaneously we heard people yelling upstairs
to get down,'' Hunt said. ```The fire alarms went off. At the same
time, we heard glass breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers moved people to the lower level, where Hunt helped
treat some, including a boy who thought he had glass in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the outside of the library looked battered and
scarred by debris, and a big piece of the facade on the northeast
corner was missing. City crews were repairing doors and the floor
of the cable TV studio, which was covered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pretty sight, but at least we had no loss of life
or injuries on our staff,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance will cover all but $100,000 of the loss, Assistant
City Manager Ramon Guajardo said. The library should reopen by this
weekend, but work will continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful thing that most of our building is
underground, which is the safest place to be,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   She said having the children's section upstairs reduced other
dangers, such as using stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was named library director after two decades at
the Dallas library, said she's never been through a tornado before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Alabama, and I'm used to hurricanes,'' she said. ``I
don't want to be in one again.''

TAX PLAN TOUCHES FEMINIST NERVE

<P>
   SYDNEY _ As a rule, Australians are neither coy nor squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Topless sunbathing and euphemism-free condom advertisements are
common here, and unremarkable. Humor tends to the scatological.
``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City,'' two decidedly
adult-oriented staples of HBO programming in the United States, are
shown on Australian network television, in prime time, without
deleted expletives. These people are not easily shocked.
</P>
<P>
   But even Australia has its limits. And women dressing up as
giant replicas of feminine hygiene products, and pelting the prime
minister with said products in public, is pushing them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, of course, is taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, the conservative government of Prime Minister John
Howard will impose a 10 percent Goods and Services Tax on almost
everything Australians buy. Exceptions will be made for such items
as sunscreen, personal lubricants for men and women, incontinence
pads, and condoms. But not for tampons and sanitary napkins, which
will jump in price like lumber, towels, and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   That has angered women enormously, igniting the kind of feminist
uprising Australia hasn't seen since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax on tampons is unfair, because there will not be a tax
on medical products like bandages, for instance,'' said activist
Rhonda Ellis. ``Only women bleed, so this is discriminatory.
Condoms, for instance, will not have a GST. So sex is a necessity,
and periods a luxury?''
</P>
<P>
   When the controversy over the Goods and Services Tax erupted
late last year, Health Minister Michael Wooldridge made matters
worse by arguing that the tax on tampons was not discriminatory,
and that tampons did not qualify for a health exemption because
menstruation is not an illness. He compared the tax on tampons to
that on shaving cream, which affects men more than women, and
concluded the government's position was perfectly just.
</P>
<P>
   That incensed Ellis, a 54-year-old veteran of the women's
movement, who took drastic action. She morphed into Tanya Tampon
and helped to make the tax on feminine hygiene products a national
issue. After all, she argues, men can do without shaving cream. It
is far more difficult for women to find substitutes for tampons and
sanitary napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis created Tanya Tampon by wrapping herself in a cylinder of
cardboard, putting a planter on her head, and covering the whole
structure with a gauzy white sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long piece of white cord that comes up from
underneath, and I tend to swing that for effect,'' she said. Long
white gloves complete the look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to walk in, I can't sit down in it, and on a hot
day, it's really warm in there, but I can talk from it,'' Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Prime Minister Howard appeared at Murwillumbah, a town far
north of Sydney, in early February, Tanya Tampon and her comrades
were there to greet him, carrying banners saying ``We're bleeding
voters too. Stick your GST!''
</P>
<P>
   Protesting environmentalists were hurling slogans at the prime
minister that day too, but while police pushed the
environmentalists back behind barricades, they kept their distance
from Tanya Tampon and her friends, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's because the police were reluctant to approach
the tampon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said Howard didn't seem to notice her that day, but the
press certainly did, and a round of television and radio
appearances followed.
</P>
<P>
   Radio interviewers asked her if she didn't think it ``a bit over
the top'' to dress up as a giant tampon: ``I said, `I think it's a
bit over the top to have a tax on tampons, and I think this is an
appropriate response to the tax.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Howard was unaware of Tanya Tampon at his appearance in
Murwillumbah, he has had difficulty avoiding her fellow protesters
since. Australians, who call their heads of state by their first
names and harbor a strong skepticism about elected officials, are
rarely shy about making their displeasure felt.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, riot police were dispatched to break up a
rally in Perth, as women protesting the tax showered Howard and his
aides with tampons dipped in red dye. The women stood side by side
with angry builders' labor union members protesting the use of
non-union workers.
</P>
<P>
   At another protest, in Nowra, north of Sydney, laid-off meat
workers _ males _ held up protest banners on behalf of the women.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, 100 red-caped women called The Menstrual Avengers
marched on the offices of media magnate Kerry Packer, and on the
headquarters of Howard's Liberal Party. They, too, tossed tampons.
One some college campuses, women have taken to wearing tampons as
earrings, in silent protest. In Canberra, 60 women in red marched
on the city center chanting, ``I bleed and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How very tasteless,'' said Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander
Downer after he and the rest of Howard's Cabinet were pelted by the
Menstrual Avengers in one town.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has done anything to budge the Howard government on
the tax, however. If an exception were made for tampons on the
grounds that they are a necessity, their argument goes, then the
floodgates would be open to exemptions for such items as children's
clothing, diapers, and funerals, and the whole system would come
crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Labor Party has seized on the tampon tax,
capitalizing on the clear outrage of so many women, and has been
trying use it to pummel Howard's government and its entire tax plan
for months. As a result, women's concerns have been placed near the
top of Australia's agenda lately, a still-rare state of affairs for
a culture many still consider to be quite macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words `tampon,' `menstruation,' and `period' have now been
used in federal parliament,'' Ellis said, pleased. ``It's
interesting that periods are possibly the last bastion of taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   That taboo is on its way out, she promised. But until that
liberation, or a tax exception, arrives, Ellis is happy to throw on
the Tanya Tampon costume as often as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unafraid of bulldozers, trains, and press cameras,'' she
said. ``If not me, then maybe nobody else would do it. Besides,
unless you volunteer your name, nobody knows who you are.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after it barred organized prayer at
public high school graduations, the Supreme Court on Wednesday
appeared deeply reluctant to permit organized prayer at public high
school football games, at least when led by a student chosen in a
schoolwide election to offer an invocation or message ``to
solemnize the event.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for a small Texas school district labored during a
spirited argument Wednesday to persuade the justices that a student
chosen by election, and not told by school officials what to say or
not say, acted as an ``independent speaker'' when leading a pregame
prayer and so did not place the school district in the position of
breaching the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual student selected is the circuit breaker, who
determines the message,'' the lawyer, Jay Alan Sekulow, told the
court. Under the Santa Fe Independent School District's ``hands-off
policy,'' he said, ``no one knows what that student might say.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to prevent the student from offering a prayer under
those circumstances would ``require the school district to be a
censor, and to censor only religious speech,'' Sekulow said,
adding, ``All speech is protected by the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's skepticism was evident throughout Sekulow's argument
in a case that is being watched closely for signs for any shifts in
the court's view of the appropriate place for religion in the
public schools. In particular, a majority of the justices indicated
through their comments that they did not accept the student's role
as that of a private speaker whose words carried no constitutional
implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not students acting individually,'' Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg told Sekulow. ``These students are acting as an
electoral body that the school has designated.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said, ``We're concerned about
avoiding having the schools become a forum for religious debate,''
and added, ``We're looking for some mechanism to ensure neutrality,
and we haven't seen what it is. I think the election thing doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was the author of the court's 5-4 decision eight years
ago in Lee vs. Weisman, which held unconstitutional the practice of
clergy-led prayer at high school graduations. To have a chance of
prevailing Wednesday, Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center
for Law &AMP; Justice, founded by the evangelist Pat Robertson, needed
to persuade Kennedy that student-led prayer at football games was
constitutionally distinct from clergy-led prayer at graduation. The
Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans barred the
football prayers in a 1998 decision that the Santa Fe district,
near Galveston, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   By a stroke of bad fortune for the school district, Kennedy was
also the author one week ago of the Supreme Court's decision on
mandatory student activity fees at the University of Wisconsin. In
that decision, all nine justices upheld the fees except for one
aspect that all agreed was constitutionally troublesome: a student
referendum at which organizations could be accepted or rejected for
financing from the pool of student fees. In his opinion last week,
Kennedy said there was a risk that majority rule would overcome the
``viewpoint neutrality'' essential for the program's
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor pointedly reminded Sekulow of last
week's decision, and raised the further issue of whether students
might conduct campaigns on the basis of the type of prayer they
would offer.
</P>
<P>
   To the justices' various concerns, Sekulow and Attorney General
John Cornyn of Texas, who also argued in support of the school
district, replied that because the policy had been blocked from
taking effect, there was no basis for making dire predictions about
how it would actually be applied. The court should simply uphold
the policy on its face, the two lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices indicated little willingness to do that,
suggesting that they understood the program well enough. ``Is there
any reason to expect we'd get a solemnizing speech to the effect
that religion is bunk?'' Justice David H. Souter asked the attorney
general, adding, ``The point of my question is that I don't think
there's any reason to expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter said: ``We're talking here not about a neutral speech
policy, not merely a discussion about religious subject matter. It
is religious worship, and the question is whether that may be
inflicted upon those who may not want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, No.
99-62, began in 1995, when the district was sued by two families,
one Catholic and one Mormon, who objected to the Christian prayers
being offered at school events by chaplains. As the litigation
progressed, the district came up with several different versions of
a policy that now provides for the election of a student, to serve
for the duration of the football season, who can decide whether to
offer an ``invocation and/or message'' as part of the pregame
ceremonies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They were trying to work their way out of a very practical
problem: How do we avoid being sued,'' Cornyn told the court. The
state's brief was also signed by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer told Cornyn: ``The school district has
figured out a way to have prayer, but the mechanism itself leaves
minority religions out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all subjected to messages we disagree with,'' the
attorney general replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the purpose of the Establishment Clause,'' Breyer
continued, ``is to allow parents to raise their children in the
religion of their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyer, Anthony P. Griffin, urged the justices
not to accept the policy as one of neutrality. ``It endorses
religion and its whole purpose is religion,'' Griffin said, adding,
``They weave a web and seek to have this court ignore its
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, probing for a difference
between football prayer and graduation prayer, observed that
``nobody has to go to a football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Band members and cheerleaders have to attend, Griffin replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anybody forced to be a band member or a cheerleader?''
Justice Antonin Scalia asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a teen-ager, yes,'' Griffin, who practices in
Galveston, replied, adding, ``And that's spoken from experience.''

PEELING BACK THE LAYERS OF HUGHES-PLATH RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them the Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton of the
literary set; two finely tuned, talented poets who shared the joy
and the misfortune of marrying each other. When the
often-tumultuous, seven-year marriage of Sylvia Plath and Ted
Hughes ended with her suicide in 1963, the squabbling never
stopped. Instead, their partisans rushed to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Plath became larger than life. Her novel, ``The Bell
Jar,'' was posthumously published in the United States and became a
fixture on high school and college reading lists. In 1982, she won
the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The Plath of legend was the Judy
Garland of poetry, a shimmering talent deemed too sensitive for
this world.
</P>
<P>
   The Ted Hughes of legend was someone else entirely: a
cold-hearted, controlling philanderer jealous of his wife's
success. Hughes never granted an interview about Plath and, as her
literary executor, shielded many of her letters and diaries from
prying biographers. Dozens of books and articles have been
published on the pair, and the prurient fascination _ usually
disguised as literary inquiry _ with their relationship never seems
to wane. Says Stanford University English professor Diane
Middlebrook: ``It was the marriage of the late 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Hughes's death in 1998, a vast amount of original
archival material from both Plath and Hughes is now becoming
available to scholars and to the public, free of the restrictions
that had previously been in force. The marriage that launched a
thousand monographs will doubtless launch a thousand more _ many of
which will probably help restore Hughes's personal and literary
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   On the Plath side of the ledger, the British publisher Faber &AMP;
Faber is about to publish over 700 pages of Plath's adult journal,
believed to be a complete edition of her extant adult diaries. (One
journal was lost and Hughes destroyed one.) The journals have been
kept at Smith College's rare book room, where two of them, written
between August 1957 and November 1959, were to have remained sealed
until 2013. The couple's children asked Smith curator Karen Kukil
to edit the journals, and before he died, their father agreed to
unseal the closed materials. Anchor Books in New York will publish
a US edition in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, 2 1/2 tons of Ted Hughes's personal archive,
including papers, notebooks, and photo albums, will be formally
opened to scholars next week at Emory University in Georgia. With
the exception of a few letters about living people _ and one
mysterious, sealed footlocker _ everything is available to
researchers. ``For a man whose literary history has been so
contentious, it is remarkable that he's opened himself up in this
way,'' says Emory curator Stephen Enniss.
</P>
<P>
   Middlebrook, who has been delving into the Emory archive for a
book on Hughes's later life, predicts the new material will change
public perceptions of the poet. ``The entire public narrative about
Plath and Hughes is about the dominance of Plath by Hughes,'' she
says. ``And that goes on being the story that people want to hear,
and that they do hear. That's not my take on it at all. The notion
that he is evil or responsible for Sylvia Plath's death is
disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to reconstruct the jigsaw puzzle of the
Plath-Hughes relationship, there are still a few pieces missing.
Ted Hughes referred to a journal that he kept, but this journal is
not among the Emory materials. And there is the matter of the
sealed footlocker, to be opened 25 years from now. No one knows
what is inside.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and his children have un-dammed an ocean of new material,
including new poems and prose works by both poets, so it's a bit
churlish to emphasize the eyedropper-ful of missing links. Hughes
never restricted access to a large Plath collection at Indiana
University's Lilly Library, for instance. Those strictures were
mostly imposed by Plath's late mother, and are no longer in force.
With free access to the Smith, Emory, and Indiana archives, we may
discover a great deal more about the Hughes-Plath relationship;
indeed much more than we may want to know.

ROYAL PHILIPS ELECTRONICS TO OPEN TV SCREEN FACTORY IN PRAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By LADKA BAUEROVA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Royal Philips Electronics NV of the
Netherlands, the largest consumer electronics manufacturer in
Europe, announced one of the biggest foreign investments in the
Czech Republic on Wednesday, a television screen factory capable of
producing 2.5 million color picture tubes a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips plant, which will be one of the world's largest
producers of TV screens, was considered a coup for the Czech
Republic. It had been in a heated three-way race with Poland and
Hungary for the investment and had offered generous tax breaks to
Philips to get it.
</P>
<P>
   CTK, the Czech news agency, reported that the government's
incentives were worth the equivalent of $42.9 million, including
10-year tax abatements.
</P>
<P>
   Philips said it would spend at least 200 million euros, or $190
million, to build the factory, which would initially employ 1,000
people. There were widespread expectations among Czech officials
that the size of the investment and the number of employees could
eventually triple.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which is expected to be operating by the end of next
year, will enable Philips more easily to supply the growing demand
for televisions in the Czech Republic and neighboring nations.
Philips said the broad market for TV tubes was growing at about 5
percent a year and was expected to expand more quickly in Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good skilled labor force available in Czech
Republic, and we would like to take advantage of that,'' said Andre
Manning, the spokesman for Philips operations in Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Philips will build the plant in the northeast town of Hranice,
where the impact of the country's 3-year-old economic downturn has
been especially severe. The unemployment rate around Hranice is 15
percent, compared with the national average of 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech authorities were eager to express their satisfaction
with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad this investment finally ended up in the Czech
Republic, since our neighbors were also extremely interested,''
said Miroslav Gregr, the minister of industry and trade, alluding
to the bids by Poland and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic will also benefit from a plan by Philips to
move some of its research and development operations into the
region. ``This will support the development of know-how and the
growth of our scientific potential,'' Gregr said. &QL;

   PHOENIX _ The losers' Last Chance Saloon is actually a
British-themed pub, oddly suited to the occasion. Like Colonel
Blimp's mourning the end of empire, true believers in the primacy

   The most conservative big city in the country voted March 14 to

60-year absence), and to build a trolley line down its main drag.
</P>
<P>
   Other Sun Belt cities learned long ago that light-rail vehicles
can ease traffic. Trolleys enhanced life in San Diego, San Jose,
and Sacramento, but Phoenix remained in stubborn thrall to its
auto-dominant philosophy as late as 1997. A referendum that year
defeated a transit tax by just 122 votes. Since then, commuting
Phoenicians have had ample time, sitting in traffic, to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   An antitax attitude has historically ruled the nation's
seventh-largest city. But as the Valley of the Sun slowly became
the Valley of the Smog, not even antitax editorials in The Wall
Street Journal could dispel the gloom or move the traffic. (The
Arizona Republic's editorials heartily urged a yes vote on
Proposition 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, opponents of transit cheered. This year, antitax
warriors drowned their sorrows at the George and Dragon, a pub on
Central Avenue, a street which trolley cars will traverse by 2006.
``It is really the voters who have lost, big-time,'' said Becky
Fenger of De-Rail the Tax, noting that her group was outspent
heavily. True enough, her $10,000 budget was no match for the $1.4
million raised by corporate interests weary of watching their work
force idling on the off-ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has been both victim and beneficiary of geography. When
the Interstate Highway System was planned, Arizona's capital had
just 107,000 people. A program with 90 percent federal funding
somehow met more favor here than most Washington-based plans.
Fields of cacti fell to the federal bulldozer, and Routes 17 and 10
met little resistance. The city now has 1.2 million residents, a
number expected to double in the next 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the Rockies don't tumble. Tucson is surrounded on
four sides by mountains. Albuquerque's growth must cope with the
majestic Sandia range. Phoenix, less hemmed in, sprawled over less
challenging barriers until it encountered its own tapped-out,
traffic-clogged transportation philosophy _ or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of limits still seems alien hereabouts. When gasoline
prices rise, grumbling quickly infests radio shows and letters to
the editor. Right-wingers and left-wingers alike subscribe to a
conspiracy theory that $2 a gallon must be a plot. Reaction is more
muted when the water bills arrive. When residents average 175
gallons a day, Phoenicians realize their supply is finite. Water
and sewer rates have escalated 2 percent annually since 1994 to a
monthly average of $29 per household.
</P>
<P>
   Transit is one way of recognizing limits, even if it means
swallowing the distasteful ideological task of subsidizing someone
else's ride on the bus. Many residents emigrated to the desert to
escape Chicago's Loop, New York's subways, or Boston's T. But by
the time a 12-mile trolley line starts operating, Phoenix may be
happy to shed its image of a cloverleaf-clogged imitator of other
car-crazed cities. By 2006, it will no longer be Los Angeles
without the beaches or Houston without the charm.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the sincerest form of transit. After the vote, when
Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza hollered ``All aboard!'' the suburbs of
Tempe and Scottsdale quickly asked to join the new system. A Wells
Fargo stagecoach never had a more eager welcome.
</P>

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    McALLEN, Texas _ Despues de perder dos costosos cargamentos de
almendras de California y uno de bacalao noruego a manos de
asaltantes, Adolfo Juarez supo que habia llegado la hora de
contraatacar. El empresario de Ciudad de Mexico contrato guardias
de seguridad para proteger sus productos en la ruta de Veracruz y
la frontera con Texas hasta su destino final en los
establecimientos de la capital mexicana.
 &HT;    ``Hay que adaptarse a las circunstancias,'' dice el dueno del
negocio de importaciones Encuentro S.A. de C.V. ``Si las
circunstancias dicen que hace falta mas proteccion, entonces hay
que buscarla.''
 &HT;    En las carreteras de Mexico el robo de mercancias es tan comun
como los baches. Bandas organizadas roban cientos de millones de
dolares en productos y crean un clima hostil para empresas de
transporte y aseguradoras.
 &HT;    La Camara Nacional del Autotransporte de Carga (Canacar),
organizacion de unos 180.000 duenos de camiones, dice que todos los
anos se denuncian asaltos a unos 800 camiones, con perdidas de
US$253 millones. Es una mala noticia para un pais donde el 90 por
ciento de toda la carga se mueve en camion.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la gran mayoria de los robos no se denuncian, dicen
las autoridades. En zonas rurales como Filo de Caballo, en
Guerrero, hay milicias locales que se toman la justicia por su
mano: ahorcan a los asaltantes.
 &HT;    En Queretaro, Michoacan, Puebla, San Luis Potosi y Sinaloa
tienen un alto indice de asaltos. Pero las carreteras que conducen
a la enorme capital mexicana, plagada por la pobreza, son el
frenetico escenario de la mayor parte de los robos de carga, dice
Manuel Gomez, vicepresidente de la Camara de transporte. ``Del 80
por ciento al 90 por ciento (de los robos) ocurre en la Ciudad de
Mexico y sus alrededores.''
 &HT;    Aunque ningun producto esta a salvo, la carne, los vinos, el
cafe, los alimentos enlatados, los equipos electronicos y la ropa
estan entre los mas codiciados por los delincuentes. Esos productos
se consumen rapidamente o se absorben sin llamar la atencion en los
concurridos mercados populares.
 &HT;    Los asaltantes estan bien armados, organizados y cuentan con una
excelente red de distribucion. ``No es facil asaltar un camion y
vender las 25 toneladas del producto que lleve,'' dice Gomez. ``Son
cadenas enormes de distribucion ilegal.''
 &HT;    Hay muchos sospechosos a la hora de determinar quienes son los
asaltantes y quienes los mantienen al tanto de los cargamentos.
Algunos ven la mano de funcionarios corruptos, sobre todo porque
las investigaciones rara vez dan con los culpables. Otros piensan
que son empleados de las companias de transporte, que conocen la
carga y pueden ganar el equivalente al salario de un mes solo con
llamar a una banda de ladrones y darles la informacion. Los
aduaneros y los propios camioneros tampoco escapan a las sospechas.
 &HT;    De cualquier manera, los robos son un gran dolor de cabeza para
las empresas que pierden sus productos y para las companias que
transportan esa mercancia, dice Jose Garduno, propietario de la
empresa camionera Transportes Terrestres, de Ciudad de Mexico.
 &HT;    En octubre de 1999, uno de los choferes de Garduno transportaba
mas de US$50.000 en jabones, detergentes y otros productos de
Procter &AMP; Gamble cuando unos bandidos armados lo asaltaron en
Tlaxcala y se hicieron con el camion. Procter &AMP; Gamble tenia el
cargamento asegurado, pero Garduno dice que tuvo que librar una
interminable batalla burocratica para sacar libre a su chofer, el
primer sospechoso del delito, y recuperar su camion, hallado mas
tarde en Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Cuando al empresario Adolfo Juarez le robaron hace unos anos,
perdio US$100.000 en almendras en Ciudad de Mexico y otro
cargamento por el mismo valor. Sufrio un nuevo golpe en 1996 cuando
le robaron un embarque de bacalao por valor de US$120.000 en
Veracruz. Como es habitual en casos asi, la mercancia nunca se
hallo. Juarez se recupero de sus perdidas financieras pero afronta
altisimas tasas de seguro.
 &HT;    Las aseguradoras han tenido grandes perdidas con los cargamentos
robados y muchas se niegan a asegurar cargamentos, dice Arnoldo
Trevino, agente de seguros en Reynosa, ciudad de Tamaulipas, cerca
de McAllen, Texas. ``En la frontera los aseguramos, pero en el
interior no,'' dice. Agrega que las empresas que tratan de prevenir
los asaltos tienen mejores primas.
 &HT;    Despues de sufrir su tercer robo, Juarez decidio protegerse.
Contrato solo companias equipadas con tecnologia GPS, que determina
por medios satelitales la ubicacion de los camiones, y contrato a
empresas privadas de guardias de seguridad para que acompanaran sus
cargamentos. En mas de tres anos no ha perdido una sola carga.
``Por que no me roban? Porque tengo escolta,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Las firmas privadas de seguridad estan entre los pocos que se
benefician de la situacion. Companias como el Grupo Diamante de
Nuevo Laredo, han adquirido gran experiencia en la proteccion de
remolques que transportan computadoras IBM, cosmeticos de Estee
Lauder y otros articulos valiosos.
 &HT;    ``Es un servicio necesario debido a la delincuencia,'' apunta
Ricardo Hernandez, administrador del Grupo Diamante. ``No hay
suficientes policias para detenerlo. Y en muchos casos, son los
mismos policias (los que roban).''
 &HT;    A un costo de US$1.500, el Grupo Diamante envia tres guardias en
un Volkswagen nuevo que acompanan al camionero durante las 18 horas
que dura el viaje desde la frontera hasta Ciudad de Mexico, o
adonde el cliente necesite ir. Los guardias no pueden portar armas,
pero tienen algo mejor: comunicaciones.
 &HT;    Los guardias se comunican por radio con frecuencia a la base
para informar su ubicacion y se mantienen en contacto permanente
con el camionero. Cuando ven algo sospechoso pueden pedir a la base
que avisen a la policia.
 &HT;    Cada vez son mas las companias de camiones que equipan sus
vehiculos con tecnologia satelital. ``No elimina los robos, pero
facilita encontrar el camion y la carga,'' dice Garduno, de
Transportes Terrestres, que instalo un sistema GPS en sus seis
camiones tras varios asaltos.
 &HT;    Pero esa tecnologia excede las posibilidades de muchas empresas
pequenas. De los 300.000 camiones operados por miembros de la
camara de transporte de carga, solo unos 4.000 tienen equipo
satelital, dice Gomez, de la Camara.
 &HT;    Muchos camioneros optan por medidas de seguridad simples, como
viajar en caravanas o llevar un telefono celular. Los miembros de
sindicatos suelen intercambiar informacion sobre los caminos
peligrosos. ``Unidos, nos comunicamos mas,'' dice Damazo
Villafranca Cantu, representante de la Union de Transportistas del
Norte de Tamaulipas y dueno de una pequena compania de camiones.
``Cuando uno esta informado, puede trabajar con mas seguridad.''
 &HT;    Aunque mas companias adoptan la alta tecnologia, los clientes no
siempre pueden costear las medidas de proteccion y prefieren
mantener los precios bajos que contratar firmas de seguridad y
camiones con tecnologia avanzada.
 &HT;    La amenaza de los robos no supera la necesidad de mantener bajos
los costos, indica Luis Rivas, de Comercial Izadora, compania de
Reynosa que importa carne de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``Nuestros gastos generales serian tan altos que tendriamos que
elevar los precios,'' dice Rivas, al explicar por que la empresa no
invierte en tecnologia satelital ni en seguro contra robo.
``Tenemos que arriesgarnos porque no podemos alejar a nuestros
clientes.'' La compania de Rivas no ha sufrido un robo en tres
anos, dice.
 &HT;    Javier Flores no ha tenido tanta suerte. El joven de 23 anos de
Saltillo, Coahuila, solo llevaba ano y medio de camionero cuando
sufrio el primer robo.
 &HT;    Todo ocurrio en mayo de 1999, cuando Javier y su hermano, que
manejaba otro camion, transportaban hierro de Saltillo a Mazatlan,
Sinaloa. Al camion de su hermano se le pincho un neumatico en las
montanas de Sinaloa.
 &HT;    Cuando se detuvieron a repararlo, cuatro hombres armados con
pistolas salieron de un automovil, los amenazaron y se llevaron
rapidamente los camiones con su carga.
 &HT;    Tambien se llevaron la tranquilidad de Flores. ``Uno hace el
trabajo como siempre, pero con miedo,'' admite.
 &HT;    Los robos de camiones parecen ir en aumento, segun la Camara de
Transporte de Carga, que informo a principios de 1999 que los
asaltos aumentaron el 15 por ciento con respecto a 1998. El
problema causo tanta inquietud en la Ciudad de Mexico como para que
la Secretaria de Seguridad Publica creara una fuerza permanente de
patrullas en motocicleta para vigilar las principales rutas de
camiones.
 &HT;    Pero algunos dicen que la proteccion policial es como poner a
los ratones a cuidar el queso. Samuel Sepulveda, nacido en Jalisco
hace 40 anos y que ha pasado la mitad de su vida manejando
remolques, todavia no sabe quien robo su camion de cemento en 1994.
 &HT;    Iba hacia San Luis Potosi cuando dos hombres con el uniforme
negro de la policia federal judicial lo detuvieron y lo acusaron de
llevar cierto contrabando que no especificaron. Se llevaron su
camion y lo dejaron en medio del campo. Hasta hoy, Sepulveda se
pregunta si de verdad eran policias.
 &HT;    Pero lo que si sabe, como muchos otros, es que en las carreteras
mexicanas no impera la ley.

primer sospechoso del delito, y recuperar su camion, hallado mas
tarde en Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Cuando al empresario Adolfo Juarez le robaron hace unos anos,
perdio US$100.000 en almendras en Ciudad de Mexico y otro
cargamento por el mismo valor. Sufrio un nuevo golpe en 1996 cuando
le robaron un embarque de bacalao por valor de US$120.000 en
Veracruz. Como es habitual en casos asi, la mercancia nunca se
hallo. Juarez se recupero de sus perdidas financieras pero afronta
altisimas tasas de seguro.
 &HT;    Las aseguradoras han tenido grandes perdidas con los cargamentos
robados y muchas se niegan a asegurar cargamentos, dice Arnoldo
Trevino, agente de seguros en Reynosa, ciudad de Tamaulipas, cerca
de McAllen, Texas. ``En la frontera los aseguramos, pero en el
interior no,'' dice. Agrega que las empresas que tratan de prevenir
los asaltos tienen mejores primas.
 &HT;    Despues de sufrir su tercer robo, Juarez decidio protegerse.
Contrato solo companias equipadas con tecnologia GPS, que determina
por medios satelitales la ubicacion de los camiones, y contrato a
empresas privadas de guardias de seguridad para que acompanaran sus
cargamentos. En mas de tres anos no ha perdido una sola carga.
``Por que no me roban? Porque tengo escolta,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Las firmas privadas de seguridad estan entre los pocos que se
benefician de la situacion. Companias como el Grupo Diamante de
Nuevo Laredo, han adquirido gran experiencia en la proteccion de
remolques que transportan computadoras IBM, cosmeticos de Estee
Lauder y otros articulos valiosos.
 &HT;    ``Es un servicio necesario debido a la delincuencia,'' apunta
Ricardo Hernandez, administrador del Grupo Diamante. ``No hay
suficientes policias para detenerlo. Y en muchos casos, son los
mismos policias (los que roban).''
 &HT;    A un costo de US$1.500, el Grupo Diamante envia tres guardias en
un Volkswagen nuevo que acompanan al camionero durante las 18 horas
que dura el viaje desde la frontera hasta Ciudad de Mexico, o
adonde el cliente necesite ir. Los guardias no pueden portar armas,
pero tienen algo mejor: comunicaciones.
 &HT;    Los guardias se comunican por radio con frecuencia a la base
para informar su ubicacion y se mantienen en contacto permanente
con el camionero. Cuando ven algo sospechoso pueden pedir a la base
que avisen a la policia.
 &HT;    Cada vez son mas las companias de camiones que equipan sus
vehiculos con tecnologia satelital. ``No elimina los robos, pero
facilita encontrar el camion y la carga,'' dice Garduno, de
Transportes Terrestres, que instalo un sistema GPS en sus seis
camiones tras varios asaltos.
 &HT;    Pero esa tecnologia excede las posibilidades de muchas empresas
pequenas. De los 300.000 camiones operados por miembros de la
camara de transporte de carga, solo unos 4.000 tienen equipo
satelital, dice Gomez, de la Camara.
 &HT;    Muchos camioneros optan por medidas de seguridad simples, como
viajar en caravanas o llevar un telefono celular. Los miembros de
sindicatos suelen intercambiar informacion sobre los caminos
peligrosos. ``Unidos, nos comunicamos mas,'' dice Damazo
Villafranca Cantu, representante de la Union de Transportistas del
Norte de Tamaulipas y dueno de una pequena compania de camiones.
``Cuando uno esta informado, puede trabajar con mas seguridad.''
 &HT;    Aunque mas companias adoptan la alta tecnologia, los clientes no
siempre pueden costear las medidas de proteccion y prefieren
mantener los precios bajos que contratar firmas de seguridad y
camiones con tecnologia avanzada.
 &HT;    La amenaza de los robos no supera la necesidad de mantener bajos
los costos, indica Luis Rivas, de Comercial Izadora, compania de
Reynosa que importa carne de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``Nuestros gastos generales serian tan altos que tendriamos que
elevar los precios,'' dice Rivas, al explicar por que la empresa no
invierte en tecnologia satelital ni en seguro contra robo.
``Tenemos que arriesgarnos porque no podemos alejar a nuestros
clientes.'' La compania de Rivas no ha sufrido un robo en tres
anos, dice.
 &HT;    Javier Flores no ha tenido tanta suerte. El joven de 23 anos de
Saltillo, Coahuila, solo llevaba ano y medio de camionero cuando
sufrio el primer robo.
 &HT;    Todo ocurrio en mayo de 1999, cuando Javier y su hermano, que
manejaba otro camion, transportaban hierro de Saltillo a Mazatlan,
Sinaloa. Al camion de su hermano se le pincho un neumatico en las
montanas de Sinaloa.
 &HT;    Cuando se detuvieron a repararlo, cuatro hombres armados con
pistolas salieron de un automovil, los amenazaron y se llevaron
rapidamente los camiones con su carga.
 &HT;    Tambien se llevaron la tranquilidad de Flores. ``Uno hace el
trabajo como siempre, pero con miedo,'' admite.
 &HT;    Los robos de camiones parecen ir en aumento, segun la Camara de
Transporte de Carga, que informo a principios de 1999 que los
asaltos aumentaron el 15 por ciento con respecto a 1998. El
problema causo tanta inquietud en la Ciudad de Mexico como para que
la Secretaria de Seguridad Publica creara una fuerza permanente de
patrullas en motocicleta para vigilar las principales rutas de
camiones.
 &HT;    Pero algunos dicen que la proteccion policial es como poner a
los ratones a cuidar el queso. Samuel Sepulveda, nacido en Jalisco
hace 40 anos y que ha pasado la mitad de su vida manejando
remolques, todavia no sabe quien robo su camion de cemento en 1994.
 &HT;    Iba hacia San Luis Potosi cuando dos hombres con el uniforme
negro de la policia federal judicial lo detuvieron y lo acusaron de
llevar cierto contrabando que no especificaron. Se llevaron su
camion y lo dejaron en medio del campo. Hasta hoy, Sepulveda se
pregunta si de verdad eran policias.
 &HT;    Pero lo que si sabe, como muchos otros, es que en las carreteras
mexicanas no impera la ley.

THE NET AT WHAT PRICE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AARON ZITNER   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States Supreme Court deeply honors its
traditions, but Lawrence Lessig, a clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia,
found one of them just too onerous to stomach. There was simply no
reason, Lessig felt, for the court to keep using an archaic
word-processing system like Atex.
</P>
<P>
   And so, working with several other clerks, Lessig used his
computer skills to install new software and write programs to meet
the special needs of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lessig's grasp of software could have a far bigger impact
on the Supreme Court _ and on the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 38-year-old Harvard law professor, Lessig has become one
of the most prominent commentators on law and cyberspace, thanks to
his academic writing, a column in the trendy magazine The Industry
Standard and a new -- and largely pessimistic -- book about the
future of privacy and free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's chief message is aimed at those who view the Internet
as some kind of democratic wonderland, a place of unfettered free
speech, business competition and creativity. Set the euphoria
aside, he warns. Government and industry are already stripping
privacy, free speech and other liberties from the Internet in order
to suit the needs of online commmerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe that the grounding for liberty
in cyberspace will simply emerge,'' he said. ``Quite the opposite
is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's profile has risen lately because of the respect he has
won from one man in particular: Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge
presiding over the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move late last year, Jackson asked Lessig to
provide guidance on one of the government's most important charges:
that Microsoft improperly merged its Web browser into the Windows
operating system. Lessig turned in a a 45-page brief that,
according to analysts, lays out a strategy for how Jackson can rule
against Microsoft and survive any appellate reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft and the US Justice Department made their final
court arguments on Feb. 22, Jackson asked several questions that
showed that the Harvard professor's arguments are already part of
his deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence Lessig's issues are the live issues of the day,''
said Thane Scott, who heads the antitrust practice at the Boston
law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge. ``He's at the confluence of big money
and big government, and there's no thinker quite at the top of the
pyramid like him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Lessig's goal was not just to comment on law but
to shape it as a politician. The son of a Pennsylvania steel plant
owner, the young Ronald Reagan fan headed the state's Republican
teen group. In 1980, he was elected a delegate to the GOP national
convention. While an undergraduate at the University of
Pennsylvania, he managed a campaign for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Lessig describes himself as a liberal. ``That
doesn't mean I'm any less skeptical of what government does,'' he
said recenlty by phone from Berlin, where is on sabbatical. ``I'm
concerned about the protection of individual rights.'' He decided
Democrats were more devoted to protecting those liberties than
Republicans. His politics made for lively debates when he clerked
for the famously conservative Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of battles at times. . . But it was great fun,''
Lessig recalled. ``There are obviously some issues we disagreed on,
but it was a lot of fun working with someone who took seriously
trying to get to the right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 graduate of Yale Law School, Lessig also clerked for
Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago. Now both men now have a special role in the Microsoft
case, with Posner working at Jackson's request to negotiate a
settlement between the company and the government. Lessig said he
had talked to Posner about Microsoft during an earlier case but not
since either man was pulled into the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig drew attention as a specialist in the new field of
cyberlaw in the mid-1990s, when he was teaching the subject at the
University of Chicago. His new book, ``Code and Other Laws of
Cyberspace,'' is only boosting his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The book is partly a rejoinder to the popular view that any
attempts to regulate the Internet will fail because the network is
so vast that no government can control it.
</P>
<P>
   The notion was famously summed up by Internet theorist John
Perry Barlow in a 1996 declaration of Internet freedom:
``Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh
and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind . . . You
are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we
gather.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig notes that the Internet is made up of software, and
software writers make deliberate choices about whether or not to
build anonymity, privacy, open access and free speech into the
online experience. As the Net evolves to suit the demands of
commerce, he argues, software writers and government will make
going online a more stifling journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frustrated me that people thought (civil liberties) would
just take care of themselves,'' Lessig said. ``What motivated me to
write the book was to get people to understand that there was
something to defend here.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, Congress has passed a broad law that makes it
illegal to build devices or software that defeat copyright
protections. And courts have used that law to rule against computer
users, even though they were not using the devices to make illegal
copies of tapes or movies. One set of defendants in a recent case
merely wanted to play DVD movies on their Linux computers, Lessig
said, which cannot play the discs without overriding copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig sees these developments as early steps toward a world
where movies, books and music are controlled even more than today.
Currently, a person who buys a book or CD can read it over and over
again or loan it to friends. But soon, Lessig predicts, people will
be charged every time they read a piece of text, or copy it, or
each time they listen to a piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   And just as they regulate copyrights, government and business
will control who can go where online. Because businesses need to
identify their customers by age and home state, Lessig predicts
that people will be encouraged to carry a ``digital ID'' with them
online, possibly built into their Web browsers. It may not be
illegal to go online without an ID, but people who fail to carry
one will be barred from so many Web sites that most will comply.
</P>
<P>
   When digital IDs become pervasive, companies and the government
will be able to control who can do what online. ``Cyberspace would
go from being an unregulable space to, depending on the depth of
the (digital ID) certificates in the space, the most regulable
space imaginable,'' Lessig writes. And because nations will enforce
each other's laws, people will find it impossible to evade the law
by operating overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig has been writing about the online world for several
years, but he has no idea how he came to Judge Jackson's attention.
He almost tossed out Jackson's request for help, thinking it was
one of the thank-you notes that judges send to professors who
recommend potential clerks. ``But it was the wrong timing'' for
that kind of note, Lessig said, and so he opened it.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, Lessig urged Jackson not to be afraid to
scrutinize the way Microsoft designs its software. Courts regularly
rule on the design of drugs, tires and other products in antitrust
cases, but somehow they are timid when it comes to software, Lessig
said. ``I believe it is a mistake to fetishize code in this way,''
he wrote, adding that software is too important to society for
courts to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig then took up the government's argument that Microsoft
illegally ``bolted'' its Web browser to its Windows operating
system. The government says Microsoft combined the two products so
that customers would have no reason to use browsers from a rival
company, Netscape Communications Corp. And if Netscape disappeared,
the government says, customers would lose out on the benefits of
competition between browser makers.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the government's argument is weak. They
point to a 1998 federal appeals court decision in a prior Microsoft
case that seemed to say the company could tie the browser to
Windows as long as consumers benefitted in some way.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, Lessig told Jackson that under the appeals court's
test, the government's charge would fail. But he offered a new
standard under which judges could look not only at whether
consumers benefit from a company's design decisions, as the appeals
court dictated, but also balance that against any possible harms.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so explicitly, Lessig was warning Jackson he
would be overturned on appeal if he found that consumers gained no
benefit at all from a combined browser-operating system, said
William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University in
Washington, who has followed the case closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody who is not a witness, for someone who is truly an
outsider, those 45 pages represent a big contribution'' to the
case, Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lessig says he is not optimistic about the nation's
ability to focus on how the Internet is changing and to debate
which civil liberties to protect. ``I would be grateful to be
proven wrong,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But he does have one suggestion: Publish the software code that
controls the Net so that everyone can see it, and prevent it from
being owned and kept secret by companies.
</P>
<P>
   A move to this so-called open source software would make it
easier for people to find ways to remain anonymous or express
themselves freely. Government and industry would find it harder to
build regulations into the software of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments like that have won Lessig a big following in some
parts of the software industry. ``He's a hero of mine,'' said
Robert Young, chairman of Red Hat Inc., a provider of the open
source Linux software. ``His gift is to take complex technology
issues and simplify them so they can be explained to the general
citizenship, and that's very helpful.''

SMART SWANK; FARBER'S PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So now that Hilary Swank has deservedly won the best actress
Academy Award for her devastating portrayal in ``Boys Don't Cry''
of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered after it was
discovered that he was actually a she, how long do you think it'll
be before the backlash begins?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way of our chew-'em-up, spit-'em-out culture. We
fall in love with a particular person, recommend their work to
everyone, and proclaim them as the best thing since frozen pizza
until they get too many awards (see Tom Hanks), and too much
acclaim (see Matt Damon), and then we turn on them like bad
mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet dollars-to-donuts that it'll happen to Swank, and
that would be a shame since she comes across in Interview as a
smart, thoughtful young woman more concerned with making art than
making money. Editor Ingrid Sischy caught up with Swank _
post-nomination, pre-Oscar coronation _ but she gets the full star
treatment with a come-hither cover shot, and several sexy photos in
which she _ with the help of Herb Ritts _ proves that she is most
definitely not a boy.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that is quickly becoming Hollywood lore, Swank
recalls strapping her breasts and packing a sock in her pants to
look more like a young man. But even more than looking male, Swank
was committed to capturing a deeper essence of Brandon Teena. ``I
realized as well that instead of playing how lonely it feels to be
treated differently, I wanted to play the joy of living your life
the way you want to. It's a beautiful love story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, maybe we won't turn on Swank after all.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the issue, teen singer Christina Aguilera assumes
all the obligatory pop tart poses _ a short dress with her legs
parted, her hands placed in provocative places, and lots o' belly
button.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Evelyn McDonnell accurately describes her as a ``Disco
Barbie,'' then slides into hyperbole about Aguilera's
better-than-Britney voice, which she calls ``a force to be reckoned
with, maybe even a supernatural force.'' Well, of course, she has a
good voice _ she sounds so much like Mariah Carey that Carey could
sue for plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Celia Farber has been one of the best AIDS
reporters in the country. She used to write the Spin magazine's
``Words from the Front'' column, a must-read for anyone with more
than a passing interest in AIDS and HIV. She earned devotees and
enemies as she distinguished herself by investigating such issues
as whether HIV causes AIDS, and whether AZT, the first approved
AIDS drug, was killing more people than it was saving.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after moving her column to the online magazine Iron Minds,
Farber has a sit-down with Richard Berkowitz in Poz to confront
those who still find her columns more dangerous than informative.
Says Farber, who seems always primed for a good battle, ``I no
longer give a damn about respect or credit from my peers. Why do I
need acknowledgment from a bunch of whores? Little do-gooders.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the ``bunch of whores'' Farber refers to are the
``legions of crisp-shirted AIDS reporters at the major newspapers
who churn out this `responsible' babble.'' Ouch. But Farber is
equally passionate about her dedication to the AIDS fight at a time
when the red-ribbon trendiness it once enjoyed has gone out of
style. ``I wanted to save people,'' she said. ``To crack the
mystery. To break new ground.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Before she was a first lady wannabe, Tipper Gore was trying to
save the world from artistic freedom with the Parents Music
Resource Center. That was the group who lobbied for warning labels
on albums they deemed offensive _ which, of course, only made those
records even bigger sellers. For Gore, public enemy No. 1 was
Luther Campbell, former leader of the Miami raunch-rap group, 2
Live Crew, which gave the world the immortal ``Me So Horny.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade removed from his First Amendment battles,
Campbell is still as nasty as he wants to be with CD and movie
``Luke's Freakfest 2000.'' But he's also a big golf fan(!) and has
been thinking a lot about presidential politics lately. In XXL, he
shows no love for George W. Bush (``I see a right-wing guy,'' he
says), and he's not feeling Al Gore either, believing Gore must
support his wife's censorship crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's interested in getting more young people to
participate in the voting process, and especially encouraging
rappers to use their community clout to make things happen
politically. ``Just imagine Rap-A-Lot rallyin' their people in
Texas. Three 6 Mafia and Memphis rallyin' their people,'' Campbell
said. ``P and Cash Money in New Orleans, Jermaine and Dungeon
Family in Atlanta, Dre and Snoop and them in California, Luke in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine all of us being responsible for our area and
bringin' people to the table.'' Hey, if the notoriously party-happy
Campbell, who never met a thong he didn't like, can spend more time
talking about ballots than booty calls, then it's easy to imagine
just about anything.

COMPANY DOESN'T GET ANY RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens all the time now: A company in an industry that has
fallen out of favor on Wall Street can't seem to get credit for one
of its business divisions in some other, more popular field.
</P>
<P>
   Typically it's an Internet or telecom unit buried inside an
otherwise unloved technology company. But our case of the moment
finds one of Boston's most successful mutual fund firms practically
printing money for its life insurance company parent.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Life Financial Services of Canada, based in Toronto, went
public last week, greeted by the same tepid market all life
insurance companies currently face. The company, founded in 1865,
went public at $8.50 per share and finished Tuesday at $9.1875.
That translates into a market value of about $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It got little, if any, boost from its ownership of MFS
Investment Management Inc., manager of $155 billion in mutual funds
and other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Will that situation lead to an initial public
stock offering by MFS itself? It seems like the smart thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   It might not happen overnight and Sun Life has been adamant
about holding on to a majority interest in MFS, but no one
dismisses the idea of a partial spinout of the investment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't surface that value in Sun Life stock over time as
we are currently structured, we would consider other options,
including the possibility of floating some minority piece of MFS,''
said Michael Hasley, senior vice president of finance at Sun Life.
</P>
<P>
   Comments by MFS executives on the subject are opaque, to say the
least, but we didn't hear any protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly deal with public companies all the time,'' said
MFS chief executive Jeffrey Shames. ``We think it would be an
interesting option.''
</P>
<P>
   MFS managers are hardly disinterested spectators in the debate.
They already own 20 percent of their company and Sun Life has
agreed to assign another 2 percent of equity to MFS managers this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind partial spinouts is simple: Get the stock
market to put a high valuation in the new public shares and the
real worth of the parent's majority interest will become obvious.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   But the current arrangement certainly doesn't work. Depending on
how aggressively you might like to value MFS's business, Sun Life's
stock price allows investors to buy the rest of the insurance
company on the cheap or for nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   MFS is such a valuable piece of Sun Life because it is growing
much faster than the rest of the parent company and profit margins
just keep getting better the more revenues rise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sun Life's 80 percent share of MFS revenues grew 40
percent to $1.3 billion. During that same period, comparable
operating profits jumped 65 percent to $129 million. Profits from
Sun Life's other leading business lines were flat or declined last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The question surrounding ownership of MFS resembles a similar
debate over the future of Putnam Investments, another Boston money
manager, a few years ago. Putnam was hot and the stock of its
parent, insurance brokerage Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., definitely was
not.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, talk of a Putnam sale was doused. The difference
now: MarshMac stock rebounded and trades at a premium today, and
subsequent financial deregulation has made the opportunity for a
publicly traded MFS greater than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An argument can be made that life insurance stocks will recover
in the future and there would be no need for Sun Life to create a
public stock for its investment management firm.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely scenerio is that Sun Life and another Canadian
life insurer, perhaps number one ManuLife Financial Corp., will
eventually be merged and a public MFS will give everyone involved
more attractive options.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   What color is your parachute?
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Group Inc., the struggling Boston money management
business that may be sold, signed ``executive retention
agreements'' with top managers last month while the company was
being shopped by investment bankers and attacked by one of its
largest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the agreements, detailed in a proxy statement filed this
week, offer executives three years of salary and full bonus (an
amount equal to 100 percent of base salary) if they get axed within
two years of any transaction. Pretty standard stuff, as 'chutes go.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive John Cogan, 73, was the lone senior manager who
declined to strap one on, according to the proxy. Nevertheless, the
company agreed to pay Cogan a $1 million fee ``upon the
consummation of a significant transaction involving the company.''
Nice work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan, who earned $575,000 last year, received no bonus because
Pioneer's performance was ``disappointing'' in 1999, according to
the proxy. But then the company promptly offered him 100,000 stock
options at December's nearly rock-bottom price of $14.9375 each, to
emphasize ``his focus on returning the company to profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Those options were worth about $744,000 on paper Tuesday.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY ENJOYING HIGHER PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women's college hockey will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Brown became the first university to begin a women's
ice hockey program 34 years ago, East Coast schools have dominated
the sport. Indeed, until three years ago, the ECAC champion won the
de facto national title as well: There was no need for a nationwide
tournament, because all the teams were in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Three seasons ago, the University of Minnesota
elevated its program to varsity status, and a four-team national
tournament was founded by the American Women's College Hockey
Alliance, a group under the auspices of USA Hockey that stepped in
to organize a tourney until there were a sufficient number of teams
_ 40 _ to warrant sanctioning by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   This season, a second league finally got off the ground, as the
Western Collegiate Hockey Association put five women's teams on the
ice, with quick expansion foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Saturday night at Northeastern's Matthews Arena,
Minnesota defeated Brown, 4-2, to become the first non-ECAC
national champion. Coupled with the rise to NCAA status beginning
next season, the victory kicks women's college hockey up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we showed in this tournament is there's some
great teams in the Midwest,'' said Minnesota coach Laura
Halldorson, still on the ice Saturday night as her team skated
around her in glee after the win. ``Certainly by expanding college
women's hockey outside the East Coast at this level, that's a very
positive thing for our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Although even Minnesota-Duluth coach Shannon Miller was quick to
acknowledge that the ECAC is still deeper and stronger
top-to-bottom _ her 25-5-3 Bulldogs, after all, won the WCHA
tournament but lost the national consolation game to Dartmouth,
which finished the season 21-12 _ Harvard coach Katey Stone said
the league should heed the wakeup call. ``I think it's wonderful
what's happening in the West, and the amount of money being put in
the sport is tremendous,'' said Stone. ``But the ECAC has been the
leader in women's hockey, and it needs to continue to be. It needs
to make a conscious effort to continue to look ahead to do
everything possible for our conference, for the betterment of the
game.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   All-around recognition
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Mosby hopes the best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of the University of Massachusetts gymnastics
team, Mosby last week was named a finalist for the American Award,
given to the nation's top women's gymnastics student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a huge honor for me,'' said Mosby, a native
of Lilburn, Ga. ``I was really suprised, because I was associated
with a lot of amazing gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   The award will be presented at the Awards Banquet in Boise,
Idaho, site of the NCAA Championships, on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mosby is preparing, as an all-around
competitor, for the NCAA Regionals Saturday at Penn State. The top
two finishers from each region advance to the NCAA Championships
April 16 (Mosby is in Region 5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little pressure because this is the end for me and I
want to perform well,'' Mosby said. ``I have been working on my
routines the last couple of weeks. Right now I am trying to clean
them up. At this point, there is no reason for me to add anything
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosby, who stands just 4 feet 8 inches, finished third in the
Atlantic 10 Championships, posting a career-best overall score of
39.375. Although she was dissapointed that she did not place
higher, she turned in an impressive performance, tying the
conference championship record with a 9.975 to win the floor
exercise and placing second on the vault with a 9.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not put any expectations on myself going into the (A-10
championships),'' Mosby said. ``I was very proud of my score
because I did as well as I possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She foiled the competition
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Purcell, a sophomore from MIT, won the women's saber
title at the NCAA Championships at Stanford last weekend. Purcell,
a gold medalist in sabre at the last Junior Pan-American Fencing
Championships in Brazil, defeated North Carolina's Kim Treiber in
the final after holding the lead throughout the tournament . . .
The Boston University women's lacrosse team slipped to 11th in the
Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association Division 1
poll after falling to No. 18 Vanderbilt, 9-8, in overtime Sunday.
Junior midfielder Chrissy Lombard is the Terriers' leading scorer
with 22 points (15 goals). . . . Fifteen members from the US soccer
team that won the Women's World Cup last year were among 30 picked
for the Olympic training camp by new coach April Heinrichs. The
team must be cut to 18 for the Sydney Games in September . . . The
US field hockey team tied Spain, 2-2, and is fourth in its
five-team group in qualifying for the Olympics, leaving the
Americans little chance of earning an automatic berth.

SPORTS COLUMN: 5 A.M. TREAT IN THE BIG APPLE: BASEBALL! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only the sixth inning and Craig Pearson still had 45
minutes before he was due in the office downtown at the World Trade
Center. This was opening day, or opening daybreak, on the big
screen, live. The subway and those commodities that Pearson would
eventually be trading would just have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have them play now than late at night,'' said
Pearson, 22, and fresh off the train at Penn Station. ``Now I'll
know the result at, what, 9 a.m.?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the final out of the Mets' 5-3 defeat to the Chicago
Cubs in Tokyo was recorded at 8:33 Wednesday morning, or 3 hours
and 26 minutes after the New York major league baseball season
began under the cover of darkness and when most fans were under the
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this being the mass transit system that never
sleeps, Ray Carrington estimated that three to four dozen fans
witnessed the historic first pitch of the 21st Century minutes
after 5 a.m. on the screens in the Long Island Railroad terminal at
Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington and his co-workers from the Audio Visual Workshop _
Michael Tibbs and Matt Bunn _ were not too impressed. He was more
interested in saying that he had been up at 1:30, and all set up
for the promotion run by the Mets and their broadcast partners, by
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even a Mets' fan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the dozens every minute, commuters rounded the corner, and
couldn't help but smile as they trained their eyes on the images
being beamed in from a domed stadium affectionately known in Tokyo
as The Big Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Most remained in stride, perhaps with visions of more
standard-size eggs, with potatoes and toast. Many stretched their
commuting time 15 or 20 minutes to have a look. And one Con Edison
worker, who shall remain nameless in order to avoid being jobless,
said, ``To tell you the truth, I was due out on the street 45
minutes ago. But this is so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets will surely survive one dome defeat, the country
won't crumble now that opening day, 2000, has been exported to
Japan. Among other critics, no less an impact hitter than Mark
McGwire has taken the opportunity to chastise the guardians of the
national pastime for shredding one of its grandest traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The longer McGwire expounded on the subject _ insisting that Our
Game ought to remain in Our Country _ the more it sounded like a
less strident variation on a certain left-handed reliever's theme.
Did McGwire forget that Our Game happens to be played now by
several Japanese and packs of Latin Americans, and those countries
relish seeing their homegrown stars?
</P>
<P>
   While the Japan Series is primarily in the interest of global
growth and a supplementary buck, it is also likely that more New
York baseball fans were literally dreaming of a Subway Series when
the previous Mets' season ended in Atlanta than when the Cubs' Rick
Aguilera retired the side Wednesday in the ninth, with the tying
run at bat. For schoolchildren typically forgotten during October _
not to mention newspaper columnists forever typing late into the
postseason night _ baseball with bagels is practically a concept to
die for.
</P>
<P>
   As for the diehards, the time zone that is incompatible with the
start of a noteworthy ball game has not been invented, witness the
4 a.m. line outside the ESPN Zone at Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Penn Station telecast that was open to the
sleepy-eyed masses, admittance to the Disney-spawned theme
restaurant was determined by contest, in a joint promotion with
WFAN. What a coincidence _ a few of the Mets' fans greeted at the
door by Joe Benigno in his Mike Piazza jersey were Benigno's
regular callers from his overnight show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prophet, it's me, Carlos,'' said one caller, recognizing
another, by voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos, I heard you tonight,'' Prophet said, embracing the
smaller man. ``Nice to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   Prophet came straight from his night work with his good friend,
Lenny from Queens, recently cited by Benigno in a magazine article
as the most distinguished caller of all. Lenny, actually a Houston
fan, wasn't quite in tears when Mike Hampton, the Mets' opening-day
starter who was acquired from the Astros, couldn't find the plate
and lasted only through the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three keys are Hampton, who must win 20, Derek Bell and
Todd Zeile,'' said Prophet, 51, and a Mets' fan from their
inception. Twenty-six years ago, he picked Ali over Foreman in
Zaire, and the round. Al Goodman was gone. Prophet was born.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny and Prophet took seats at the bar (the taps were wisely
turned off) in front of the oversize screen. The rest of the fans
settled in. The banter ceased with the first pitch of the pennant
race. Television camera crews made the rounds. Before taking a walk
down Broadway to Penn Station, Mr. Met _ the identical twin of the
Mr. Met in Japan _ took a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Mets fell behind. The festivities were forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have jet lag when they come back,'' Donn
Lloyd told his friend, Garvey Austin, who had worked late last
night, fallen asleep and come straight from the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time they lose this season, it's jet lag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long and winding season was under way. The Mets were 0-1. On
their way out, the fans didn't care about the time of day, and
weren't in much of a mood to give it.

PENN . COLLEGES CONSIDER ADMITTING TOP 15   PERCENT OF H.S.
SENIORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla., Texas)  By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 14 campuses of Pennsylvania's public college system are
considering a plan to increase minority enrollment by offering
admission to the top 15 percent of every high school graduation
class in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which is being discussed by a 30-member planning
commission that will report to the system's board of governors,
closely follows recent admission policies adopted in Texas and
Florida that replaced affirmative action plans. In contrast to
those plans, the Pennsylvania plan would continue using existing
affirmation action system.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption of the plan in Pennsylvania would mean that students in
some urban high schools who ordinarily would not be admitted
because their grades were not high enough could qualify because
they were in poorly performing schools and did well compared with
their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would not apply to the top-level state-related
institutions, which are not part of the system and have their own,
higher admissions requirements: Pennsylvania State University,
Temple University, the University of Pittsburgh and Lincoln
University.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions in the system that are considering the program
are in the state's second tier, former state teachers colleges that
have been upgraded over the years to state university status. They
are Bloomsburg, California, Cheyney, Clarion, East Stroudsburg,
Edinboro, Indiana, Kutztown, Lock Haven, Mansfield, Millersville,
Shippensburg, Slippery Rock and West Chester State Universities.
</P>
<P>
   Kenn Marshall, the spokesman for the 14-campus system, said
minorities accounted for 8.5 percent of the system's 95,000
students, as compared with 11 percent to 12 percent minorities in
the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the 15 percent plan was one of several proposals
to increase minority representation that were being considered by
the planning commission. That commission of business and community
leaders is to submit its proposals to the board of governors in
July for final decision. The board is made up of the governor, the
secretary of education, four members of the state Legislature, 11
appointees of the governor and three students with full voting
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of the move by the state college system, which was
reported Wednesday on the Internet page of The Chronicle of Higher
Education, represents another attempt by American colleges to
address the question of how to increase minority enrollment without
using programs specifically aimed at underrepresented racial
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In some of those cases, such as those in Texas and Florida,
there have been protests from minority groups that their
representation would be reduced through new laws eliminating
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state lawmakers replaced an affirmative action program
with guarantees that the top 10 percent of graduates from every one
of the state's high schools would gain admission to the state
university. In Florida, affirmative action was replaced by a system
that guarantees admission to state colleges to the top 20 percent
of each high school's graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   While in Pennsylvania each campus sets its own admission policy,
Marshall said: ``Our general policy is equal opportunity to all
applicants and preference in admissions, hiring and promotion to
members of minority groups. That would remain in place.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the admission of the top 15 percent of the
students from even poorly performing high schools did not create
the risk of admitting many unqualified students, Marshall said:
``That's always a possibility. But our chancellor, James H.
McCormick, has stated very clearly that it is our desire to provide
access to higher education to as many students as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pennsylvania State University, the flagship institution of
the state's premiere colleges, Dr. John Romano, vice provost for
enrollment, said it would not adopt a policy like that contemplated
at the second-tier colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard to build a student body that's diverse in
character,'' Romano said. ``But the system to automatically admit
the top 15 percent of any high school, that conversation has not
taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania State University has 75,000 students, Romano said,
of whom 11 percent are members of minorities.

CLINTON URGES CONGRESS TO ACT ON TRADE PACT, GUN CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out on his presidency, Bill
Clinton urged Congress on Wednesday to act on his top legislative
priorities, including normalizing trade relations with China and
approving gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Congress adjourns this summer we ought to be able to look
back and say we took real steps to make America better,'' Clinton
said during a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded questions for more than an hour on a variety of
domestic and foreign policy issues. He praised the decision by the
oil-producing nations to increase production and said he hoped the
latest spike in gas prices would prod Congress to approve measures
to promote development of alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighter side, Clinton said he did not want to get in the
middle of a debate raging in Britain over whether Prime Minister
Tony Blair should take paternity leave when his next child is born.
Although, he joked, he would have loved ``to be a fly on the wall''
when Blair and his wife discussed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Clinton appear defensive, when he said that
neither he nor Vice President Al Gore had knowingly done anything
wrong in regard to the fund-raising scandals during the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   With a new presidential election season already heating up, both
Clinton and congressional leaders realize that the window for
legislative activity will soon close.
</P>
<P>
   One measure Clinton wants Congress to consider soon is
normalized trade relations with China, an issue that has proved
dicey for congressional Democrats, who are being pressured by
unions to oppose the pact.
</P>
<P>
   The president expressed some frustration that he has faced
opposition within his party. He said the trade pact would open up
Chinese markets to a variety of U.S. ventures and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can just get everybody to read what this agreement does,
it will pass handily because this agreement will create jobs for
America; it will create jobs for organized labor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could undercut Clinton's ability to marshal
support for the pact, Gore has pledged that, if elected president,
he would change the treaty to ensure that China abides by
environmental and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that even if Congress approves the China pact
this year, Gore would still be able to negotiate labor and
environmental standards in the future.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, the congressional divisions are more along
partisan lines. Clinton accused Republican leaders of refusing to
hammer out compromises on a series of provisions, such as
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he does not agree with the National Rifle
Association's argument that the main problem is the
administration's unwillingness to enforce current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA's position is that if somebody does something wrong,
throw the book at them, but do not have any preventative measures
when it comes to guns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said applying the gun lobby's logic, airports would do
away with metal detectors and ``the next time a plane blows up,
we're going to throw the book at them.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stepped gingerly around the recent controversy
over police shootings in New York City, which has become an issue
in the Senate campaign between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Justice Department is reviewing the practices
of the department. And in a dig at Giuliani, Clinton said in many
cities ``there is ample evidence that the crime rate can go down
and the tenor of community police relations can go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was more eager to weigh in on the latest campaign
finance plan by Gore, who has proposed creating a $7.1 billion
endowment fund to pay for congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish I had thought of it myself,'' he said. But
Clinton bristled at the suggestion that Gore's admission that he
``was an imperfect messenger'' on fund-raising reform implied that
the administration had tried to bend the law .
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I disagree with that,'' Clinton said. ``He has never said
that he knew that any of the money that he raised was not lawfully
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he directed the party to make changes when he
realized the party had accepted illegal foreign money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong. And we did everything we could to correct it and
set it right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore is a ``good messenger'' for campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I think he was showing a little humility, and I
think that's always a good thing. We're all flawed in one way or
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also touched on a number of foreign-policy
concerns, including recent presidential elections in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he looked forward to working with Russian President
Vladimir Putin and said he had ``expressed a genuine commitment to
economic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also said that in recent Mideast peace talks
between Syria and Israel there had been no mention of sending U.S.
advisers, monitors or troops to the disputed Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he hoped the newly elected president of Taiwan
and the leaders of China would be able to begin a dialogue on how
to deal with future relations.

   Q. We retired in 1986 and own a home in Pennsylvania and a
townhouse in Arizona, where we spend up to five months a year. We
anticipate possibly another 10 years of longevity. In the past, we
considered purchasing long-term care insurance, but our current
plan is to accumulate money in a separate emergency account for
this purpose. We also plan to sell the Arizona property, should
either of us need long-term care. Our current position is 45.4
percent equities, 37.8 percent bonds, and 16.8 percent cash. All
dividends are reinvested. We'd appreciate advice about the
allocation. What would you do with the $43,000 cash currently in my
IRA?
</P>
<P>
   R.H., Center Valley, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your allocation of assets is fine. The only change I would
make is to move that $43,000 in your IRA from cash to a
fixed-income holding, probably an intermediate-term bond fund, such
as a GNMA offering.
</P>
<P>
   But your plan to self-insure when it comes to long-term health
care is very dubious. Long-term care insurance is so expensive
because the costs such a policy would cover can be astronomical.
They could be far beyond your likely accumulation in that emergency
account.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose both of you went a full decade before needing to tap
into that account. With a presumed 6.5 percent average portfolio
return and with contributions of $333 per month, you would have
$105,691. Alas, that can be an insignificant sum when compared with
some of the health-care costs that loom for people with serious
health problems. Even if you sold your Arizona home, that, too,
could be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Self-insuring for long-term health care is a luxury that can be
afforded only by mega-millionaires. For the rest of us, the
insurance premiums are onerous, but they represent the only
realistic way of facing up to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Seeking to retire with $2,000 monthly income from
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 53.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement accounts:
</P>
<P>
   --Employer: $103,000, 25 percent in domestic equities, 25
percent in international equities.
</P>
<P>
   --Tax-Sheltered annuity: $350 biweekly contribution, $80,000
balance, in New Perspective, EuroPacific Growth, and Investment Co.
of America funds.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I hope to retire in five years with a monthly income of
$2,000 from my savings. I have been adding $300 biweekly to my
tax-sheltered annuity and plan to add $50 to that payment. Where do
you suggest I put the additional funds? In addition to American
funds, the plan offers funds in the Fidelity family. My husband is
retired from the military and receives a $2,600 monthly pension,
$2,300 of which is used to pay our mortgage, which is due to be
paid off in 14 years. We have no other debt. How much do I need to
save so I can retire comfortably?
</P>
<P>
   R.L., Bonita, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should come pretty close, at least on paper. The trouble
is that making projections gets iffier and iffier as the investment
time frame shortens. When you get down to five years or less, I get
a bit nervous about using the 10 percent growth figure, with which
I am comfortable for a decade or longer.
</P>
<P>
   But on paper, if you achieved average 10 percent portfolio
growth, both within the retirement account and the tax-sheltered
annuity, and if you contributed $758.88 a month (which is what $350
biweekly works out to), you would amass $359,734 after five years.
If we presume that in retirement you could then move your savings
to fixed-income accounts yielding a portfolio average of 6.5
percent, you would need about $370,000 to produce that desired
$2,000 monthly income stream.
</P>
<P>
   So, as I said, you'd be pretty close. But if the vagaries of the
markets were such that you achieved only 8 percent portfolio
growth, the accumulation would be only $328,302. You need to bear
in mind that at this stage the internal growth of your retirement
savings should far exceed the value of your contributions, so the
projected growth figure is pretty important.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, and because using even the 10 percent growth
figure you fall a little more than $10,000 short of the target, I'd
suggest that you think in terms of retiring in five or six years _
or even seven if you encounter sour markets. If the markets are
kind to you, it might turn out that you do indeed reach the desired
pool in five years, but I wouldn't suggest you set yourself up to
be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Just to give you an idea of where you would end up if you
delayed retirement: If you kept saving at the current rate and
earned 8 percent returns over seven years, the accumulation would
be $404,723. If you followed the same assumptions but inserted a
projected 10 percent growth rate, the pool would be $459,065 after
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   I tend to throw cold water on the idea of putting all of your
retirement money to work to produce an income stream, with nothing
left aside to protect you against the likely inflation of the later
years of retirement. But in your case, you have an extra element _
that military pension that is now paying the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   After eight or 10 years of retirement, the mortgage will be paid
off, freeing up a significant monthly income, some of which could
be used to improve your income stream and deal with higher costs of
living, with the rest saved in stock accounts to deal with
inflation. You also could improve the situation by consigning the
entire military pension check of $2,600 to the mortgage, thus
prepaying it by $300 a month and bringing the payoff date closer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as to where to invest that additional $50 you will be
putting away every two weeks for the next five years or so, if all
of the Fidelity funds are available to you under the plan, my
suggestion would be Fidelity Select Health Care fund. This is a
little riskier than the funds you are now using _ after all, it's a
sector fund, and the pharmaceutical and health care equipment
companies on which it focuses are expensive stocks. But it has
excellent long-term growth prospects and could supply the spark in
your portfolio that allows you to reach your target in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Is it time to take on some risk?
</P>
<P>
   Age: 74.
</P>
<P>
   Investment: $70,594 bank IRA at 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A bank financial specialist has been urging me for months to
reinvest my IRA CD in stocks or annuities. I'm not sure of the
mutual fund family name he mentioned; I think it was Evergreen. I'm
not sure investing in stocks or annuities is as risk-free as a CD.
</P>
<P>
   C.F., Allentown, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right _ investing in stocks or annuity accounts that
are invested in mutual funds carries a vast amount of risk when
compared to buying a government-insured bank CD. And if you are
uncomfortable with the prospect that you might lose money by
changing from the CD to a fund account, you should politely say no.
</P>
<P>
   If the fund family is indeed Evergreen, one factor you should
consider is that if you decide to try funds, you will pay some sort
of sales charge, either up front or when you cash out, or through
annual charges called 12b-1 fees. For most Evergreen funds, the fee
is 4.5 percent (and more in some cases) if you choose to pay at the
outset. If you paid a 4.5 percent fee, that would represent a
little more than 9 months interest on your CD.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the fact that you seem so vague about what the banker
is offering leads me to believe you would be best off sticking with
CDs.

 &HT;    Jackson wants `honorable' deal in Coke suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson is scheduled to meet this
morning with Coca-Cola officials for the second consecutive day as
he attempts to persuade them to quickly settle a racial
discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If there is not an ``honorable settlement'' soon, Jackson said
Wednesday, he will participate in a bus ``ride for justice'' to the
company's annual shareholders meeting in Wilimington, Del., on
April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come April, either the buses will roll or justice will roll,''
Jackson told reporters following a two-hour meeting with top
Coca-Cola officials at their Atlanta headquarters. He said he had a
``positive meeting'' with Chairman Doug Daft, President Jack Stahl,
Executive Vice President Carl Ware and Vice President Ingrid
Saunders Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed with Jackson's assessment of Wednesday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very constructive conversation with Rev. Jackson,''
said Ware, who serves as co-chair of the company's Diversity
Advisory Council, along with Stahl. ``The Coca-Cola Co. has had a
long-standing relationship with Rev. Jackson and, as always, we
value his insights and perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke has provided financial support to Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Jackson has maintained a low profile on the case,
although he has sent two letters to the company in support of the
plaintiffs since the suit was filed nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with former and current African-American employees
organizing a three-bus convoy to the Wilmington shareholders
meeting, as well as rallies along the way in Greensboro, N.C.,
Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C., Jackson decided to take a
public stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is in Coke's corner,'' Jackson said. ``Coke should
choose an honorable settlement over a protracted fight.''
</P>
<P>
   He highlighted four essential ingredients for reaching an
agreement with the plaintiffs:
</P>
<P>
   _ A fair financial settlement in the case.
</P>
<P>
   _ No retaliation against workers for being involved in the
current action.
</P>
<P>
   _ Empowerment of someone at the company who can transform its
corporate culture with regard to its treatment of African-Americans
and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   _ A plan to include minorities as business partners, including
suppliers, lawyers, investment managers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said a settlement could be reached before court-ordered
mediation talks take place on April 17 and 18, which would be after
the buses started to roll on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is reached, he said, ``mediation is moot.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Jackson said a settlement would stop the buses, the
chief organizer of the protest ride made no such commitment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm taking three buses to Delaware,''
said Larry Jones, a former Coca-Cola human resources manager who
has spent the last 10 days organizing the trip. ``Our agenda hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was one of 500 people laid off last month as part of
the company's restructuring, was unequivocal on this issue _
before, during and after Jackson's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that more than 50 people have signed up to ride the
buses, which he says will transport about 150 former and current
employees. He also said about $9,500 of the $60,000 needed to pay
for the buses and lodging has been raised for the April 15-20 trip.
</P>
<P>
   But several company observers said Coca-Cola should try its best
to stop the buses from rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Company efforts to resolve this issue quickly need to be
galvanized,'' said Scott Wilkins, an analyst with Deutsche Bank.
``The last thing this company needs right now is bad PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with the company on Wednesday, Jackson spent
Tuesday night talking with about a dozen former and current
African-American employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some workers worked for 10 to 12 years without promotions,''
Jackson said he was told. ``This is a crisis that can be turned
into an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
represent about 2,000 current and former black employees in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed the
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it's in the company's best interest to settle the
suit, partially because blacks represent 25 percent of its consumer
base.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson did not talk about a possible boycott of Coke
products, Jones has said that is an option if a settlement is not
reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his relationship with Coca-Cola dates back some 20
years, when he negotiated with the company to open up its doors and
markets to include more talent and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of those meetings, he said, ``Carl Ware was put on
the leadership track. ... Ware has a significant position now _
maybe 10 years after he earned it.''

EPA ANNOUNCES PLAN TO CONTROL DDT CONTAMINATION SITE IN PACIFIC
OCEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking the first steps toward controlling the
largest known site of DDT contamination in the country, the
Environmental Protection Agency plans to cap parts of the deposit,
which lies deep in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California
coast near Palos Verdes Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million pilot program, which would focus on four areas
within the 17-square-mile site, was announced Wednesday as the
agency unveiled a separate $22 million plan to raise public
awareness about the contamination and provide tools to enforce
fishing bans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really huge environmental problem in Southern
California,'' said Keith Takata, director of the agency's Superfund
division for the region that includes California.
</P>
<P>
   The DDT came from Montrose Chemical Corp. in Torrance, Calif.,
which was once the world's largest producer of the pesticide DDT,
Takata said. The company manufactured DDT from 1947 to 1982. Its
use in the United States was banned in 1973. Until 1971, the EPA
said, Montrose discharged high levels of DDT into waste water
lines, which then flowed seven or eight miles into ocean outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean site is also contaminated with PCBs, polychlorinated
biphenyls, which were discharged through municipal sewer pipes.
Both chemicals are suspected of causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decade-long ban on commercial fishing in the area and
efforts to warn the public about the danger of eating fish caught
there, contaminated fish are still being found in markets, the EPA
said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of markets in 1997 by Heal the Bay, a local
environmental group that monitors water quality and beaches, found
that 85 percent of the 130 samples taken exceeded the EPA's
acceptable risk level for DDT contamination, said Mark Gold,
executive director of Heal the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Gold applauded the EPA's increased attention to the area, but
called the effort ``long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's plan, which is subject to a public hearings, would
provide money for two wardens to be on duty around the clock,
increased public outreach and education and further monitoring of
contaminant levels in commercially sold fish. The actions, which
would be in force for 10 years, would be interim steps as the EPA
continued to evaluate how to best address contamination off the
Palos Verdes Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The site is one to three miles off the peninsula between Point
Vicente and Point Fermin. The continental shelf and an adjoining
slope 100 to 300 feet deep are polluted.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1992 and 1993 found
DDT-contaminated sediment from about 2 inches to 2 feet thick, with
the highest concentration in a 3-square-mile band near the sewer
outfall pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation is estimated at 110 tons of DDT and 11 tons of
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA hopes to diminish the effects of the deposit by capping
at least parts of the site with sand and sediment. But scientists,
environmentalists and a lawyer for Montrose have questioned the
action. There is concern that such a move might not be effective
and that it might smother marine life or stir up the deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't evaluate what they're going to do in this pilot
program,'' said Stephen B. Weisberg, director of the Southern
California Coastal Water Research Project, an agency of local and
regional officials monitoring ocean water quality in the region.
``There are a variety of unknowns. They include amongst others: Can
they physically get the material in place and get it to stay there
without disturbing the existing sediment?''
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg, who resigned from a technical advisory committee for
the project because he believed it was ineffective, said more
scientific review was necessary before the EPA proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   While officials have capped contaminated areas underwater
before, they have never done so at such depths or over such a wide
area. EPA officials said the purpose of the pilot program was to
provide more information about how sediment would best be
deposited, how much would be necessary and the feasibility of
covering a large area.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest natural-resource damage cases in the nation
is being waged over the site, with federal and state agencies
seeking about $170 million in damages for cleanup and restoration
from Montrose and five other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Lytz, a lawyer for Montrose, did not return a phone call,
but he has been quoted as calling the EPA's plan unnecessary and
wasteful.

&HT;     PANEL HEARS CALLS FOR MEDICARE COVERAGE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and key Republican and
Democratic lawmakers urged Congress Wednesday to broaden Medicare
to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, they
differed on how to fund the program, who should be covered and
whether it should be passed before Medicare itself undergoes a full
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the witnesses' differing proposals, Committee
member John Breaux, D-La., said, ``We've got to quit hearing and
start writing (legislation). We have a very, very narrow window of
opportunity'' to pass a bill. He was referring to the fact that
Congress' session will be shorter during this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides health care for more than 39 million elderly
and disabled Americans. It does not cover prescription drugs
although about two thirds of Medicare recipients have some type of
outside drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Because of rising costs, some experts say Medicare will go
bankrupt by 2015. President Clinton and many lawmakers have
proposed ways to keep the program solvent longer, but none of the
plans is expected to pass this year. However, polls show that the
prescription drug proposal has considerable support among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., said Congress must make
prescription medicines available for those with little or no
medical coverage regardless of whether Medicare itself is
restructured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act this year to help the poorest and sickest
beneficiaries obtain prescription drugs,'' he said. ``These
vulnerable individuals should not have to wait any longer for the
assistance they so desperately need.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, which oversees Medicare, said Congress should also
revamp the whole program this year. He noted that Clinton's plan
would extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund until at least
2025 and make prescription drug coverage available to all
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said only prescription drug
legislation is ``realistically'' possible in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said she feared Clinton's overall
plan would limit patient choice and competition among medical
providers, which she said keeps down costs.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said their own plan, which
would fund prescription drugs outside of Medicare, would provide
immediate drug benefits and keep down spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Frist argued that drug benefits not linked to Medicare
risked runaway costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., also advocated drug coverage
within Medicare. Disagreeing with Bilirakis' plea to offer coverage
to poor people first this year, Kennedy urged that such coverage
should be available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla, said, ``To deny
prescription drug coverage in today's times is almost ludicrous,''
but he said Medicare overhaul is necessary too.

AN UPSTART GOVERNOR TAKES ON JAPAN'S MANDARINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ If any politician was ever going to try to break the
central government's hold over almost all aspects of even local
governing, the most likely candidate has been the crusading
shoot-from-the-lip governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
   For a man whose political career has been fueled by provocation
and controversy, he had a relatively quiet first year as governor
of one of the world's biggest cities. There had been a
uncontroversial proposal to impose strict pollution controls on
diesel vehicles, for example.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been talk about somehow ridding Tokyo of the
black crows that noisily haunt its streets, systematically ripping
through trash left outside for collection. Ishihara suggested crow
pie.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has grave fiscal problems, in part because of the
national economic downturn. In a jam, Ishihara's populist
inspiration was to soak the banks, one of the least popular
institutions, along with the government, in this society enmeshed
in a long financial crisis. The banking system was recently given a
$73 billion bailout from the national government.
</P>
<P>
   And so the uproar over his proposal to begin taxing the largest
banks with headquarters in the city on April 1, to a total of $1
billion a year, has shown that the governor's first months in
office were merely the quiet before the storm. Coincidentally or
not, the expected revenues almost match the size of the city's
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus has little to do with the banks or any other narrowly
defined policy matter, and everything to do with a creeping
revolution in which local governments are flexing their muscles and
speaking up.
</P>
<P>
   For the provinces, Ishihara's tax proposal resembles a sort of
Boston Tea Party, the first dramatic crack in a system
euphemistically called administrative guidance, under which the
central government decides everything from budgets to road projects
on behalf of the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara seems eager to be at the forefront of the movement for
local control.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara, 67, a prize-winning fiction writer and a former
transportation minister, has clearly returned to the spot that he
most enjoys, the center of unrelenting political and media
attention. Members of the City Hall press corps say he exultingly
refers to his proposals as kamikaze, or a divine wind, and finds it
difficult to suppress the characteristic smirk he wears when things
are going his way.
</P>
<P>
   The last time so much fuss was made about him, in 1989, Ishihara
had just published his best-selling anti-American screed, ``The
Japan That Can Say No.'' Now, to the endless irritation of Tokyo's
bureaucratic mandarins, he is showing the traditionally powerless
prefectures, and their residents, they can say no, too.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the central government officials who decide on
matters large and small looked around desperately for anything in
the law that would allow them to stop Ishihara's plan. When they
found no legal way to stop him, executives of the big banks and the
people who regulate them took to calling the governor names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil,'' is one epithet that has frequently been used.
Eisuke Sakakibara, the former deputy finance minister who was
Japan's candidate to lead the International Monetary Fund, and one
of the few other public figures known for speaking his mind,
recently compared Ishihara to Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying he is a right-wing dictator, but that's what
his tactics remind me of, and I'm worried,'' Sakakibara said.
</P>
<P>
   What is most worrisome to those fighting to preserve control
over Kasumigaseki, the area of the city that is home to the
national ministries, is that the movement for local control is
spreading. Other localities have rejected government-supported
nuclear-power projects and huge dam-building plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not really at war with the national government, but the
direction is toward change and destroying the central authority,''
Ishihara said in an interview in which he discussed his ambitions
at length. ``In order to do that, we don't need to drop a bomb on
Kasumigaseki. We need to make them aware that the real needs of the
people and what the government is doing are really far apart from
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara has always seemed obsessed with Japan's direction and
place in the world. In the financial bubble years of the 1980s, he
reveled in excoriating Americans for their racism and urged the
United States to become used to learning at the knee of an Asian
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   For the new century, with his country locked in a 10-year slide,
he has a new diagnosis and a new prescription. Japan has no worthy
political leadership, no real intellectual or political debate and,
worst of all, no direction. Unsurprisingly, the tonic he offers _
with his favorable public opinion ratings soaring into the 70s _ is
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English historian Toynbee said that the biggest cause of a
country's decline and eventual disappearance is the inability to
make decisions,'' Ishihara said. ``That is exactly the condition
that Japan finds itself in. The decision-making process in Japan
takes forever, because people shun responsibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, under Ishihara's brash leadership, Japan would not
have that problem. The trouble, some caution, is that with a figure
so impish, the country would have plenty of new troubles, instead.
Already, Ishihara conducts his own parallel foreign policy of
sorts, for example mischievously inviting the Dalai Lama and the
departing president of Taiwan to Tokyo, drawing stern warnings from
China.
</P>
<P>
   Others warn of a troubling streak of emotional nationalism and
an association with militarist causes throughout his career. ``He
advocates the revision of the Constitution and associates himself
with people who are extremely dangerous,'' a prominent Japanese
commentator, Makoto Sataka, said. ``Then there is the matter of his
style, a top-down approach that neglects the details. Also, I would
say that he doesn't regard himself with a very critical eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara brushes off criticisms of his nationalism and openly
longs for a strong Japan that honors the values of old. ``There are
no more samurai in Japan,'' he said. ``You could use another word,
tough guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would lead a revival, he spoke almost like a
cowboy. ``I had that ambition once,'' Ishihara said. ``But I see
the sun is setting, and the road is long.''

 &HT;    TENSIONS RISE IN MIAMI AS DEADLINE ON ELIAN APPROACHES
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With tensions rising and officials warning the city may
explode in protest, the showdown over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez neared a climax Wednesday as a key deadline approached.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the drama was a report that Cuban leader Fidel Castro
planned to allow Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to come to
the United States to retrieve the boy. It was not immediately clear
if the trip would take place.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials repeated
their warnings that they would revoke Elian's parole at 9 a.m. EST
Thursday unless his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, agreed in writing
to hand the boy over to federal officials if the family loses its
court battle to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Lazaro Gonzales continued to meet with federal
officials but had made no such promise, said a family spokesman who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Elian would not be immediately removed
from Gonzalez's home if his parole were revoked, although the
removal might take place within days.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzalez huddled with INS officials, more than a hundred
protesters milled outside his Little Havana home, chanting, praying
and vowing to form a human chain to stop federal officials from
taking the boy away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to show the world that we're united and that we're
not going to allow Elian to go back to Cuba,'' said Hortensia
Prado(cq), one of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, a convoy of dump trucks chugged down the narrow
streets of the neighborhood, horns bleating to the cheers of the
protesters. The drivers vowed to block all the streets leading to
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local officials lashed out at Attorney General Janet
Reno and President Clinton, warning that Miami's Cuban exile
community may burst into angry protests if Elian is removed before
his court appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're provoking the community,'' Miami-Dade County Mayor
Alex Penelas said of Clinton and Reno. ``They keep pushing and
pushing the envelope and when it explodes, no one is going to be
able to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a noon press conference, Penelas and 20 other local officials
vowed that local police would make no effort to assist federal
officers should they try to remove the boy before his court case is
finished. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also issued a statement saying no
state officers would assist, either.
</P>
<P>
   After critics said the mayor was essentially inviting the
community to protest, Penelas issued another statement saying
police would not tolerate disruptions in the streets, such as the
ones that erupted in January after the initial decision by federal
officials that Elian should go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to the comments at a Washington news
conference by saying, ``I like the mayor very much but I believe in
the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the city appeared on the brink of some sort of
outburst, immigration officials repeated Wednesday that even if the
9 a.m. deadline comes and they revoke Elian's parole, they do not
plan to immediately go the Lazaro Gonzales's home and forcibly
remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obligation is on them,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
said in a television interview. ``They have said they intend to be
law-abiding, and we are relying on them to be law-abiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug of war
since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on
Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their
boat sank as they fled Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of
his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian
should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family then filed a federal court suit to challenge
the federal decision and to request an asylum hearing for the boy,
but last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them. The family
then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
which on Monday set oral arguments for May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the complicated standoff is the fact that since he
was rescued at sea, Elian has been legally in the custody of Reno.
Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore
the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that she would allow the appeal to be heard, but
has insisted that Lazaro Gonzalez sign a statement promising to
voluntarily turn Elian over if the family loses the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite edging up the pressure on the family, federal officials
have said they are reluctant to forcibly take the boy against the
family's will. But the family seems adamantly opposed to turning
the boy over until all legal channels have been exhausted,
including a possible hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's
exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the
never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. The boy has been the
subject of poems, paintings and an almost religious fervor, with
some people recently flocking to a bank near Lazaro Gonzalez's home
where a figure has appeared in a glass window that many believe
resembles the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Such intense feelings left worried police officials planning for
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great concerns that I can't see a peaceful resolution
to this situation,'' said Miami Police Chief William O'Brien.

<P>
   In a discovery boosting prospects of finding Earth-size worlds
beyond the solar system, astronomers have for the first time
detected planets apparently smaller than Saturn that are orbiting
other Sun-like stars.
</P>
<P>
   Using the world's largest ground-based telescope and refinements
in their search techniques, the American astronomers found
compelling evidence of two relatively small planets around separate
stars a little more than 100 light-years away. The orbits of the
planets are so close to the host stars that scorching temperatures
there rule out the existence of life or liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new findings, the discovery team and other
scientists said Wednesday, the search for extrasolar planets
crossed a new frontier of expectations. Of the 30 such planets
detected until now, all have been the size of Jupiter, the solar
system's giant, or much larger. This raised nagging questions: Were
all these true planets? Did this undermine the prevailing theory
that planets form by a snowball effect of growth from small ones to
large bodies?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were thus reassured to learn that in other planetary
systems there are worlds the size of Saturn and smaller, perhaps
many of them. Now they suspect that it will be only a matter of
time and improved technology before Earth-size worlds will be
detected in other planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests there are going to be many, many more planets
out there that are small,'' Dr. R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie
Institution in Washington, one of the discoverers of the two
Saturn-class planets, said Wednesday at a news conference at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Heidi B. Hammel, an astrophysicist at the Space Science
Institute in Boulder, Colo., who was not a member of the discovery
team, predicted that in a year or two extrasolar planets with the
masses of Uranus would be discovered. In the solar-system
hierarchy, Jupiter's mass is 317 times that of Earth, Saturn's 95
times, Neptune's 17 and Uranus' 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely critical step towards finding
terrestrial-type planets,'' Hammel said. ``We are pushing
boundaries that we have not pushed before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since extrasolar planetary exploration began,
Butler and Dr. Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at
Berkeley have been the most successful at it. They conducted the
most recent observations at the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, in
Hawaii, using an improved spectrometer developed by Dr. Steve Vogt
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. NASA and the
National Science Foundation supported the research.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers did not actually see the planets. They monitored
slight wobbles of the host stars as they responded to the
gravitational pull exerted by planetary objects near them. The
minimum mass of a planet and its orbital time and shape were
calculated from these gravitational perturbations.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Marcy and Butler determined the presence of a
planet at least 80 percent the mass of Saturn orbiting 3.8 million
miles from the star HD46375, 109 light-years away in the
constellation Monoceros. Being so close to its star, the planet
takes only three days to complete an orbit; that is a full year. An
extremely hot year it is, with temperatures averaging 2070 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   The other planet was detected orbiting the star 79 Ceti, also
known as HD16141, located 117 light-years away in the constellation
Cetus. Its mass is estimated to be 70 percent that of Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Because this object was farther away from its star, about 32.5
million miles, it took the astronomers longer to be sure that they
were indeed observing a planet and could calculate the time and
shape of its orbit. Though they were reasonably sure by last
August, they said they waited to collect more confirming data
before announcing the Ceti planet. Marcy said they were still
tracking another Saturn-class object before making any definitive
statements.
</P>
<P>
   From their observations, Marcy said, the Ceti planet travels an
extremely lopsided orbit, compared with the more neatly circular
orbits of the other newly discovered planet and all the members of
the solar system. Each orbit takes 75 days, and the planet follows
a course that would be equivalent to moving inside and outside of
Mercury's path around the Sun. Like Mercury, it is blasted by heat
up to 1500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers said their discoveries so far were mainly
confined to the immediate vicinity of stars, where planets would be
close enough to have a pronounced gravitational effect on their
host stars and complete orbits in a matter of days or months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a planet took more than four years to orbit a star, we
haven't been looking long enough'' to be sure it is a planet, Marcy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcy-Butler team accounts for 21 of the 30 extrasolar
planetary discoveries until now, and as Marcy noted, ``We've never
made a false claim, and we are proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by the most recent discovery, Dr. Alan P. Boss, a
theorist of planetary evolution at the Carnegie Institution, said
he could foresee ``the incredible number of other planets we will
be finding as the search techniques are improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised to find Saturn-size planets, Butler
responded, ``I would have been more shocked if we hadn't found
smaller and smaller planets.''  &QL;

MORE PROGRESS REPORTED IN DECODING KEY OF HEREDITARY INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium of universities engaged in decoding the
human genome has accomplished two-thirds of its preliminary goal,
Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate the public consortium is on track to complete a
rough draft of the genome by the end of June, Collins said. If so,
the consortium's version of the genome would probably be available
to researchers before the more finished version being promised by
its private competitor, Celera Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the genome, the DNA molecules in which the human
hereditary information is inscribed, is expected in time to
transform medicine by revealing the genes that make the body
vulnerable to disease.
</P>
<P>
   The rough draft, by the consortium's definition, will constitute
90 percent of the genome with an error rate no worse than 1 in
1,000 among its component chemical units.
</P>
<P>
   The rough draft will fall well short of a finished, complete
sequence but should still prove valuable for researchers because it
will contain most of the human genes, even though some will be in
bits and pieces. The public consortium, Collins said, has now
decoded 2,178,076 DNA units, or about two-thirds of the expected
total. Altogether the human genome contains about 3 billion units
of DNA, packaged in the form of 23 chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's rival, Celera, is decoding the human genome by
a different method and has said it will publish its sequence only
when it is almost fully assembled, sometime later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Celera said that in January it had decoded 2,580,000 DNA units,
putting it roughly at the stage the consortium has now reached. Dr.
J. Craig Venter, the company's president, has said the material
being deposited by the consortium in Genbank, a publicly accessible
Internet data bank, is in the form of fragments that cannot be
further joined together and whose position on their parent
chromosomes is largely unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Lipman, director of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, confirmed that the public consortium's
data are mostly in the form of short fragments about 10,000 units
long and that the site of each fragment on its chromosome is
roughly but not always precisely known.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the disjointed nature of the fragments, ``A lot of
what people want to do can be done with draft sequence _ people
will find it very useful,'' Lipman said.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium thus seems on track to achieve the goal it
announced after Celera entered the race, producing a quick rough
draft containing most human genes in a form useful to researchers.
Celera may or may not have decoded more DNA data by the end of June
but its equivalent product will not be publicly available.

TORNADO LEAVES TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION IN DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Although at least three people died and 100
were injured Tuesday evening when tornadoes swept through downtown
Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the most common sentiment
expressed here Wednesday was relief that more people had not been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a tragedy of monumental proportions. We
have sidestepped a major disaster,'' Lt. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas
said after surveying the damage Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials searched Wednesday to see if any more bodies were in
the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's streets were littered with debris, and battered
buildings, demolished automobiles and downed trees marked the
blocks-wide swath of the twister that sliced through the city.
Trees still standing near the city's center were stripped of leaves
and covered with dangling shards of building insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs of warehouses were thrown into the street.
Tractor-trailers were tossed about. The roof of one church had
collapsed and the facade of another's steeple was stripped away to
reveal twisted steel girders.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, fighting massive traffic snarls and hazardous
conditions created by debris that drifted down from damaged
high-rise buildings, sealed off about 2 square miles of the city's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a very dangerous situation,'' said Police Chief
Ralph Mendoza. ``We could have 200-pound pieces of glass dropping
from some of these buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people died in collapsed buildings in Fort Worth. Two
motorists were swept from their automobile into the Trinity River
by flood waters at the edge of downtown Fort Worth. The body of
only one had been recovered by late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Coash, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a forecasting
firm in Wichita, Kan., said the destruction was a result of
separate twisters in Fort Worth and Arlington that remained on the
ground much longer than usual for such storms.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and weather forecasters said that early warning
of the impending storm, and the fact that most downtown workers had
already returned home for the day, had played a major part in
limiting the loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who was filling in for Gov. George W. Bush, who was
campaigning in the Northeast, said that he had spoken to the
governor earlier Wednesday and that they both wanted to express
``heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth and
Arlington, a disaster area Wednesday morning and has sent a request
to the federal government for a disaster relief, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth residents spent Wednesday surveying the damage and
reliving the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Gearhart, 23, had been waiting with his roommate for a
Dallas Stars hockey game to begin on television in his apartment
when, he said, ``Everything started to get really dark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Papers started flying down the street, and we could see banks
of clouds swirling and intertwining above us,'' Gearhart said.
``When big chunks of wood started blowing past, we hit the
stairwell to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The twister split into two funnel clouds just west of his
apartment building, Gearhart said, and both leapfrogged past and
hit the 35-story Bank One building down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank One just got mauled,'' Gearhart said.
</P>
<P>
   This was to have been opening day for the Nostalgic New Orleans
Apartments, an eight-unit building that Brett Thomas and his
brother Mark had worked six months to restore. Instead, they spent
Wednesday picking through the wreckage left of their project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first ad ran in this morning's paper,'' Brett Thomas said,
as he sat on a chimney that had blown off a building across the
street. The roof of his two-story building sagged, and broken glass
littered the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The twisters struck near sundown, moving from the west to the
southeast through downtown Fort Worth, retreating into the sky to
drop down again in Arlington, 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Gehren said the funnel passed about two blocks from her
house. ``The power went out, and my husband had just managed to get
the garage door closed when the wind picked up and we started
hearing explosions,'' Gehren said. ``I started screaming and didn't
stop until it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people remained without power Wednesday, according
to Pat Nichols, a spokeswoman for the major electric supplier in
the area, Texas Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, still scrambling to respond to the disaster,
said it was too early to say exactly how much damage had been done
in financial terms or how long it would take to recover from the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Terrell, Fort Worth's city manager, said a preliminary
survey by his staff had found 52 commercial structures damaged and
eight buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn., was struck by a similar storm in April 1998
that killed one person and did $200 million in damage. Billy
Fields, coordinator of that city's Tornado Recovery Board, said it
would probably take Fort Worth three or four years to rebound from
the tornadoes.

 &HT;    BellSouth to offer tracking stock for Latin American unit
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. announced plans Wednesday to create a
tracking stock for its Latin American businesses, a bold move aimed
at raising billions of dollars that could be used to expand that
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as AT&AMP;T prepares its own blockbuster public offering for
a wireless tracking stock, the BellSouth plan is meant to get
investors to see the unit's solid growth and potential.
</P>
<P>
   By separating Latin America from the rest of BellSouth _ if only
on paper _ the company hopes to set its market value free from the
doldrums that have beset the mother company.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's operations would be unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   What could be dramatically different is the company's market
value.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock has for the past year traded within a fairly
narrow range, even when many technology stocks were surging
skyward. Yet $25 billion-a-year BellSouth has within it several
businesses that would _ the company believes _ be highly valued if
they were on their own as ``pure plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the aim of a tracking stock: to unlock the market value
of a unit within a company without spinning it off.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was that BellSouth was preparing to issue a tracking
stock for its wireless operations. But BellSouth and SBC began
talking about combining their wireless units, perhaps also allying
their international businesses or going all the way to a complete
merger.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth Chief Executive F. Duane Ackerman has long been
adamant that the company means to thrive on its own. In announcing
its own Latin American tracker, BellSouth has put some muscle
behind that intent.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials Wednesday declined comment on their filing,
citing concern about violating federal restrictions against hyping
a stock before an IPO. The public offering will come later this
year after review by federal regulators and approval by
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's filing makes clear that the company sees Latin
America as a big market.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has operations in 10 countries that have more than 6
million customers and last year produced $2.4 billion in revenue.
Growth potential is enormous, especially in wireless, where
BellSouth has most of its Latin American money. About eight of
every 100 people has a wireless phone compared to rates of about 40
percent in the United States and twice that in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, millions of people in the region have no phone service
at all and only a tiny handful are linked to the Internet.
BellSouth's filing cites analysts who predict yearly growth of 28
percent in the number of wireless customers in Latin America, 21
percent in wireless revenues and 16 percent in overall
telecommunications revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has issued a tracker for its wireless business, and that
stock has far outpaced the performance of the parent company's
shares. AT&AMP;T last fall announced plans for a wireless tracker, and
this week said it hopes to raise more than $13 billion when the
stock is issued _ which would make that public offering more than
twice the size of the previous record holder, UPS, whose IPO raised
$5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, no other telecommunications company has tried issuing a
tracker for one geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's tracker will include all the company's Latin
American businesses _ from wireless to Internet _ but leave the
company free to manage its U.S. wireless business separately.
</P>
<P>
   How much could a BellSouth tracking stock be worth?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said the Latin American group is worth about
$14 billion, but BellSouth has not yet set a price, a decision that
will come later. The filing sets a goal of $1 billion to be raised
by the IPO, but the company has plenty of time to modify that, too.
The company is mum on the question of how many shares will be
issued, and what proportion of them will be sold publicly.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has licenses covering 176 million people in Latin
America _ roughly equivalent to the U.S. population covered by AT&AMP;T
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, saw its stock gain about 10 points _ the
equivalent of roughly $35 billion _ after announcing plans for its
wireless tracking stock, noted analyst Anthony Ferrugia of A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Co. ``You can't extrapolate from that to BellSouth, but I
would expect some incremental increase.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the announcement, BellSouth stock climbed
about $2.375 a share, finishing the day at $47.25, up $2.125 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   With the tracker, BellSouth surrenders nothing, retaining
control of operations while waiting to reap a multibillion-dollar
bonus, Ferrugia said. ``I would say that BellSouth has an excellent
presence in South America and they know that trackers have been
getting very good valuations lately.''

 &HT;    Anti-crime measures considered at close of NFL owners meeting
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The NFL closed its annual owners meeting
Wednesday without adopting a new discipline policy for players who
commit off-field criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   But tougher penalties might not be too far away.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, other league officials and a
handful of coaches met for more than two hours Wednesday to discuss
the issue. Tagliabue presented a two-page list of proposals,
including more education for players and stiffer discipline for
those who break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep talking to the Players Association and
we'll keep having our internal discussions,'' Tagliabue said.
``(The meeting) focused on goals and it focused on issues. There
were very positive feelings about the programs we have in place.
The challenge is not to get frustrated. It's to continue educating
our players.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Henderson, the NFL's executive vice president of labor
relations, co-chaired the unprecedented panel discussion. Henderson
said a toughened anti-crime policy could be in place after the next
league meetings in Baltimore in May.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile incidents involving NFL players in recent
months prompted the self-examination. Baltimore Ravens linebacker
Ray Lewis will go on trial in May for the Jan. 31 murders of two
men outside a Atlanta nightclub. Carolina Panthers receiver Rae
Carruth is charged with plotting the murder of his pregnant
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue imposed a policy on violent crime in 1997. Under that
plan, players who are charged with criminal acts undergo a
mandatory clinical evaluation and possibly counseling. If players
are convicted of crimes, they can be fined and suspended. A second
conviction can lead to expulsion from the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly the American public is fed up,'' Patriots
owner Robert Kraft said. ``They're sick of it. We in the NFL need
to be mindful of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the solutions discussed at Wednesday's meeting were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Identifying players deemed ``at-risk'' for problems and
requiring them to undergo counseling before they enter the NFL.
Those players would enter the league under probation and would face
stiffer penalties if convicted of crimes. Some players who have
more questionable pasts might be required to wait one or two years
before entering the league.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating support groups within each team consisting of veteran
players who would serve as mentors for younger players. The groups
might also include an assistant coach, trainer or security
official.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren established a six-man veterans
committee last season. Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said he will
consider adding such a group to his team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating standardized interviews and background checks for
prospective players, instead of the individual teams conducting
them at the combine workouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asking military leaders to serve as security consultants in
locker rooms. NFL officials pointed out that the military meshes
personnel from diverse backgrounds, much as pro football does.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever solutions are adopted, most owners agreed that the
league needs to be active earlier. And at least one owner suggested
it might be time to stop taking chances on players with
questionable pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a policy, at least in the last four to five
years,'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said, ``that we're very concerned
about taking guys that have had problems in college, and I believe
that's a very good policy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's all in the name for ABC's Thursday lineup. At the
beginning of this season, the network offered up a little dud
called ``Wasteland,'' which disappeared promptly enough.
``Wasteland'' lived up to its title, and, amazingly enough, so does
``Wonderland,'' debuting tonight. It's a grim, frantic, unruly and
at times obtuse production, but it's also, no doubt about it,
pretty amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' was created by Peter Berg, who starred in
``Chicago Hope'' and wrote and directed ``Very Bad Things'' (which
also lived up to its name). His concept here is pretty simple:
``ER'' set in a mental institution and shot in the
drunks-manning-the-Steadicam, documentarian manner of ``NYPD
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg does not appear in the show, but as a consolation he has
assembled the best cast of actors you've never heard of. Character
actor Ted Levine stars as Dr. Robert Banger, who heads the forensic
psychiatry department of a New York public hospital, and therefore
deals with crazies who have run afoul of the law; he's also going
through a messy divorce and custody battle. Martin Donovan, a
veteran of filmmaker Hal Hartley's verbiage-fests, plays Dr. Neil
Harrison, who works with Banger and (just barely) heads up some
group therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's married to Dr. Lyla Garrity (Michelle Forbes), who
runs a psychiatric emergency program and is having issues with her
pregnancy. When a basket case who thinks he's Zeus (Leland Orser)
guns down five cops and causes a ruckus at the hospital that
endangers the health of Garrity's unborn baby, it's discovered she
had denied him medication a few days earlier _ medication that
might have prevented the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland's'' multiple narratives are dense and fractious
and, as is often true of pilots, the material is piled on furiously
_ you may be sympathetic when a character repeatedly shouts out,
``Can we turn down the volume?'' And since it deals with the
mentally ill, the stories invariably are going to be tinged with
tragedy. The show whistles along, but not with ``ER's'' calculated
slickness; it's a little more frazzled in its storytelling,
presumably mirroring its subject matter. In its own way,
``Wonderland'' is as visceral in its milieu and sliding-scale
morality as HBO's ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong performances from Levine, Donovan and Forbes all
evince a decency that is being ground down by impossible daily
pressures. Even the guest stars dazzle, including Jay O. Sanders as
a suicidal spurned lover and, in next week's episode, Lenka
Peterson as an elderly woman who virtually explodes in apoplectic
rage at the mere thought of her husband. And, here and there, are
disarming little touches that keep the show compellingly watchable:
At one point, apropos of nothing, a patient watches with mute
delight while a miniature rhinoceros roams amid his huaraches.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's what I think of the show; here's what ABC thinks:
It's thrown ``Wonderland'' opposite the juggernaut that is ``ER''
without so much as a courtesy run in a less competitive time slot.
Which means audiences are unlikely to find the show and, if they
do, they're unlikely to be able to suss out everything that's been
going on when they do. Unless ABC does the show a favor, it's
likely to be gone by May sweeps. It's a little shocking the network
isn't trying to help out a show of this verve and energy a little
more; after all, it can't live off of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' forever, can it? &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The show: ``Wonderland.'' &QL; 
Drama set in and around a mental institution. &QL; 
The stars: Ted Levine, Martin Donovan, Michelle Forbes. &QL; 
Where: ABC (Channel 7). &QL;

SENATE REJECTS PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO PROTECT U.S. FLAG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate rejected a proposed constitutional
amendment Wednesday that would have banned the burning or
desecration of the U.S. flag, but supporters insisted they would
reintroduce the measure until it passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of this amendment is inevitable ...We know we don't
have the votes here today, but sooner or later we're going to get
this through,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said shortly before the
Senate failed by a 63-37 vote to muster the two-thirds majority
needed for passage of a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ended three days of politically charged debate over the
amendment designed to challenge a 1989 Supreme Court decision
striking down flag-protection statutes in 48 states as a violation
of free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat marked the third time in a decade that supporters had
failed to muster the 67 votes necessary to approve the amendment.
In 1995, it failed by three votes.
</P>
<P>
   The House, meanwhile, has passed it three times, the most recent
in June. But the amendment must be approved by both houses of
Congress before it can be sent on to the states for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized opponents
of the measure, as well as the 1989 Supreme Court ruling, for what
he called their ``fundamental misunderstanding of the nation's
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``ludicrous'' to interpret desecration of the
flag as free speech when most ``patriotic'' Americans consider it
to be a ``repugnant'' form of expression that should be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American flag is a sacred, basic, fundamental symbol of
our nation's freedom,'' Lott said, adding that it should be treated
respectfully as if it were one of the country's most valuable
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to the heart of who we are as a people and as a
nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W. Va., said that while the flag may be
the ``symbol of our nation's values,'' it does not warrant
protection by tampering with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love that flag. But we must love the Constitution more,''
Byrd said, referring to the 209-year-old document as ``the thing
itself,'' that the nation's democratic principles are built on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe it belongs in our Constitution ... because I
believe that many instances of flag desecration can be prosecuted
under general laws protecting public and private property, laws
which do not require any constitutional amendment,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that flag burning, in his view, is ``only a rare
occurrence,'' and protecting it with a constitutional amendment
would only give ``attention seekers who defile the flag the
opportunity to defy the Constitution as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's opposition to the amendment surprised Hatch, chief
sponsor of the measure, who had been counting on Byrd to help
convince wavering lawmakers to support it. Going into the debate,
Hatch believed he was only one or two votes shy of the 67 he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's opposition marked a reversal from his past stands on the
issue. He has voted in favor of it twice before, and his decision
not to back it a third time may have swayed other senators who
often look to him for guidance on constitutional matters.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to oppose the amendment, Byrd said he went against
the prevailing sentiment in his state and that his decision had
caused him ``greater anguish'' than any other he has made during
his 41 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that after careful study, he had concluded a flag
amendment could not be justified because it would extend rather
than narrow the power of government and would not protect any
``basic civil right'' guaranteed under the Constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mindful that he is running out of time to reach
deals with Congress, President Clinton called on Republicans on
Wednesday to work with him on a wide range of issues including gun
safety, the addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare and
regulation of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Republicans in the House and Senate were stalling
or playing politics with many issues he considers to be his
priorities, and he portrayed himself as eager to ring up real
accomplishments in the relatively short time left in the
legislative calendar of his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want action, and they deserve it,''
Clinton told a news conference in the East Room of the White House.
``The only thing left is for the congressional leadership to reach
across party lines and to work with us to break the grip of special
interests and do the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton offered no concessions on any of the issues he
brought up, and left the impression that his idea of compromise was
for the Republicans to give in. And he did little to dispel the
feeling among Republicans that he is more interested in provoking
confrontations that can be used to the advantage of Democrats in
the campaign than he is in getting legislation signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less than 10 months remaining in his administration, Bill
Clinton faces a very clear choice,'' Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
House Republican whip, told reporters on Capitol Hill. ``Does the
president want to exploit political issues or does the president
want to help us implement effective solutions?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans themselves face much the same choice. Some of them
favor reaching accommodation with Clinton on a few issues to
insulate themselves against the inevitable charge from Democrats
that they oversee a do-nothing Congress. Other Republicans are
convinced that the best strategy is to push through bills that
reflect their agenda, even if they draw a veto, in an effort to
send a clear message to voters as they fight to regain the White
House and retain control of the House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as Clinton tried to increase the pressure on Republicans on
domestic issues, he continued his efforts to work with them to win
approval in Congress for what is perhaps his top goal this year,
bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the trade agreement, reached in November after
long negotiations between Beijing and Washington, ``a
100-to-nothing deal'' for America, because the United States lowers
no tariffs and opens no markets, while China must do both. He also
defended the deal on national security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But he bristled at criticism from organized labor and many
liberal Democrats that his negotiators should have included labor
standards and goals for environmental improvement in the accord.
Clinton is struggling to convince Democrats, especially in the
House, to support the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we had a bilateral trade agreement,'' he said,
differentiating a country-to-country deal from an agreement to make
China a full member of the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own negotiators said last year that the talks were a
bilateral accord. China, however, has made it clear that it
considers labor and environmental issues beyond the scope of the
WTO, and refused to negotiate on those issues. Vice President Al
Gore, in comments that were interpreted as less than enthusiastic
about the WTO deal, said earlier this year that, if elected
president, he would try to negotiate a tougher agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised both President Jiang Zemin of China and
Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian. Chen, whose party has
called for Taiwan's independence, has backed away from that
position in carefully worded statements since his election 11 days
ago. That has defused tension with China, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference, which lasted an hour and 15 minutes, was
the second held by Clinton this year. He appeared relaxed as he
discussed the stalled Middle East peace talks, the presidential
election in Russia and his delight that his 20-year-old daughter,
Chelsea, still enjoys traveling with him despite having reached an
age when many children do not want to hang out with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Clinton appear to get a bit riled, when he was
asked whether he and Gore had played fast and loose with campaign
finance rules in raising money for their 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as appalled as the next person when I found out that we
had taken funds, that people had given us money that wasn't
legal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Gore ``was showing a little humility'' this
week when he described himself as an imperfect messenger for
campaign finance reform, in part because of the controversy
surrounding the vice president's fund-raising appearance in 1996 at
a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he liked Gore's idea of establishing an endowment
to help fund general elections as a way of diminishing the
influence of campaign contributions in politics. And he said
Congress would function better if members of both parties did not
have to spend so much time raising money.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out his domestic agenda for the rest of the
legislative year _- which will be shortened by the eagerness of
members of Congress to go home and campaign _ Clinton stressed his
desire for passage of gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Congress to pass his request for $300 million in new
funding to help reduce gun violence through an array of initiatives
including faster and more comprehensive background checks on gun
purchasers and the hiring of new prosecutors on the local, state
and federal level to prosecute gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And he demanded that the Republican leadership move forward on a
gun-related bill that has been bottled up since in a House-Senate
conference. The legislation would tighten rules on the sales of
guns at gun shows, require child safety locks on handguns and ban
the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the opponents of reform have run out of arguments,
so now they're just trying to run out the clock,'' Clinton said.
``The argument is over. Gun safety measures do work and do not
interfere with the interests of ordinary hunters and sports
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to see movement on a bill, already passed
by the House, giving patients more rights in dealing with health
maintenance organizations. He criticized Republicans for attaching
a $123 billion package of tax cuts to legislation that would
increase the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15, over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The president repeated his longstanding request for more money
for school construction and modernization. And he urged Congress to
respond to a recent Supreme Court ruling that the Food and Drug
Administration does not have the authority to regulate tobacco as a
drug by passing legislation that would give the agency that power.

 &HT;    Census staff ensures homeless not left out
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nine people were hidden under a bridge in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was hours before dawn and they were covered with
layers of blankets, the homeless people were cooperative and polite
to the census workers who interrupted their rest with flashlights
and questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, who told a reporter his name was ``just Harry,''
said he didn't mind that census takers had come to question him
while he was in bed, because he hadn't gone to sleep yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laid down,'' Harry said.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Wednesday, between the hours of 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.,
census workers wearing orange vests searched nationwide for people
living under bridges, in abandoned buildings and in secret spots
sheltered by bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Their instructions were to take basic information from any of
the street people they found _ name, race, gender and age. The
address on the form was the address of their campsites. Census
workers were warned not to wake anyone, not to press if someone
didn't want to answer questions, and to leave if there was a chance
of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials did not demand a full name if a homeless
person, like Harry, did not want to provide it, or offered only a
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are stressing the importance of finding the homeless
this year because an estimated 2 percent of the nation's people
were not counted 10 years ago; many were street people. The
undercount cost states and local communities billions of dollars in
federal funds, distributed based on population, for community block
grants and education, transportation and social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, 1,000 census takers were dispatched Wednesday, 690
in metro Atlanta. Spokesman Lance Robertson said the teams were
everywhere _ downtown Atlanta; Marietta, where there were dozens of
``pockets''; around Six Flags Over Georgia; and behind a restaurant
in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they do not know yet how many homeless people
were counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' a nervous Eric Cathcart said
moments before he followed other census takers through a hole in a
chain-link fence to the place where Harry and his friends were
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating boulders on the dirt embankment that led to a
3-foot-high passage under the bridge, 12 census workers filed into
the place Harry and his friends have called ``home'' for eight to
10 years. Shabby mattresses were spaced for privacy, and a rusted
barrel served as a stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. Good morning,'' the census workers announced.
Then one muttered, ``Watch out for rats.''
</P>
<P>
   No one complained that they were awakened. Several suggested the
easiest way for the workers to get back to their cars from under
the bridge. A couple pointed the way to the sleeping area of
homeless people who were not connected to their community.
</P>
<P>
   One census worker gave $1 to the man who had just answered the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a mile away, two women and two men were found
at the home they had built by positioning a shredded mattress and
abandoned sofa around a trash can that contained a fire. One of the
men was breaking up a headboard from a bed, using it for firewood.
</P>
<P>
   He left when the census workers walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, y'all,'' a woman shouted from beneath her covers
on the bed. ``Give me some money for some breakfast. You. With your
brown eyes. Y'all are going to have breakfast, aren't you? Give me
some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Change was handed over and the census workers turned to leave
when she shouted sarcastically, ``Take my telephone number so you
can call me up.''

HEALTH CARE SUPPLIERS TO FORM ONLINE EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INSURERS-ONLINE) 
(Eds.: `Lyn' cq in last graf) 
(cjl) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five big health care companies, which account for about 70
percent of the equipment, drugs and other supplies bought by the
nation's hospitals, said Wednesday that they planned to form an
online exchange that would provide information about products and
enable customers to place and track orders.
</P>
<P>
   The companies _ Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Baxter International Inc.,
Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic Inc. and GE Medical Systems, a unit
of General Electric Co. _ say the exchange's purpose was to cut
hundreds of millions of dollars out of the costs that they and
their customers incur while handling the drudge work of processing
orders. Although customers would continue to negotiate prices with
individual manufacturers, they would use the exchange to place
orders under previously negotiated contracts, check on the status
of orders, arrange delivery, check supporting documentation and
learn more about products.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which will own equal shares of the exchange, say
they expect little opposition from regulators. They are not banding
together on prices, and they are inviting all other medical
suppliers to join. ``There will be a firewall so that we can't even
see each other's prices,'' said Miles White, the chief executive of
Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The five companies are still in the process of hiring the
exchange's managers and putting the finishing touches on its
software. They expect the exchange, which will be based in Chicago,
to go online in the United States this summer and to expand
globally next year.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange will be a free service for customers. It will be
financed by fees from participating suppliers, including the five
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never take this entity public, because we don't want to
have to maximize profits for shareholders,'' said Jeffrey Immelt,
the chief executive of GE Medical.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur D. Collins Jr., Medtronic's president, added, ``The CEO
of this exchange will be gauged on how efficiently he can move
large volumes of transactions and how well customers are satisfied,
not on earnings per share.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies do stand to benefit financially in more
ways than just cutting costs. Numerous Web-based exchanges,
including Neoforma.com, MedCenterDirect.com, Promedix and
Broadlane, already offer health care customers one-stop shopping
for medical products. Those companies take their fees from
suppliers. By forming their own exchange, the five companies avoid
such fees.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on prices remains uncertain. Over the last decade,
many hospitals have formed powerful buying coalitions that have
forced prices for medical supplies way down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this exchange can help the hospitals lower their
transaction costs, it could alleviate the pricing pressure the
suppliers are under,'' said Michael Weinstein, a medical products
analyst at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend lately is for huge purchasers in concentrated
industries to form online buying coalitions. The automotive and
retail industries have both announced buying consortiums, and just
Wednesday, 15 utilities said that they would form a buying
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Efforts to buy and sell on the Web always seem to lead to
lower prices for buyers at the vendors' expense,'' said Mike
Krensavage, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   If the hospital groups put their own consortium on the Web,
their negotiating power could increase exponentially. And even if
they do not, hospitals could tap into the buying services offered
by the myriad of dot-com companies that offer such services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is two-thirds of the reason we can negotiate
low prices,'' said Matthew Lekstutis, a senior vice president of
EDS CoNext, an online procurement service.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange may be particularly useful to small hospitals that
are still processing many orders by hand. ``We're certainly not as
automated as we could be, so putting all this on the Web can be
really useful,'' said Lyn Moore, director of health information
management for the Covenant Health System, a network of four
hospitals in Lubbock, Texas.  &QL;

THIS TIME, THE SEX PISTOLS' POINT OF VIEW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Ken Tucker is critic-at-large for Entertainment Weekly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in ``The Filth and the Fury,'' the new documentary
about the British punk-rock band the Sex Pistols, the group's
endlessly quotable lead singer John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten)
observes that the group was ``a bit like a Harold Pinter play: it
shouldn't work, but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the movie that Julien Temple has
assembled from footage of the band in performance, along with new
and archival interviews with the band members, their supporters and
their detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon, the drummer Paul Cook, the guitarist Steve Jones, the
bassist Glen Matlock and Matlock's replacement, Sid Vicious, were a
band for little more than two years, and they recorded exactly one
album, ``Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,''
released in 1977. It sold poorly in an America then dominated by
the Bee Gees and the Eagles, but immediately went to No. 1 in
England.
</P>
<P>
   The Sex Pistols' existence was brief, and alternately thrilling
and appalling. The brevity was due in no small part to the group's
incessant internal bickering and to its insistence, closely
documented in the new movie, on turning the usual show-business
promotional opportunities into expletive-filled assaults that would
have been unsuitable for broadcast even if mass America had been
interested in seeing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This band wasn't about making people happy,'' Lydon says in
the film; ``it was about attack _ attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this guarantees that, nearly a quarter of a century on,
many who go to see ``The Filth and the Fury'' (which is playing at
the Film Forum in Manhattan will be experiencing the spectacle of
the Sex Pistols for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   As the film makes clear, the Sex Pistols existed not to have a
career so much as to have an impact _ to release an invigorating
blast of poisonous gas into the clean, crisp air of the '70s
pop-music industry. Using footage of Laurence Olivier in ``Richard
III'' like a hiphop DJ uses record beats, Temple replays the
wretched king repeating two words of Shakespeare _ ``deformed,
unfinished'' _ over and over.
</P>
<P>
   He intercuts this filmic stutter with other images: scenes of
the Sex Pistols bashing convincingly through Jonathan Richman's
two-chord masterpiece ``Roadrunner''; shots of the shaved-headed,
safety-pinned, ragtag fashion statements the band inspired among
its young fans; and Lydon's assertion of the Pistols' ultimate
effect: ``People who had no self-respect suddenly started to view
themselves as beautiful in not being beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A fair percentage of the movie contradicts such positive
conclusions. The group is seen being boringly loutish on a British
talk show, an infamous appearance that inspired the newspaper
headline that provides the film's title; Vicious, we are reminded,
died of a heroin overdose in 1979 after stabbing to death his
girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, everything about the Sex Pistols turns on
contradiction. They were anti-rockers who claimed to possess little
musicianship, yet they created some of the most exciting rock
recordings ever, including ``Anarchy in the U.K.,'' ``God Save the
Queen'' and ``Pretty Vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistols' behavior was consistent only in being
unpredictable: When this writer interviewed Lydon, who was sitting
on a bed in a ritzy Los Angeles hotel room in 1978, soon after the
group's breakup, the singer answered questions with polite
directness; but he stopped abruptly and leaned over the side of the
bed to vomit vigorously onto the floor to make a point about how
disgusted he was by rock-star excesses. Then he resumed the
conversation as if nothing surprising had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' is actually the second documentary
Temple has made about the band, and it stands in polar opposition
to the first, ``The Great Rock &AMP; Roll Swindle'' (1980). ``Filth''
uses Lydon's contemporary commentary to cast the Pistols as
heroically trying to expose hypocrisy in the music industry and in
the government, while ``Swindle'' presented them as know-nothing
puppets, the creation of their manager, the former boutique owner
and self-styled anarchist Malcolm McLaren, who in that movie went
so far as to refer to ``an invention of mine they called punk
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Sex Pistols: were they puppets or prophets? And how
could the same director present both notions with equal conviction,
two decades apart? The production notes for ``The Filth and the
Fury'' explain the disparity by saying that Lydon, who had feuded
with McLaren from the start of their business relationship, refused
to participate in the making of ``Swindle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Lydon sued McLaren and won ownership of the group's
master recordings and of Temple's footage. In ``Filth,'' Temple is
obliged to give Lydon his revenge, with the singer referring to
McLaren only as ``the manager'' and calling him ``evil.'' ``He had
no control over us,'' Lydon says.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Filth and the Fury'' is far more engrossing than
``Swindle,'' it's not because it clarifies any of the
behind-the-scenes history. Temple evinces no point of view, no
convictions; he sides with whoever's holding the film cans. But
Lydon in ``Filth'' is a far more articulate and entertaining
character than McLaren was in ``Swindle.'' It's not only that
Lydon's observations are more sociologically pointed (describing
the Thatcherite policies he sees as the source of punk's
philosophical despair, he says of his contemporaries, ``You would
not be capable of questioning your future because you didn't have
one'').
</P>
<P>
   The stage performances in ``Filth'' showcase one of the most
charismatic figures in rock history. Lydon's slicing vocals have
the sharpness of a buccaneer's sword, and he holds the stage like a
pop-music Captain Ahab. (``He hung onto the mike,'' wrote Greil
Marcus in a Rolling Stone review of the band's final concert, on
Jan. 14, 1978, in San Francisco, ``as if he were caught in a wind
tunnel, about to be blown off the stage.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' is a hodgepodge of self-justifying
memories; a compromised, often slapdash history of a band that
insisted rock was dead even as its own music resuscitated the form
for millions. In other words, it's a movie that shouldn't work, but
it does.

U.S.-JAPAN TIES HONORED IN A ROOM WITH A PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ There was a history to the elegant room at the U.S.
Embassy Residence, where Henry Aaron, Lou Brock and Ernie Banks
gathered Wednesday in a celebration of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same reception hall where Emperor Hirohito visited
Gen. Douglas MacArthur on Sept. 27, 1945, only 25 days after Japan
had surrendered on the U.S.S. Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a victorious general meeting a defeated emperor, this
time Japanese and Americans saluted the modern sporting heroes,
Sammy Sosa and Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, wearing a dark suit, and Piazza, wearing a leather jacket,
presented their respective team caps to Ambassador Thomas A. Foley.
Practicing the diplomacy that made him speaker of the House for
part of his 30-year stint in Congress, representing the Spokane
area of Washington, Foley alternated both caps for a photo
opportunity and said, ``I'll wear them both.''
</P>
<P>
   The three current Hall of Fame players and the two future Hall
of Fame players were walking on the same floor where Hirohito had
walked the entire 70-foot length to where MacArthur waited, an
obvious symbol of the new relationship between the nations. At the
end of the meeting, MacArthur had a military photographer take a
picture of him with the emperor, who was many inches shorter,
another indication to the world of the status between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the theme was the peaceful, even joyous, link
between the two nations. Banks gave a very snappy salute to U.S.
Marines attached to the embassy. One of the Marines, Sgt. Clint
Joseph from Brooklyn, got Banks' autograph and never mentioned to
Banks that he is a diehard Mets fan _ another sign of modern
diplomacy in this historic reception room.

NASDAQ DOWN AGAIN AS TECHNOLOGY STOCKS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks sent the Nasdaq stock market to the
biggest of three consecutive losses Wednesday as more investors
abandoned recent market favorites for the perceived comfort of
General Electric and other household names.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index shed 189.22 points, or 3.9 percent,
to 4,644.67.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in terms of points was the biggest since March 14,
and the percentage loss, 3.91 percent, was the biggest since March
20.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who as a group have been heavily overweighted in
technology, have become increasingly nervous about stretched
valuations. In addition, on Wednesday there were reports that one
of the biggest hedge-fund operations, Tiger Management, has decided
to close, and ``the news on Tiger Management clearly precipitated
some rotation out of these higher-momentum areas,'' said Christine
A. Callies, chief U.S. strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
This pall over the market was in spite of the fact that Tiger's
holdings are mainly New York Stock Exchange issues.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts pointed to a lingering effect from the
recommendation on Tuesday by Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential
Goldman, Sachs strategist, that investors trim their exposure to
stocks and hold as much as 15 percent cash. Technology companies,
she contended, were no longer undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq sagged, the Dow Jones industrial average staged an
afternoon rally of as much as 165 before losing half of it toward
the close. It ended the day with a gain of 82.61 points, or 0.76
percent, at 11,018.72.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric accounted for nearly half the Dow's gain,
jumping 7{ to a record close of 163{ after an analyst at Prudential
Securities raised his price target to 210 from 185.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil each surged more than 4 points, the
latter among the many oil-related stocks that more than reversed
Tuesday's ragged performance as analysts and investors further
digested OPEC's announcement of plans to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a realization now that crude prices are not going to
collapse here,'' said M.J. Matts, a value-oriented portfolio
manager at National City Investment Management in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, Texaco and Atlantic Richfield all gained more than 3
points while oilfield companies Schlumberger and B. J. Services
were up more than 4 and Halliburton more than 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, less dominated by
high-technology than Nasdaq, finished up 0.79 points, to 1,508.52.
Of its components, 280 advanced and 203 declined, the biggest
point-losers being technology companies such as Motorola,
Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology and Yahoo,
though some regained part of the lost ground after the normal 4
p.m. close. Micron's announcement of a 2-for-1 split may have
contributed to the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks joined energy in the winner's circle, with
Warner-Lambert ahead more than 3 and Merck, Bristol-Myers and
American Home Products each ahead more than 2. On the New York
Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by
1,632 to 1,336, as 57 stocks hit new 52-week lows and 54 hit new
highs. Volume climbed to 1.06 billion.

ORGANIZATION OF REFORM RABBIS DECIDES TO ALLOW SAME SEX UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The rabbis of Judaism's Reform movement
declared Wednesday that gay relationships are ``worthy of
affirmation'' through Jewish ritual and that Reform rabbis who
decide to officiate at same-sex ceremonies will have the support of
the branch's rabbinical body _ as will those who decide they will
not.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
through a resolution at its annual convention here, makes the
conference the largest group of American clergy to affirm that its
members may conduct gay unions. The conference represents about
1,800 rabbis who lead nearly 1.5 million Jews in the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conference was already on the record as favoring a
right to civil marriage for gays, the resolution it adopted
Wednesday uses the term ``union'' to describe a gay relationship
and leaves it up to individual rabbis to decide the type of ritual
to use to bless one. Still, conference officials and some other
rabbis said they considered the decision to be of great symbolic
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakthrough is that it's a major religious group that
says unequivocally it will support its rabbis if they participate
in these ceremonies,'' said Rabbi Paul Menitoff, the conference's
executive vice president. He said he also regarded the resolution
as a strong weapon against anti-gay bias.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Valerie Lieber, head of a Brooklyn, N.Y., congregation and
an official of the Gay and Lesbian Rabbinic Network, a caucus
within the conference, said, ``I would say that it truly means we
have gone beyond a time of tolerance and acceptance to a time of
embracing the souls of gay and lesbian Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the resolution also drew qualified support from rabbis who
said they would not officiate at a same-sex union. They were
particularly gratified by wording that was added to the text last
week to note that a diversity of opinion about the subject exists
within the Reform rabbinate, and to say explicitly that the
conference will support those who do not officiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a compromise,'' said Rabbi Clifford E. Librach of
Sharon, Mass. He called the resolution ``a victory for diversity
and intellectual tolerance.'' He said he felt that Jewish tradition
barred him from officiating at a same-sex union, as it did from
officiating at an interfaith marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Another conference member who said he would not officiate at
same-sex unions, Rabbi Jeffrey K. Salkin of Port Washington, N.Y.,
said there was a ``large bloc of silent people'' unhappy with the
resolution, but that those people also believed ``that reasonable
people can come to different conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the new wording was added to the resolution, the two men
had planned to offer a substitute motion that would have called for
welcoming gays to Reform congregations and defending their civil
rights, but making no statement on same-sex ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, following about an hour of discussion, came in a
session closed to reporters. Conference officials later said about
400 rabbis attended and overwhelmingly approved the resolution by
voice vote. The deliberations took place in the Joseph S. Koury
Convention Center in this central North Carolina city, as the
conference concluded a four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said that immediately after the vote
participants stood and sang a prayer _ ``Thank God for Bringing us
to This Moment'' _ that is commonly used to mark such events as a
bar or bat mitzvah, a person's arrival in Israel or other
significant events.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, only two smaller religious bodies, the
Unitarian-Universalist Association and the Reconstructionist
Rabbinical Association, which represents Jews in Reconstructionist
synagogues, had adopted statements supporting clergy members who
decided to officiate at gay unions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some other religious bodies have taken a very different tack. In
1996, for example, the United Methodist Church adopted a rule
forbidding its ministers from conducting same-sex unions, which has
led to one pastor being defrocked and another suspended after
church trials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Reform resolution is bold in this context, it is
nonetheless a nuanced document, reflecting divisions within liberal
Judaism over the issue. It contains a background section discussing
the evolution of the conference's positions on homosexuals, noting
that two separate committees within the conference reached opposing
conclusions on whether same-sex unions could be conducted within
Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the resolution fits within a recent pattern within
the Reform movement. In 1977, Reform rabbis called for an end to
discrimination against gays and decriminalization of homosexual
activity between consenting adults. In 1990, the conference voted
that sexual orientation should not be a bar to serving as a rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be impossible to know how many gay men and lesbians
are in the Reform rabbinate, the three-year-old Gay and Lesbian
Rabbinic Network has about 50 members. One of them, Rabbi Karen
Bender of Great Neck, N.Y., predicted the resolution will inspire
rabbis to create services for gay couples. ``The beauty of it is,
it leaves it open what rabbis will call it,'' she said. ``Some will
call it marriage, some will call it a commitment ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of such ceremonies is not known, in recent
years, a growing number of Reform rabbis have said they would
conduct them. One who did so three years ago was Rabbi Charles A.
Kroloff of Westfield, N.J., now the conference's president.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kroloff said he spent a year ``educating the
congregation'' about the ceremony before officiating. He held adult
classes, discussed it in the temple bulletin, even mentioned it
during Friday services, as a way to gain acceptance among members
for the event. ``There was a transformation in the congregation
from beginning to end,'' Kroloff said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rabbi Shira Stern, director of a Jewish chaplaincy program
in New Jersey and a leader of the Women's Rabbinic Network, the
caucus that wrote the resolution, said it was a ``mandate to
create'' liturgies for use in same sex ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday's vote, some rabbis said they worried that
the resolution would undercut efforts by the Reform movement to
expand its small minority presence in Israel, where the majority of
citizens are unaffiliated and the largest religious group by far is
the Orthodox, who regard biblical prohibitions against homosexual
activity as legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   But Rabbi Uri Regev, director of the Center for Religious
Action, an organization in Jerusalem, said in an interview here
before the vote that he expected the resolution to produce
``diverse reactions,'' with some Israelis upset and others
supportive. ``I think that Israeli society is not as progressive
yet as we would like to see,'' he said. ``But at the same time, it
is certainly opening up to understanding of the rights and the
plight of homosexuals in a way that is gratifying.''

NASA CHIEF TAKES BLAME IN MARS PROGRAM FAILURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA administrator Dan Goldin on Wednesday shouldered the blame
for recent back-to-back Mars program failures, acknowledging he
expected too much for too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``As head of NASA, I accept the responsibility'' Goldin told
workers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the
facility that develops the agency's planetary spacecraft, including
its Mars probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warning bells are sounding,'' the space agency chief said.
``The trend is very, very sobering and one we can't ignore. It says
we pushed too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's JPL visit and his remarks followed Tuesday's public
release of a scathing investigative report into the Dec. 3 loss of
the Mars Polar Lander, a robotic probe that was to search for water
frozen in the subsoil of the planet's south pole.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander failure followed the Sept. 23 loss of NASA's
Mars Climate Orbiter, a probe that was to track the migration of
water vapor in the planet's thin atmosphere for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency invested $372 million in the two-mission
package.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-member panel of experts, led by Thomas Young, a retired
aerospace company executive, blamed the losses on mismanagement,
underfunding and inadequate staffing. The lapses led to a lack of
pre-launch testing and independent oversight that could have
prevented the design flaws and errors that led to the failures, the
panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander was out of communication with Earth as it
descended toward the surface of Mars. Investigators believe that it
most likely shattered on the frozen Martian terrain when a computer
software flaw caused the probe's descent rockets to shut down while
it was still 130 feet above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter was lost as it attempted to maneuver into
orbit around Mars. Investigators believe it dove into the Martian
atmosphere because of errors in navigation. The errors were
attributed to JPL's use of English rather than metric units of
measurements to compute a series of small propulsive maneuvers
during the transit from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The package of missions was underfunded by at least 30 percent,
the Young panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The funding constraints prompted inexperienced managers at JPL
to skimp on independent oversight of their activities, pre-launch
testing, staffing and adequate training of their personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's remarks, Goldin said he and his Washington staff
had pushed their ``faster, better, cheaper'' strategy for dealing
with NASA's declining budgets throughout the early and mid-1990s
too far. The strategy called on JPL to cut the size and cost of its
missions but to increase their frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin told the workers that in the future agency officials in
Washington will monitor the development of NASA's Mars probes more
closely and create reserve funds from which money can be drawn to
respond to unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that risk and failure are inherent in any
exploration effort that relies on innovation and breakthrough
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you more than ever before,'' he told the workers. ``We
need you to help fix the problems.''

   FRIEDKIN-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ William Friedkin was a golden boy
in Hollywood in the early 1970s. Two of his films, ``The French
Connection'' and ``The Exorcist,'' were among the most successful
of that decade. But Friedkin responded to sudden wealth and power
with the kind of self-destructive arrogance all too common in
Hollywood. The town waited for him to fail. And he did. ``Sure, I
was arrogant, I let success go to my head, I did not suffer fools
gladly,'' said Friedkin, the director of the new drama ``Rules of
Engagement,'' which opens Friday. He spoke quietly. ``I probably
was more enamored of myself than my talent deserved,'' he said. ``I
thought I was infallible. I wasn't.'' At the age of 64, Friedkin
accepts his infallibility with a shrug, and still seems brashly
confident. But the years have taken their toll. By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).  &QL;

   HIP-HOP-FILMS (Undated) _ Hip-hop, to the discomfort of artistic
purists and cultural puritans alike, has become the lingua franca
of global youth culture. Nowhere is this more evident than at the
movies, where hip-hop increasingly provides not only a source of
subsidiary revenue (thanks to soundtrack sales), but a repertory of
styles, references and attitudes now showing at theaters
everywhere. By A.O. Scott. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   HIGH-FIDELITY-FILM (Undated) _ In the transition from novel to
film, Rob, the hero of ``High Fidelity'' _ Nick Hornby's 1995
novel, Stephen Frears's new film _ undergoes some minor
transformations: he ceases being British and becomes American,
relocates from London to Chicago and sees his last name change from
Fleming to Gordon. The first two changes were no doubt to
accommodate the casting of the Chicago native John Cusack; the last
you can speculate about on your own. Otherwise, much remains the
same. Rob is still the owner of a marginally failing vintage record
shop, still called Championship Vinyl, which is still manned by
``the musical moron twins,'' Dick and Barry; he is still moping
about his love life, especially his recent dumping by his
girlfriend, Laura; and he is still the gloomy underachiever whose
relentless navel-gazing is made palatable by his honesty about his
shortcomings and his often quite funny insights about men, women
and romance. As film adaptations go, this one is almost fiercely
faithful. By Jamie Malanowski. (Moved).  &QL;

   FILTH-AND-FURY-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Filth and the Fury,''
the new documentary about the British punk-rock band the Sex
Pistols, the group's endlessly quotable lead singer John Lydon (aka
Johnny Rotten) observes that the group was ``a bit like a Harold
Pinter play: it shouldn't work, but it does.'' The same could be
said of the movie that Julien Temple has assembled from footage of
the band in performance, along with new and archival interviews
with the band members, their supporters and their detractors. ``The
Filth and the Fury'' is now playing in Manhattan. By Ken Tucker.

   TERE-O'CONNOR-DANCE (Undated) _ Unlike some choreographers, who
bark like drill sergeants at their dancers, Tere O'Connor seldom
raises his voice, although inside, he says, his vision of what
should be sometimes collides with his realization of what is,
pushing him to the point of a scream. ``Hi Everybody!,'' which
opens on Thursday for a three-week run at Dance Theater Workshop in
Manhattan, is a poetic, absurdist combination of dance and what
O'Connor calls ``the theater of the obvious,'' meant to entertain
the audience while disorienting it and provoking it into a

   PATRICK-STEWART-THEATER (New York) _ Patrick Stewart's first
``Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in
1998, brought him mixed reviews and a mild concussion. So why has
he decided to star again in the Arthur Miller play _ this time on
Broadway? ``There are some roles that gnaw at you,'' the Royal
Shakespeare Company veteran and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
captain said recently; he was taking a lunch break during
rehearsals. ``Leontes in `The Winter's Tale' is one, and Lyman Felt
in `The Ride Down Mount Morgan' is another. There's this impulse
that I must do it again, that I almost got it right, but not
quite.'' In the play, Stewart, 59, plays a bigamist who has led a
self-indulgent life; the character is in part Miller's comment on
the Reagan era. By Mervyn Rothstein. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   EILEEN-HECKART-THEATER (New York) _ Eileen Heckart has been
acting for more than 50 years now, almost always as the second
banana. She was the alcoholic mother whose son is drowned in ``The
Bad Seed,'' the spinster teacher in ``Picnic'' on Broadway who gets
tipsy. ``You do one, they have no imagination,'' said Heckart about
all the drunks she has played. Sometimes she is the aunt, as in the
Mary Tyler Moore television show. She was Marilyn Monroe's waitress
friend in the movie ``Bus Stop.'' But this time, and at 81, Heckart
has the lead. Indeed, she dominates the stage at the Promenade
Theater for nearly every one of the 110 minutes of ``The Waverly
Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's memory play about his grandmother's
decline, in which Heckart portrays Gladys Green, a woman who is
gradually becoming senile. By Dinitia Smith. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

the bassist Edgar Meyer and the violinist Mark O'Connor take the
stage on Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall to play selections from
their best-selling album, ``Appalachia Waltz,'' and its new sequel,
``Appalachian Journey,'' most eyes will be on Ma. The trio's
celebrity, its meal ticket, he is a classical-music superstar,
perhaps the greatest string player of our time. But he's not as
remarkable a musician as his 38-year-old ensemble-mate on violin.
O'Connor's unfinished trajectory, from largely self-taught fiddle
player to concert-hall virtuoso and classical composer, is already
one of the most spectacular, if underpublicized, journeys in recent
American music. By Tony Scherman. (Moved).  &QL;

   PRINTS-ART (Philadelphia) _ Not until the printing press made
cheap multiple copies of a picture available _ in woodcuts,
engravings, drypoints, etchings and aquatints _ could Europe's
artists, few of whom could travel to Rome, see for themselves the
masterpieces of antiquity. Thereafter we hear regularly of prints
as the inspiration for particular images, but it is not often that
we focus on the source of the information that now flooded through
Europe. Put simply, what was it that printmakers chose to show when
they depicted the ancient world? That is the question the
exhibition ``Revivals, Reveries and Reconstructions: Images of
Antiquity in Prints From 1500 to 1800,'' on view at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art until April 16, seeks to answer. By

   TV-DIRTY-PICTURES (Undated) _ Exactly 10 years ago this Friday,
Dennis Barrie became the first American museum director known to be
indicted for doing his job. Barrie, then 42 and director of the
Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, was well aware that there
were objections to the new exhibition there: photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe, which included depictions of sadomasochistic
homosexual acts and portraits of nude children. Business leaders
had pressured the center to cancel the show, but the opening for
museum members the evening before had gone smoothly, so Barrie was
optimistic. But Barrie and the art center were indicted on
obscenity charges (pandering and using minors in pornography).
``Dirty Pictures,'' the television film version of Barrie's story,
is scheduled to have its premiere next month on Showtime. Barrie is
played by James Woods in the first criminal trial in the United
States over the content of a museum exhibition. By Anita Gates.

   TV-VIDEO-ART (Undated) _ On March 23, 1969, the infant medium of
video art launched a guerrilla raid on broadcast television. The
attack, a show titled ``The Medium is the Medium'' and described in
the program guide as ``six avant-garde artists take over
television,'' consisted of a barrage of abstract images and visual
non sequiturs. And if most viewers were too busy singing along with
Peter, Paul and Mary on ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' to
notice the artistic coup d'etat, the broadcast nevertheless marked
a turning point in the history of an art form that is now firmly
entrenched in the bastions of high culture. Excerpts from the ``The
Medium is the Medium'' return to broadcast television this Sunday
at 4 p.m. when WGBH in Boston presents ``The Electronic Canvas,'' a

ANIMAL PLANET ANSWERS THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Call of the Wild,'' Jack London's adventure yarn of a boy, his
dog and Klondike fever in the Yukon has been filmed four times
before, twice as TV movies. The cable network Animal Planet takes
the idea one further by spinning its televersion of London's novel
into its first fictional TV series.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the show _ although he doesn't get nearly enough
screen time _ is Kavic, a handsome Malamute/timber wolf mix playing
Buck, the heroic sled dog, who saves pretty much everyone in sight
at one point or another (or, at least, will be given the chance
when the show goes to series beginning Monday).
</P>
<P>
   As for the humans, Shane Meier is clearly much older than his
15-year-old character, and his hair is far too perfect for a rugged
Alaskan, but his acting chops aren't to be questioned as Miles
Challenger, the young man who experiences love at first sight for
Buck, only to watch another man outbid him for the noble pooch at
an auction. When that man must give him up, a pair of buffoonish
city slickers named Mercedes (Kathleen Duborg) and her
all-vice-all-the-time brother Hal (Ben Cardinal), who'd be
hard-pressed to hunt for their backsides let alone gold, buy Buck
then recruit Miles to guide them on their trek.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the wild, Hal irrationally and repeatedly insists Miles
switch their itinerary all around, unimpressed by the potential
danger or even the fact that their food supply is dangerously
dwindling. As presented here, Hal is an unconvincing stock villain
and his behavior so loopily outlandish that not even the other
characters can abide him, as evidenced in this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Mercedes: ``My brother (shouldn't be considered) a
malicious man.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Miles: ``Your brother was a lunatic, Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Mercedes: ``You're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's film also neglects to give significant time to
appealing performers who will be series regulars, namely Nick
Mancuso as Miles' gruff but understanding stepfather, Rachel
Hayward as his mother and Crystal Buble as his romantic interest.
Still, ``Call of the Wild'' makes for decent family fare with high
adventure and mild humor, boasting gorgeous, vast scenic vistas
(British Columbia subs for Alaska) and equally gorgeous supporting
canine players. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The show: ``Call of the Wild.'' &QL; 
What: Telefilm based on Jack London's classic and pilot for
upcoming series on life in the Yukon. &QL; 
The stars: Shane Meier, Nick Mancuso, Rachel Hayward, Kavic. &QL; 
Where: Animal Planet. &QL; 
When: 8 p.m. Friday and 9 p.m. Saturday; thereafter, 9 p.m.
Mondays. &QL;

GUTHRIDGE TOPS ON DEAN'S LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They talk all the time. But generally it's always
on Bill Guthridge's dime.
</P>
<P>
   The Teacher and The Pupil, which sounds odd since The Pupil is
62 years old and has a coaching resume that dates back to 1962.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, when The Teacher is named Dean Smith and you
work in a building called the Smith Center, named after the man who
won more college basketball games than any other coach, you don't
mind second billing.
</P>
<P>
   This week that will change. North Carolina is in the Final Four
for a record 15th time. The Tar Heels arrived with more losses (13)
than any UNC team has ever brought to college basketball's final
ball.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also here on Bill Guthridge's dance card. Oh, there
are still players _ like senior point guard Ed Cota _ making
contributions. But for the past three seasons, Guthridge has tried
to make his own footprints in one of college basketball's most
storied programs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Smith remains sequestered nearby in retirement after
36 seasons, 879 wins, and two national championships, Guthridge has
proven that he can run the shop just fine. You think not? Consider
this: In his first two seasons, Guthridge won 58 games quicker than
any other coach in NCAA history. With 59-55 win over Tulsa Sunday,
Guthridge has won 80 in three seasons, matching the quickest
three-year start in NCAA history. In three seasons, Guthridge has
been to two Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge chooses to keep his talks with his mentor _ he was
Smith's assistant for 30 years _ private. ``I generally call him,''
said Guthridge, who will be guiding the Tar Heels in Saturday's
Final Four semifinal against Florida. ``I generally ask him for
advice on things that happen. He's always helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not as reticent about his friend. When UNC won 34 games
in 1997 and reached the Final Four, Smith was the first to offer
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill did a marvelous job, but it was not a surprise to me or
anyone who knows college basketball,'' said Smith, who has
deliberately kept a low profile during the run three years ago and
during the rough trip the Tar Heels had this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never did receive enough credit, although he didn't ask for
it, for all his years as Tex Winter's assistant and my assistant.
Bill's basketball savvy, ability to remain composed, and genuine
affection for his players are just some of the reasons for his
success as a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge is not comfortable talking about himself. Sounds like
bragging, which traces back to his Kansas routes, where if a person
did his job that was all the praise he needed. But make no mistake.
He suffered through the early part of the season when the Tar Heels
were losing not only to highly-regarded teams like Michigan State,
Cincinnati, and Indiana, but also to ACC rivals Virginia and Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge said his faith in his team never wavered. ``I had
confidence in this team all year. Its ability to bounce back is a
great trademark,'' he said. ``I was just disappointed I was not
able to push the right buttons to get the thing going earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tournament, the Tar Heels, who were projected as a Top 10
team, have found that formula as Guthridge has been able to ``push
the right buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty much written off,'' said sophomore forward
Jason Capel, who understands what Guthridge endured as the team
faltered. ``I'm a coach's son. I know what's that about.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Guthridge. He came out of Kansas State in the 1950s with
an appreciation for coaching as he learned under longtime Wildcats
coach Tex Winter. He came to UNC in 1967, found a niche with Smith
and thought he had found basketball heaven. ``When Dean Smith
retired (in 1997), I thought I would retire,'' said Guthridge, who
found that he wasn't quite ready to give up the game Smith retired.
``That threw a monkey wrench into the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a teacher,'' said Guthridge, who was quickly
named as the replacement. ``Thirty years at Carolina, five years at
Kansas State. When I started out I wanted to be a head coach. I had
opportunities in the '70s. But because of the success of the
program, I finally decided I had the best job in country: an
assistant at North Carolina, working with Dean Smith and all the
great assistant coaches. At that time, I felt I could be happy as
an assistant forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the underlying themes that Smith harped on in talking to
Guthridge over the years was to get him to think like a head coach.
``What would you do if you were me?'' Smith used to ask Guthridge
when the inevitable crisis of a season developed.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge used that training this season. As recently as a week
ago he was reading media reports that he was too old and out of
touch and the best thing he could do was retire. Guthridge
dismissed the criticism, the same way he has shrugged off the
praise. He says seeing his team succeed derives his pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm truly happy for this team,'' he said. ``I had a lot of
satisfaction in my life and some disappointments, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he celebrated a win over Tennessee last Friday
night in the South semifinal, Guthridge smiled. ``I went back to my
hotel room and kissed my wife,'' he said. ``That was my
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in the next several days, don't expect
much more from its coach.
</P>
<P>
   That's his way and it works for him, which is all that really
matters.

MAKING A SPLASH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Poolside parties and pinup girls.
</P>
<P>
   They were the essence of Old Hollywood glamour _ and the theme
of this year's swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for structured suits with padded cups. These new
water babies are unstructured and skin-tight like that racy red
number Farrah Fawcett wore in her now-famous `70s poster. Or the
nude-colored low-cut style worn by Bo Derek in ``10.'' Yes, even as
a maillot, these new styles are as revealing as Jennifer Lopez's
Grammy dress.
</P>
<P>
   But the new-again bikini is the real showstopper on the beach.
The style, first seen on screen goddesses such as Ursula Andress in
``Dr. No,'' is back with a tad less fabric and a lot more glitz.
These little triangles of snakeskin and satin are beaded like
evening gowns, accented with rhinestones, and trimmed with feathers
and fringe. With a pair of stilettos and a matching pareo wrapped
at the hips, they can go from the pool to the Polo Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it _ swimsuit inspirations reflect the sex
appeal of European fashion designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a European trend, and if it weren't for them, we wouldn't
have the excitement we're seeing in swimwear this year,'' says Los
Angeles swimsuit designer Anne Cole.
</P>
<P>
   While the designer suits may not actually be suitable for
swimming, Cole's new collection of suits with rhinestones and
sequins and glittery gold lame straps are waterproof. ``They have
to be, or our customers will send them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she personally prefers suits with what she calls
``button-down'' sex appeal, she admits this is a ``vixen's year,''
right down to those new snakeskin print suits that she personally
dislikes. Even the winter cruise line of suits have more sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   For those more modest types without a personal trainer to carve
out curves and tone tummies, not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an abundance of pareos, sarongs and scarves to tie
around the hips or bustline, there are a number of swimsuits made
with high-tech fabrics such as Lycra Soft, a new microfiber that
works like a girdle or corset for aging baby boomers who need
support. The fabrics have the bonus of being chlorine-resistant so
they won't fall apart before the summer's over.
</P>
<P>
   Although most swimsuit designers claim the bikini is big this
year, especially the triangle and string types, the `90s fave _ the
tankini _ is still sizzling on the sand. According to Heather
Moldenhauer, spokeswoman for Jantzen swimsuits, the tank top
portion has gotten a little longer this season which makes it more
appealing to those with less-than-perfect figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the junior department, which is geared to younger, trimmer
bodies, the tankini still reigns, but triangle bikinis sold as
separates with alternate choices of bandeau tops and matching
trunks are the latest trend, says Tracy Marciano, who designs for
Electric Beach swimwear. And those trunks have options, too, from
high waists to micro styles, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a bright season for solids in turquoise, pink and
orange. But think exotic with influences of Africa, Asia and Indian
translated into crochet styles, tie-dye designs, stenciling and
embroidery in shades of olive and bronze.

<P>
   Wine neophytes can use the Web to learn about it and where to
buy it. Those who favor whites, for example, may be interested in
the rising popularity of German rieslings in the United States. The
Web can provide an introduction to this most versatile of white
wines.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reviews of 1998 German rieslings at
www.winetoday.com, which is owned by New York Times Digital. At
www.winespectator.com, the magazine's library archives are a gold
mine of estate listings. A 1999 article, ``The New Golden Age of
Riesling,'' names producers whose wines are exceptional, among them
Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region and Georg
Breuer in the Rheingau (look for the Ruedes-heimer Berg Schlossberg
bottlings).
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site of the Manhattan-based German Wine Information
Bureau, a trade office (www.germanwineusa.org), the Addresses,
Contacts and Links button leads to the Breuer and Kesselstatt home
pages. Both estates relate their wine-growing philosophies and
carry links to their American agents: Breuer's is Classical Wines
in Seattle; Kesselstatt's include Valckenberg International in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's site opens a side trip to www.vonschubert.com _ to
Carl von Schubert's estate Maximin Gruenhaus, in Ruwer. In good
vintages and poor it makes long-lived rieslings of such
transcendent beauty from the Abtsberg and Herrenberg vineyards that
they qualify as national treasures.
</P>
<P>
   These estates' sites have included e-mail addresses. Inquiries
are almost surely to yield information about distributors,
purchases as well as retailers and restaurants carrying the brands.
</P>
<P>
   What foods go with white, dry, semidry and sweet rieslings? The
bureau site's mix-and-match Food and Wine Pairing Guide provides
guidance.

JUDGE RULES RELEASE OF   CLINTON'S LETTERS ILLEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Wednesday ruled that President
Clinton ``committed a criminal violation of the Privacy Act'' by
releasing the private letters of a woman who accused him of making
a sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling brought a quick reply from Clinton, who said at a
wide-ranging press conference just a few hours later that he
``reluctantly'' authorized releasing Kathleen Willey's letters
because it was the only way he knew to rebut her charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't agree with the ruling,'' Clinton said. US
District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered White House lawyers to
answer questions about the issue in a lawsuit that has been filed
by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that has filed
several lawsuits against the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the Privacy Act is a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reacted to the ruling as he fielded 22 questions ranging
from oil prices to the Elian Gonzalez case, missing White House
e-mails, Middle East peace talks, gun control, and Vice President
Al Gore's campaign finance initiative.
</P>
<P>
   He began by hailing Tuesday's announcement by OPEC members that
they will increase oil production, calling it ``good news for our
economy and for the American consumer.'' He said gasoline prices
and home heating costs should fall in the next few weeks, and he
urged oil companies ``to do everything they can to bring the
savings to consumers as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not expect that a bill in Congress to repeal
the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, which he helped push through
in 1993, would ever reach his desk, and he was not convinced that
savings from such a measure would be passed along to consumers. But
he said lawmakers should act quickly on a bill in the House to
renew his authority over the oil stockpile in the strategic
petroleum reserve, before the authority expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who appeared less energetic than in some of his
previous meetings with reporters, was at times wistful and
reflective, and untypically disarming when asked about White House
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   He cracked that Lamberth, a Republican judicial appointee whose
decisions involving administration officials have sometimes been
overturned, ``does seem to have somehow acquired a significant
percentage of the cases involving the White House.'' And he
chuckled when told that one of his legal advisers had described the
judge as a ``loose cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Lamberth wrote that evidence in the case
``established that the president had the requisite intent for
committing a criminal violation of the Privacy Act'' when Clinton
authorized the release of the letters during the 1998 criminal
investigation that led to his impeachment and acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The Privacy Act protects individuals from the release of certain
materials about them without their consent. The Clinton Justice
Department maintains that the act does not apply to those
components of the White House that advise or assist the president.
</P>
<P>
   Willey's letters were released by White House aides after she
alleged in a ``60 Minutes'' interview that Clinton made an unwanted
sexual advance next to the Oval Office in 1993. The letters were
meant to show that she remained friendly with Clinton after the
alleged incident.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the president said the Privacy Act never came up
in White House discussions about releasing the letters. ``I never
thought about it, never thought about whether it applied or not,
and decided to do it reluctantly, only because it was the only way
I knew to refute allegations that were made against me that were
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Clinton pledged the cooperation of the White
House with judicial and congressional investigators looking into
what happened to thousands of electronic messages that disappeared
but had been sought during inquiries into 1996 campaign
fund-raising excesses, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and other
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't handle the e-mail things,'' Clinton said,
acknowledging his limited ability with computers. ``I'm confident
that whatever's the right thing to do, we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   On other domestic issues, Clinton said the Miami relatives of
Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy entangled in an
international custody battle, should accept the decision of federal
courts, should they order the boy returned to his father in Cuba.
``If they do not prevail in court, they will clearly appeal,'' he
said. ``I would just hope that the law would be followed by
everyone, including them.''
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Clinton said that there needs to be ``a balance
between prevention and punishment,'' and that he was unfazed by
attacks from the National Rifle Association and its leader, actor
Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the president's job description _ being
attacked by people who disagree with him,'' Clinton said. ``That
doesn't matter. I still think Charlton Heston is a great actor, and
I love his movies, and I still watch them every time I get a
chance. . . . And I loved having him here at the White House not
very long ago when he got one of the Kennedy Center awards.''
</P>
<P>
   On states' taxing of Internet sales, Clinton said he supports
the current moratorium on taxes and predicted that ``over the next
year or so, you will begin to see some kind of consensus emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Gore's plan to rid politics of special
interest money, specifically to create a $7.1 billion endowment to
pay for House and Senate races, and eventually the White House. ``I
kind of wish I'd thought of it myself,'' he said. He said such a
proposal would eliminate the need for candidates to spend so much
time raising money for their campaigns, and give members of the
House and Senate time to be ``home resting, you know, reading good
books, spending time with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he ``was outraged'' and ``as appalled as the next
person'' when he discovered that the Democratic National Committee
and his reelection team had taken illegal contributions from
foreign donors in the 1996 campaign. ``We didn't need it to win. It
was wrong. And we did everything we could to try to correct it and
set it right, and we spent a lot of money doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   On foreign matters, Clinton said Syria and Israel should come up
with ideas and start talking about peace in the Middle East, an
effort he tried unsuccessfully to revive Sunday by meeting with
Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva. ``If we're going to have a
negotiation, I don't think it's enough to say, `I don't like your
position. Come back and see me when I like your position,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pledged to work with President Vladimir Putin of
Russia ``regardless of personal chemistry,'' which he said he hoped
would be good.

TOWER OF FAITH: CHURCH MEMBERS SURVIVE TORNADO'S FURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sue Belew and Margie Young were at the top
of the five-story tower of Calvary Cathedral on Tuesday night,
keeping alive the church's five-year chain of uninterrupted prayer,
and were unaware of the tornadic force bearing down on them.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor, the 30 or so church members who had
gathered for Bible study, also suspected nothing until Louis Cruz,
a security guard, entered an office where Debbie Dahman, a
secretary for the church's private school, was finishing up her
work for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 6:30 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tornado touched down at Montgomery Ward,'' Cruz said,
referring to the office building 10 blocks away on the west side of
the Trinity River.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain had been falling, but the early evening air had
been still, Dahman said. They were momentarily stunned, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other and then the lights went out,'' she
said. ``Suddenly we heard this whoooosh. It was like a locomotive
... like a train coming through the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The guard alerted the church pastor, Rev. Robert Nichols, and
his wife, Joy, and got them to a secure location in a hallway
outside the pastor's office, Dahman said. Church members also
scrambled for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The building trembled as the tornado crossed the Trinity, tore
the glass facade from the Cash America International building and
then pounded the cathedral. Belew and Young were still praying when
the brick walls of the tower disappeared, leaving them exposed to
the howling winds.
</P>
<P>
   Below, a stairway collapsed and one man was injured by falling
debris. Another, a member of the Bible study class, also suffered
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   As the twister moved on, it hammered other nearby buildings and
apartments and uprooted trees on a wooded knoll on its path to
downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Behind it, the Cavalry Cathedral appeared to be little more than
a bombed out shell. The women in the prayer tower made it safely to
the ground and the two injured men were taken to a hospital for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dahman said the timing of the storm was fortunate. Had it struck
two hours earlier, more than 500 children and teen-agers, students
of the private school and wards of the day-care center, would have
been in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle here is that nobody was killed'' Nichols told the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Especially fortunate, he said, were the
two women in the prayer tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle they weren't sucked out of that building and
killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer tower has been continuously occupied for the past
five years as members of the non-denominational church scale the
stairway to pray in two-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always at least one person up there, usually two,''
Dahman said. The prayers are for ``our church, our nation, our
elected representatives all across the nation, for our governors
and for our pastors.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer chain was broken Tuesday night, but only temporarily,
she said.

 &HT;    Devastation of school bus-train wreck more acute day after;
thousands attend vigil for victims
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. _ The holes in lives and hearts became apparent
Thursday in this Blue Ridge town near the scene of the worst
train-school bus wreck involving Georgians in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of grieving for the six injured and two killed in
the crash started with schoolchildren raising the elementary school
flag to half-mast and ended with about 1,000 tear-stained faces
glistening in candlelight at a vigil on the courthouse lawn about
15 minutes outside town. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes was among those
attending the vigil at the Murray County courthouse in Chattsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest of sorrows: the memory of joy in the face
of grief,'' said Barnes. ``We can not understand why they were
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 miles away, in Chattanooga, Tenn., the chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board was blasting the situation
that contributed to the wreck at the unprotected crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded school buses should never cross a train track that isn't
protected with either crossing gates or warning lights, said NTSB
Chairman Jim Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge all of the local school districts in the United
States to immediately contact the railroads in these school
districts and find out where the passive (unmarked) crossings are
and (have schools) provide a plan for the safe crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the frenzy of the early Tuesday crash at a narrow railroad
crossing subsided, residents of this blue-collar community of about
600 people felt the full weight of their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I was numb. Today I woke up and realized that she
was not there,'' said Jenny Agan, 26, the aunt of Kayla Silvers, a
6-year-old who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla was among seven students on the long yellow bus picking up
students for Northwest Elementary School. They all lived near one
another in this enclave of trailer homes and small dwellings at the
top of a hill. Nine-year-old Daniel Pack also died when the 33-car
CSX freight train collided with the bus at the unprotected
crossing. Six were injured and hospitalized, three in critical
condition. One girl, Brittany Gaddis, who stumbled from the twisted
hulk of the train to a nearby store, was released from the hospital
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   School officials braced Thursday for a hard day of sorrow and
tears _ and they got it. In Tuesday's confusion, many students
hadn't heard what had happened, or, if they had, they did not know
who was injured.
</P>
<P>
   For the students and teachers, the day after hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my heart is broke,'' said Zachary Mantoota, 8. He
rides that bus some days, but was driven to school Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said his class talked about ``how that train hit the bus. A
couple of kids were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations with his grandmother, he shared his own
sadness. He knows two of those injured, Kevin Sherrill, 8, and
Amber Pritchett, 9, both of Tennga.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had deep sadness and love. It really tore my heart out to
hear him,'' said his grandmother, Janice Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwest Elementary, Principal C.L. Dunn tried to keep the
day as normal as possible. ``We feel the children need a sense of
routine right now to reassure them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors visited the classes of the accident victims.
Bus routes were reconfigured to avoid train crossings. Some buses
carried yellow ribbons in tribute to the students.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents kept their children off the buses, driving them to
school instead. Among them were the parents of Zachery Watson, 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crying a lot last night,'' said his father, John
Watson, who was among those who helped at the accident scene.
</P>
<P>
   At the railroad crossing on Liberty Church Road, eight small
yellow ribbons hung on the wooden post holding the yellow sign with
the X on it to symbolize a railroad crossing. The post on the other
side of the one-track crossing, sideswiped as the train dragged and
shredded the bus, had been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National
Transportation Safety Board measured and marked the site in
preparation for an accident restaging today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to mirror the conditions, to determine at what point a
driver could see the train and hear the train,'' said NTSB
spokeswoman Lauren Peduzzi.
</P>
<P>
   The train's on-board computer revealed that the warning whistle
had been blowing and that the train was traveling at about 50 mph
on impact. The speed limit at the crossing, where trains can pass
as often as every half hour, is 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials acknowledged that many questions remain and
that it is too early to place blame. Dana Keeton, spokeswoman for
the Tennessee Highway Patrol, rattled off a short list of some
outstanding issues: Was the bus moving or was it stopped upon the
tracks? Did the bus driver follow the law by stopping before the
tracks to check both ways? Why was the bus on the tracks when a
train was coming?
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB expects to release a preliminary report in about a
week, but a full finding could take 10 months, Peduzzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Keeton said the bus driver, Rhonda Cloer, whose own
daughter was among the injured students, had only one previous
violation on her driving record, a 1991 speeding ticket. The record
did not indicate whether that occurred while she was driving a bus,
Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators turned the scene of horror and destruction into
one of analytical review, a man in jeans and cowboy boots walked
across the tracks, which have no warning lights or gates.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Duckett said he didn't need a study to see the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some crossing lights up there bad, and those arms
that come down,'' said Duckett, who was planning to attend the
vigil.
</P>
<P>
   And the fixes shouldn't end at this crossing, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two or three down the line that need it, and another
over in Crandal where my brother lives.''

AT&AMP;T TAKES FULL CONTROL OF AT HOMECABLE VENTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bolstering its plan to deliver high-speed Internet access over
cable television lines, AT&AMP;T Corp. said Wednesday that it had
agreed to take control of At Home Corp., the cable modem venture.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, which does business as Excite(at)Home, is the nation's
biggest provider of Internet service using cable systems, with
about 1.1 million customers. But despite its success, the company
has been riven by strategic disagreements among its major
shareholders since AT&AMP;T became an investor in the company last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes had cast a pall of uncertainty over At Home's
long-term future and prevented the company from moving as quickly
as some executives would have liked to take advantage of the
surging demand for high-speed Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten to a point where the lack of clarity, the lack of
alignment, was getting in our way on getting important things
done,'' C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman, said in an interview
Wednesday. ``This is the Internet space. You've got to operate at
Net speed, and we were having a hard time doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to end the confusion both in At Home's boardroom and
among public investors, Wednesday's deal gave AT&AMP;T full control _
though not ownership _ of the company. At Home's two other major
shareholders, Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc., agreed to
step down from At Home's board and to give up veto power.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will be left with 74 percent voting control of At Home,
leading AT&AMP;T to say that it would consolidate At Home's future
financial results into its own. AT&AMP;T said the move would reduce its
earnings this year by 5 cents a share. Shares of AT&AMP;T rose $1.125,
to $60.5625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's ascendance was part of a complicated array of
announcements Wednesday that were meant to clarify At Home's
prospects and strategic direction. One of the first companies to
recognize that cable lines could deliver torrents of data from
cyberspace, At Home has been considered a highly promising, if
slightly dysfunctional member, of the Internet vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a decision it made last year, At Home said Wednesday
that it had canceled its plans to issue a separately traded stock
meant to track the company's media assets, primarily the Excite Web
portal.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, AT&AMP;T, Comcast and Cox said they had agreed
to extend their use of At Home's communications network and to
extend their deals to display the Excite portal prominently on
users' computer screens. Under their previous agreement, the three
cable carriers had given At Home the exclusive right to deliver
Internet service over their cable systems through 2002. Those
exclusive arrangements will still end, but under Wednesday's deal
AT&AMP;T agreed to maintain the Excite portal's prominence through
2008, and Cox and Comcast made a similar pledge to extend through
2006.
</P>
<P>
   After the exclusive deals run out in two years, AT&AMP;T, Comcast
and Cox will continue to use At Home's network to deliver
electronic content and services that may come from other companies,
perhaps Yahoo Inc. or America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant theme, however, of Wednesday's announcements was
AT&AMP;T's new role of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year, it has been an interesting time _ in or
out, back, forth, what's it going to be, what isn't it going to
be,'' Thomas A. Jermoluk, At Home's chairman, said Wednesday in an
interview, referring to AT&AMP;T's unsettled relationship with his
company. ``Really it was time for AT&AMP;T in particular to make a
conscious decision about where their Internet strategy was going to
take them and what their relationship would be with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast and Cox will hardly leave At Home's board empty-handed.
The two companies each own about 8 percent of At Home, or about 30
million shares. Under Wednesday's deal, Cox and Comcast each won
the right to sell their stakes to AT&AMP;T for at least $48 a share at
any time between next January and June 2002. (If At Home's shares
are trading above $48 if and when Cox and Comcast decide to sell,
AT&AMP;T would not have to buy the companies' entire stakes.) At Home's
shares closed at $37.6875 Wednesday, up $3.375, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Comcast also won the right to cancel their entire deals
with At Home after June 2001. The companies, however, will have
strong incentives to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Cox and Comcast each won the right to purchase
two shares of At Home for each household to which their standard
cable television service is available, a total that could reach
more than 35 million shares. The price at which Cox and Comcast
will be allowed to purchase those shares was not announced
Wednesday, but executives involved in the deal said it was about
$30.
</P>
<P>
   Because it agreed to extend its relationship with At Home
through 2008, AT&AMP;T will be allowed to buy up to about 50 million
shares on the same terms, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The catch for Comcast and Cox is that their right to purchase
those shares will vest gradually through 2006. If they opt out of
their deals with At Home, the companies will forfeit those rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outset, we have viewed Excite(at)Home as an
invaluable strategic partner,'' Brian L. Roberts, Comcast's
president, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   David Woodrow, Cox's executive vice president for business
development, said in a statement, ``We are pleased to extend our
relationship with Excite(at)Home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, Comcast and Cox have not been pleased to
confront AT&AMP;T in At Home's boardroom. For much of last year, AT&AMP;T
had said that the Excite Web portal had little place in the same
company with the At Home cable modem service, arguing that
investors would not give the combined entity full financial credit
for the strength of such disparate operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Comcast were strong believers that Excite and At Home
should remain in the same stock, prompting a furious battle. AT&AMP;T
eventually won out.
</P>
<P>
   But a curious thing happened on the way to the new stock's
initial public offering: America Online's deal to acquire Time
Warner. That marriage between the No. 1 Internet provider and the
No. 2 cable television company prompted AT&AMP;T to reconsider its
stance on the marriage of Excite and At Home, executives close to
both AT&AMP;T and At Home said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, AT&AMP;T essentially changed its mind, leading At Home
to announce Wednesday that it had canceled the plan for a new
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step in the AT&AMP;T Internet strategy,''
Armstrong said. ``We've just acquired a terrific involvement and
relationship with one of the leading portals and one of the leading
broadband communications companies.''

EBAY FOUNDERS PLEDGE $10 MILLION TO TUFTS

<P>
   Pam Wesley wanted a place where she and other collectors could
trade their Pez candy dispensers. Her boyfriend _ a computer
programmer named Pierre Omidyar _ built her eBay Inc., the biggest
auction site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now the couple, married in February 1999, plan to invest $10
million in their alma mater, Tufts University outside Boston. The
donation, which will be spread over the next five years, will help
launch the new College of Citizenship and Public Service this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The investment will also fund financial aid packages for 24
undergraduates annually, plus projects that encourage students to
become more civically involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pam and I hope this new program will educate future business
leaders, artists, and computer scientists alike to the personal
impact they can have on and off the job in addressing society's
most pressing issues,'' Pierre Omidyar, eBay's chairman, said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Omidyar, a Boston native who received a biology degree from
Tufts in 1989, played a strong role in the decision to make the
award to the school. Her mother and grandfather also attended the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they're wealthy beyond their dreams, the Omidyars and
others who have gotten rich quick in the high-tech industry are
increasingly dipping into their fortunes to help schools and
charities.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Patrick J. McGovern Jr., founder of International
Data Group in Boston, said he would give an estimated $350 million
to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over the next two
decades. The donation, which will go toward brain research, was the
largest donation ever bestowed on a university.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation promised $1
billion for a program that will help 20,000 minority students
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Omidyar, a computer science major from California,
started building eBay in 1995. Since then, the online auction site
has attracted more than 10 million registered users. Sales more
than quadruped last year to $224.7 million. And unlike many
dot-coms, eBay posted a profit, earning $10.8 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before the San Jose, Calif., company's initial public offering
in September 1998, Omidyar stepped aside to make room for former
Hasbro executive Margaret Whitman, now eBay's chief executive. He
holds stock options in the company worth billions.
</P>
<P>
   The Omidyars split their time between Paris, where Pierre
Omidyar was born, and California. Their goal: to give away 99
percent of their fortune during their lifetimes, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the new Omidyar Foundation made its first large
pledge, $1 million to New Profit Inc., a Boston venture
philanthropy firm, said Lorna Lathram, executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's most recent pledge will be among the largest ever
made to Tufts, said John DiBiaggio, the school's president. Last
year, Tufts alumnus Bernard Gordon, founder of Analogic Corp.,
donated $20 million to his alma mater. Tufts has received several
$10 million gifts.
</P>
<P>
   A robust economy, driven in large part by dot-coms and other
technology firms, has been a boon to university fund-raisers. But
many schools accustomed to coddling Old World wealth over years are
discovering the new moneymakers operate at a faster pace and are
willing to give larger first-time donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things they are finding is some of these young
philanthropists don't have time to go through long cultivation
processes,'' said Eugene Tempel, executive director of the Indiana
University Center on Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Omidyar and DiBiaggio started discussing a possible donation
less than a year ago and recently came to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a gift, that's an incredibly short time,'' DiBiaggio said.

TORNADO VICTIM DIED AFTER WARNING OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRISTY GONZALES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Howard Douglas Thornton .MDNM/banged on the
door of a small guard shack near the Montgomery Ward building and
told three people inside to take cover, because a tornado was
headed their way.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed the door and ran toward the warehouse, but before the
52-year-old father of five could make it to safety, he was swept
away by the storm he was warning people about, witnesses and police
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, an Arlington resident known as ``Doug'' to his family
and friends, was a quiet, hard-working family man, said his wife of
almost 29 years, Patty Thornton. His children described him as
neat, meticulous and quirky, a collector of Nutcracker figurines
and model ships.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon at her southwest Arlington home, Patty
Thornton tried to make sense of what happened to her husband, a
shuttle driver for American Delivery Service. He made frequent
trips around the Metroplex and to Oklahoma, mostly for Montgomery
Ward. In 1994, he received a driver of the year award from the
company in recognition of his safety record.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Thornton was not surprised that her husband tried to warn
others of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see him sitting back and watching something that
could hurt someone and not saying anything about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Thornton, 24, said her father probably considered the wooden
shack unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he figured he would be better off in the main building
than in that little rinky-dinky shack,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Godoy Jr., .MDNM/a Montgomery Ward maintenance worker who
watched the tornado rush toward the building, said perhaps Thornton
thought there was no room for him in the shed, which housed four
large desks. Godoy said he believes that Thornton saved the lives
of the supervisor, truck driver and security worker, who took
shelter under the desks inside the shack.
</P>
<P>
   As for the shack, ``It was completely gone,'' Godoy said.
Amazingly, the people inside were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   American Delivery Service President Chip Dorger .MDNM/said
Thornton worked for the company for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dedicated shuttle driver,'' he said. ``We're going to
miss a good employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, Patty Thornton .MDNM/was listening to weather
reports while her husband completed his driving logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the storm was headed more toward Meacham Field, so I
thought it would be all right and he said he'd leave before it got
bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm, the family drove to her husband's work site but
did not learn of his death until they returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton grew up in Oak Cliff, a Dallas suburb, and graduated
from Sunset High School. He enjoyed fishing and working in his
yard, said his brother, Fred Thornton, 44, of Cedar Hill, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Thornton decorated his study with his children's framed
awards and more than 30 photographs of his children and
grandchildren, including a 10-year-old granddaughter who lives at
the home. Her brother and sister were killed in a car wreck about
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around death a little too much for their ages,''
Patty Thornton said of her children. ``I have my moments when I
cry, but I know he's in a better place.''

 &HT;    One again: Seven-year separation ends for family torn by borders
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until last month, Silvia Umana had not seen two of her
children for seven years. She left them with her mother in
Nicaragua after she decided in 1993 to come to the United States,
an arduous four-month trip that would have been impossible with a
4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl. Umana entered this country
illegally and got a job cleaning offices and hotels in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She has known her children for years mainly as voices on the
phone and smiling faces in snapshots mailed from home. Now she is
one of dozens of parents from Nicaragua to be reunited with
children they last saw years ago. She and other Nicaraguans here
used a federal law to become legal residents. Now they're racing to
bring their children here and use that same law to make the kids
legal residents, too.
</P>
<P>
   They face a deadline of midnight Friday to apply for residency
under two laws designed to give legal status to illegal immigrants
from Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti. Nationally, the laws have so far
made legal residents of 47,500 Nicaraguans, 2,500 Cubans and 26,000
Haitians, said Dan Kane, spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The INS had estimated that 50,000 Nicaraguans and 10,000 Cubans
would obtain legal status through the Nicaraguan Adjustment and
Central American Relief Act of 1997. It estimated that 50,000
Haitians would become residents by taking advantage of the Haitian
Immigration Fairness Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Irmina Owens, director of immigration and legal services at the
Latin American Association in Atlanta, said her staff has helped
about 30 Nicaraguan children come here since January. Other
attorneys and advocacy groups have helped children, too, but the
INS said it does not have an estimate of the number of kids
reunited with parents through the law.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Owens said, she helped a man finalize paperwork for
the 10-year-old son he left in Nicaragua when the boy was 8 months
old. The boy ``wasn't so sure about the whole thing. It's a lot of
change,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers say metro Atlanta is home to 400 Nicaraguans, 6,000
Cubans and 3,000 Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans are requesting residency through a different law
that has no deadline. Haitians are not applying in large numbers
because many have lived in the United States for years and have
become legal residents _ by marrying a U.S. citizen, for example _
by the time they come to Atlanta, said Andre Lubin, general manager
of Radio Savannah, a station serving Haitians that broadcasts in
Creole and French to 3,000 people with special receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that fewer Haitians have applied is because the
regulations for Haitians are tighter than for Nicaraguans. A
Haitian who entered the United States on a forged passport, for
example, is ineligible even though a Nicaraguan who did that is
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   About 260,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and
some Eastern European countries qualify for benefits that could
lead to legal status, but they do not face a deadline. About 29,000
of those eligible have applied, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering extending the deadline, and several
senators have asked President Clinton to create a grace period for
those who miss Friday's cutoff. No decision has been made on either
proposal, and government officials and immigrant advocates urge
anyone who plans to apply to do so before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Faulkner, an assistant director for the INS district
covering Georgia and three nearby states, said the INS office in
downtown Atlanta will remain open until midnight Friday to take
applications. He said he does not expect crowds because most
eligible immigrants already have filed.
</P>
<P>
   Umana, 32, left home when she was 25. She traveled for four
months by foot, train, horse and boat through Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico to get to this country.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Atlanta, she called her children often and ``cried and
cried'' after hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,460 miles away, in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, her
children also felt the pangs of separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I thought about her I cried,'' said her son, Moises, 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote to my mom,'' said Umana's daughter, Katya, 14. ``It
was hard, but I had a nice grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   They flew to the United States and had a tearful airport reunion
with their mother last month. Now they're getting to know a
2-year-old brother, Robert, and trying to adjust to new
surroundings. Katya is learning English at a DeKalb County school _
she can already say, ``Where are you from?'' and ``I'll see you
tomorrow!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a country of great opportunity where you can
study and learn more,'' she said in Spanish, ``but the weather is
very cold here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools are more modern,'' Moises said. ``The buildings
are big.''

CONGRESS MOVES CLOSER TO A DEAL ON APPEALS PROCESS FOR HMO
PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators said Wednesday that they
had made progress toward agreement on an appeals process for
patients wrongly denied care by health maintenance organizations, a
major unresolved issue in legislation to define patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   House members and senators from both parties said they had
agreed, in principle, that all HMO patients should be able to
appeal the denial of benefits to an independent panel of medical
experts. Republican and Democratic staff members have been
discussing the details of such appeal procedures for the last five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have already agreed on a few other issues, including a
requirement for HMOs to cover emergency care in any situation where
a ``prudent layperson'' would consider it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties see the appeal procedures as one of the
most important provisions of a bill defining patients' rights. The
House and the Senate passed different versions of the legislation
last year, and negotiators from the two chambers said they were
making slow but steady progress toward a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators said they wanted to agree on appeal procedures
before they moved on to the more contentious question of whether
patients would have a new federal right to sue HMOs for injuries
caused by the delay or denial of care. Lawmakers said they assumed
that there would be some new right to sue; President Clinton
insists that patients should have such a right. But Republicans
hope that strong, effective appeal procedures will reduce the
number of patients who feel compelled to sue. In most cases, they
say, the appeals process will work much faster than the courts.
</P>
<P>
   David Schnittger, a spokesman for Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio,
said, ``Many Republicans see a strong external review system, in
which independent doctors resolve claims disputes, as the most
effective patient protection we can devise.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that he and other members
of the conference committee had made ``important progress'' toward
an agreement on appeals, but that he wished the conferees would
move faster.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Osterberg, a spokeswoman for Sen. Don Nickles, the
Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the conference committee,
said: ``We are getting close to a consensus on appeals. We are
taking time to be sure it's done right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers generally agree that doctors who rule on a patient's
appeal should be independent of the HMO, and should be bound by the
terms of any insurance contract that provides health benefits to
the patient. But Democrats, some Republicans and consumer advocates
insist that the HMO's definition of ``medical necessity'' should
not be binding on the people who decide a patient's appeal. In
other words, the members of the appeals panel would exercise their
own judgment about whether a particular service was medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Such seemingly technical questions can be vital to patients.
Rep. Greg Ganske, an Iowa Republican who is a surgeon, said HMOs
sometimes ``manipulate the term `medically necessary' to avoid
covering costly procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ganske said, HMOs often refuse to pay for surgery
on children to correct cleft lip and cleft palate, contending that
such procedures are a form of cosmetic surgery and are therefore
not covered by the insurance policy. But Ganske said that in many
cases the surgery was not a cosmetic procedure, because without it
children could not eat or speak properly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise legislation, lawmakers said, if a health
plan promised to cover 30 days of hospital care for people with a
mental illness, the appeals board could not order coverage for a
31st day. But Democrats want to make sure that patients have an
independent way of determining whether the HMO is right in saying
that a particular service is limited or excluded under the terms of
a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers often refuse to pay for experimental treatments.
Democrats and some Republicans like Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia
say patients must be able to challenge an HMO's decision about what
is experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said that an unusual and interesting dynamic
had developed in negotiations on the patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they said, Senate Republicans pull aside Democrats from
the House and the Senate, hoping to make deals, and House
Republicans are excluded from the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles, the assistant Republican leader of the Senate, has made
clear that he wants to wrap up an agreement before the discussions
are embroiled in the politics of election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers and congressional aides said Nickles had excluded
House Republicans from some discussions as part of a strategy to
speed the negotiations. Other participants said it was difficult to
deal with the House Republicans as a group because they did not
have a uniform stance on the legislation. By contrast, the Senate
Republican negotiators present a united front, and Democrats from
the two chambers agree among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In October, when the House passed its version of the
legislation, 68 House Republicans rebelled against their party
leadership and joined more than 200 Democrats in passing a bill
supported by Clinton.

UNILEVER EMERGES AS SUITOR OF BEN &AMP; JERRY'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unlikely matchup between Unilever, the global consumer goods
giant, and a group of socially oriented investors emerged Wednesday
as the likely buyer of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., the ice-cream
icon of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in South Burlington, Vt., confirmed that it
``is in discussions'' with Ben &AMP; Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen,
Unilever, and Meadowbrook Lane Capital for a deal that could take
the publicly traded company private.
</P>
<P>
   A sale to private investors would cap an up-and-down history for
Vermont's most renowned company. After being founded in 1978 in a
Vermont gas station, Ben &AMP; Jerry's pioneered superpremium ice cream
with flavors such as Cherry Garcia and Cookie Dough.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as its founders were seeking to step back
from active management, the company faced stronger competition as
other ice cream makers consolidated. Last year, while sales
continued to rise, the company's earnings and stock price fell
sharply, opening the way for takeover offers.
</P>
<P>
   A ``going private'' offer was presented to the Ben &AMP; Jerry's
board of directors last Thursday, the company said in a statement,
and while ``there are a number of unresolved issues that would have
to be agreed upon,'' the talks are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, citing as its source a shareholder who was
briefed on the deal, reported Wednesday that an announcement could
be made as soon as Friday. The offer was reported to be $38 per
share, or 27 percent above Wednesday's closing price, which would
value the company at about $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   Following that report, Ben &AMP; Jerry's shares rose $4.40625
Wednesday to close at $38.375, a 15 percent gain for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the proposed deal appears to allow Ben &AMP; Jerry's
to maintain its image as a socially concious company as well as its
activism in promoting environmental and social causes and
campaigning for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a win for Ben Cohen, who will be able to keep
the company independent and perpetuate its social mission, for its
shareholders who support that mission, and for the people of
Vermont, who feel so strongly about the company,'' James Barrett,
an analyst with Josephthal &AMP; Co., said.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch giant whose products include Lipton
teas, Dove soaps, Gorton's seafood and Breyer's ice cream, was
among companies rumored to be behind a bid for control of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's reported by the company last December. While not naming the
bidder, the company said the offer was about $145 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowbrook Lane Capital lists Northhampton as its home and
reportedly counts Terry Mollner, a Western Massachusetts social
activist, among its leaders. Philadelphia restaurateur Judith
Wicks, a leader of the San Francisco-based Social Venture Network,
previously identified herself as a Meadowbrook investor.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Greenfield control just under half the voting stock in
Ben &AMP; Jerry's, all but assuring that they can continue to wield
control over the company's direction, Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the likelihood of this going through is extremely
good,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by a company spokesman, Jerry Greenfield,
who founded Ben &AMP; Jerry's with Cohen in 1978, denied the Times'
report that ``a rift'' between the two had developed because the
deal would leave Greenfield with no control in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been friends since we met over 35 years ago in junior
high school where we were the two slowest and fattest kids in our
gym class,'' the statement said. ``Today we are slower and fatter
and better friends than ever. We expect that trend to continue.''

NO ROOF, NO WALL, BUT STILL ALIVE

(EDS: Accompanies TORNADO-TEXAS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As paramedics lifted him into the ambulance,
David Johnson looked back at the house in which he has lived for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the roof is off,'' said the 70-year-old man, whose
house stood near Montgomery Ward west of downtown Fort Worth. ``And
the east wall of the house was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who suffered a gashed stomach, was buried under debris
in his damaged house.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he was within hours of being discharged from Harris
Methodist Fort Worth, and was trying to decide what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   He owns the two-bedroom house on Mercedes Avenue and has
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his finances depend on Social Security. The only possessions
he's sure he still has are in one plastic bag: the clothes he wore
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He left the house without his glasses. Hospital staff members
have been helping him look up phone numbers as he calls his
insurance company and tracks down a place to live temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he talks about how the wind swept out of nowhere. He was
doing yardwork with his roommate, Gregory Bufano, when the debris
started flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get back into the house to get into the
bathtub, because I have a cast-iron bathtub,'' Johnson said. ``I
was hugging the back wall of the house to get back into the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Bufano, who still had dried blood on his ear Wednesday, helped
rescue Johnson and load him into the ambulance. But he lost track
of where Johnson had gone, until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a grandfather to me,'' Bufano said.

   Writer/journalist Holly Morris has hit upon a revelation: Take a
camera crew with you on your vacation, and even if no one knows who
you are, you'll get preferential treatment and access to folks who
otherwise wouldn't give you the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Adventure Divas Cuba: Paradox Found,'' Morris wanders
peripatetically around the land of Castro and hooks up with a
female hip-hop trio, a filmmaker, a feminist broadcaster, an exiled
Black Panther, an author of erotic poetry and a Santeria priestess.
The idea is to locate and ascertain the perspectives of women of
substance in foreign locales, but even Morris tires of her goal at
points, running off to go fishing for a day, playing with her
favorite tchotchke that she brought from home, or just grousing
that she feels ``cranky.''
</P>
<P>
   She says things like, ``The sensual is a food group here,'' and,
of men ogling women, observes, ``Somehow it lacks the icky feeling
it has at home,'' a statement that seems simultaneously naive and
condescending. Nonetheless, she's a predominantly winning tour
guide, though her ``you go, girl'' vibe will strike some viewers as
a little on the too-cute side.
</P>
<P>
   This special purports to be the first of a series of programs
touring exotic destinations in search of strong and colorful women.
In truth, however, it looks more like a calling card for Morris to
find a gig with one of those TV newsmagazines that are increasingly
proliferating where the emphasis is on subjectivity and the
correspondent's persona and less on substantive reporting. For
which Morris, with a keener segment producer and sterner editor at
her service, would seem a natural. &QL; 
_______ &QL; 
The show: ``'Adventure Divas Cuba: Paradox Found.'' &QL; 
What: Travelogue with a feminist slant. &QL; 
The stars: Holly Morris hosts. &QL; 
Where: PBS. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

CISCO BUYING NET FIRM SIGHTPATH FOR $800M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. is continuing its
expansion in Massachusetts by acquiring an Internet data-delivery
firm for $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   SightPath Inc., founded in 1998 by researchers at MIT, uses
software and hardware to create storehouses of Internet data nearer
to the end user. The system is designed to make it easier for
companies and individuals to use Internet services that demand lots
of bandwidth, such as video broadcasting. Cisco will incorporate
SightPath's software into its existing hardware products.
</P>
<P>
   ``SightPath had been moving up to be one of the leaders in this
space,'' said Matthew Barzowskas, vice president of First Albany
Corp. in Boston. It makes sense, he said, for Cisco to acquire the
company to fill out its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is the world's leading producer of networking hardware for
use in the Internet and in corporate networks. Nearly every piece
of data on the Internet passes through Cisco equipment during some
part of its journey.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cisco passed Microsoft Corp. to become the world's
most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization
of about $527.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further proof that content distribution networks are
going to be a big area,'' said Jim Ricotta, president and CEO of
SightPath, which is based in Waltham, Mass. He and the 76 employees
of SightPath will continue to develop the technology as a business
unit within Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has been on an expansion binge. ``They like to say this is
a way to get continual injections of start-up DNA into the
company,'' Ricotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the SightPath deal, Cisco had spent $3 billion to
acquire eight New England firms since 1994. The San Jose, Calif.,
company also plans to build a New England development center that
could employ up to 5,000 workers within five years.

 &HT;    Al-Amin's car found in Alabama
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ The black Mercedes-Benz police say sped away
from a shootout that left one Fulton County, Ga., deputy fatally
shot and another wounded, was found Wednesday afternoon in the same
Alabama town where accused killer Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it,'' Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner said a
couple of hours after the vehicle was located in White Hall. ``It's
got a lot of bullet holes, probably from the shooting, but it's
being impounded and it will be tested in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents found the car around midafternoon, Vaughner said, but
he would not elaborate on the circumstances that led authorities to
the vehicle. The car, equipped with a sun roof, was discovered on
County Road 17, near the only school in the rural town 25 miles
west of Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle was towed in the middle of a blinding rainstorm on
Ala. 80 from White Hall on a flat-bed truck just before 5 p.m. CST.
About 25 minutes later, the tow truck, owned by Waldrip Wrecking of
Montgomery, delivered the Mercedes to the parking lot of the
Montgomery Police Department's crime scene bureau. At least one
bullet hole was evident on the passenger side door.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Howard Kenney, commander of the bureau, would not comment on
the vehicle, saying only, ``We are assisting the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wasn't saying much about the car either, and it was
unclear whether the vehicle would be processed for evidence in
Montgomery or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Celeste Armstead confirmed that the
Mercedes-Benz was the car authorities have been looking for since
March 16, when deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English were
shot. ``We believe it is the car that Al-Amin reportedly fled in,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, 35, was critically wounded and died the next day.
English, 28, was seriously injured. English later identified
Al-Amin, a former black militant known as H. Rap Brown, as the
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy told Atlanta police he and Kinchen spotted Al-Amin
standing by a black Mercedes-Benz outside his grocery store in
Atlanta that night as they attempted to serve him with a Cobb
County, Ga., arrest warrant. The warrant originated from Al-Amin's
failure to appear in court on several charges, including theft by
receiving a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Al-Amin opened fire on the deputies when they
approached him just after 10 p.m. and asked him to show his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said her officers fired at
Al-Amin at least 10 times with department-issued .40-caliber guns.
Ballistics tests should show whether the bullet holes in the
Mercedes came from shots the deputies fired.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Alabama authorities found the Georgia license
plate belonging to the Mercedes-Benz behind a restaurant on Freedom
Road in White Hall, Vaughner said. The small cafe was once operated
by Al-Amin, but has been closed for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Alabama authorities are still trying to find out
whether someone helped Al-Amin get from Atlanta to White Hall after
the deputies were shot. They are also trying to determine who in
White Hall might have harbored Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mercedes-Benz was being unloaded at the Montgomery Police
Department, Montgomery County Sheriff D.T. Marshall announced that
extradition papers for Al-Amin had arrived from Gov. Roy Barnes'
office.
</P>
<P>
   Selma lawyer J.L. Chestnut, who is representing Al-Amin, filed a
motion Wednesday in Montgomery County Court requesting a court
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition process could take two weeks to two months,
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he would serve Al-Amin the warrant in his jail
cell either Wednesday night or this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get Mr. Al-Amin back to Georgia where he
belongs,'' Marshall said.

SERIES ON MENTALLY ILL EXHAUSTING, WONDERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: A-  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's ``ER'' is a repeat. So why not check into
``Wonderland'' on ABC? It's new. It's interesting. It's possible
you'll never check out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' is from Peter Berg, who for three seasons played
the slightly bizarre, hockey-playing Dr. Kronk on ``Chicago Hope.''
With backing from Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Tony Krantz at
Imagine Television, Berg created a drama that'll either scare the
ohmigosh out of people (and cause them to swear off ``Wonderland''
forever), or hook 'em good.
</P>
<P>
   The prize in this case is complete intellectual engagement. But
be warned: The cost may be emotional exhaustion because
``Wonderland'' is about mental illness. Not the kind where the docs
on ``ER'' request a psychiatric consult and the patient is never
seen again, or the kind where a guy kills in a psychotic rage on
``NYPD Blue'' and is locked up forever. It's about prolonged
exposure to the behavior ``normal'' people consider ``abnormal.''
Week in and week out. For as long as ABC is willing to go at it in
TV's toughest time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted as it is against ``ER,'' ``Wonderland'' probably has as
much chance of ratings success as I have of winning the lottery.
(And I don't buy lottery tickets.) So, either ABC has placed the
series in its lambs-to-the-slaughter file, or it genuinely is not
worried about ratings because the show is so good it deserves to be
on the air as an example of ABC's well-known commitment to quality
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ABC hopes the enormous audience for ``Who Wants To Be
a Millionaire'' at 9 will stay put at 10 and give ``Wonderland'' a
huge opening night. With NBC airing an old ``ER'' at 10, it's
possible: ``ER'' reruns don't score well. And last week, an ABC
News program, ``The John Stossel Special: You Can't Say That!'' did
manage to crack the Nielsen Top 20 going up against ``ER.'' But
where the Thursday ``Millionaire'' delivered an audience of 17.4
million homes last week, according to Nielsen Media Research,
``Stossel'' was seen in only 9.6 million homes (compared to 18.4
million for a new episode of ``ER.'')
</P>
<P>
   This kind of audience slippage drives network executives crazy.
No doubt they'd be welcome in the psychiatric ward of Rivervue
Hospital, where the walls are soft, the doors are locked and sharp
implements are taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after New York's storied Bellevue Hospital, Rivervue
is where ``Wonderland'' takes place. It's a noisy, clattering
public facility where gifted-but-harried doctors handle unrealistic
caseloads, where the patients scream and twitch and lash out and
hallucinate and generally do things that ``stable'' people find
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Berg obviously finds it fascinating, but after watching two
episodes back to back, I was dishrag city. Do I want to tune in
again? Right now, yes. Can I commit to such emotional mayhem every
week? I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of ``Wonderland'' is in writing that allows the
actors to improvise, and acting that allows viewers to empathize.
The effect is a heightened realism that never loosens its grip.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable Ted Levine leads a fine ensemble cast that also
includes Michelle Forbes, who was always my favorite player on
``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' Levine is Dr. Robert Banger, the
brooding but likable head of the forensic psychiatry department,
which deals in the criminal side of things. Forbes is Dr. Lyla
Garrity, director of the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency
Program, a critical-response facility for people suffering
psychiatric emergencies. She's married to Dr. Neil Harrison (Martin
Donovan), another forensic specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that not everything on ``Wonderland'' is ``Cuckoo's
Nest'' revisited. The doctors have private lives, too. Banger's
marriage is failing and he's fighting to retain custody of the
kids. Garrity and Harrison are expecting, but the health of the
child may be compromised. Other staffers have the usual endearing
traits and peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   As with most shows that challenge their viewers, ``Wonderland''
is like crunchy peanut butter. It's richly textured and will stick
to the roof of your mind long after the credits roll. But its aim
is clear and noble: to publicly pay attention, in a sympathetic,
compassionate way, to one of society's most marginalized groups.
</P>
<P>
   Berg slams it home in episode two, in a scene that pits Banger
against a defense lawyer, even though both want to help a patient
who shot and killed five people in Times Square. Banger wants to
medicate the man to control his manic episodes; the lawyer wants to
keep the man off medication to enhance his plea of insanity. As
they argue strategy in front of the patient and his family, the
man's distraught father shouts: ``He's my son! My son who got into
Columbia and loves Chinese food and rock climbing in the Catskills.
My son, whose dream was to build a boat and follow the journey of
`The Odyssey.' He's my son! He has a name! You call him by his
name!''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reasonable request. The bigger question is: How many
times are we willing to hear it?
</P>
<P>
   Wonderland. One-hour drama series about the doctors who handle
the psychiatric cases at a New York City hospital. Starring Ted
Levine, Michelle Forbes, Martin Donovan, Billy Burke, Michael Jai
White and Joelle Carter. Series premiere Thursday night on ABC.
Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ADASIYE, Lebanon _ When Lt. Col. Robin Abboud looks down from
his home high in the rugged hills of southern Lebanon, the view is
of Israel. Less than 500 yards away lies the border fence topped
with electrified barbed wire, and beyond it a military road flanked
by minefields that snakes steeply uphill to an Israeli army post
bristling with radars and lookout towers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israel that the 42-year-old Lebanese colonel sees most
plainly is the Israel that lies beyond the bands of steel _ the
Israel represented, a few miles down a lush valley visible from his
veranda, by the town of Qiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of neat green fields, gleaming apartment blocks and
tidy industrial zones, the town looks like a poster for all that
Israel has carved out of these stony biblical lands during the last
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare the history of Israel and the Arabs, of Judaism and
Islam, if you will,'' Abboud said over Arab pastries and thimble
cups of thick Turkish coffee in his living room. ``The Arab past
has been a history of deception, of rivalry and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at the Jews _ how they decided, after the Holocaust,
to establish Israel, to commit themselves to each other and to
create the only real democracy in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the vision makes for a stark contrast with Lebanon,
where progress has been confounded by years of religious and ethnic
enmity and a civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990. Lately,
though, Abboud's view has been tinged with melancholy and even
fear.
</P>
<P>
   For Abboud, the colonel, an Arab and a Shiite Muslim, is also _
in the eyes of a Lebanese military court _ a traitor, sentenced in
absentia to life imprisonment at hard labor for having served more
than two decades in a militia force allied to Israel in its
military presence in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Now Israel is preparing to leave, and as a member of the South
Lebanon Army, or SLA _ , a 3,000-member militia of Lebanese
Muslims, Christians and Druse _ Abboud is more than ever a marked
man.
</P>
<P>
   The critical moment came this month when the Israeli cabinet
endorsed a campaign pledge made last year by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to withdraw the 1,500-soldier Israeli contingent back into
Israel by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, from the SLA militia's viewpoint, the Israeli
cabinet decided to complete the pullout with or without an
agreement with Lebanon and Syria. The Syrians effectively control
most of Lebanon through the 35,000 troops they maintain beyond the
military buffer zone that Israel controls within nine miles of its
border.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The territory Israel is vacating has become a curious hybrid, a
place where the resentments that its presence engenders have been
offset by advantages: superior roads and other public services,
like water and power, stores richly stocked with foreign goods
imported duty free through Israel, and _ at least for SLA officers
and their families _ prosperity unrivaled elsewhere in rural
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also an elusive sense of lifelessness and a lack of
authenticity, as if this were no more than a stage set, to be
dismantled when the players move on.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the villages are half-deserted, abandoned by residents
who long since migrated north to other parts of Lebanon or abroad.
In shops and cafes, people not working for the Israelis or their
Lebanese allies shy away when approached by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hills and valleys held by the Israelis, flanked by the
Mediterranean to the west and the snowy peaks of Mount Hermon to
the east, have been marked by the ebb and flow of conquest for
thousands of years. The Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans, the
Ottoman Turks, the British and the French all left their traces
before being driven out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 22 years, the retreating power is Israel, and the
repercussions for the South Lebanon Army are profound.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement among Israel, Syria and Lebanon setting
terms for the withdrawal, the men of the militia force, and
possibly even the 5,000 other residents of the buffer zone who work
in Israel _ in total, counting families, about a quarter of the
120,000 residents of the zone _ appear to be prime targets for
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary members of the militia, many little more than
conscripts, Lebanese officials have said the punishment will be
prison terms _ probably of a year, possibly two or three _ but the
outlook for the force's 350 officers is grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   A small flicker of hope remains in the possibility of a peace
agreement between Israel and Syria before the July withdrawal date,
which would enable Israel to negotiate the terms for withdrawal
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Israeli-Syrian peace talks deadlocked, President
Emile Lahoud of Lebanon has ruled out talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, SLA officers say that with the Israeli deadline
near at hand, too little time may be left for negotiations.
Anxieties have been heightened by warnings from the leaders of
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, the Shiite Muslim militant group
backed by Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the Muslim cleric who leads Hezbollah,
has described the South Lebanon Army's soldiers as ``criminal
collaborators who must be tried for treason,'' and has warned
Western countries inclined to offer the militiamen refuge that
they, too, should expect to ``treated as enemies'' by Hezbollah.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, pledges of lenient treatment for defectors that
Hezbollah held out several years ago have been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent speculation in Israel that militia members
may have tried to curry favor with Hezbollah by tipping its
guerrillas about Israeli military movements _ thus resulting in a
wave of casualties suffered by Israeli forces earlier this year _
Hezbollah leaders say it is ``too late now'' for the militiamen to
switch sides in hope of being spared.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30 a Hezbollah bomb assassinated the SLA's top field
commander, Col. Akl Hashem, as he walked his dog in his native
village near here. For Hezbollah the attack was second only to its
most startling operational success, the roadside bomb in February
1999 that killed Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, the 36-year-old Israeli
officer who was the main liaison to the militia. He was the
highest-ranking Israeli soldier to die since Israel declared the
border area its ``security zone'' in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Hezbollah has shown its ability to infiltrate
deep into the occupied zone and pick off militia members at will.
</P>
<P>
   It announced in early March that it had carried out a ``death
sentence'' against a corporal in the militia's security branch. The
man, a Shiite Muslim, was saying goodbye to his wife and children
after breakfast at his home in the village of Markabe, two miles
south of Colonel Abboud's home in Adasiye, when a Hezbollah hit man
shot him in the head with a silenced pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has prompted scores of defections from the militia
and prompted discussions within the Israeli high command about an
accelerated withdrawal if the Lebanese force begins to
disintegrate. The militia maintains many of the 90 hillside forts
that are the backbone of the Israeli zone, and undertake risky road
patrols and door-to-door searches. Its scouts are stationed in
every Israeli post.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Israel seems to have decided there is no future
for the militia inside Lebanon, but it is against providing refuge
in Israel. Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said
that ``bringing the members of the South Lebanon Army and their
families to Israel and transforming them into refugees is not a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to a report in Yediot Ahronot, an Israeli
newspaper, Israel has identified 200 senior officers who with their
families will be accepted as refugees elsewhere, most likely in the
United States, Canada, France and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also said to be preparing an indemnity fund. Israeli
newspapers have suggested that it will involve an average severance
payout of $30,000, with a maximum, for senior officers, of $175,000
_ sums apparently to be funded from the $74 million that Barak has
set as the cost of a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats have said Israel has been told that there is no
possibility that the sum will be met by increased American
subsidies to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is much solace to men like onel Abboud. Like all
SLA men, the colonel wears an olive green Israeli army uniform,
with the Hebrew acronym for ``Israeli Defense Forces'' above his
left breastpocket.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Israeli military colleges with distinction.
And last year his 15-year-old daughter, Zeinab, was saved by
Israeli doctors who performed a double heart valve replacement
operation at Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva
outside Tel Aviv, with Israel absorbing the $80,000 cost.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel can barely disguise his sense of abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Of his Israeli military counterparts, Abboud had only praise,
saying, ``We have shed blood together, and that is the strongest of
all bonds.'' But for Israeli politicians, the colonel had a barely
disguised contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth means nothing in politics,'' he said. ``You have only to
compare what Benjamin Netanyahu was saying only two years ago with
what Barak is saying now to see that. In politics, there is no
principle, only self-interest, whether it be individuals or
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Shi'ite Muslim, Abboud has particular reason for concern.
For the moment, he is rejecting emigration with his wife and eight
children, perhaps to Canada, where he has a sister, but staying in
Lebanon is clearly not an option.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, at the house of another SLA officer, a visit
to the washroom led past a kitchen where fitted appliances had been
pulled from the walls. In the next room, a mass of personal
belongings, including furniture and exercise equipment, had been
stacked, apparently for packing.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the prospect of being driven from their homeland,
possibly for ever, the SLA officers, many of whom were low-ranking
corporals and sergeants in the Lebanese army before the Israeli
occupation, stand to lose luxuries accumulated over the years of
Israeli occupation _late-model BMWs and Mercedes-Benz, sumptuous
homes with pink granite facings, marbled floors and copies of
18th-century French court furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents of the occupation zone said that Israeli
military commanders had turned a blind eye for years to corruption
and criminality among high-ranking SLA men. These practises are
said to have included drug-trafficking, protection rackets,
skimming of tax revenues, and vehicle-theft rings.
</P>
<P>
   But if the good life they have led suggests that SLA officers
made a Faustian deal in siding with Israel, the reality seems more
complex. As these men tell the militia's story, it grew from a
desire among people in southern Lebanon to protect themselves
against armed Palestinians who, in the 1970s, became a law unto
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel invaded in 1978 to halt Palestinian attacks across
the border, many Lebanese flocked to throw flowers on Israeli tanks
_ while others, now SLA veterans, say they took up arms alongside
the invaders as the only force that seemed capable of bringing
order.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the Palestinians were routed, matters became more
complicated still. Since the mid-1980s, Hezbollah has cast itself
in the role of a ``national resistance force.'' Then, in the 1990s,
Lebanese nationalism was rekindled from the rubble of the civil
war, when the country disintegrated into a mosaic of armed
fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the SLA was isolated. Abboud, looking back,
tells the story in a wistful tone. ``Things just developed,'' he
said, ``in ways none of us could have foreseen.''

DNA-MAPPING PROJECT PROGRESSING RAPIDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A far-flung network of computerized gene-readers has deciphered
the 2-billionth ``letter'' of humankind's DNA instruction manual,
the chief of the Human Genome Project said Wednesday as he
announced a new deadline of early June for the effort to be 90
percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly funded effort is reading 1,000 genetic sequences
per second as it nears the goal of decoding all 3.2 billion
chemical letters, known as base pairs, of the human genetic
blueprint by 2003, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the
National Human Genome Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is the complete set of 80,000 to 100,000 human genes
_ the material composed of DNA, which contains the code for all
inherited traits in humans. Completion of the map is expected to
provide insight into evolution as well as jump-start new treatments
and cures for a variety of diseases and symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome project is in very good shape,'' said Collins at a
briefing before addressing the Bio2000 conference that has drawn
more than 9,000 biotech officials and scientists to Boston. He said
that the genome project, by supplying the raw information that is
to be translated into a myriad of new drugs and medical tests, ``is
the feeder layer for this wonderful industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In ambition and complexity, the effort to read all the genetic
code contained in human cells rivals the Big Dig. But unlike that
troubled transportation project, the genome program, launched in
1990, is coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. Collins said
the 90-percent-complete working draft of the genome sequence will
cost about $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The project had expected to have the working draft by spring; it
will now be ``late May or early June,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins emphasized that the gene-reading robots in the United
States, England. and Japan are dumping their translation of the
chemical code into a public database every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news that we're moving so fast, but it's even better
news that researchers throughout the world are using this data now
to investigate the genetic underpinnings of health and diseases
ranging from Alzheimer's to diabetes,'' said Collins, who is a
geneticist and co-discoverer of the gene that causes cystic
fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a private genome company that is also racing to
finish sequencing the entire human genome is refusing to make
public its reading of the genetic blueprint until it is complete
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the company, Celera Genomics of Rockville, Md.,
has developed a plan under which subscribers (mainly pharmaceutical
companies) pay a hefty fee to access the data before it is made
public. The companies will be able to search for, and submit patent
applications on, any gene sequences they think may lead to
profitable medical products or treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's bid to finish sequencing the genome is financed by
hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, and the company
wants to recoup that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that the publicly funded project ``takes very
seriously the issue of having this resource in the public domain,''
which is why the robot gene-readers at the 16 public genome centers
are working as fast as possible to churn out the sequence data.
Once released publicly, the DNA sequence itself can't be patented,
but those who take the data and develop products from it can patent
those products.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a number of private companies have found thousands of
human genes within the genome independent of both the genome
project and Celera. They have filed for patent protection of those
genes, and hundreds of patents have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that while he agrees that companies need the
incentive of patent protection to carry out the costly development
of gene-based tests and drugs, they could slow the pace of
research.
</P>
<P>
   Collins called it a ``serious issue'' that could hamper
experiments involving the whole set of genes at once if many were
protected by patents. ``We want to understand how all the genes
work with each other in our `instruction book,' '' Collins said.
``You can understand how science could be impeded'' if researchers
had to pay royalties to different patent-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project's chief also said that government scientists
are creating databases of free mathematical tools that will help
researchers understand the genetic sequences being poured into
GenBank, the public databank for genome information. The rival
company, Celera, says that its strategy is to provide such
mathematical tools to its subscribers, for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to predict when the genome data might lead to health
benefits, Collins forecast that within five to seven years, it may
be possible to test an individual early in life to reveal
particular disease vulnerabilities over a lifetime. But, he said,
until treatments are developed, people may not want to have this
information.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are mainly interested in
genome information as a tool to make new ``designer drugs'' that
take into account peoples' genetic differences. This way, doctors
could prescribe specific drugs for patients that would be more
likely than today's pharmaceuticals to be effective without harmful
side effects. Collins predicted that such drugs are at least 15
years away.

JUDGE SAYS CLINTON'S RELEASE OF LETTERS VIOLATED WILLEY'S PRIVACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton released personal letters
from a woman who had accused him of making a sexual advance, he
illegally violated her privacy, a federal judge said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth found that Clinton had
committed ``a criminal violation of the Privacy Act'' in releasing
letters from Kathleen Willey in March 1998, after she accused him
in an appearance on the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' of making
an advance.
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the Privacy Act is a misdemeanor, and punishable
by up to 1 year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brushed off the judge's finding at a news conference
Wednesday. He and his counsel, Beth Nolan, said they would appeal
the judge's rulings, including one that White House lawyers submit
to questions from Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has
been a persistent critic of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch has sued the White House several times. The case
addressed by Lamberth Wednesday was a suit concerning the improper
transfer to the White House of hundreds of FBI files on former
appointees and employees of the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has contended that the transfer of
files, while wrong, was done in error rather than with malice.
Judicial Watch contends otherwise and is seeking $90 million on
behalf of people whose files were sent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the discovery process, Judicial Watch questioned the
release of the Willey letters, even though Willey is not a party to
the suit. White House aides refused to answer some of those
questions, leading to Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ordered White House lawyers to submit to questioning by
Judicial Watch within 20 days. The White House has balked at some
Judicial Watch questions before, especially ones pertaining to the
release of the Willey letters.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Clinton did not seem fazed by the order.
When a questioner noted that a White House lawyer had called
Lamberth ``a loose cannon,'' Clinton looked amused and replied,
``Well, he does seem to have somehow acquired a significant
percentage of the cases involving the White House.'' The judge was
appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that, before releasing Willey's letters, he had not
talked to anyone about the Privacy Act, which usually prohibits
release of information about a person from federal records without
that person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had released Willey's letters
``reluctantly, only because it was the only way I knew to refute
allegations that were made against me that were untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Willey, a former White House volunteer, said Clinton made an
improper advance in the fall of 1993. Her account added to the
burdens of a president then being investigated for his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and coping with a sexual-misconduct lawsuit
filed by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton released letters Willey had written him after the fall
of 1993, hoping that their friendly tone would deflate the
accusation that he had behaved improperly.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Lamberth said that when Clinton and his aides
released the letters, they surely knew of his 1997 finding that the
White House was bound by the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court cannot accept or condone this unlawful action,''
the judge wrote. He said there might have been no violation had the
letters been ``strictly personal'' and kept by the president
himself, instead of in White House records.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what, if anything, the independent
counsel Robert Ray would do about Lamberth's finding that the
president had acted illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan disagreed with Lamberth's ruling, saying that in 1975
Antonin Scalia _ then an assistant attorney general and now a
Supreme Court justice _ had advised officials that much of the
White House operation was not subject to the Privacy Act, and that
Republicans and Democrats had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly disagree with Judge Lamberth's opinion and are
confident it will be overturned,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also asked Wednesday about reports the White House
had a previously undisclosed computer disk with e-mail messages
from Lewinsky to two witnesses appearing before the grand jury that
investigated their affair. Asked why the disk was not turned over
sooner, Clinton said he believed that the material on the disk
``was known years ago,'' and that Nolan would clarify the issue
when she testifies on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of White House e-mail correspondences from 1996 to
1998, sought by a grand jury and congressional committees, was
electronically misplaced and never turned over to investigators.
The Justice Department is investigating.

CISCO BUYING NET FIRM SIGHTPATH FOR $800   MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Fixing dropped word in headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. is continuing its
expansion in Massachusetts by acquiring an Internet data-delivery
firm for $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   SightPath Inc., founded in 1998 by researchers at MIT, uses
software and hardware to create storehouses of Internet data nearer
to the end user. The system is designed to make it easier for
companies and individuals to use Internet services that demand lots
of bandwidth, such as video broadcasting. Cisco will incorporate
SightPath's software into its existing hardware products.
</P>
<P>
   ``SightPath had been moving up to be one of the leaders in this
space,'' said Matthew Barzowskas, vice president of First Albany
Corp. in Boston. It makes sense, he said, for Cisco to acquire the
company to fill out its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is the world's leading producer of networking hardware for
use in the Internet and in corporate networks. Nearly every piece
of data on the Internet passes through Cisco equipment during some
part of its journey.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cisco passed Microsoft Corp. to become the world's
most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization
of about $527.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further proof that content distribution networks are
going to be a big area,'' said Jim Ricotta, president and CEO of
SightPath, which is based in Waltham, Mass. He and the 76 employees
of SightPath will continue to develop the technology as a business
unit within Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has been on an expansion binge. ``They like to say this is
a way to get continual injections of start-up DNA into the
company,'' Ricotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the SightPath deal, Cisco had spent $3 billion to
acquire eight New England firms since 1994. The San Jose, Calif.,
company also plans to build a New England development center that
could employ up to 5,000 workers within five years.

 &HT;    Education may need new menu
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Education _ the issue polls big time this year, and
the candidates have enough differences to fight over. But with
little precedent for how to make it the centerpiece issue of a
presidential campaign, both Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush have fallen into the martial rhetoric of our previous
``wars'' on various social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kicked off his campaign with a promise to bring ``radical
change'' to the nation's schools from the White House. Bush,
rolling out his proposal this week to spend $5 billion to ensure
that every child can read by the third grade, called education a
``national emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   To many a frustrated parent, the need for radical change in a
student's math scores does rate as an emergency of pretty serious
proportions. But the proposals attached to this big-program
rhetoric amount to larger versions of the education initiatives
that have already become the staple of so many State of the State
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Very real problems exist in education, but in most states the
alarm bell has already been rung more than once.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been as widely recognized as such, but another factor
tends to dampen the din of both candidates' education rhetoric: the
spectacular success of so many of the recently educated.
</P>
<P>
   Not every engineering school dropout is doing as well as
Christopher Klaus, the 26-year-old entrepreneur who announced a $15
million gift to Georgia Tech on Tuesday, the same day Bush gave his
education speech.
</P>
<P>
   But enough young Americans have had early success in the new
economy to provide much of the philanthropical muscle needed to
tackle the problems of public schools. They also raise some
interesting questions about the priorities put forth in the crisis
rhetoric over education.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly literacy, in some broad sense, is fundamental to any
national education policy. But does it matter more, in terms of
their educational and professional trajectory, that fourth-grade
students be able to read the word ``mosquito'' (and maybe spell
``potato''), or that they know their way around the Windows menu
bar?
</P>
<P>
   Both abilities involve literacy in different forms, one worth
preserving and the other steadily evolving. But the spelling
abilities demonstrated on the Web sites of some promising startups
make a powerful argument for the relevance of the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   There may yet be a debate about what literacy really means, but
the exchanges between the two camps this week had some of the worst
characteristics of a bitter battle for a PTA presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign distributed copies of newspaper stories about
an unreleased Education Department report suggesting that the
improved test scores in Bush's Texas aren't reliable. Bush's
campaign quickly condemned the report as a taxpayer-funded piece of
political research. Much more of this, and the nation will
collectively long for a summer break from school.
</P>
<P>
   (In case you're curious, a check with Klaus' firm, ISS, revealed
that the Tech donor attended Roman Catholic parochial schools
through junior high, then went to a public high school in Sarasota,
Fla.)

JUSTICES TACKLE PRAYER ISSUE AT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court grappled Wednesday with prayer at
Texas high school football games, grilling attorneys with questions
such as whether student attendance at the games in Santa Fe is a
choice or a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, appearing as divided as the Texas lawyers arguing
before them, asked these and other questions in considering whether
students can continue to deliver prayers before kickoff without
violating the Constitution's separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn sought to defend the Santa Fe
Independent School District's policy of permitting a student,
chosen by peers, to deliver a personal statement before game time.
But attorney Anthony Griffin made comic reference to the exalted
role of football in Texas as he argued that student pre-game
speeches invariably invoke religion, a subject that public schools
generally may not broach under the constitutional mandate that
states not endorse any particular religion.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong argument before a packed courtroom, Justice
David H. Souter expressed doubt that the school board is neutral on
religion, saying the policy smacks of sectarian endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin
Scalia said a brief student message before such a minor social
gathering as a football game probably doesn't raise constitutional
concerns. After all, students are not compelled to attend pregame
ceremonies, enabling them to avoid listening to another student's
prayer, they said.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Griffin responded. Missing football-related
events is frowned upon in gridiron-mad Texas, where most students
are either in the band, on the team or cheering on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anyone forced to be a band member, cheerleader or football
player?'' asked Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a teen-ager, yes,'' responded Griffin, prompting
laughter throughout the packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, by July.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the high court's first major foray since 1992
into the First Amendment issue of governmental endorsement of
religion at public schools. The justices, in several decisions
since 1962, have ruled that the Constitution generally prohibits
school-district involvement in religious activities, saying that
such participation alienates students of minority faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision in Santa Fe, located about 35 miles
southeast of Houston, can help define whether that general
prohibition extends to school playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Under Santa Fe's policy, the student body each spring elects a
student to deliver a ``statement or invocation'' before football
games. The selected student can draft his or her own message ``to
solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student
safety and to establish the appropriate environment for the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy has been suspended pending the Supreme Court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and students in the school district sued in 1995 to
stop the pregame practice as unconstitutional. Fearing opposition
from the overwhelming majority of parents who endorsed the policy,
the families sought and received a court order that their names not
be used in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing the high court's
line of religion cases, ruled in February 1999 that Santa Fe, by
permitting students to recite prayers before football games,
endorsed faith in violation of the Constitution. The First
Amendment prevents public schools from compelling students to
listen to expressions of religions they do not accept, the 5th
Circuit ruled, prompting the school district to appeal to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, and the school district's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, argued
that the policy is constitutional because it neither endorses nor
rejects religion. Rather, it allows students to decide for
themselves how best to rally their football team before kickoff,
they added.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the school board plays virtually no role in
selecting which student will give the message or what the student
will say, thereby eliminating any connection between the government
and any potential student prayer. State and local officials have
``no way to predict'' what a student will say, Cornyn added.
</P>
<P>
   But Souter and Justice John Paul Stevens appeared unconvinced
that the school board is not involved and does not oversee what the
students say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to get a speech at the football
games saying `religion is bunk,''' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens asked Cornyn whether school administrators would
tolerate a student who used foul language or delivered a deeply
religious statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn responded that school leaders could bar the student from
using obscenities as part of their responsibility to regulate the
manner of the message. But school leaders cannot edit the content
of a student's statement, even if it is religious in nature, he
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said school districts are in a Catch-22 due to the First
Amendment's competing demands of allowing students to speak freely
while prohibiting them from mentioning religion. ``How do we avoid
getting sued?'' Cornyn asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow added that the school's policy is ``neutral'' on the
subject of religion, leaving students free to include a prayer in
their pre-game message if they choose. He said the main purpose is
to ``solemnize'' the event, an argument that drew scorn from
Souter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is solemnization?'' the justice asked, noting that the
word has religious overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy also expressed concern that the
policy endorses religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about schools becoming forums for religious
debates,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow responded that the policy prevents schools from getting
involved in religion by taking a ``hands-off approach'' and letting
students say what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin challenged the district, saying that although its policy
does not mention religion, the practice has always been that
student speakers delivered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   School districts, as the educators of children, have a
constitutional responsibility to be secular and leave religious
teaching to parents and churches, said Griffin, who is representing
the parents and students challenging the policy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe High School senior Marian Ward, who offered a brief
prayer before the football team's opening game Sept. 3, attended
the court hearing and voiced support for the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country was founded on the principles of freedom of
religion and freedom of speech, and I believe in the separation of
church and state,'' Ward said after the arguments. ``But I don't
believe in restricting personal expressions in public. I would just
like to see some clarification from the justices.''

FORMER CONGRESSMAN BLASTS INDUSTRY OVER DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TARA YAEKEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days after protesters flooded the streets of Boston
during the Bio2000 conference, former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy
II took up the baton for his own crusade Wednesday, urging members
of the biotechnology industry to lessen their resistance to his
prescription drug plan for the poor and uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, chairman of Citizens Energy Corp., blasted the biotech
industry for putting pressure on Governor Paul Cellucci to reject
his proposal, which would involve buying prescription drugs in bulk
and selling them at reduced rates to people in Massachusetts with
little or no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so bitterly disappointed by . . . all the fat cats
sitting across the street doing whatever they're doing,'' said
Kennedy, speaking outside the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention
Center, where the conference is being held. ``You're supposed to
provide prescription drugs to help people, not hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said Kennedy's plan would be the first step toward
price controls, which they said would hinder investment for
cutting-edge research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, representatives of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, which is hosting the conference, said that Kennedy
had misrepresented them as uncaring toward the nation's most
vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a misstatement of BIO's position on the issue
of prescription drugs,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Bradish-Myers. ``I
would say that the industry has recognized that some people need
improved access. But how you go about it is critically important
and cannot be oversimplified.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, an affiliate
of BIO, warned Cellucci that approving the proposal would have a
``chilling'' effect on the biotech industry and block access for
many people to innovative drugs. The council's executive director,
Janice Bourque, was attending the conference Wednesday and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said his plan has to do with bulk purchasing, not price
controls, and that it would be an inexpensive option for 1.6
million Massachusetts residents who have limited or no health care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature passed a measure in last year's budget asking
the governor's staff to put together a proposal for a bulk
prescription drug purchasing plan. A Cellucci spokesman, John
Birtwell, said that process is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put skin and bones onto this very good idea,''
he said.

 &HT;    U.S. foundations' giving nearly tripled in decade
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A vibrant economy is driving the nation's
foundations to give away more money than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, foundations gave $22.8 billion in grants to nonprofit
groups.
</P>
<P>
   That record figure is up from $7.9 billion a decade ago,
according to a new report conducted by the Foundation Center, a New
York-based organization that monitors foundations.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia has been a major player in the surge of
philanthropic giving.
</P>
<P>
   The number of foundations in the state has jumped to 906, up 64
percent since 1989. By comparison, the number of foundations across
the country increased by 47 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Georgia's foundations gave $495 million in 1998, up
312 percent from 1989. At the same time, assets increased to $11.3
billion, a 335 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an extraordinary growth in philanthropic capital,''
said Charles McTier, president of the Atlanta-based Robert W.
Woodruff Foundation Inc., and chairman of the Foundation Center's
board. ``It is attributable to our nation's healthy economy and the
success of American business.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundations are forced by law to give away at least 5 percent of
the value of their investments in the previous year. This means
that foundations are increasing the size of their donations by the
millions and making an impact in areas such as the environment,
health and education.
</P>
<P>
   Giving by every type of foundation _ corporate, individual and
community _ is on the rise, according to the Foundation Center's
report.
</P>
<P>
   And large companies have increased the size of their gifts,
which has helped boost foundation endowments.
</P>
<P>
   Endowment values rose to $385.1 billion in 1998, up 16.7
percent. In part, this was due to record-size gifts from Bill Gates
to the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation's
assets jumped ninefold to $5.4 billion as a result of gifts of $4.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, corporate foundation assets grew 20.4 percent to $13.11
billion. Most of the increase resulted from higher stock values,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 was a watershed for corporate foundations,'' said Sara
Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center. ``This is good news
for communities that rely on companies as a key source of private
giving.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in assets means more money for projects that
government agencies and corporations reject, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foundations don't have to play by the same rules,'' Engelhardt
said. ``Very often, when someone comes in with a completely
outside-the-box idea, they can't get funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge in giving could change that. The nation's largest
foundations may be able to achieve goals in communities that
weren't possible before, Engelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Rand Wentworth, director of the Georgia office of the Trust for
Public Land, understands that from experience.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Wentworth met with McTier at the Woodruff
Foundation to generally discuss conservation needs.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth mentioned that the Trust for Public Land was
interested in preserving land along the Chattahoochee River to
address water quality and to create more green space.
</P>
<P>
   McTier told Wentworth to research what was possible. ``He said
to think big,'' Wentworth said.
</P>
<P>
   With that challenge, Wentworth worked with the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources, the Nature Conservancy of Georgia
and other environmental groups. They came up with a plan to buy
property along the river stretching 200 miles from the mountains in
northern Georgia to downtown Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   When they presented their plan, McTier didn't blink. The
Woodruff Foundation offered a commitment of $25 million over three
years with the challenge of finding matching grants from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodruff grant gave Wentworth and other environmental groups
the leverage they needed to convince Congress to ante up.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth's group was able to raise an additional $25 million in
federal funds with help from the Georgia congressional delegation.
The state in two budget cycles came up with $35 million. Local
governments along the river gave another $25 million to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Woodruff Foundation's leadership allowed us to dream big
and it opened a door of credibility with Congress,'' Wentworth
said. ``They are birthing a great new regional park on a massive
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodruff Foundation is the biggest foundation in Atlanta,
with $3.7 billion in assets. In 1998, the foundation gave $86.6
million in grants, mostly to Georgia-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After the Woodruff Foundation, the state's largest foundations
are: The UPS Foundation; the Bradley-Turner Foundation; the Joseph
B. Whitehead Foundation; the J. Bulow Campbell Foundation; the
Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta; the Turner Foundation,
Inc.; the Murray M. Rosenberg Foundation, Inc.; the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Inc.; and the Lettie Pate Evans Foundation, Inc.

NFL SPENT TIME ON MONEY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. This was a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings weren't about football,'' said one of the NFL's
best coaches. ``The meetings were about money. Money won. Football
was zero. All of the time was spent on money.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL annual meetings closed Wednesday and very little was
done to change the game on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Said one owner of an AFC team, ``We've been going at this since
Sunday and all the talk is about the Internet. How can we maximize
the Internet? We didn't come up with any answers, but they are
going to study that hard and see how we can use it best in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners agreed in a resolution to have all 32 members of the
league participate in one NFL Internet system.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the owners voted instant replay back for another
season by a margin of 28-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy with the system that was in place last year,''
said Vikings coach Dennis Green, who is a member of the Competition
Committee, which is responsible for changing the rules. ``The
feeling is to give it another year, and if it works well again,
then voting next year to have this system for the future. I don't
think we should vote on this one year at a time. If it's good,
let's keep it in the books, and I think most people feel (that
way).''
</P>
<P>
   There were just a handful of changes and most of them were
minor.
</P>
<P>
   Players can be fined for excessive on-field celebrations and any
sexual gestures. If more than one player is involved in a
celebration after a touchdown then the players can be subject to
fines by the league.
</P>
<P>
   The owners also hit the assistant coaches from the blind side,
putting through a rule that says an assistant can only move to
another team to become a head coach. In the past, assistants could
leave to go to another team for a promotion (e.g. from running
backs coach to offensive coordinator). The coaches see this as an
attempt to drive down their salaries.

IRAN AGREES TO INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for complete writethru to update and restructure) 
 (See also CLINTON-OPEC) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Just hours after Iran angrily broke ranks with
all other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, its leaders reversed themselves and announced that they
would, after all, try to raise production in line with the rest of
the oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep and preserve our market share,'' said
Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. ``Beyond that, we
will see what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's quick reversal Wednesday morning added to the drama that
has surrounded the meeting of oil ministers, which ended here early
Wednesday when nine of the 11 members of OPEC decided to raise
production quotas by 1.45 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   If Iran continued to pump in line with its share of the market,
the cartel's production limit would rise by 1.7 million barrels a
day beginning next month, or about 7 percent. Iraq is the only
other OPEC member not a party to the agreement, as its production
has been limited by the United Nations since the Persian Gulf War
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's reluctant acceptance reflected OPEC's continued ability
to enforce a unified pricing strategy. Despite the messy process
here, economic analysts said there was little danger that the group
would dissolve into the bickering _ and erratic production _ that
occurred years ago when prices plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Oil markets Wednesday interpreted the agreement as a sign that
production would indeed rise and prices fell moderately in
commodity trading around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Wednesday, oil prices fell 64 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $26.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
level since Jan. 12. Since a nine-year peak of $34.37 a barrel
three weeks ago, prices have fallen 23 percent mostly because
traders had anticipated that oil cartel members would raise their
production quotas here.
</P>
<P>
   One OPEC official predicted that by May oil prices will have
declined further and Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rasheed,
told reporters here that he was ``pessimistic'' about the oil price
outlook over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   But lower prices at gasoline pumps in the United States are
probably months away, experts said, especially with inventories low
and demand for fuel likely to rise in the summer. Also, the
increased production is not so sizable that it is expected to
substantially reduce prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the total OPEC increase will be much smaller
because several members are already overshooting quotas by 1.2
million barrels a day. Analysts estimate that, after the quotas are
raised, most of this cheating will simply be absorbed into the new
limits.
</P>
<P>
   As for crude oil prices, analysts predict that they could start
climbing again by this winter, because demand is likely to remain
strong, the world's oil inventories are low and will not be fully
replenished.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, several OPEC countries have little excess capacity
and would not be able to further exceed their production limits
even if they wanted to.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday night when Iran refused to participate in the agreement,
several analysts worried that it could set off a frenzy of cheating
by a few OPEC members. But Wednesday, Iran's grudging compliance
suggested that Saudi Arabia has enough power to enforce the pricing
and production regime in the face of objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excess capacity is unevenly distributed,'' said Irene
King, senior oil economist at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``Seventy percent
of the excess capacity is in three countries _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Abu Dhabi.'' Those countries, she added, are the ones most
interested in preserving OPEC's grip on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce feud with Saudi Arabia, Iranian officials initially
argued here that any significant increase could send prices
plunging and would be a capitulation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Iranian officials also knew that if they insisted on holding
the line on oil production it would be both futile and costly. On
the one hand, their refusal to pump more crude would do little to
keep oil prices high. On the other, Iran would lose sales as
countries like Saudi Arabia simply filled the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the real point Iran wanted to make Wednesday was to
attack the United States and its aggressive lobbying campaign for
higher production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question about influence,'' said Ardebili Wednesday,
asserting that Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, had
telephoned OPEC's president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela just as the
OPEC oil ministers were meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 40-year history of OPEC there has never been a case of
the Secretary of Energy calling OPEC ministers in the middle of a
meeting,'' Ardebili complained. ``We are very upset and
disappointed at the external pressure. We don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the increase in oil production quotas did not live
up to the 2 million barrels a day that the United States had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   However, the OPEC agreement will probably be supplemented by
several hundred thousand additional barrels from Mexico and Norway,
non-OPEC countries that participated in last year's cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City Wednesday, the energy minister announced that the
country would raise production by 150,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, exhausted oil ministers described the marathon
battles that were over ideology as much as money.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the conservative kingdom whose enormous oil
reserves overshadow those of any other OPEC member, was determined
to increase production enough to bring oil prices down to about
$25.
</P>
<P>
   Why seek a lower price at all? Analysts say Saudi officials were
worried about jeopardizing the United States. At $30 a barrel or
higher, Saudi officials feared that demand would eventually
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a stable market, we want a well-supplied market and we
want a market that will be in equilibrium all the time,'' Ali
Naimi, the Saudi minister, said
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's Ardebili wanted to keep prices high and worried that
OPEC risked repeating the blunder at a meeting in Jakarta in 1997,
when Saudi Arabia pushed through a production increase only to see
prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC leaders have always wanted to present a unified front and
even the Saudis had preached about the need for unanimous
consensus. But after hours of fruitless wrangling, Naimi decided to
ignore Iranian opposition and go ahead without them.

THIS `BUDDY' NOT YOUR PAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Hanlon's metaphorical mish-mash of a movie, ``Buddy Boy,''
is almost as unlikable as its characters, and that's saying
something. While Hanlon demonstrates some skill at building
suspense in this, his first feature film, his cartoonish writing
sabotages the enterprise, making ``Buddy Boy'' a tedious exercise
in vapid voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins with grainy black-and-white crucifixion images
that lead to our first encounter with the film's protagonist,
Francis (Aidan Gillen), who is seen masturbating in front of a
drafting table full of pornography. Is it, as with Kevin Spacey's
Lester Burnham, the highlight of his day? One can only imagine so.
</P>
<P>
   Francis lives in a filthy, rat-infested apartment with Sal
(Susan Tyrell), a figure he introduces as his mother, but given
Sal's dubious wig and beefy build, anything is possible. Francis'
homelife primarily consists of eating Spam-like meat for dinner and
lugging Sal's unconscious body back to her recliner after she has
passed out for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine Francis' delight when he discovers that a
beautiful woman has moved into the building across the street and
that she enjoys disrobing nightly in front of her window. After
gazing at her through a peep hole for several evenings (which gives
him plenty of fuel for his masturbatory fantasies, particularly
after he spies her pleasuring herself), Francis sees his neighbor
on the street and intervenes during an attempted mugging. The
woman, Gloria (Emmanuelle Seigner), improbably invites him to
dinner, and then, even more improbably, the two begin a romance.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that this would be pretty heady stuff for a homely,
mumbling virgin who develops film by day and dines on Spam at
night. But Francis is a tortured soul, weighted down by his
Catholic upbringing and the unfairness of life. Soon, he's
confronting the confused Gloria over imagined atrocities, using a
butcher's knife to make his point clear.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' self-pity would be more meaningful if Hanlon managed to
depict the character with any measure of skill. But the character,
and the movie for that matter, can only be seen in the most
absurdist of terms. Matters of faith are touched on, but never with
any kind of depth or meaning. ``Buddy Boy'' is a grotesquerie in
every sense of the word.!end!

GUN INDUSTRY SHUNS SMITH &AMP; WESSON; STATES OPEN ANTITRUST
INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson, which recently agreed to restrictions on the way
it makes and distributes handguns, has come under such fierce
financial pressure from other firearms manufacturers and dealers
opposed to the agreement that state officials have started
antitrust investigations of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and city officials are also trying to protect
Smith &AMP; Wesson by persuading police agencies nationwide to buy the
company's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to help Smith &AMP; Wesson comes after the company agreed
on March 17 to a wide array of restrictions in exchange for ending
many of the 30 lawsuits filed against it by cities and counties and
averting threatened suits by the states of New York and Connecticut
and the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, one of the nation's largest gun wholesalers
announced it will stop distributing Smith &AMP; Wesson handguns, many
retail dealers have proclaimed they will not sell Smith &AMP; Wesson
products and the National Rifle Association has denounced the
company as a foreign-owned business that has ``run up the white
flag of surrender'' to the Clinton administration. Smith &AMP; Wesson,
based in Springfield, Mass., is owned by Tomkins PLC of London.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ken Jorgensen, a spokesman for Smith &AMP; Wesson, said
the Chicago law firm that had long jointly represented Smith &AMP;
Wesson, Sturm Ruger &AMP; Co. and Colt's Manufacturing Co., three of
the largest handgun makers, has said the firm will drop Smith &AMP;
Wesson as a client. And some shooting match organizers have told
Smith &AMP; Wesson that the company is not welcome at their events.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago law firm that informed Smith &AMP; Wesson it would no
longer represent the company is Wildman, Harrold, Allen &AMP; Dixon.
Anne Kimball, a lawyer at the firm who has represented Smith &AMP;
Wesson, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York who helped
strike the deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson, said that officials are
investigating whether there is a conspiracy against the gun maker.
``We are seeing behavior on the part of Smith &AMP; Wesson's
competitors that raises the specter of illegal anti-trust
activity,'' Spitzer said in an interview Wednesday, adding: ``This
is serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general who was
also involved in the deal and is helping coordinate the measures to
protect the company, said, ``Smith &AMP; Wesson is under absolutely
unprecedented pressure, both financial and personal within the gun
industry, with threats that are almost violent in nature, and I
have heard the fear that it could be put out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the gun industry trade organization, said, ``there is
no conspiracy'' against Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not be more confident that these are just independent
actions by businessmen,'' Delfay said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust investigation is being conducted under state
antitrust laws in New York, Connecticut and Maryland, with more
states expected to join and subpoenas to be issued starting
Thursday, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits filed against the gun makers by cities and counties
charge them with negligently marketing and distributing their guns
in ways that have helped criminals and juveniles gain access to
them. Some of the cities are seeking to recover the cost of gun
violence for the hiring of additional policemen and in hospital
care while other cities say their main goal is to improve gun
safety and change gun makers' marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen, the Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman, said it is too early to
tell what the settlement's financial impact on the company will be.
But, Jorgensen added, ``We've been getting beat up pretty bad, and
the whole idea seems to be a boycott of Smith &AMP; Wesson products.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to get law-enforcement agencies to buy Smith &AMP; Wesson
handguns could prove very helpful to the company, whose sales are
primarily to civilians. Nationwide, police forces purchase about 25
percent of the 2.5 million handguns made each year. Only a very
small part of the police handgun purchases are from Smith &AMP; Wesson.
But Blumenthal and other federal, state and city officials who met
in Washington on Tuesday to try to find a way to help the company
acknowledged that there are difficult contractual and legal
problems in getting police forces to make the change to Smith &AMP;
Wesson.

</P>
<P>
   Several cities and counties around the country, including
Atlanta, Detroit, Miami-Dade County, Buffalo, Rochester, N.Y., and
Albany, N.Y., have recently agreed to buy only from Smith &AMP; Wesson.
New York City, which buys Glock handguns for its police officers,
has withheld a decision.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The effort to support Smith &AMP; Wesson is critical to regulating
the firearms industry, government officials say, because the deal
it struck splintered the powerful united front of gun makers and
gun owners that has blocked tough gun laws in Washington and state
capitals for years. The company agreed to improve the safety of its
handguns, for instance, by including trigger locks with all sales,
and to allow its dealers to sell weapons at only those gun shows
where all sales are subject to background checks on the buyer. It
also requires, within three years, so-called smart-gun technology
that will allow each of its new handguns to be fired only by
authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that if Smith &AMP; Wesson were undermined financially,
it would weaken the government's hand in drawing other gun makers
into similar agreements. ``If one company signs on and is left out
to dry, we can't credibly go to other companies and ask them to
join this agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The wholesaler that announced it will stop distributing Smith &AMP;
Wesson guns is RSR Group Inc. of Winter Park, Fla., which called
for Smith &AMP; Wesson to reopen negotiations to ``find a workable
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although RSR has been a leading distributor of Smith &AMP; Wesson
products for more than 20 years, we have come to the difficult
conclusion that we cannot continue to do business with Smith &AMP;
Wesson under the problematic terms of the current agreement,'' the
company said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said these were precisely the kinds of actions the
investigation would examine to see whether ``they are part of a
concerted, illegal campaign to retaliate against Smith &AMP; Wesson,
restraining trade and impeding the development of a safer
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, who
helped organize the Tuesday meeting in Washington, said, ``It seems
the industry is doing everything it can to make an example out of
Smith &AMP; Wesson.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Almost overlooked in the dispute over what has happened to Smith
&AMP; Wesson is the view of some gun control advocates, who asserted
that the settlement two weeks ago let the company off easy because
it only accepted provisions it was already practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, six municipalities that did not take part in the
agreement _ Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, New Orleans,
Washington, D.C. and Wayne County, Mich. _ said they would continue
with their lawsuits against Smith &AMP; Wesson as well as other gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   John Komako, for example, a lawyer for Cleveland, said he saw
``no reason to sign onto the agreement'' without seeing what
documents Smith &AMP; Wesson would be forced to disclose in the
discovery stage of the lawsuits. On March 14, just before Smith &AMP;
Wesson reached its agreement, U.S. District Judge Donald Nugent, in
Cleveland, rejected the gun companies' motion for summary dismissal
and ordered that discovery in the case could proceed. Lawyers
advising the cities suing the gun industry have contended that if
they could get into discovery of corporate documents they would
find evidence that the firearms makers have long known how easily
their guns are sold to criminals and juveniles, providing the kind
of proof that led to expensive settlements by the tobacco
companies.

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR WOMAN SWEPT AWAY IN CREEK
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Yolanda Dickens leaped to safety as
floodwaters swept away a car carrying her husband and his
grandmother near Trinity Boulevard on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She looked on helplessly as they disappeared into a swollen
creekbed.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens, 22, never saw her husband again.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, family members and authorities searched fruitlessly for
Ashlyn Dickens, 24, and his grandmother, Adele Warren, 62.
Relatives found Ashlyn Dickens' body Wednesday morning in the
Valley View Branch creekbed. He is survived by his wife and two
young children, ages 2 and 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, searchers _ including a helicopter, military
personnel, a Fort Worth Fire Department rescue team and dogs _ had
not found Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very joyous woman,'' said Andre Allen of Mansfield,
her nephew. ``This is all unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, along with friends, relatives and more than 15 of
Warren's co-workers at nearby Bell Helicopter Textron, kept vigil
Wednesday as searchers combed the creek. Warren worked at Bell for
more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, family members and friends huddled in prayer
for the 62-year-old Everman grandmother. Her mother was scheduled
to arrive Wednesday afternoon from Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster happened after 6 p.m. Tuesday, when Warren left
work just as massive thunderstorms dumped heavy rain in far east
Fort Worth. About the same time, a tornado was working its way
through downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ashlyn and Yolanda Dickens, of Fort Worth, had driven to the
Bell Helicopter plant on Hurst Boulevard to pick up Warren.
Initially, family members had reported that the Dickens' 2-year-old
son was in the car, but he was not, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always drove home on Trinity Boulevard,'' said LaCreecha
White of Fort Worth, Warren's granddaughter. Ashlyn Dickens was
White's brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got on Trinity and was going that way, (west) but there
was water, so she turned this way,'' White said, pointing to the
eastbound lanes of Trinity Boulevard. White said Yolanda Dickens
gave her an account of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more water. She tried to make a U-turn, but the
water was too strong,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren's car was caught in the rushing water and fell into the
creek, which crosses Trinity Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives found the car Tuesday night about 200 yards from the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too dark to keep looking,'' White said. ``We were
back here at 6 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two hours later, Ashlyn Dickens' body was found about
100 yards down the creek from where the car was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers found a tan purse and a maroon sweater in the creek,
but family members told authorities that the items did not belong
to Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay here as long as it takes,'' White said. ``We have
to find her.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Mohammad is a gifted young boy who's at the head
of his class, popular with his fellow students and well-liked by
his teacher. He's a child so attuned to nature that he can hear a
baby bird that has fallen from its nest and is resourceful enough
to be able to shimmy up a tall tree and return it to safety,
shooing away a hungry cat in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad is also blind, a condition he's aware of mostly because
of the way his selfish father treats him. The father, Hashem, wants
to keep Mohammad at Tehran's Institute For the Blind instead of
bringing him home during summer vacation. But Hashem has no choice.
He must take Mohammad with him and make his peace with his young
son and, more importantly, himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's the set-up of ``The Color of Paradise,'' Majid Majidi's
moving follow-up to his 1997 Oscar-nominated foreign-language film
``The Children of Heaven.'' Certainly, Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani)
could be considered a child of paradise, a young boy who possesses
a reverence for nature and the capacity to appreciate creation with
an undiluted intensity. Majidi, remarkably, is able to show us the
world as the loving Mohammad senses it, using vivid colors and
simple images to render this child's vision of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, like Majidi's previous work, plays as a parable, this
time revolving around the spiritually blind father's rejection of
his child. The gloomy Hashem believes that life has dealt him an
unfair hand. His beloved wife died, his only son is blind and he is
stuck being ``a poor and miserable man.'' The fact that his mother
and two pretty daughters love him and Mohammad with all their
hearts is little consolation, nor is his beautiful farm home in the
heights of northern Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad continues to love his father despite Hashem's attempts
to leave him at school and, later, with a blind carpenter. The
rejection ultimately takes its toll more on the father than the
son, as Majidi leads the viewer to ponder the cost of an
unforgiving and hardened heart.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Children of Heaven,'' this movie features mostly
non-professional actors, with the exception of the skilled Mahjub,
who expertly plays the conflicted father. Majidi's way with child
actors, as well as his masterful ability to compose gorgeous,
unembellished images, makes ``The Color of Paradise'' another small
cinematic gem. It would be no surprise if Majidi winds up seeing
another Oscar nomination for this heart-felt work. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The film: ``The Color of Paradise'' (PG; adult themes). &QL; 
The stars: Moshen Ramezani, Hossein Mahjub, Salime Feizi. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Majid Majidi. Released
by Sony Pictures Classics. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 30 minutes. &QL;

CITIES AND STATES MAY BAN NUDE DANCING, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Ind.)   (Eds: New material adding quotes and background begins with 8th

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that cities and
states may ban nude dancing as a way of combatting crime and other
``negative secondary effects'' associated with establishments that
offer this kind of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 vote upholding an Erie, Pa., ordinance that requires
exotic dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string, the court's
fractured majority did not explain how that requirement would
reduce the crime, prostitution, sexual assaults or other problems
associated with places where dancers appear fully nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, requiring dancers to wear pasties and G-strings
may not greatly reduce these secondary effects,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor conceded in her opinion. But she said that under the
appropriate First Amendment analysis, such a regulation needed only
to further the government's legitimate interest rather than fully
accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may also be true that a pasties and G-string requirement
would not be as effective as, for example, a requirement that the
dancers be fully clothed,'' O'Connor said, ``but the city must
balance its efforts to address the problem with the requirement
that the restriction be no greater than necessary to further the
city's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, Erie vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161, the court
took up where it left off nine years ago, when an even more
splintered majority upheld a public indecency law in Indiana that
also banned nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the court ruled that nude dancing _ as opposed to
simple public nudity _ was a form of expression that had at least
some minimal protection under the First Amendment but that could
nonetheless be regulated under an appropriate standard.
</P>
<P>
   The court failed in the Indiana case to settle on a standard,
and did only marginally better Wednesday as Justice David H. Souter
changed his mind on the amount of evidence cities needed in order
to justify a ban on nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 case, Barnes vs. Glen Theatre, Souter said the
government could essentially assume that ``pernicious secondary
effects'' would result from the presence of nude dancing
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But while the plurality Wednesday _ O'Connor with Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G.
Breyer _ adopted that approach, Souter said that he had since
concluded that a city should have to provide evidence both of ``the
seriousness of the threatened harm'' and ``the efficacy of its
chosen remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be less ignorant of nude dancing than I was nine
years ago,'' Souter said, ``but after many subsequent occasions to
think further about the needs of the First Amendment, I have come
to believe that a government must toe the mark more carefully than
I first insisted.'' He said that because Erie had not provided any
evidence, the case should be sent back to the lower courts to give
it the chance to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The majority judgment to support Erie's ordinance, overturning a
1998 decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that declared it
unconstitutional, came from the addition of Justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas to the four-justice plurality.
</P>
<P>
   They said, in a concurring opinion by Scalia, that there was no
need to consider the presence or absence of ``secondary effects''
because ``the traditional power of government to foster good morals
(bonos mores) and the acceptability of the traditional judgment (if
Erie wishes to endorse it) that nude public dancing itself is
immoral have not been repealed by the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented
from the court's approach as well as the application to this case.
In a dissenting opinion by Stevens, they said that while the court
had used the secondary-effects doctrine in the past to justify
relegating adult businesses to special adult entertainment zones,
it had never approved it ``to justify a total ban on protected
First Amendment expression.'' Erie's ordinance, adopted in 1994,
applies throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the former nude dancing club whose owner challenged
the ordinance, Stevens said: ``The city of Erie has totally
silenced a message the dancers at Kandyland want to convey. The
fact that this censorship may have a laudable ulterior purpose
cannot mean that censorship is not censorship.'' The decision, he
said, had ``grave implications for basic free speech principles.''
</P>
<P>
   One question in the case, City of Erie vs. Pap's A.M., No.
98-1161, was whether the court should have dismissed the city
appeal as moot after being informed by Pap's A.M., the club's
owner, last summer that Kandyland no longer had nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the decision not to dismiss the case, O'Connor
said Wednesday that the city was entitled to a decision because it
was suffering the ``ongoing injury'' of not being able to enforce
its law. Scalia and Thomas said that in their view, the case was
moot.
</P>
<P>
   On the merits of the First Amendment issue, O'Connor said it was
significant that the law's target was conduct, not expression. ``It
does not target nudity that contains an erotic message; rather, it
bans all public nudity, regardless of whether that nudity is
accompanied by expressive activity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As such, she said, the case was governed by the lower level of
First Amendment scrutiny the court applies to content-neutral laws
that regulate conduct and have only an incidental effect on
expression.
</P>
<P>
   The court first announced that test in a 1968 decision that
upheld the prosecution of people who burned their draft cards, on
the ground the government had a legitimate interest in making sure
that draft cards were available.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that Kandyland might have challenged, in the lower
courts, the Erie City Council's assumptions about the secondary
effects of nude dancing, but did not.
</P>
<P>
   That led John H. Weston, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented
Kandyland at the Supreme Court, to find a potential silver lining
in the decision. In an interview, he said the decision meant that
lower courts must give those who challenge laws of this type in the
future ``a meaningful opportunity to evaluate and scrutinize the
underpinnings of the legislation.''

ANALYSIS: AGENT ORANGE AND DIABETES, DIVING INTO MURKY DEPTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new Air Force report raising questions about whether the
defoliant Agent Orange might be linked to diabetes in Vietnam
veterans is as puzzling as it is provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared the health of 859 veterans of Operation Ranch
Hand, in which Agent Orange was sprayed on much of the landscape
during the Vietnam War, with that of 1,232 who did not spray the
chemical. There was no difference in the incidence of diabetes in
the two groups _ 16.9 percent of the Ranch Hand group was diabetic,
and 17 percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes effect only showed up when scientists looked at the
levels of dioxin, the main chemical in Agent Orange, in the men's
blood. After adjusting for factors like age and body fat levels,
they concluded that the Ranch Hand participants with the lowest
levels of dioxin had a 47 percent lower risk of diabetes than those
with the highest levels of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans not involved in Operation Ranch Hand showed the same
trend, said Dr. Joel E. Michalek, an Air Force statistician who is
the principal investigator for the study. Most people have some
dioxin in their blood because it was once widely used as a
herbicide, so people were exposed to it in the environment, and it
persists in body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Michalek said in a telephone interview that the two groups of
Air Force veterans might have shown no difference in their diabetes
incidence, over all, because many men in the Ranch Hand group did
not have high dioxin levels. About half of the Ranch Hand group, he
said, had average levels of the defoliant in their blood. So even
if dioxin exposure did increase diabetes risk, the effect might not
have been apparent. For that reason, he said, his group moved on to
advanced statistical modeling and data analyses.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that other scientists had questioned the Air
Force findings and methods.
</P>
<P>
   A major criticism of the Air Force study, Michalek said, has
been that it is hard to sort out a dioxin effect from an effect of
simply being overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin is stored in fat, so the fatter a person is, the higher
his dioxin levels are likely to be. But the fatter someone is, the
more likely he is to develop diabetes. The question scientists
asked was, is the effect due to dioxin or to obesity?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know diabetes is highly related to body fat, and so is
dioxin,'' Michalek said. ``That's why these diabetes findings are
so difficult to interpret. People are concerned that we haven't
done the right body fat adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michalek said he and his colleagues first started seeing a link
between Agent Orange and diabetes in 1991. Though ``the findings
were met with criticism in the scientific community,'' he said, Air
Force researchers have continued to see the effect, even after
searching assiduously for other factors that might have explained
it away.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Air Force considered its current statistical
analysis the strongest evidence yet, but that it was beginning two
additional biochemical studies to see whether the effect held up.
He added that the service had asked the federal government to spend
millions of dollars on more such studies.
</P>
<P>
   Michalek said that no matter how he adjusted for other factors,
like age, body weight and family history of diabetes, the
association between dioxin exposure and diabetes remained. But some
scientists are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Dr. Michael Gough, a retired biologist who was
chairman of a federal advisory panel for the Ranch Hand study from
1990 to 1995. After spending years on the dioxin question, Gough
said, ``The conclusion I've come to is that there is no evidence
whatsoever to support any connection between low-level dioxin
exposure and any human disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Some statisticians said the Air Force study was fraught with
pitfalls, including the fact that Vietnam veterans have linked a
variety of health complaints to exposure to Agent Orange and the
study aims to look at virtually all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is unprecedented,'' Michalek said. ``We have so
many end points.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as statisticians point out, that makes it very likely that
something will turn up by chance alone, making it especially
difficult to sort out whether an effect is real.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of
California, says he grows wary when a study looks at large numbers
of possible outcomes and then makes complicated statistical
adjustments to come up with a positive finding for one of them.
``The more types of funny analyses you see, the more your antennae
can be quivering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Michalek said, he is unwilling to say whether he
thinks dioxin really does cause diabetes. ``I am a scientist,'' he
said, explaining that he is awaiting results from the biochemical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans, however, say it is time that the Department of
Veterans Affairs compensates them if they develop diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence we have seen, the V.A. should make a
decision that diabetes is presumed to be service-connected based on
Agent Orange exposure,'' said John Sommer, executive director of
the Washington office of the American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   Gough, for one, said he did not doubt that the veterans would
end up being compensated for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a feeling in this country that the Vietnam
veterans got a bad shake, and I don't deny for a minute that that
was true,'' he said. ``That has now extended to the constant
suggestion that Agent Orange poisoned the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the questions about the Air Force study that plague many
scientists, Gough said, ``I'm certain that diabetes will be turned
into a compensable disease for Vietnam veterans.''

 &HT;    Gay GOP group: Bush is no uniter
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's credentials as a
self-labeled ``uniter'' are under fire from a Republican group that
says the probable GOP presidential nominee talks a better game than
he plays.
</P>
<P>
   After months of unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting with
Bush, the national director of the Log Cabin Republicans, the
party's gay rights organization, said it's hard to bring people
together if you refuse to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does question calling yourself `a uniter not a
divider,''' said Rich Tafel, echoing Bush's oft-repeated
description of himself. ``He said he went to Bob Jones University
because he speaks to all groups, but he won't meet with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's February speech at the South Carolina university left him
with weeks of political problems because of his delayed
condemnation of the school's anti-Catholic policies. He also was
criticized because he didn't speak out against the school's ban on
interracial dating during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel's comments came in conjunction with a memo to members of
the Log Cabin Republicans about the months-long effort to meet with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush, far from being a uniter who is compassionate, has
actually played upon divisions to win the nomination, and now shows
little desire to heal them. A candidate who cannot unite the
Republican Party won't win this election,'' Tafel said in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans' attack on Bush's credentials as a
uniter came as the GOP's effort to expand its base came under fire
on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Anderson, a black GOP activist who had been vice chairman
of a Republican effort to recruit minorities, recently quit the
party because of what she called a ``pattern of racial blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the recent spectacle of the two leading Republican
presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain,
refusing to condemn the flying of the Confederate flag _ a symbol
of defiance of the first Republican president _ over the South
Carolina Statehouse,'' Anderson said in a column explaining her
decision. ``And Governor Bush has yet to apologize to
African-Americans for failing to speak out against Bob Jones
University's ban on interracial dating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he disapproved of the university's policy, since
revoked, against interracial dating. In a letter to Catholic
leaders, Bush said he regretted not speaking out against the
university's anti-Catholic policies. There was no equivalent effort
to express regret for his delayed condemnation of the ban on
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics made up an important bloc of voters in key GOP primary
states. African-Americans did not.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Levy on Wednesday
downplayed the significance of Anderson's departure from the
party's New Majority Council. She was one of more than 500
co-chairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that she decided to leave,'' Levy said. ``I
think she is completely misreading the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee also is trying to poke holes
in the GOP's big tent by noting that former California Republican
Gov. Pete Wilson, whose positions on immigration and affirmative
action alienated many Hispanics, helped a new group raise $1.5
million for television ads espousing its conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush preaches unity. When the camera lights are on,
he reaches out to people of color. However, when the camera lights
are off and when behind closed doors, he allows Pete Wilson to send
out negative messages,'' said DNC General Co-chairman Dennis
Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan discounted efforts to link his
boss to the California effort. ``We are not involved,'' he said. A
top Bush adviser said a Bush meeting with gay Republicans is in the
works, but it probably will not involve leaders of Log Cabin
Republicans.

REFORM JEWISH RABBIS SUPPORT SAME-SEX CEREMONIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Breaking with more than three millennia of
tradition, the world's largest organization of rabbis voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to support ceremonies, including weddings,
for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, the first by a major religious denomination, was
hailed by gays and lesbians as a milestone in their struggle for
acceptance. It was denounced by conservative and orthodox Jewish
movements as divisive and contrary to biblical teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Reform Jewish movement, the dominant strand of
American Judaism, said they hoped their action might influence
liberal Protestant denominations now debating the treatment of gays
and lesbians. Later this year the Episcopal, Presbyterian and
United Methodist churches are expected to debate a variety of
policies regarding homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, the 500 Reform rabbis gathered here
spontaneously broke into song, chanting in Hebrew a prayer that
Jews recite to thank God for allowing them to experience a special
moment. At a news conference just after the vote, the group's
president, Rabbi Charles A. Kroloff, said: ``I've never been
prouder to be a rabbi _ I think this is one of our finest days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is that every gay and lesbian Jew in America will
feel comfortable in every Reform synagogue throughout our land, and
I also hope that other clergy groups will hear us loud and clear
and that they'll be inspired to move in the same direction,'' said
Kroloff, who is president of the 1,800-member Central Conference of
American Rabbis. ``In my mind this is the direction of history _
this is where we're all headed, to affirm the rights of our fellow
Jews and our fellow human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution approved by the Reform rabbis does not use the
words ``wedding'' or ``marriage,'' and does not require any rabbi
to perform any ceremony. Instead, the resolution says that ``the
relationship of a Jewish same-gender couple is worthy of
affirmation through Jewish ritual.'' The resolution also says the
rabbis will support those who officiate at ``rituals of union'' for
same-gender couples, as well as those who do not officiate at such
ceremonies. The resolution also calls on the rabbis' group to
develop educational and liturgical material about such ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 of the 1,800 Reform rabbis have said they are
performing or are willing to perform same-gender ceremonies, and
some are using the word ``wedding,'' while others use phrases such
as ``commitment ceremony.'' Many ceremonies include elements
associated with a Jewish wedding _ a couple standing under a
canopy, the recitation of seven blessings, and the smashing of a
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Individual clergy members in some other America denominations,
in particular the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Diocese
of Massachusetts, are performing same-sex union ceremonies. And the
Unitarian Universalist Association, which does not espouse a creed,
has long supported gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For the Reform rabbis, the nearly unanimous vote Wednesday
brought an end to years of controversy. Even though the group voted
10 years ago to endorse the ordination of gays and lesbians as
rabbis, the issue of gay relationships was so divisive that two
years ago the group withdrew a resolution from its annual
convention rather than endure heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   The change, the rabbis said, followed years of debate and
reflection, and via moments such as an emotional prayer service
here on Tuesday at which about 50 gay and lesbian Reform rabbis
stood together before their colleagues and recited a traditional
prayer honoring Jewish teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Clifford E. Librach of Sharon voted in favor only after
the language was changed to more clearly acknowledge ``the
pluralism within our ranks on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proponents were all four rabbis from Temple Israel of
Boston, which has been performing same-sex ceremonies for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statement that just as God is present in a marriage
between a man and a woman, two men or two women can have divinity
in their relationship,'' said Rabbi Jonah D. Pesner of Temple
Israel.

DNA-MAPPING PROJECT PROGRESSING RAPIDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A far-flung network of computerized gene-readers has deciphered
the 2-billionth ``letter'' of humankind's DNA instruction manual,
the chief of the Human Genome Project said Wednesday as he
announced a new deadline of early June for the effort to be 90
percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly funded effort is reading 1,000 genetic sequences
per second as it nears the goal of decoding all 3.2 billion
chemical letters, known as base pairs, of the human genetic
blueprint by 2003, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the
National Human Genome Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is the complete set of 80,000 to 100,000 human genes
_ the material composed of DNA, which contains the code for all
inherited traits in humans. Completion of the map is expected to
provide insight into evolution as well as jump-start new treatments
and cures for a variety of diseases and symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome project is in very good shape,'' said Collins at a
briefing before addressing the Bio2000 conference that has drawn
more than 9,000 biotech officials and scientists to Boston. He said
that the genome project, by supplying the raw information that is
to be translated into a myriad of new drugs and medical tests, ``is
the feeder layer for this wonderful industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In ambition and complexity, the effort to read all the genetic
code contained in human cells rivals the Big Dig. But unlike that
troubled transportation project, the genome program, launched in
1990, is coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. Collins said
the 90-percent-complete working draft of the genome sequence will
cost about $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The project had expected to have the working draft by spring; it
will now be ``late May or early June,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins emphasized that the gene-reading robots in the United
States, England. and Japan are dumping their translation of the
chemical code into a public database every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news that we're moving so fast, but it's even better
news that researchers throughout the world are using this data now
to investigate the genetic underpinnings of health and diseases
ranging from Alzheimer's to diabetes,'' said Collins, who is a
geneticist and co-discoverer of the gene that causes cystic
fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a private genome company that is also racing to
finish sequencing the entire human genome is refusing to make
public its reading of the genetic blueprint until it is complete
this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the company, Celera Genomics of Rockville, Md.,
has developed a plan under which subscribers (mainly pharmaceutical
companies) pay a hefty fee to access the data before it is made
public. The companies will be able to search for, and submit patent
applications on, any gene sequences they think may lead to
profitable medical products or treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's bid to finish sequencing the genome is financed by
hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, and the company
wants to recoup that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that the publicly funded project ``takes very
seriously the issue of having this resource in the public domain,''
which is why the robot gene-readers at the 16 public genome centers
are working as fast as possible to churn out the sequence data.
Once released publicly, the DNA sequence itself can't be patented,
but those who take the data and develop products from it can patent
those products.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a number of private companies have found thousands of
human genes within the genome independent of both the genome
project and Celera. They have filed for patent protection of those
genes, and hundreds of patents have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that while he agrees that companies need the
incentive of patent protection to carry out the costly development
of gene-based tests and drugs, they could slow the pace of
research.
</P>
<P>
   Collins called it a ``serious issue'' that could hamper
experiments involving the whole set of genes at once if many were
protected by patents. ``We want to understand how all the genes
work with each other in our `instruction book,' '' Collins said.
``You can understand how science could be impeded'' if researchers
had to pay royalties to different patent-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project's chief also said that government scientists
are creating databases of free mathematical tools that will help
researchers understand the genetic sequences being poured into
GenBank, the public databank for genome information. The rival
company, Celera, says that its strategy is to provide such
mathematical tools to its subscribers, for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to predict when the genome data might lead to health
benefits, Collins forecast that within five to seven years, it may
be possible to test an individual early in life to reveal
particular disease vulnerabilities over a lifetime. But, he said,
until treatments are developed, people may not want to have this
information.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are mainly interested in
genome information as a tool to make new ``designer drugs'' that
take into account peoples' genetic differences. This way, doctors
could prescribe specific drugs for patients that would be more
likely than today's pharmaceuticals to be effective without harmful
side effects. Collins predicted that such drugs are at least 15
years away.

MIAMI AREA POLITICIANS CAUTION U.S. ON FORCIBLY TAKING CUBAN BOY

   MIAMI _ Elected officials in and around Miami warned U.S.
immigration officials Wednesday that they should expect little help
from the police here when they come for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez,
and they said this city could erupt in violence if federal agents
tried to forcibly take the boy from his great-uncle's house in
Little Havana and send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in
the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the
federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately
repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said Alex Penelas, mayor of
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle
and temporary guardian, still had not signed an agreement to hand
the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose
a fight to keep him when the case is heard in May in the 11th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't cooperate in anything,'' Gonzalez told a
Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house,
and they'll have to go find him there.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure built in this city, the home of a large number of
Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service said they did not plan to remove Elian on Thursday morning
even if his Miami relatives continued to defy them. But an INS
spokeswoman said the agency would revoke Elian's permission to stay
in the United States, clearing the way for his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said that the boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would travel to the United States to
bring his son home after the custody battle has been decided in the
courts. Elian's father would be accompanied by other family members
from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and teachers, and
psychiatric experts, Castro said on Cuban television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the perfect formula for re-inserting Elian,'' Castro
said. He also said that the group would be willing to wait as long
as it takes to bring the boy back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Castro's announcement, a Justice Department
spokesman said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it changes things. How it changes things is a little
hard to say at this point. If the father shows up in Miami and
decides to go and ring the doorbell of his relatives and find his
son, well, the family in Miami is on record as saying they would
turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually do this remains to be
seen.''

PHONY FLIGHT 261 STORY CIRCULATING ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A story getting widespread circulation on the Internet
claims Monroe minister Linda Knight led passengers of Alaska Flight
261 in prayer over the plane's intercom system during the final
nine minutes before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Her words were picked up by the doomed jet's cockpit voice
recorder, according to the story.
</P>
<P>
   While no one survived the crash so exactly what was happening in
the passenger compartment is not known, sources close to the
federal crash investigation said that no such prayer can be heard
on the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet story has taken on a life of its own.
Several people from around the country, including family members of
crash victims, have called or e-mailed the Post-Intelligencer in
recent days, wanting to know if the story is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping there might be some credibility to it,
though I had my doubts,'' said Ben Johnson, editor of a monthly
magazine in Greenville, S.C., for the Associate Reformed
Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was sent the Internet story via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these things look too good to be true,'' he said.
``But you have to balance that with the fact that truth can be
stranger than fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stokes, whose mother Janice of Ketchikan, Alaska, was
among the 88 passengers and crew who died in the crash, said he
searched the Internet for the prayer story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of new information on the crash has been
frustrating,'' he said. ``There have not been many updates lately
from the NTSB. Then, when I heard about this web site that
supposedly had the story, it got my hopes up. I searched for two
hours but didn't find anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The story in question says an Alaska Airlines pilot listened to
the cockpit voice recorder and that for the last 9 minutes of
Flight 261 the wife of the pastor from Monroe can be heard
``sharing the Gospel'' with the crew and passengers over the
intercom system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before the final dive into the Pacific Ocean, she can be
heard leading the sinner's prayer for salvation,'' the Internet
story says.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Knight and her husband Joe were co-pastors of The Rock
Church in Monroe, Wash. They were on returning from from a
humanitarian trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Their son, Jeff
Knight is in Mexico and could not be reached for coment about the
Internet story.
</P>
<P>
   But a family friend said she and Jeff have spoken about the
story and he told her he believed it to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows his parents' character,'' said the friend, Johanna
Little. ``Knowing his mother, she would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet was heading to Seattle, with a scheduled stop in San
Fransciso, when it crashed into the Pacific off the California
coast north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has publicly released
little information about what is on the cockpit voice recorder
during the jet's last 30 minutes of flight, other than that the
pilots were in radio contact with Alaska mechanics on the ground as
they worked on a problem with the plane's stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that an unsubstantiated Internet
story has surfaced in the wake of an air crash.
</P>
<P>
   Former newsman Pierre Salinger lost credibility after he used an
Internet story as the basis of a claim that a Navy missile brought
down TWA Flight 800 in July 1996. The FBI and the safety board
discounted the missile theory, but many people still believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Microsoft learned the power that an an
Internet story can have as it moves through cyberspace when it had
to issue a press release denying it had bought the Catholic Church.
Someone posted the bogus story on the Net and people who believed
it called Microsoft to complain.

CLINTON WELCOMES THE OPEC DECISION TO SELL MORE OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON and OPEC, moved in `i' category) 
(jt) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday welcomed the OPEC
decision to increase crude oil production and urged oil companies
to pass the savings quickly along to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference that covered a gamut of other issues from
China policy to gun control to taxes on the Internet, the president
began by saying that the production increase announced on Tuesday
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was ``good
news for the economy and for the American consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed no new policies. Until it becomes clear whether
gasoline and fuel oil prices fall and by how much, Clinton said,
``we have to just keep our powder dry, keep our options open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plans to take up legislation on Thursday to cut and
potentially repeal the federal gasoline tax, but there is
considerable opposition to the measure in Congress. Asked if he
would veto the bill, the president said he did not anticipate
having to make that decision because he did not expect Congress to
approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, hoping to get political mileage from
the steep increase in gasoline prices this year, continued
Wednesday to attack the administration on energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, unfortunately, a Clinton-Gore anti-energy policy,
and the American people are paying the price _ at the gas pumps _
for eight years of neglect,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the
Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and many of his colleagues want tax breaks for oil
producers and more oil and gas exploration on federal land,
including the waters off Florida and California and the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opposes those measures. Wednesday, he renewed the call
he made in his State of the Union address in January for new steps
to promote fuel conservation and alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Republican Congress has rejected the
administration's requests for more money for energy research and
for tougher fuel economy standards for automobiles and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to try to lower
the federal gasoline tax, now 24.4 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The measure before the Senate would immediately roll back the
4.3 cents enacted in 1993, which was part of a large budget measure
approved by the Senate after Vice President Al Gore cast the
tie-breaking vote. The remaining 18.4 cents would be rescinded if
average gasoline prices, now slightly above $1.50 a gallon, reached
$2 a gallon.

HENDERSON GETS THE CALL-UP FROM PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ With Shawn Bates gone for the season as a result of
wrist and hip injuries, forward Jay Henderson Wednesday became the
latest player to get the call from Providence. In a season in which
the Baby B's have had an even tougher time fielding a healthy team
than the parent club, Henderson's presence here is a tough blow to
the Bruins' AHL affiliate but a boost for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little reward for the end of the season, that's the way
I look at it,'' said Henderson, who left Providence as the team's
second-leading scorer with 45 points (18 goals) in 60 games.
``Hopefully I'll be here for the rest of the season. It'll boost my
confidence going into the (AHL) playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is one of the few players in the organization who
hasn't been seriously injured this season. The worst he's had to
endure was being elbowed in the face last Friday against Kentucky.
It resulted in a broken front tooth and 15 stitches in his lip.
Despite that nasty bit of business, which is healing, Henderson
said he's had a satisfying year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone pretty well,'' he said. ``I've been very lucky,
knock on wood, with injuries. Offensively, I think I've been doing
pretty good. Injury-wise it's been tough for the team but I can't
complain about the ice time I've been getting. It's going well.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins' season ends, Henderson and others will be
returned to Providence as the Baby B's attempt to capture a second
straight Calder Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait for it,'' said Henderson. ``We've got six, seven,
or maybe eight guys coming down for the playoffs. I know (coach
Peter Laviolette) is really excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said as hard as this season has been on the players,
it's been more difficult on the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well. I don't know how he's done it,'' said
Henderson, of Laviolette's ability to keep the ship afloat. ``I'd
go crazy. I'd have lost my mind. He's been really positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The rash of injuries actually has worked in Henderson's favor
with more ice time and more responsibility than he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had four solid lines and the expectation of me
scoring goals wasn't on my shoulders,'' he said. ``This year, all
year we've been shortstaffed. I've put higher expectations on
myself in terms of scoring goals. I like that role. Guys have been
up in Boston so there's been more responsibility on myself and
other players down there to score goals and take over the
leadership roles. It's worked out well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tallas is back
</P>
<P>
   Having improved significantly since suffering a neck injury
March 21 against Tampa Bay, Rob Tallas was back in net Wednesday
night against the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of days off helped,'' said Tallas. ``It's still a
little sore, though. I think sleeping on it all night, when you
first wake up it's a little stiff. Sometimes you feel a little
muscle spasm in it. For the most part, though, every day I've
massaged it, put heat and ice on it. It was just a muscle so it's
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago Tallas couldn't turn his head, but now he's close
to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to affect me one bit out there,'' he said.
``Unless I get scored on from behind the net, I'll blame it on the
neck, but other than that I think it's pretty good. This is a fun
building to play in and I know this game means a lot to (coach Pat
Burns).''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could always be worse
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Bruins' injury woes have been this year,
Montreal's have been worse. The Habs went into Wednesday night's
game with more than 500 man games lost to injury. The Montreal
Gazette reported the payout to injured players this season was just
over $9.62 million in US funds out of a $32 million payroll. Saku
Koivu, Vladimir Malakhov (since traded to New Jersey), Trevor
Linden, and Brian Savage accounted for nearly two-thirds of the
$9.62 million . . . Jeff Hackett made his eighth consecutive start,
and 14th in 16 games, in net for Montreal. Hackett, 31, is expected
to start every one of the Canadiens' remaining games as they
continue their fight for a playoff spot.

FEDERAL AGENCY RETHINKS INTERNET PATENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing charges that it has been too ready to issue
patents for Internet business methods, the Patent and Trademark
Office said Wednesday that it was changing its evaluation
procedures to ensure that such patents cover true innovations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will be ``fine-tuning our examinations in a lot of
areas,'' its director, Q. Todd Dickinson, said. ``These changes
have been in the works for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions announced Wednesday are the first substantial move
to address a growing debate over whether ownership of business
methods can be awarded to someone exclusively because they are
applied online. The debate centers on these questions: Do recent
patents for practices like single-click purchases or
name-your-price sales, to name just two, protect legitimate
innovations? Or do they stifle electronic commerce and competition
when issued to inventors exploiting a patent system designed in a
non-digital age?
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the agency has made changes after being
criticized for lagging behind technology; a similar controversy
arose several years ago over its processing of software-related
inventions. Both then and now, critics have castigated the agency
for lacking the trained staff and resource materials to make
informed judgments _ this time, to know enough about software, the
Internet and electronic commerce to understand which business
methods are universal or already in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Wednesday that it would tackle those challenges
by increasing review of its' examiners work, and by inviting
representatives of the software industry to help educate the
agency's staff. The plans were first reported Wednesday in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said the examiners who analyze and approve patents
will be required to search databases looking for ``prior art,'' or
existing evidence of a business method. Each patent application
will now undergo an initial examination and two reviews, instead of
one review, and the agency will double the number of business
method patents it randomly scrutinizes a fourth time each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said he hoped ``to get more examiners into the
field,'' where they could visit laboratories and offices in the
software and computer industry, for example.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also like industry representatives to offer
their expertise to the agency and that he planned to invite them to
a roundtable discussion this summer, to share databases and to
bolster the agency's research resources and the expertise of its
examiners, managers and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   Software makers and others would find themselves dealing with
Group 705, a department created in 1997 to process business-method
software patents. At the time, it employed 12 examiners; now it has
40. It was set up not long after a furor arose over
software-related inventions.
</P>
<P>
   For years software had been covered by copyright law and was
believed, like mathematical algorithms, to be ineligible for
patents. But that changed as the software industry grew and as
ownership of lines of code became increasingly valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute grew, too, and culminated with a patent awarded to
Compton's New Media for a search-and-retrieval method. Critics
immediately pointed out that the technology was already in the
public domain. The Patent and Trademark Office was forced to reveal
that it had few software engineers on staff to evaluate such
applications and a pitiful supply of software manuals in its
research library. The Compton's debacle ended in a rare
re-evaluation of an issued patent, and an even rarer rescinding of
that patent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the agency issued new guidelines, hired new software
engineers to train as patent examiners, opened a new computer
database of existing software technologies, and dedicated itself to
collecting reference material for its software library. But
evidently, the lesson was not easily transferred to the explosive
growth in electronic commerce and the sudden glut of
Internet-related business method patents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the agency has found itself castigated for
issuing patents for what appear to be common ways of conducting
electronic business, like the 1-Click purchasing patented by
Amazon.com or the name-your-price method patented by Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Amazon, Jeffrey Bezos, proposed this
month that the controversy might be resolved by publishing
applications while they are pending, and by shortening the lifespan
of business method patents.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickinson rejected the idea that the 210-year-old patent
system was not well suited for a rapidly evolving computer-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've adapted to every technology that has come along,''
Dickinson said. ``People made the same argument when the telephone
came along. They said the same thing with Henry Ford and the motor
car. The automobile industry was the main part of the economy in
the first half of the century. This will sort itself out in the
same way.''

PITINO BACKS OFF FROM SUSPENSION THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A day after promising ``major suspensions'' of more
than one player for ``un-Celticlike behavior'' during Tuesday's
blowout loss in Orlando, Rick Pitino Wednesday did . . . nothing.
But he did say he could not envision staying in Boston if the
Celtics continue to flounder next season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of following through on the suspensions, Pitino backed
off after what he said was a soul-searching, two-hour meeting on
the team plane following the 122-87 loss, its worst of the season
and fifth in a row. The candid admission about his future in Boston
represented the first time Pitino has put a timeline on his stay in
town.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling news conference at the Celtics' practice facility,
Pitino said he would forfeit the remainder of his contract _ some
$20-plus million after next season _ because he wouldn't feel right
taking money if he wasn't producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come next year, if this team doesn't reach its potential,
doesn't make the playoffs, I'd be honest with you at that point, I
would definitely make a move myself,'' Pitino said. ``I would,
without question. Because all I would be doing if I stayed at that
point (would be) trying to take (owner) Paul Gaston's money.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What he said on Tuesday night was unequivocal and unambiguous:
unnamed players _ believed to be Antoine Walker and Danny Fortson _
were due for suspensions that could range from a couple games to
the season's final 11 games. His one qualifier: that he would sleep
on it. But he certainly sounded like someone who had had enough of
what he termed ``childish behavior'' of some of his players,
adding, ``Unfortunately, they're going to pay dearly for this.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to pay a thing. Pitino said he was impressed
enough by the cathartic talk on the plane ride and the players'
understandable frustration over a series of tough losses that he
decided not to suspend anyone. He also has decided that he probably
won't make major trades involving those same players, which he also
said he was thinking of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dead wrong what happened,'' he said. ``It was something
untypical of Celtic behavior, but I don't want to make anyone a
scapegoat and that's why I'm not doing that. Believe me, they
understand where I am coming from. If I thought suspensions would
help them as people, and help them as a team, I'd suspend all of
them right now. But I don't think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Walker, ``What happened? Nothing happened. We lost the
game. That's not y'all's business if something did happen. That's
my point. You can talk about the game, but what happened between
the team is our business and our business only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a difficult time for us because we're fghting
for the playoffs. We've lost five straight games and it hurts. We
got 11 games left. Our job as a unit is not to throw the season
away and end the season on a bad note. We gotta take these 11 games
and turn it around and get back on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was asked if he thought he was blowing his credibility
with his turnaround. ``Do I believe suspensions were in order? Yes
I do,'' he said. ``But I think professional basketball is a
partnership. I listened to them. They understand that this is never
to happen again, that this is never going to be tolerated again.
After listening to them, I did not feel suspensions were in order.
If that makes me soft, or losing credibility, then so be it. That's
the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Pitino has done a quick 180. He made
a threat last year after a big loss in Cleveland, promising that
after reviewing the tape, if he saw people degrading the Boston
uniform, those players would not start or play anymore. The next
day, he stuck with the same lineup and made no changes because he
said everyone was culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Also last season, Walker and Kenny Anderson were fined for
arguing on the court during a game in Washington. Pitino said he
talked to both players and added, ``It won't happen again. I'm
confident of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flip-flop this time wasn't the only issue Pitino
addressed in a rambling session with reporters that touched a lot
of bases. Inevitably, the question of his future in Boston came up,
again, and Pitino talked about what he felt next year's team needed
(veterans and athletes). But not before he said he'd step back at
the end of this season to make sure that, in his mind, he's
``making a difference in the lives of athletes. That's where I get
my gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was saying, for the first time, that he might not
return for the 2000-2001 season, Pitino said that was not the case.
He also said no one should worry about being traded or losing a job
based on Tuesday's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only change I'd make down the road is to myself,'' he
said. ``What I have to do, down the road, is if these guys don't
get it done, I have to say to myself, `Self, these are the guys you
wanted. These are the guys you brought in. This is your team.
You're not winning. . . . I'm not here to take Paul Gaston's money.
That will never happen. I'm not in it to say I've got a 10-year
contract. What I will say is, `Thanks, Paul, appreciate the
opportunity very much, keep your money and spend it wisely, on
players.'''

NOT MUCH GOLD AT `EL DORADO'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
It's been reported that DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg fought
to keep a realistic edge in the studio's new animated feature,
``The Road to El Dorado.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   If so, he lost. And so did the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended somewhere between a Bob Hope/Bing Crosby comedy and
surreal jungle adventure, ``El Dorado'' sure could have used some
kind of coherent basis. Yes, it's a cartoon fantasy, but the film's
inconsistent inner logic keeps throwing you out of its story, a
condition that's only exacerbated by a broader lack of
believability.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a caper comedy, at other times a straightforward
adventure, mixed up with supernatural elements that come out of
narrative nowhere and saddled with distractingly surreal production
numbers, the movie is constantly marching in different directions.
Marry that to an underfocused, meandering narrative that never
quite engages, and you've got a film that virtually invites you to
pick apart its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Which is too bad, since there's a good bit of lovely work that
went into the graphic end of this. Set mostly in the legendary lost
city of gold, the film makes marvelous use of Meso-American
designs, lush foliage and, through impressive new computer
programs, difficult-to-animate water motifs. The look is
appropriately mythic and as lavish as a conquistador's wildest
dream of New World opulence.
</P>
<P>
   What a half-baked buddy comedy is doing in the middle of all
this brilliance remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1519, and two likable Spanish ne'er-do-wells, quick-witted
Tulio (voiced by Kevin Kline) and dreamy Miguel (Kenneth Branagh),
wind up hiding from the law on one of Hernan Cortes' ships. Then
they're somehow in a rowboat with the helpful warhorse Altivo and,
amazingly enough, a map to El Dorado that starts right where their
dinghy happens to beach.
</P>
<P>
   They soon discover the great golden city, which is otherwise
safely inaccessible behind a waterfall and mountain grotto. The
Europeans _ who, like all the pre-Columbian locals, miraculously
speak English _ are naturally enough mistaken as gods (by immense
good luck, not to mention story contrivance, a belching volcano
chokes just when a miracle demonstration is required).
</P>
<P>
   Our con-happy heroes set about collecting as much treasure as
possible, which they plan to sail back to Spain in a seaworthy ship
that the adoring Indians, who presumably know nothing of the world
beyond their immediate environs, are capable of building in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a cartoon dimension as astounding as this one, there
are complications. It seems that Tulio and Miguel have stumbled
into a power struggle between El Dorado's roly-poly, life-loving
Chief (Edward James Olmos) and its hissable, human sacrifice-happy
high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante). There's also a shrewd
little gal, Chel (Rosie Perez, who besides her voice provided
remarkably well-copied body models, movements and attitudes), who's
onto the Spaniards' scam, wants in on it and gets PG erotic with
Tulio.
</P>
<P>
   You can decide whether you think Chel represents a physically
accurate celebration of indigenous femininity or a sexualized
Latina stereotype _ or just a latter-day Dorothy Lamour. While
that's arguably an individual judgment call, there should be little
debate that Elton John and Tim Rice's attempts to infuse the film's
songs with authentic Latin flavor fall well short of their
African-inspired ``Lion King'' music.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a monstrous stone jaguar that comes to life and
large bird and fish creatures that wander through frames from,
well, the gods know where. If this sounds like a stab at magical
realism, be warned that very little of it seems real at all.
</P>
<P>
   And the magic doesn't exactly work, either. &QL;

HATTEBERG WILL BE WAKEFIELD'S RIGHT-HAND MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Scott Hatteberg will be seeing a lot of Tim
Wakefield. In fact, the Red Sox catcher can expect to see the
knuckleballer every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg would like to be a starter, but that job belongs to
Jason Varitek. Since it doesn't appear that he will be traded,
Hatteberg's role in Boston will be Wakefield's personal catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they are both starters. I can only catch one of them,''
Sox manager Jimy Williams said of Hatteberg and Varitek. ``I've got
two good catchers. They both deserve to catch. We need them both.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Hatteberg will catch for Wakefield exclusively.
The 30-year-old catcher solely from the left side (while Varitek
switch hits), but Williams said Hatteberg will catch Wakefield even
when the opposing team starts a lefthander.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg, who was limited to 80 at-bats in 1999, had surgery on
his right elbow last May. In 1998, Hatteberg appeared in 112 games
and had 170 more at-bats than Varitek. But last season Varitek
emerged as one of the American League's best catchers, leaving
Hatteberg as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Down and dirty
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden is a New Englander (Weston) who
grew up worshiping the Red Sox. There are many reasons he is
popular in Cincinnati. One of them was on display Wednesday.
Bowden, dressed in shorts, T-shirt, and baseball cap, did infield
work with the grounds crew. He had a cup of water thrown in his
face during the routine, courtesy of Barry Larkin . . . Gary Gaetti
left the Red Sox' 4-3 win against the Reds early, packed his bags,
and left Ed Smith Stadium for the airport. According to the Red
Sox, Gaetti has permission to go home. He will miss Thursday's home
finale against the Twins at City of Palms Park in Fort Myers. The
plan is for the veteran first baseman/designated hitter to rejoin
the team in Phoenix Friday. No reason was given for his departure .
. . Many Red Sox have begun calling Carl Everett ``Dr. Evil.''
``It's an inside joke,'' Everett said. ``You know, it's from
(`Austin Powers.')'' . . . Everett and Jose Offerman were given the
day off . . . John Valentin hit a seventh-inning solo homer, a hit
that turned out to be the winning run. John Wasdin (two scoreless
innings) was credited with the win . . . As expected, the Red Sox
exercised one of two club options on Nomar Garciaparra's contract.
That means the shortstop will be with the team until at least 2003.
The Sox also have the right to trigger an option for 2004 . . .
Williams said he isn't concerned with the team's 10-17 spring
record. ``I've seen the same intensity all spring,'' the manager
said. ``Maybe I can't see the trees from the forest, I don't
know.'' . . . Ed Smith threw out the first ball. Not familiar with
Mr. Smith? The Reds' stadium here is named after him.

 &HT;    Fire consumed a family's dream
 &HT;    By Steve Visser and Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACWORTH, Ga. _ Joanne Cochran, mother of four and surrogate mom
to more, had almost escaped the trailer park in Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   With two jobs, long hours and little pay, the hard-working woman
had scrounged enough money for a home of her own _ an unremarkable
tale of the working poor's survival in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, an hour before she was to supervise the 4 a.m.
browning of biscuits at a nearby Hardee's, Cochran's trailer home
burned to the ground. The 37-year-old woman and seven other people
died. The youngest victim was a baby born two weeks into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just got everything going right, and now it's all gone,''
said Tammy Kines, assistant manager of the Modern Living Mobile
Home Park. ``She couldn't give her kids everything, but she made
sure they had everything they needed _ food, clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor reported the fire at 3:15 a.m. and a pumper truck
arrived minutes later, emptying its 750-gallon tank onto the
1,500-square-foot home, said Cobb County fire Capt. Mark Gresham.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer park covers 18 acres and has 114 homes, but the only
fire hydrant is at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was the worst from a single fire in Cobb County
history. State Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, who is also
the state fire marshal, said it was the worst residential fire in
Georgia since at least 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were unable to locate any smoke detectors in the
rubble _ which are typically found, said Oxendine, who was at the
scene. Investigators determined that an electrical short in an
unvented dryer in the living room caused the blaze, igniting
clothing around the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fire would have put out a lot of smoke,'' Oxendine said.
``From the nature of the fire, we are saying there wasn't a smoke
detector or it wasn't operational. ...There would have been more
than enough time for everybody to get out safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobile home park owner Ed Converse disputed the apparent absence
of a smoke detector.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran had just quit her second job as a maintenance worker in
the park and knew the importance of safety, he said. Other
maintenance workers said they recently saw smoke detectors in the
trailer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An ashen Converse said park employees had a going-away party for
Cochran two weeks ago. ``Everybody liked Joanne,'' he said. ``She
was close to her kids. If there was a stray, she took them in _
anyone, anything. She had a huge heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the fire were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochran's son Brandon, a rambunctious, blond, 6-year-old
first-grader at Acworth Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daughter Melissa, 15, a student at Awtry Middle School, who
baby-sat Brandon when her mother worked the evening shift at
Hardee's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daughter Nicole, and her cousin Jennifer Lacy, both 18, who
worked full-time at the Subway sandwich shop in the shopping center
across from the trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   _ Son Jessie, 19, who worked at Hardee's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jessie's 16-year-old girlfriend, Sarah Hilliard, and their
11-week-old daughter, Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters found three bodies in the front of the mobile home,
five more on the floor in a rear bedroom about 10 feet from the
back door. ``It appears they were all trying to exit,'' said Mark
Gresham, a Cobb County Fire Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's estranged husband, Dwight Cochran, identified the
bodies. ``He's torn up,'' said neighbor Patricia Harris. ``All her
kids are his.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wheeling said he awoke to find his neighbor's trailer
ablaze. He tried to open windows to get to the victims by breaking
a window with a rock, but it wouldn't shatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bounced off like it was hitting a wall ... the police said
it must have been the pressure from the fire inside,'' said the
40-year-old construction worker. ``The back end was burning pretty
good and you could see the smoke coming out all around the trailer.
I knew it was too late then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish to God there was something else I could've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran and her family had lived in Modern Living park for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just getting ready to move,'' said neighbor Donna
Travis, shaking her head. ``Joanne just got a new car and her
daughter had just got a new car and they were excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole's car was a 1985 Mazda MX6, and Cochran's was a 1991
Chevrolet Cavalier. Both cars sat unscathed by the shell of the
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends milled around, vowing they would do what
Cochran didn't manage to do _ leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen so much in here, it's got me scared,'' said Patricia
Harris, who lives two doors down from the Cochran home. ``I've got
to get out of here. I'm ready now. I stood here and watched it all
go up. It didn't take no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeling concurred: ``I'm not going to live in a trailer
anymore. I knew it was dangerous when we moved in here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving,'' said Donna Travis as she watched firefighters
poke through the rubble. ``I've got three kids. They don't need to
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Cobb County, as elsewhere in the generally affluent
suburbs of Atlanta, ``getting out'' doesn't come as easily as do
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile home parks such as Modern Living park, where rent ranges
from $120 to $180 a week, are one of the few options for low-cost
housing in a county where the average monthly rent for a
two-bedroom apartment is $783.
</P>
<P>
   Low rent opportunities _ and more specifically, the deposits and
credit history _ are beyond the reach of many working in service
and construction jobs, said Katheryn Preston, community coordinator
of the Cobb Human Services Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Paying $630 a month on rent would eat up 30 percent of the
income of someone making $25,200 year. Moving into a typical
one-bedroom apartment takes a wage of at least $10.96 an hour,
according to a study done by Preston's group.
</P>
<P>
   James Drummond, who lives in Modern Living park, makes $12 an
hour installing irrigation systems. After paying child support, he
doesn't have enough cash left to save for the deposit it would take
to live somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But money wasn't uppermost on the minds of friends, neighbors
and relatives Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They had set up four silk-flower wreaths outside the home. One
was in the shape of a cross. Another was decorated with a white
baby's rattle.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Joseph Wilmont and his 7-year-old sister Crystal
live catty-cornered to the trailer that burned. As they watched
mourners setting flowers down, the two children decided to pay
their own tribute to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   They walked through the rain to lay Pokemon cards on the wet
ground by the floral arrangements. Across the cards, Crystal placed
a pink bracelet stamped with the letters W.W.J.D., which stands for
``What Would Jesus Do.''
</P>
<P>
   The cards and bracelet were for everyone who died, but
especially for Brandon, their playmate. ``I'm saying that I'll be
your best friend forever and ever,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the charred trailer lay the trappings of a family's
life. A heap of blackened paperback novels, a torn blue-and-white
checkered tablecloth with Piglet on it, a single roller-skate with
lavender laces. A Big Wheel plastic tricycle, bikes and a plastic
rocking horse lay in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hilliard, whose granddaughter of the same name died in the
fire, came with relatives to survey the scene. Stanley Hilliard,
the younger Sarah's father, salvaged a picture frame with a Glamour
Shots photo of his daughter. In the picture, Sarah is wearing an
elegant blue gown and is smiling through the soft lens, her blond
hair styled and her eyes sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   The father's hands trembled as he cradled the photo, careful not
to cut his fingers on the broken glass. His daughter and the baby
will be taken to Chattanooga, Tenn., to be buried, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Sarah Hilliard smiled at a photo of her granddaughter
and the baby. In the photo, Sarah is sitting on the floor, nestled
with her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they precious?'' the grandmother asked in a voice
barely above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   At Awtry Middle and Acworth Elementary schools, counselors
talked to classmates of Melissa and Brandon Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just tough on the kids. ``I had one officer who said
he was OK until they brought the kids out,'' said Acworth police
Chief Billy Fuller. ``That really got to him. I've been in this 34
years. I hope I never see it again.''

MANY OFFICERS SAY GIULIANI WIDENS COMMUNITY BREACH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as he defends his Police Department daily from
what he has characterized as bashing, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
facing increasingly vocal criticism of his style and tactics on law
enforcement matters from an unlikely quarter: police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Although many officers say they appreciate Giuliani's support
for the officers involved in the recent shooting of an unarmed
black man, many also say the mayor's zero-tolerance approach to
crime, his limited outreach to the black and Latino communities and
his criticism of the dead man, Patrick Dorismond, have needlessly
widened the breach between the police force and people in many
neighborhoods it serves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Absent a survey, it is difficult to measure the extent of police
disaffection with Giuliani. But in interviews with 18 officers of
various ranks in the last few days, six supported the mayor's
stance, while a dozen, including several union officials, have
talked about how the mayor's strong language and aggressive
policies have undermined one of the force's greatest assets,
community support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it more difficult to patrol in minority
neighborhoods,'' said one detective who works for a squad in
Manhattan, ``because even though people may look at any officer and
not necessarily group them, when the mayor acts this way, he is
making it sound like it is `us against them.' I think it's adding
to the anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the Detectives Endowment
Association, which endorsed Giuliani in 1997, said the
administration needed to do much more to repair the frayed
relationship between the police and many minorities. He noted that
even the detective who shot Dorismond, Anthony Vasquez, had issued
a statement of compassion for the man's family.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting was ``100 percent justified,'' Scotto
said, ``but even being justified, you have to have a sense of
sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said that, while he did not believe either Giuliani or
Police Commissioner Howard Safir was to blame for heightened
criticism of the police, his organization had nonetheless had to
increase its outreach efforts because the city had not done enough
to explain the police perspective to minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of officers from a variety of ranks said that many
of their colleagues, caught between the scorn of some communities
and the pressure to produce ever-declining crime rates, had begun
to count the days to their retirement at 20 years. Some are
sporting hats that say ``20 and Out,'' one officer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ones being hit with the bottles, not Howie and
Rudy,'' said John Loud, the PBA's second vice president. ``We do
appreciate their help and their support, but we have greatly
reduced crime, and even though you always have to keep your eye on
it, now is the time to respond to the community's wishes and let
them know we are here for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that most police officers had full
confidence in the mayor and that much of the discontent was the
rhetoric of unions looking for an advantage in ongoing contract
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several officers interviewed applauded the mayor's
unflinching approach, calling it a brave stance in an era when many
politicians pandered to police critics. They said the media and
habitual police detractors had undermined the department's morale,
polarized the debate and caused declines in the number of
applicants interested in a police career.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he is sticking up for us against these hand-grenade
throwers out there,'' one Manhattan detective said of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office would not comment on the overall question of
criticism by police officers, except to refer to a comment the
mayor made earlier this week when asked to respond to remarks by
Scotto, the head of the detectives' union. The mayor called Scotto,
who is a frequent visitor to the White House, a strong ally of
President Clinton and his wife, Giuliani's opponent in the race for
the U.S. Senate. He dismissed the criticism as overtly political
and ``part of the pile on from people who support the Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said detractors were intentionally overlooking
the many efforts the administration had made to reach out to
various communities, including a meeting Safir had Wednesday with a
task force of Bronx clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda B. Jimenez, the deputy commissioner for community
affairs, said the department had held large meetings in each
borough six times a year and countless smaller sessions to bring
people together with the officers who policed their streets. She
cited a number of strategies, including efforts to work with
neighborhood residents to build relationships after drug sweeps on
targeted blocks. ``The only limit we have is the physical limit of
time,'' said Jimenez, who oversees an office of 300 officers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the interviews indicated that Giuliani's
relationship with the 40,000-member police force is a complex one,
even if the debate since the death of Dorismond on March 16 has
made it appear at times as if he and police officers speak with one
voice, from the same side of the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many officers said that the city's outreach efforts had
been half-hearted and that the pressure to produce higher arrest
tallies and lower crime rates had forced them to pursue lesser
offenders, a policy that had exacerbated tensions in many
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the lions and tigers; now we are out there looking for
the rabbits,'' said Loud, who said he had been a volunteer in the
mayor's 1993 campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When police controversies occur now, several officers said, some
people are unwilling to await the facts because they already
believe the police are guilty of overzealous enforcement.
Wednesday, for example, civil libertarians complained that police
truancy patrols were sometimes stationed outside high schools and
arrest students who are late, but on their way to class.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the image of police, the unions that represent
lieutenants and captains took out an advertisement in The New York
Post Wednesday that proclaimed, ``New York City Police Officers Do
Care.'' Lt. Anthony Garvey, the president of the Lieutenants
Benevolent Association, said the ad was intended to counter
criticism that police routinely use excessive force. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Garvey said the mayor was no more guilty of undermining
support for officers than Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Comptroller
Alan Hevesi or any number of other politicians. ``I think they are
being used by everyone,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scotto said the city needs to expand the number of
police-sponsored athletic leagues and other initiatives that put a

Department is only engaged in enforcement,'' he said, ``not in

   For his part, Lynch said he had met twice in recent months with
black leaders in Harlem to improve the dialogue. Wednesday, he
said, he met with Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban

   At least some of the mayor's critics admitted they were still
bitter from the labor dispute several years ago when officers
received no wage increase for the first two years of their current
five-year contract. Others said they believe the department should
have followed a strategy recently championed by William Bratton,
the former police commissioner, who has suggested taking advantage
of the ``peace dividend of safer streets to increase training and
build relationships.'' &QL;

   But a lieutenant who commands a detective squad in Manhattan
said the mayor's critics have forgotten it is Giuliani who deserves
the credit for reinvigorating the police force, bolstering its
budget, defending its officers and supporting its mission of
cutting crime. ``I'm certainly not going to repay his support of me
by not supporting him,'' the lieutenant said. ``People have short
memories. I don't.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Braves pick up Burkett, cut Simon
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Braves may have found their fifth starter.
They signed veteran right-hander John Burkett to a major-league
contract on Wednesday afternoon, only hours after he was released
by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be able to really help the first two weeks,'' said
Bobby Cox, referring to the time when John Rocker will be suspended
and the bullpen will be short-handed. ``And our fifth starter's
job, which we'll need on April 22, it will be maybe him, maybe
(Bruce) Chen, maybe (Luis) Rivera.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also released Randall Simon, whose .317 batting
average in 1999 wasn't enough to earn him a spot this year on a
roster that still includes four first basemen _ Andres Galarraga,
Wally Joyner, Brian Hunter and Bobby Bonilla. Reliever Rafael
Medina also was released, leaving 36 players in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, 35, is expected to join the Braves on Friday in Atlanta
when they play the first of two exhibition games at Turner Field.
Contract terms weren't available. He was 1-2 with a 5.29 ERA in 17
innings this spring, but he held the Braves scoreless on one hit in
two innings when they played the Devil Rays in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrific acquisition,'' Cox said. ``We saw
(Burkett) pitch in Venezuela and he looked good. I've always liked
John. He's not overpowering, but he throws strikes; he's able to
move the ball around the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, one of only five pitchers who have made 25 or more
starts every season in the 1990s, spent the last four seasons with
the Texas Rangers, who declined his $4.2 million option for 2000.
He was hindered by bursitis in his right shoulder early last season
and wound up with the second-highest ERA of his career at 5.62 and
a 9-8 record. But he was 5-1 with a 3.51 ERA over his last seven
starts.
</P>
<P>
   He was with the Marlins for all of 1995 and parts of 1996 before
going to the Rangers. Befoe that, he pitched six years for the San
Francisco Giants, winning 22 games in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has struggled in his bid to become the Braves' fifth
starter. He's 0-3 with a 10.13 ERA in five appearances this spring,
including four starts. He pitches today against the Florida Marlins
in the Braves' final exhibition before heading north to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won't need a fifth starter until April 22 because of
the off days in their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Simon _ the player Rocker referred to as ``a fat monkey'' in the
Sports Illustrated article that led to his suspension _ was out of
options, so teams interested in acquiring him were willing to wait
for his possible release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to trade (Simon and Medina) and we couldn't, so we
had a decision to make,'' general manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the two players now, the Braves had to pay them
one-fourth of their salaries, saving $339,375. Simon, 24, would
have made $222,500 this season, Medina $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Randall will land on a team in the near future,'' Cox
said. ``He's got some big-league talent, no doubt.''

IN BASERUNNING, A ROSE IS A ROSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ There was only one distressing moment in Brian
Rose's start Wednesday at Ed Smith Stadium. If you had watched the
troubling sequence on television, you might have cursed the screen
and asked, ``What exactly is that guy trying to prove?''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have been screaming at Rose, who is officially part
of the Red Sox' rotation as the fifth starter. You would have been
yelling at third-base coach Wendell Kim, who, I am convinced,
momentarily transposed his Roses. The Sox were playing the
Cincinnati Reds, so maybe Kim quickly went back to baseball's 1970
All-Star Game. That's when a fierce Pete (No Relation) Rose
barrelled into catcher Ray Fosse and separated the catcher's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The hit in '70 was a bit much, and so was Wednesday's wave by
Wendell. In the second inning, Brian Rose singled. The next batter,
Donnie Sadler, doubled. The ball was mishandled in the outfield _
but not that badly _ so Kim waved Rose home. He had no chance. The
ball was relayed from Gold Glover Ken Griffey Jr. to Gold Glover
Barry Larkin to solid catcher Eddie Taubensee.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Rose did have a chance, so what? These are rationing
times in baseball when it comes to pitching. This is an era that
features Pat Rapp as a No. 3 starter in Baltimore. When teams find
a young guy who can throw strikes (and that's the 24-year-old
Rose's profile), they nearly put him under surveillance. What
exactly is the necessity of sending a pitcher home in an exhibition
game? At best, you're going to get an uneven pitcher-catcher
collision. At worst? Use your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness to Kim, controversy comes with his position.
Fans and self-righteous sportswriters don't say, ``That was a
terrific job of baserunning management by the third-base coach.''
It's easy to focus on the mistakes. Wednesday's was even easier
because of how damaging it could have been. (Imagine if Kim had
sent Pedro Martinez home. The Sox probably wouldn't have let him on
the team bus.)
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams was a third-base coach in Atlanta from
1990-96. He shrugged off the sacrificial wave and added, ``I
probably would have sent him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Sox and their fans, this story has a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was even teased about his plate collision. ``He embarrassed
the entire pitching staff with his baserunning,'' reliever John
Wasdin joked. Rose hesitated when asked if Kim's ``go'' sign at
third surprised him. Wasdin was in another room when the question
was asked, but he still shouted ``Yes!'' as Rose paused.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose was away from the basepaths, he pitched well. He went
five innings and gave up seven hits. He was a mess his first couple
innings, allowing five of the seven hits, including an Aaron Boone
home run. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan immediately noticed Rose's
mechanics were off. Between innings, Kerrigan motioned as if he
were playing an accordion. Rose got the message: His body was
flying open too much as he threw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all over the place,'' Rose said of the early innings.
``I was throwing the ball right over the plate.'' He wasn't
credited with the win in the Sox' 4-3 victory, but he faced the
lineup that the Reds will use on Opening Day and gave up three
runs. If he keeps his turn in the rotation, he will pitch April 8
against Mo Vaughn and the Angels in Anaheim, Calif. A five-inning,
three-run duplicate would certainly be welcomed by Williams and
Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his good outing against the Reds, Rose was being
complimented by the manager. Rose worked with Rich Zawacki, the Sox
physical therapist, over the winter. They used weights and tubing
exercises to improve his arm strength. The theory last season when
Rose was optioned to Pawtucket in August is that his arm was tired.
Few people question his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched some great games last year,'' Williams said. ``How
many did he win, six? He could have had a lot more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was a respectable 7-6 last season with a 4.87 ERA. His ERA
this spring is 3.26, although Williams said he is less concerned
with the numbers and more with the performance. The performance has
been impressive. The Sox are fortunate to have a No. 5 starter the
caliber of Rose (or, if it doesn't work out with him, Juan Pena).
But for some reason, I can't stop thinking that their No. 5 is
going to have a better season than their No. 3 (Jeff Fassero).
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Rose comes Monday. He and Tim Wakefield will
not make the trip to Phoenix on Friday. Wakefield will pitch a
minor-league game Sunday. Rose will work on Monday and throw 85
pitches. Both pitchers will then fly to Seattle for Tuesday's
opener at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on Monday, Rose will have a couple things
in his favor: National League rules will not be in effect, and Kim
will be a few time zones away in Seattle.

6 HEALTH INSURERS ARE DEVELOPING ONLINE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: budgeted earlier as HEALTHEON-OUTLOOK; see also
HEALTHCARE-ONLINE)  
(lh) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to block Internet health care companies from usurping
their relationships with patients and doctors and eventually taking
large portions of their business, six of the biggest health
insurers are developing their own online project.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers hope the project, tentatively called MedUnite, will
make it easier for patients to enroll in health plans and choose
doctors and hospitals by replacing paperwork and telephone calls
with online channels; smooth relations with disaffected physicians
by speeding communications; and cut business costs, according to
people working with the group.
</P>
<P>
   The online system would also handle administrative services like
approving or denying medical procedures and processing payment
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the consortium _ Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Cigna Corp.,
WellPoint Health Systems, Oxford Health Plans, Foundation Health
Systems and PacifiCare Health Systems _ have been discussing their
plans with IBM, Oracle Corp. and several smaller technology
companies, and they plan to announce the project in the next 60
days or so. That could happen at back-to-back meetings that
Foundation, WellPoint and PacifiCare have scheduled with Wall
Street analysts on May 15. Oracle declined to comment, and IBM
could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative pits these insurers against Healtheon/WebMD,
by far the biggest Internet health care company. Before these
companies developed the venture, they were candidates to become
some of Healtheon's biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kroll, a health care analyst at SG Cowen, said: ``The health
plan companies want to stake out their claim. They have very
important relationships with doctors and patients and lots of data
and information that they have aggregated. They want to be
participants in this connectivity process, rather than risk being
left out of the loops.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon, as one of its main businesses, hopes to charge
transaction fees for the use of online connections that would link
insurers, patients and providers of care, including doctors,
hospitals and laboratories, as well as employers, who pay for most
care. The competition could cut into Healtheon's potential earnings
by eliminating important customers and even leading to pressure to
cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said that speculation about the insurer
group, which has not yet publicly discussed its plans, was already
affecting investors' confidence in Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a response to Healtheon's perceived market dominance
and the desire of payers to retain some control,'' said Janice
Young, a research director with the Gartner Group Research and
Advisory Service, which analyzes technology-related industries.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's frequently volatile stock price has been sinking
over the last four weeks since it announced disappointing financial
results for the fourth quarter of 1999. Shares of Healtheon fell
$1.375, to $30.6875, in trading on Nasdaq, which was down sharply
over all.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the insurers declined to confirm or deny the
plans for a consortium. But Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for
Aetna, said it was ``a prospective alliance that we think holds
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By virtue of the market leadership of the companies in this
group, it is uniquely positioned to drive change in the industry,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of Aetna, she said, the consortium is
``only one of a number of alternatives dealing with connectivity
that we are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   David Olson, a senior vice president of Foundation, said,
``Clearly the Internet presents a lot of opportunities for us as a
health plan to do a lot of things more efficiently.'' There are
efforts to create partnerships, he added, but ``I can't say very
much about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans nationwide
are developing joint Internet projects, and regional cooperative
online arrangements are also being discussed by insurers in New
England and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Sullivan, a senior vice president of the national Blue
Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the group was holding
discussions with ``a major technology company'' to create an
Internet platform that the association members could gain access to
for all types of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But some Blue Cross plans, including Empire in New York and
Horizon in New Jersey, will have contracts with Healtheon for
online services when its recently announced merger with CareInsite,
a competing Internet company, is completed. CareInsite also has
contracts with the HIP and GHI health plans in New York and
Massachusetts Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Arnold, the chief executive of Healtheon, said he
expected that competitors would offer ``many initiatives, now and
in the future.'' But he said that Healtheon, which has alliances
and cooperative agreements with dozens of Internet and health care
companies, was in a better position ``than anyone else to decrease
costs, increase health plan members' satisfaction and ultimately
improve the quality of care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be one of the winners in this space,'' added
Martin J. Wygod, the founder of CareInsite, who will be co-chairman
of Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Other big insurers are closely watching the consortium plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Healthcare is not an active part of the process, but we
are kept informed,'' said Jay Silverstein, a United vice president.
``We are willing to get involved in anything that will make life
simpler for physicians and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several insurance officials said they wanted to be sure that the
joint effort did not obscure the special products they offered to
``differentiate one health plan from another'' in competing for
customers, as Silverstein put it.

SMITS BRINGS POWER TO `PRICE OF GLORY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many a fight fan will tell you what a beloved boxer may lack in
finesse, technique or skill can often be made up for with heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory'' proves pretty much the same the thing about
filmmakers with little more to their game than earnest
understanding of well-proven cliches. This family boxing drama hits
all of the expected combinations, but does so in a sincere and
committed enough way to pack real emotional punch.
</P>
<P>
   Written by New York Times sportswriter Phil Berger _ who
collaborated with heavyweights Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes on
their autobiographies _ and directed by energetic feature
first-timer Carlos Avila, the film succeeds more often than not at
bringing something like individual life to its collection of genre
stereotypes. You've definitely seen all these characters and their
problems before, but you haven't felt their pain this acutely in a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The battling Ortega brothers have been sparring on the Arizona
Silver Gloves circuit since they were old enough to stand up
without getting knocked down. That's because, of course, their
Mexican-born father Arturo (Jimmy Smits) could have been a
contender before he was injured, and he's directed all of his
vicarious vitality into training his three sons to become
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Arturo's determination often borders on child
abuse, although he thinks he's lovingly providing his progeny with
an invaluable advantage that will advance their status in the
world. As you might expect, the boys don't grow up quite like
Arturo hoped. Eldest Sonny (Jon Seda of ``Selena'' and TV's
``Homicide: Life on the Streets''), is the most talented, but he's
more interested in his personal life outside the ring. Middle man
Jimmy (Clifton Collins Jr.) is the worst fighter, but the most
eager for his father's oft-withheld approval _ and self-damagingly
resentful when he doesn't get it. Baby Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez)
is a natural brawler and daddy's boy all the way, right down to the
featherweight temper control.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sensible mom (Maria Del Mar) who fights a losing
battle to keep peace at home, does somewhat better at instilling
good values in the boys and manages to love Arturo in spite of his
moody excesses. There's an exploitative promoter and shady
underworld characters. The fight footage is fair to middling. There
is a wedding. There is a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all of these generic elements, ``Price of Glory''
boasts a few unique assets. The manner in which it presents the
Ortegas with both pinpoint specificity as a Mexican-American family
and in more universal detail without making a fussy deal either way
is refreshing and, more important, it adds much needed groundwork
of truth to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And while all of the performances are worthy, and the younger
men certainly go the extra mile physically for their parts, Smits'
efforts to find the humanity in the tyrannical Arturo are most
impressive. Hateful as the guy often is, Smits does draw us deep
into his blinkered, selfishly well-meaning point of view. On the
few occasions when Arturo does see the error of his ways, Smits
makes us feel the impact, and often by nicely understated means.
</P>
<P>
   In a movie that's usually as subtle as a haymaker, those are
some sweet shots. &QL;

PATRONS HID IN BEER COOLER DURING TWISTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Customers in Angelo's Barbecue kept their
cool, if not their calm, as Tuesday's tornado tore over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode it out in the beer cooler,'' cook Timmy Gil said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The storm struck just before the time when the dinner crowds
begin to arrive at Angelo's. The restaurant, a cavernous place on
White Settlement Road, just west of downtown, is possibly the most
popular barbecue spot in the city.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:15 p.m. CST, however, only about 25 patrons were gathered
near the bar. Gil was slicing brisket when he saw a group of
customers charging from the front door, shouting that a tornado was
heading straight toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `I'm heading to the cooler,' and they all
followed,'' said Gil.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the group of about 35 huddled in the back of the
chilly vault and listened to the increasing roar of the approaching
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared I started cussing,'' said waitress Katy
McCorkle. ``I said a few choice words, then I realized nobody else
was making a sound and they were all listening to me. That
embarrassed me so much I got quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the frigid room waitress Carol Kreig was
pulling on a beer she had grabbed on her way in and trying to
ignore the increasing rumble overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the beer and my cigarettes 'cause I figured they might
be my last ones,'' said Kreig. ``I wanted everybody to sing so we
wouldn't have to hear that thing, so I started singing `Ninety-nine
Bottles of Beer on the Wall' 'cause it seemed appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I sang one chorus by myself and they all started yelling
at me to shut up, so I gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cooler, one man remained in the dining area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to go in with everybody else, but I looked around
and thought `I've put 35 years in this place and, if it goes, I
think I'll just go with it,''' said owner ``Skeet'' George. ``So I
sat down and waited for it to hit, and it didn't. It jumped right
over us.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado all but destroyed the Montgomery Wards building and
the Calvary Cathedral International a few blocks from Angelo's, but
left the restaurant undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have stayed in that cooler about 20 minutes,'' said
Kreig. ``And, you know, I don't remember being cold.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A Russian officer was charged Wednesday with killing a
civilian in Chechnya, a rare move by the Russian military to crack
down on human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Russian general staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin,
informed Acting President Vladimir Putin of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tank regiment commander, Colonel Budanov, humiliated a woman
citizen of Chechnya and then killed her,'' Kvashnin told the RTR
television network. He said Russia troops had apologized to the
woman's family and expressed regrets by attending her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Although international human rights organizations have reported
numerous cases in which Chechens have been robbed, beaten, killed
and raped, there has been little or no action until now by the
authorities to bring the culprits to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a welcome step, but not a substitute for a thorough
investigation of the massacres that have been documented so far,''
said Rachel Denber, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Curbing rights abuses is not only important for Russia's effort
to maintain smooth relations with the West, but also for its
longer-term effort to build credibility with the Chechen people and
win the peace.
</P>
<P>
   But peace, as Russians learned Wednesday, remained elusive. In a
deadly replay of recent clashes, Chechen rebels ambushed two
military units in the Chechen highlands.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, reported on state-owned television, undercut the
military's assertions that the war was virtually at an end and gave
new ammunition to some leaders who have begun to call for a
political solution to the 6-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when 41 militia members were traveling in a
convey near the mountain village of Zhani-Vedeno. The convoy was
attacked. When a rescue party went to the scene, it, too, was
ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that they did not know how many soldiers
had been killed or wounded in the convoy and that 14 were wounded
in the 20-member rescue group.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
Wednesday night that other forces were being dispatched to the area
and that Russian troops were using helicopters and artillery to
attack the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were the latest in a series of setbacks for the
Russian military. They were especially embarrassing, because they
occurred during a visit by Interior Minister Vladimir B. Rushailo
to Chechnya to plan ways to capture rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed to set the stage for a new call by regional
leaders for a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Putin Wednesday, two leaders from the
northern Caucasus regions that border Chechnya again urged him to
open a dialogue with President Aslan Maskhadov of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a kind of envoy between Maskhadov's government and
Moscow,'' President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia said in remarks
broadcast on the state-owned television.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to talk to Maskhadov, who was seen as a
relative moderate before Moscow mounted its offensive. But
Yastrzhembsky said on Wednesday that Maskhadov could be given
amnesty ``if it is proved that there is no blood on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military campaign, which has had broad public support
and has accounted in large measure for Putin's popularity, was
barely an issue in the recent presidential campaign. But the call
for a political solution to the war could pick up additional
support now that the election is over.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Boris Nemtsov, a reform-minded leader
in a coalition called the Union of Right Forces, said his party had
decided that it was too politically costly to oppose the war during
the election campaign. But more reform politicians might begin to
speak up now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then to organize a big noise was inefficient,'' Nemtsov said
in an interview. ``Now I think it is the thing to do.''

   TRENTON, N.J. _ As Gov. Christie Whitman stood beside Texas Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday night, addressing the Somerset County
Republicans who helped give her political career its start nearly
20 years ago, there were those in the audience who could not help
but wonder about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made a
daylong stop in New Jersey to campaign and replenish his coffers as
he prepared for the general election. Whitman, whose most visible
role this presidential season has been to serve as a punching bag
for Gary L. Bauer and other conservatives who object to her support
of abortion rights, dutifully escorted Bush around the state and
gave several heartfelt speeches on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But to longtime supporters of Whitman, like Somerset County
Surrogate Patrick J. Fittipaldi, it was impossible not to think of
the days, not long ago, when it was Whitman who was considered
possible presidential material and Bush was just another governor
with a well-connected father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would have brought a lot of balance to things,''
said Fittipaldi, who served as a freeholder with Whitman in the
early 1980s. ``She's conservative on some things, and open-minded.
She even would have mixed in a little bit of liberalism. But I
guess it just wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when she was chosen to make the nationally televised
rebuttal to President Clinton's State of the Union address, many
Republicans regarded Whitman as a rising power. She was fiscally
conservative, and she had kept her campaign promise to cut taxes.
She was also socially moderate, with a solid record on defending
gay rights, abortion rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   She was viewed as the kind of Republican who could attract
independents and women to the party.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, when Whitman vetoed a bill that would have banned
the late-term abortion procedure that opponents call ``partial
birth abortion,'' she became the Republican conservatives loved to
hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know what happened to Whitman and Republicans,
it boils down to three words,'' said Gerald Pomper, a political
science professor at Rutgers University. ``Partial, birth and
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has since moved slightly to the right on abortion
rights. Last year, she signed a bill requiring parental
notification for girls under 18 to obtain an abortion _ the first
restriction on abortion rights she has ever enacted.
</P>
<P>
   But that shift has done little to soothe the anti-abortion
campaigners who would demonize Whitman as a liberal in Republican
clothing. During this year's Republican primary campaign, Bauer and
Steve Forbes criticized Whitman, spitting out her name as if it
were a synonym for social permissiveness and moral decay. In one of
the debates, Bauer even challenged Bush to assure Republican voters
that he would not choose Whitman as a running mate. Bush dodged the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Whitman has remained largely silent, supporting
Bush, but not in a way that would jeopardize his support among
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was practically the last Republican governor in the nation
to be allowed to show her support for Bush,'' said Tom Wilson,
campaign manager for Whitman's 1997 re-election effort. ``She puts
a good face on it publicly. But the way they've treated her,
there's also a part of her which tries to moderate the party, that
must think, `Don't shun me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the ideologically charged primary campaign has ended,
moderate Republicans are urging Bush to move back toward the center
by making Whitman a more visible part of his campaign. Some Whitman
supporters even hold out the fleeting hope that she could still be
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was too early to consider a running mate and
sidestepped a question today about whether Whitman's support for
abortion rights would disqualify her. ``Good people can disagree on
the issue, and I understand that,'' Bush said. ``I mean, I'm
standing up here with a friend of mine. We disagree on some aspects
of the issue. That doesn't mean we can't be pulling for the same
thing, being on the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, said the governor would be
honored to be chosen as Bush's running mate, but considered it
unlikely.

DINERS WATCHED FROM 35TH FLOOR AS STORM APPROACHED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dramatic escapes were on the menu Tuesday
night at Reata, the well-known restaurant perched on the 35th floor
of the Bank One tower in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The next course, cleaning up, could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When the sirens sounded, 100 guests and 40 staff members were in
the restaurant. Briefly, they had a bird's-eye view of the
approaching storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw stuff flying by, and then you saw this mass of
twisting debris coming at you,'' said Mike Evans, an owner of the
restaurant. ``And as it was coming, it was blowing out electrical
poles.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that evacuating the restaurant took just 45 seconds as
customers took shelter in a stairwell. Staff members had time to
shut off the gas, electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle that no one got hurt in that whole thing,'' he
said. ``It really hit us like nothing you've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The upscale restaurant, which specializes in Texas cowboy
cuisine, has a commanding view of the city from one of the highest
points in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the windows were blown out, and ceiling tiles and
furniture were tossed about. Carpets were soaked.
</P>
<P>
   Al Micallef, another restaurant owner, said damage is estimated
at $300,000. He said he hopes to reopen in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Cherry, president of Dalcan Investments in Dallas, which
owns the building, said it will be many weeks before the building
reopens for tenants.

HUNTER ADVOCATES DEER-HUNTING HIATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN DIMAS, Calif. _ It might be another six months before
hunters can take aim at deer in the San Gabriel Mountains, but one
hunter wants the next season to be held off for two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Cancelling a hunting season might seem sacrilegious to some but
not to J.R. Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to postpone the season for two or three years,'' the
San Dimas resident said. ``This herd is down at least 70 percent
from the late '60s and we need to let them grow back.''
</P>
<P>
   But while wildlife officials admit the idea has merit, it is
also impractical; and a burgeoning mountain lion population is an
important part of the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it would make much of a difference,'' said J. Bradford
Crow of Pasadena, a L.A. County Fish and Game commissioner. ``What
we have going on is the deer population is in such a sad degree and
there are a bunch of different reasons. One reason we're talking
about this is because of the mountain lion. They've eaten almost
all the deer and now there's nothing left for them to eat except
dogs and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain lions eat about two or three deer a month, according to
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hunting in the San Gabriels since I was a kid and
there have been major changes,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime hunter, who got a 110-pound field-dressed buck
above Rincon in San Gabriel Canyon last October, admitted mountain
lion predation has been a problem. But he also pointed to other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot more populated than 30 years ago,'' he said. ``It
used to be that we'd go up and if we didn't see five or six bucks
in one day, you weren't looking. Now when we go, we're lucky to see
one. I was up by Frazier Park (in Los Padres National Forest)
recently and we did not see a single deer. But we saw three
mountain lions. A lot of the deer have moved farther into the
mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard advocates that the state should transplant deer into the
area, something all government officials say will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're seeing are bucks and doe that are no more than 2 or
3 years old,'' he said. ``Maybe we should import them from
somewhere else. There are so many deer in other states, it's
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow said he's had the same arguments with his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot less deer and I don't think the amount of
hunters that shoot them makes that much of a dent in the herds,''
Crow said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Woodard's contentions was the 1999 season. The area's
antlered archery season was Sept. 25-Jan. 31. The regular season
was Sept. 4-26 and Oct. 9-Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be really hard for archers to get a deer, but with
these new composite bows, anyone can get one,'' said Woodard, who
at times has hunted with a bow and arrow. ``Their season is too
long. Four weeks for the general season is just right.''

AMENDMENT TO BAN FLAG BURNING FALLS SHORT IN SENATE BY 4 VOTES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following two days of heartfelt speeches about
patriotism and symbolism, the Senate Wednesday failed to approve a
constitutional amendment to give Congress the power to ban the
desecration of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in 11 years that the Senate had taken up
the question, and each time supporters of the flag measure failed
to collect the 67 votes needed to pass such an amendment.
Wednesday's bipartisan tally was 63-37, four votes short of the
threshold. The last time around, in 1995, the proposal ended three
votes shy of passing.
</P>
<P>
   Although flag burning has been on the wane since the war
protests of the 1960s, supporters of the amendment argue that a
single desecrated flag is one too many, a view that public opinion
surveys say jibes with that of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is illogical for the Senate to ignore the feelings of the
overwhelming number of Americans who support flag protection,''
said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the
Judiciary Committee. He sponsored the amendment and said he would
revive it another year. ``The flag is not just a piece of cloth or
a symbol. It is the embodiment of our heritage, our liberties and
indeed our sovereignty as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate remains the final stumbling block to a constitutional
amendment banning flag burning. Last year, 305 House members voted
for the amendment, well beyond the two-thirds needed. Every state
but Vermont has passed measures expressing support for an amendment
that protects the flag. A constitutional amendment requires
approvals by three-quarters of the states' legislatures after it
clears Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment Wednesday was intended to
circumvent a 1989 Supreme Court ruling that said flag burning was a
protected form of political speech. The proposed amendment stated:
``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court's failure to act responsibly on this issue
leaves us no other means to protect this symbol,'' Sen. Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the majority leader, said on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, burning the flag is not speech,'' he added.
``It is conduct of the most offensive kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Democrats supported the amendment and four Republicans
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of debate, the amendment's opponents received
an important boost from two Democrats, significantly Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, a senior member of the Senate who is known for his
knowledge of the intricacies of the Constitution and of Senate
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the Senate floor, Byrd stated solemnly that he would
reverse his previous endorsement of the flag amendment _ which he
said had resulted from ``shock'' over the Supreme Court decision _
and would now oppose the measure. The decision, he said, came after
days of research and of discussion with Constitutional scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of few subjects that have come before the Senate that
have given me greater anguish,'' said Byrd, who first made his
announcement on Tuesday before a group of American Legionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Byrd said, he concluded the amendment did not fit
the confines of the Constitution and would serve to debase it, just
as the constitutional amendment on Prohibition had, before it was
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said he rejected the flag-burning amendment for several
reasons: such acts are not pervasive, an amendment would only
encourage them and flag desecration could already be dealt with
under existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag is the symbol of our nation,'' Byrd said. ``That
flag is the symbol of our nation's history. That flag is the symbol
of our nation's values. We love that flag. But we must love the
Constitution more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., also changed his position after long
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   With military veterans standing at the center of the debate,
both sides produced the words of their own war heroes to buttress
their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch cited a letter by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded
the troops during the Persian Gulf war. ``The flag remains the
single, pre-eminent connection among all Americans,'' the general
wrote in a letter dated April 5, 1999. ``It represents our basic
commitment to each other and to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats quickly brandished their own letter from a war
hero, from Gen. Colin Powell, and pointed out that a diminishing
number of veterans saw a need for an amendment. ``I will not amend
that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants,'' Powell
wrote on May 18, 1999. ``The flag will still be flying proudly long
after they have slunk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over flag-burning has changed little over the years.
Supporters of the amendment argue that the flag is a unique symbol
that binds the country, one that men and women have died to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who has traded the life of a loved one for a flag,
folded at a funeral,'' Hatch said. ``Let's think about that trade _
and about the people who made that trade for us _ before deciding
whether the flag is important enough to be addressed in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the other side of the debate maintain that an
individual's right to free speech, including the right to burn a
flag, is paramount. If the Senate approved the measure, they
argued, it would be following the example of such notorious
countries as Iraq, Iran, Libya and Nazi Germany, which banned flag
desecration.
</P>
<P>
   ``A desecrated flag is replaceable,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., a decorated Vietnam War veteran. ``Desecrated rights are
lost forever.''

TWO USC GUARDS WON'T RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC point guard Rashad Jones and shooting guard
Malachi Thurston will not return to the team next season, according
to sources within the basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-1 junior from San Jose, has a chronically
separated shoulder that will prevent him from playing next season
and effectively ends his college career. He will continue to attend
USC on a medical-redshirt scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston, a 6-4 freshman from Oakland, has encountered academic
problems and will probably be forced to enroll at a junior college
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones averaged 0.9 points and 1.0 rebounds last season. Thurston
averaged 1.6 points and 1.0 rebounds. Neither played a key role for
the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Jones and Thurston means USC will have two
extra scholarships available for the spring signing period, which
begins next month. USC could sign as many as four players in April,
but it's doubtful the Trojans will sign more than two.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Robert Hutchinson of Okaloosa-Walton Community
College in Niceville, Fla., reaffirmed his oral commitment last
weekend during a campus visit, and USC is waiting for Laguna Beach
High guard Travis Hanour to make a decision. Hanour visited Utah
last weekend but is expected to chose between USC and Arizona. He
originally committed to USC in February but is currently undecided.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby has been out of town recruiting and was
unavailable for comment. Bibby recently visited Puerto Rico, where
he scouted 6-5 guard Roberto Nieves. But Nieves is unlikely to
attend USC, because he has not met the necessary academic
requirements.

JUDGE RULES CLINTON VIOLATED WILLEY'S PRIVACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge said Wednesday that President
Clinton and top aides intentionally violated federal privacy laws
by releasing personal letters from Kathleen Willey to undermine the
credibility of her sexual-misconduct claims against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion was mentioned in a memorandum from U.S. District
Judge Royce Lamberth, a Republican appointee, ordering presidential
aides to respond to queries from Judicial Watch, a conservative
group spearheading a civil lawsuit against the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disputed the finding, saying he had been reluctant to
release the letters from Willey but did so two years ago because
``it was the only way I knew to refute allegations'' that he had
groped her during a private meeting in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Beth Nolan said Lamberth's order would be
appealed. ``We are confident it will be overturned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless reversed, Lamberth's decision clears the way for Judicial
Watch and its clients to question White House aides about how
Willey's letters to Clinton were made public in 1998 in the midst
of the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-perjury scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch and its clients ``have sufficiently established
that the White House and president were aware that they were
subject to the Privacy Act, and yet chose to violate its
provisions'' by releasing the letters, Lamberth wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court cannot accept or condone this unlawful action,''
said Lamberth, who has allowed Judicial Watch's legal team wide
latitude in examining whether the Clinton White House compiled
dossiers of damaging information for use against political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lamberth's decision Wednesday allows Judicial Watch to
delve into the letters, Willey, the Democratic activist and former
White House volunteer, is not a party to the lawsuit. The suit was
filed on behalf of former employees of the Reagan and Bush
administrations over the White House's gathering of hundreds of FBI
files on Republican appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton approved the release of Willey's letters the day after
her appearance on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' in which she accused him
of fondling her during a meeting in 1993. Her allegation was made
as the president was scrambling to keep secret his affair with
Lewinsky, a coverup that eventually led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, written by Willey after her Oval Office encounter
with Clinton, spoke of him in glowing terms and appeared to some
presidential supporters to cast doubt on Willey's claim that she
was offended and upset by Clinton's alleged behavior. The president
denied making any improper advances toward Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lamberth told Clinton's lawyers nine months before
Willey's letters were released that the White House is required to
abide by the Privacy Act, Clinton on Wednesday said the subject
never came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the decision was made to release those letters, I didn't
even have any conversation with anybody about the Privacy Act,''
Clinton said during a White House press conference.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Lamberth said three White House attorneys who
advised Clinton about releasing the letters _ longtime confidant
Bruce Lindsey, former White House Counsel Charles Ruff and former
Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills _ also may have violated
the act.
</P>
<P>
   Violation of the Privacy Act is a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth's ruling came amid calls for the Justice Department to
investigate reports of missing White House e-mail relating to the
Lewinsky scandal. Justice already is examining possible wrongdoing
in the failure of White House officials to turn over computer
records sought in conjunction with a campaign finance investigation
by congressional committees and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy downplayed
reports that a previously undisclosed computer disk had turned up
containing e-mails from Lewinsky to two confidants while her affair
with Clinton was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand it simply contains duplicative e-mails that were
already examined in 1998,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The disk reportedly has copies of e-mail correspondence between
Lewinsky and the two friends, both of whom testified before a
federal grand jury _ presidential secretary Betty Curry and White
House aide Ashley Raines.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also is investigating the release of
information damaging to the reputation of another Clinton critic _
Linda Tripp. Data from her personnel file at the Pentagon was
provided to a reporter during the investigation that led to
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Maryland judge said she would rule in May whether
Tripp would be tried on charges of violating the state's
wiretapping laws when she tape-recorded conversations with
Lewinsky. The tapes, which provided the basis of the impeachment
investigation of Clinton, included Lewinsky's description of their
affair and discussions of an attempt to defy court orders in an
effort to keep it secret.

FOES KNOW MATADORS CAN BITE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Respect is evident, but can it translate into
victories?
</P>
<P>
   Men's volleyball opponents recognize that Cal State Northridge
no longer is a pushover. UCLA lost. Pepperdine won the fifth game
16-14. USC won the fifth game 21-19.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Matadors, while ranked 11th in the USA Today/American
Volleyball Coaches Association poll, are 8-12 (4-10 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) heading into Wednesday's match with UC
Irvine. They have by far the worst record of any top-15 team.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: Northridge no longer can sneak up on unsuspecting
teams.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the Matadors went into Wooden Center and shocked
UCLA for just the third time in 42 matches. Less than a week later,
they almost shocked Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer the case. Pepperdine won in four games last
week. Now, fourth-ranked UCLA gets its second chance Friday night
at 7 at Northridge, a place where they haven't lost in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be super-focused,'' CSUN coach Jeff Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   How right he is. UCLA watched tape of Northridge this week,
looking for sideout preferences. Northridge doesn't have time to
focus on UCLA because of the Irvine match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' Campbell said. ``You're
legitimate and you've got teams that are no longer taking you
lightly. If they do, they're going to lose. It means we're getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (21-3, 11-3 MPSF), meanwhile, will sport a different look
on Friday: Setter Brandon Taliaferro will play. Taliaferro missed
the last CSUN match with back injuries. Now, he's playing with four
degenerative discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon knows the offense,'' UCLA coach Al Scates said.
``Brandon leads the nation in aces with 42 in 62 games. That's
amazing. We score a lot of points when Brandon serves.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the track: USC hosts one of the top four-way meets in the
country Saturday. Beside the Trojans, Nebraska, North Carolina and
Louisiana State will compete at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   So far, USC has several athletes who have qualified for the NCAA
meet. Triple jumper Djeke Mambo has leaped 53 feet, 10 inches,
second-best in school history. Hammer throwers Szabolcs Maroti
(225-10) and Dagan Massey (204-7) also have qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Three football players have provisionally qualified: Sultan
McCullough in the 100 meters (10.26), Kareem Kelly in the 100
(10.33) and Marcell Allmond in the decathlon (7,152 points).
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, defending NCAA 100-meter champion Angela
Williams has secured a berth in the 400 relay, joining Candace
Young, Malika Edmonson and Kinshasa Davis in running 43.76,
fourth-best in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has won four of the last six men's Big 12 Conference
titles and 19 of the past 21 women's. North Carolina is the
defending ACC men's champion, and the women finished third in the
recent NCAA Indoor Championships. LSU returns five All-America men.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC vs. UCLA tennis: The men meet Friday at USC, for the
157th time. UCLA (14-2) is ranked first nationally and is led by
Jean-Noel Grinda, last year's national runner-up. But Grinda has a
shoulder injury and is 2-2 in singles this season. He remains
effective in doubles, where he teams with Jean-Julien Rojer for a
10-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   The big matchup is UCLA's Jong-Min Lee and Brandon Kramer,
ranked fourth, against sixth-ranked Ryan Moore and Nic Rainey.
</P>
<P>
   USC (12-5) is 19th and looks to senior Patrick Gottesleben,
ranked 40th, to lead. He'll battle Lee, ranked 26th.
</P>
<P>
   The USC women are ranked seventh and play at No. 8 UCLA on
Saturday at noon. This is the 52nd time these two teams have met.
</P>
<P>
   USC senior Jacqui Boyd has won 11 consecutive singles matches.
Freshman Jewel Peterson, at No. 8, is the team's highest-ranked
player. She'll battle Sara Walker, at No. 6, in a can't-miss battle
of freshman phenoms. Walker is also ranked ninth in doubles when
teaming with Amanda Basica.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after winning a presidential primary that
exposed new fissures in New York's Republican Party, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas returned to the state Wednesday, attending a
fund-raiser with a party establishment that tried to demonstrate
that it had put its bickering behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who before the
primary had publicly disagreed over the Bush campaign's strategy in
New York, took the stage at a Manhattan hotel to praise Bush and
one another. Bush hailed his ``long and steadfast'' friendship with
Pataki and said he appreciated the ``reform-minded agenda'' of
Giuliani, who is running for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men did not pose for the customary
hands-clasped-together-in-solidarity photo at the fund-raiser,
which netted roughly $500,000 for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush visited a charter school in Newark,
N.J., with New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman. He was asked at
a news conference whether he could choose a running mate who, like
Whitman, backed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He responded that he was not yet focusing on the makeup of the
ticket. But, he added: ``Good people can disagree on the issue, and
I understand that. I mean, I'm standing up here with a friend of
mine. We disagree on some aspects of the issue. That doesn't mean
we can't be pulling for the same thing _ being on the same team.
And I respect Governor Whitman's views and I respect her as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani showed fealty to Bush, the mayor gave no
indication that he wanted Bush's help in the Senate race in New
York, which tends to skew Democratic in presidential contests.
Giuliani is to campaign next month with Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who lost in the primaries to Bush, suggesting that
Giuliani believes that he has more to gain aligning himself with
the acknowledged loser than the putative standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, appears
to consider Bush a liability for Giuliani, and she is trying to
link the two in her attacks on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York primary, Giuliani endorsed Bush, but he
criticized Pataki, who led the Bush campaign in New York, for
running negative commercials against McCain. Polls show that McCain
was relatively popular with Democrats and independents, who could
not vote in the New York primary but obviously can in November.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the fund-raiser about Bush, Giuliani's campaign
manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said: ``The mayor was with John
McCain last night in Washington. He was with Governor Bush today in
New York, and of course looks forward to campaigning with Senator
McCain and Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush declined to get entangled in the Senate race
beyond expressing his general support for Giuliani. At the news
conference in Newark, he was asked about Giuliani's criticism that
Clinton has not adequately reimbursed the federal government for
her campaign travel aboard government planes. ``I don't have an
opinion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Bush, besides a few lines about Pataki,
Giuliani and other state Republicans, offered his standard stump
speech without tailoring it to the state. ``I will proudly wave our
banner of compassionate conservatism all across the land,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was one unexpected bit of local color: A few death-penalty
protesters briefly interrupted his speech before being removed by
security officers. Bush staunchly favors the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day with a breakfast with Archbishop Theodore
McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. Bush has
sought to court Catholic voters in the wake of controversy over his
South Carolina visit to Bob Jones University, whose leaders have
espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then visited the Newark charter school, the North Star
Academy, which has a predominantly black student body. Bush, who
believes the federal government should help create more charter
schools, said the academy represented the kind of local innovation
he hoped to foster. ``Had we tried to invent North Star at the
federal government, they'd still be in committee hearings,'' Bush
said.

<P>
   John Cusack loves music. Sinatra, Mozart, the Cramps _ you name
it, he'll have an opinion about it. He prefers LPs to CDs, knows
the locations of the best record stores around the world and has
already picked out what song he wants to be played at his funeral
(Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross,'' unless he changes his mind
again).
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's appreciation for music was evident in ``Grosse Point
Blank,'' the charmingly offbeat 1997 film that he co-wrote and
co-produced under his New Crime Productions banner. Clash frontman
Joe Strummer scored the movie, and the soundtrack, a nice sampler
of Reagan-era pop music, continues to be a big seller to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's latest film, ``High Fidelity,'' continues along the
same path. Cusack and his Evanston, Ill., pals Steve Pink and D.V.
DeVincentis have again written the screenplay, adapting Nick
Hornby's novel about a music junkie trying to figure out women. The
film, which is often set in a barely functioning record store,
features 65 different songs, ranging from classic rock to cult
bands like the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and the Beta Band.
</P>
<P>
   Here we talk to the 33-year-old Cusack about his feelings for
rock, ``Crocodile'' and otherwise, his proclivity for wearing Clash
T-shirts in his films and why music always seems to sound better in
a record store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you discover music?
</P>
<P>
   A: As soon as my sister (actress Joan Cusack) allowed me into
her room to play 45s on her turntable. There was no turning back
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of stuff did your parents listen to?
</P>
<P>
   A: They would listen to classical and stuff like Gladys Knight
and the Pips and Sinatra. But nothing modern. We'd introduce stuff
to my dad and he'd say, ``Where was I?'' I remember when I got out
of high school, I told him, ``You've got to listen to Bob Dylan.''
He had never heard one of his records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do your tastes run?
</P>
<P>
   A: All over the map. There's something satisfying about
listening to classical music and then there's something equally
satisfying about listening to music that sounds like it was made in
a concrete bunker underwater with some tape rolling. It makes no
difference, as long as it's got soul creeping through it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``High Fidelity'' features some pretty heated debates among
the three guys working in the record store. Did you and your
co-writers get into the same kind of arguments?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, the battles were huge. It was a war. It was just like in
the book. We'd talk about music and each one of us was absolutely
right beyond a question of a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the biggest fights about?
</P>
<P>
   A: What 65 songs we'd have in the movie. If it were up to those
guys, we would have limited it more to these specialized bands that
nobody knows. Don't get me wrong. I love those groups, but there
comes a point where you have to broaden the range and include songs
for people who don't know as much about music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like Elton John's ``Crocodile Rock''?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Grimacing) That was (director) Stephen Frears' choice. I
hate that song with a passion to this day, but he liked the faux
innocence of it to match the scene it's in. And that's OK. It's not
that big of a deal. But at the time for us, including ``Crocodile
Rock,'' was a travesty and we made a great big stink about it:
``You can't! You can't!'' That's how obsessive we were about the
music in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any song you wanted in that didn't make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was this one Warren Zevon song that I thought was
perfect, but nobody else felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you remember your first concert?
</P>
<P>
   A: I went to a simulcast of the Who just after Kenny Jones
joined them. The first concert that blew off the back of my head
was Fishbone. Back in the day, those guys were great. They were so
ahead of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've worn Clash T-shirts in a few of your films. That had
to be another favorite band.
</P>
<P>
   A: Definitely. But I started out listening to ELO, KISS and
Cheap Trick. I guess you'd consider them guilty pleasures, but
those were the bands that I cut my teeth on. You know, when you're
13, 14 years old and you want to figure out what's radical and you
realize you can be an individual and buy stuff that your parents
don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was your parents' reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think, like all parents, they didn't understand what the
hell we were listening to. There was this store in Chicago, Rick's
Record Exchange, that's just like Championship Vinyl (the record
store in the movie). I used to go there every day after school and
listen to music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You must have a pretty fair collection.
</P>
<P>
   A: You'd think. But I don't collect. I have things and then they
go away. I don't have a place where things stay. It's probably
because I'm so disorganized. I'll grab a CD to go somewhere and
I'll leave it in somebody's car. I'll go out and buy stuff ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you just won't hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. I mean, I'll be in a record store and hear something
great, buy it, listen to it for a while and then it's gone. But in
my head, I'll have it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does music always sound better when you're listening to
it in a record store?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a good question. It's true. I've bought albums I've
heard in stores and then when I listen to them again, I wonder what
the hell I was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because everybody goes to a record store hoping to
find that piece of treasure and you have all that energy around
you. It's almost a sacred observance. Everybody's kind of serious
when they're in a record store. You know what I mean? There's this
undercurrent of focus where people are looking, looking, searching
for something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the last treasure you've found?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's this band called Ozomatli. The music is like a
cross-cultural block party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you say you agree with your ``High Fidelity'' character
that Jimmy Cliff's ``Many Rivers to Cross'' would be your funeral
song?
</P>
<P>
   A: That would do just fine. (Pause) But then again ... actually
... nah, I'd probably want Bob Marley. He'd turn it into a party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It doesn't usually turn out that way despite the best of
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't, does it? Maybe we could start with Cliff and
segue into Marley. You've got to give it a try.

TEXAS TORNADO DAMAGE IS IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERNIE MAKOVY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The governor's office declared Tarrant
County a disaster area Wednesday as workers began cleaning up the
devastation from tornadoes that ravaged Fort Worth and Arlington,
killing five people, wiping out neighborhoods and making downtown a
ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Damage in Fort Worth alone was projected to top $300 million,
with most of the destruction downtown and in the Monticello,
Rivercrest and Linwood neighborhoods. Figures for Arlington, where
100 homes sustained major damage and 1,000 had light to moderate
damage, were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr accompanied state officials on a
helicopter tour of the two cities and said he was ``just completely
shocked'' by the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mike Moncrief said he was awestruck by the disaster.
``I've seen the aftermath of Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls
(tornadoes), but I just didn't expect it here in our own back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two tornadoes hit Fort Worth and Arlington about 30 minutes
apart Tuesday evening. They plowed through the Fort Worth business
district, shattering plate-glass windows in high-rise buildings,
and ripped through a residential area south of Interstate 20 in
southeast Arlington. Fifty-six homes were damaged in Grand Prairie,
east of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service gauged the Arlington tornado at its
peak as an F3, which packs winds of 158 to 206 mph. The Fort Worth
tornado was an F2 with winds ranging from 113 to 157 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry granted the county disaster declaration in
the absence of Gov. George W. Bush, who was out of state
campaigning for president. The governor issued a statement saying
the damage is ``a tragic reminder of the fierce power of nature. My
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Our
state disaster recovery teams are already working with local
officials to assess the damage and provide relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington damage was primarily confined to the area around
Matlock and Bardin roads near the municipal airport; no serious
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the major path of destruction was along a
two-mile stretch from University Boulevard along West Seventh
Street through downtown. More than 80 people were treated at area
hospitals, and at least two were in serious or critical condition
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Bob Terrell estimated preliminary damage in Fort
Worth at $157 million, but comparisons already were being made to
the 1995 hailstorm, which produced $400 million in insured damages
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Insurance Information Service estimated that
the final damage total for the Tuesday tornadoes will exceed $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hailstorm was more widespread, whereas now, the damage is
more concentrated and obviously more extensive,'' Assistant City
Manager Ramon Guajardo said. ``But I don't know which will be more
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 buildings hit by the tornado in Fort Worth, eight were
destroyed, 27 sustained major damage and 15 had minor damage. At
least one, the Cash America building, may have to be torn down,
Deputy Fire Chief Jim Tidwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also damaged in Fort Worth were the downtown Central Library,
the Cowtown Coliseum and the International Center.
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals treated more than 80 people for injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death toll stood at four Wednesday night, with one
person missing and presumed dead. Two victims were crushed on the
outskirts of downtown _ Carl Spence, 67, by a collapsing wall and
Howard D. Thornton by a truck trailer that toppled onto him _ as
the tornado plowed its way through the heart of the city about 6:30
p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the third victim _ Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, _ was
recovered Wednesday morning along a creek in the 9500 block of
Trinity Boulevard, behind the Bell Helicopter plant in northeast
Tarrant County. Dickens and his grandmother, Adele Warren, 62, were
in a car that was swept away by rising creek waters as they left
Bell Helicopter. Warren's body had not been located by Wednesday
afternoon, but she is presumed to be dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juan C. Osequera, 19, who suffered severe head trauma when a
softball-size hailstone hit him, died Wednesday night at a Fort
Worth hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon Wednesday, authorities had reopened many
downtown streets that had been barricaded, leaving the business
district a virtual ghost town bounded by glistening sidewalks
sprinkled with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Streets surrounding the most heavily damaged high-rise buildings
_ Bank One, UPR Plaza, Tandy Towers and the Tandy Technology Center
_ may remain closed through the weekend as workers remove cracked
or broken plate-glass windows, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and managers of downtown properties were allowed into
their buildings Wednesday afternoon to assess damage and secure the
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of downtown workers who received an
unexpected holiday Wednesday will probably be permitted to return
Thursday, Police Chief Ralph Mendoza and Guajardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the downtown area, the heaviest damage was in the
Linwood neighborhood. More than a dozen homes and duplexes,
including the former home of presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald, were destroyed or heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Also hard-hit in Fort Worth was the Monticello neighborhood,
where the storm ripped roofs from homes and uprooted 80-year-old
trees along Hamilton Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3900 block of Hamilton Avenue, winds lifted one family's
garage and moved it 10 feet north. A basketball goal was knocked
horizontally, and winds drove it into the family's white sedan,
embedding the backboard in the left taillight.
</P>
<P>
   The only reported neighborhood injury was a man working at the
West Seventh Street Barbershop. The owner's son, Michael Moore, was
the last to leave the barbershop, said his mother, Rosa Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just walked out of the shop, and the wind blew him
against the building and it collapsed on top of him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, the tornado destroyed a section of roof at the
Bell Helicopter Textron facility. Flying debris damaged a V-22
helicopter and an XV-15 demonstrator but did not damage two CV-22
Osprey helicopters housed there, Bell spokesman Bob Leder said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado skirted the I-20 corridor of car dealerships, then
slammed into a residential neighborhood flanking both sides of
Matlock Road just south of Bardin Road. Some houses, particularly
along Embercrest Lane and Chasemore Lane, caught the brunt of
powerful winds that left only clumps of rubble atop concrete
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents credited their survival or lack of serious injury
to residential construction that places bathrooms in the middle of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bathrooms saved lives,'' said Laura Donovan, whose home
on Sandalwood Lane was damaged but not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Fire Battalion Chief John McQueary also marveled at
the absence of serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a strict ``no fly
zone'' over downtown Fort Worth at the request of the FBI, said
John Clabes, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why is that the downdrafts from the helicopters
flying over downtown were blowing some of the remaining shards of
glass out of those tall buildings and blowing those shards down on
the people trying to clean up the mess below,'' Clabes said.
</P>
<P>
   The ban will remain in effect until the FBI or Barr requests
that it be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth suburb of River Oaks, Castleberry High School
students, whose classes were canceled Wednesday, are expected to
return Thursday. The campus sustained widespread damage to the
field house, vocational building and main building.
</P>
<P>
   River Oaks City Administrator Joy Williams said 80 structures
sustained damage.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods on the southern and western fringes of River Oaks
were hard hit, with fallen trees, broken windows and roofs blown
off.
</P>
<P>
   The city lost many stately trees more than 100 years old, Mayor
Jack Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired graphic artist Jerry Grimes, 65, now working part-time
for the U.S. Census, recalled how he was leaving Tandy Center on
Tuesday evening when he saw the storm developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started forming from the ground up,'' Grimes said. ``Then I
saw it begin a slow counterrotation. The sky turned black, and then
the clouds were pulled right out of the sky... The yellow stripe on
my back started to grow. At that point, I decided the tornado was
bigger and badder than me, so I took off.''

CUBAN FATHER IS READY TO RECLAIM CUSTODY OF SON, CASTRO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ As the relatives of Elian Gonzalez continued to defy
immigration officials, and politicians here seemed to side with
them against the federal government, President Fidel Castro of Cuba
announced Wednesday night that the boy's father was preparing to
come to the United States to reclaim him.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Cuban television, Castro said Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez ``is ready to immediately'' go to Florida if the
United States government committed itself to turning the boy over
to him.
</P>
<P>
   But adding to the confusion of the day, a State Department
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Elian's
father had not yet asked for a visa. The official also
characterized Castro's speech as ``odd.''
</P>
<P>
   While immigration officials had expected the father to make a
visa request and to come to the United States to pick up his son if
the courts found in his favor, the official said, ``the rest of
this caught us by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban president's remarks came after warnings from local
authorities in South Florida that Miami could erupt in violence if
federal agents tried to forcibly take the boy from his
great-uncle's house in Little Havana and send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in
the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the
federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately
repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said Alex Penelas, mayor of
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle
and temporary guardian, still had not signed an agreement to hand
the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose
a fight to keep him when the case is heard in May in the 11th U.S.
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't cooperate in anything,'' Gonzalez told a
Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house,
and they'll have to go find him there.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure built in this city, the home of a large number of
Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service said they did not plan to remove Elian on Thursday morning
even if his Miami relatives continued to defy them. But an INS
spokeswoman said the agency would revoke Elian's permission to stay
in the United States, clearing the way for his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments in Havana, Castro said that Elian's father would
be accompanied by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's
former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the perfect formula for reinserting Elian,'' Castro
said. He also said that the group would be willing to wait as long
as it takes to bring the boy back.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interest Section in
Washington, said Cuban officials and State Department officials
will meet Thursday morning to discuss arrangements for such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Castro's announcement, a Justice Department
spokesman said, ``Certainly it changes things. How it changes
things is a little hard to say at this point. If the father shows
up in Miami and decides to go and ring the doorbell of his
relatives and find his son, well the family in Miami is on record
as saying they would turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually
do this remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Elian's father, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been clear that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would come
to the United States if he were assured that by coming he could
take custody of his son. I think all that has happened tonight is
that the president of Cuba has said that there is no Cuban
government impediment to him coming and remaining here as long as
it takes to exhaust the appeals, if by coming he can take custody
of Elian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel will come here, his absence is not an issue, he
will come here to the U.S., if by coming he is given custody of
Elian.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are two other players in that. The
relatives in Miami have said they won't release Elian. And the INS
and the government of the United States have not said, `Yes, that
if you come, we will arrange for you to have Elian's custody.'
Those two hurdles have not yet been overcome. The conversations
that are going on right now in Miami hold the key.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials were apparently unable to reach an
agreement with Gonzalez on Wednesday night, saying that they would
reconvene Thursday at 9 a.m. Earlier, immigration officials had
said they would officially begin arranging Elian's trip back to
Cuba if there had been no agreement by 9 a.m. on Thursday. They
have now extended the deadline for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, where many people see the return of the boy to
Cuba as delivering him to the hated Fidel Castro and communism more
than as returning a 6-year-old boy to his father, mayors and other
elected officials held a news conference to show solidarity not
with the federal government but with the family here. Their message
was that if federal officials want to take Elian away in what
threatens to be a violent confrontation with demonstrators, they
are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the responsibility of the Miami Police Department to
snatch Elian Gonzalez from his Miami family and be sent back to a
communist regime,'' said Joe Carollo, the mayor of Miami. ``Local
police should not be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, the mayor Miami-Dade County, said, ``If their continued
provocation, in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy's
parole, leads to civil unrest and violence, we are holding the
federal government responsible and, specifically, Janet Reno and
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Immigration experts said the mayors' comments were frightening,
and amounted to what seemed to be defiance of a federal agency
while presenting the possibility of a breakdown of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disturbing,'' said Max Castro, a senior research
associate for the Dante B. Fascell North-South Center of the
University of Miami, and an expert on Cuban issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If federal officers backed by Janet Reno and federal court
attempt to carry out a lawful order, the local authorities will not
intervene?'' asked Castro. ``It borders on the irresponsible. It's
a defiance of legal authority. It almost gives people more
encouragement'' to defy federal agents when they arrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials called the comments troubling.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not respond with strong language to the
mayors' decision to side with the family, saying that ``whatever
the law is, whatever the decision that is ultimately made, the rest
of us ought to obey it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the mayors' comments had circulated on news wires and
television, Penelas said he did not mean to say that the police
here would not enforce the law if illegal demonstrations take
place.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration experts said the city's politicians are trying
to have it both ways, and wondered what would happen if an illegal
demonstration broke out at the house or some other location between
federal officials and people who want to keep Elian here.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said the police would ``keep public order.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, that might not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are provoking this community to an extent that I nor
anyone else can control,'' said Penelas, of the government's
handling of the case. ``If blood is shed on the streets,'' he said,
``yes, I will hold them responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day that brought many surprises in the Elian story, Mayor
Carollo of Miami said he had information that federal officials
were mobilizing in South Florida to take the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 48 hours the federal government has had federal
agents in the area of the old Homestead Air Force Base,'' he said.
``There were federal agents scouting and observing the area to see
what would be the best way of bringing the father in and taking
Elian out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not deny that this is being considered,'' he said of
his discussions with federal officials. ``I am strongly advising
that this not be done. This is not going to be in the best interest
of our government of Miami and against the best interests of Elian
Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had spoken with Jeffrey Weiss, director of the asylum
division and international affairs for the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that he knew of no plan by the Defense Department
to provide facilities for a reunion of Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans make up almost 800,000 of Miami-Dade
County's 2.1 million people. As Elian's Miami relatives continued
to negotiate with federal officials, leaders in the exile community
practiced ways to prevent the boy's repatriation. Some drilled in
the street, linking arms and marching to a cadence called by their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, demonstrators formed a human cross on
Southwest Eighth Street, holding candles and flashlights aloft. The
police blocked off traffic for them.

 FRENCH BRING PAIRS TITLE HOME
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   NICE, France _ It was, simply put, the most bizarre pairs event
in world figure skating history.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending champions withdrew on Sunday after
testing positive for a banned drug last month. Stephane Bernardis
opened his hotel door Tuesday and was slashed on the arm by an
unknown man while his bodyguard was shopping with his partner.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bernardis and Sarah Abitbol came back to win
France's first pairs medal in 68 years. A Ukrainian skater tripped
on a lift, whacked his head on the ice, and was wheeled off
unconscious to the hospital. And the second-string Russians rose to
beat the favored Chinese _ and heard the Ukrainian anthem played
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too much to think about,'' said Alexei Tikhonov after he
and partner Maria Petrova defeated Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo to
bring the gold medal back to the motherland for the fourth time in
five years and the 30th time in the last 36. ``We are very
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze were pulled out by
the Russian federation after her doping sample at the European
championships turned up ephedrine from bronchial medication, the
Chinese figured to win the pairs title for the first time. But Shen
and Zhao felt the squeeze and skated flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we didn't skate so good,'' conceded Zhao after he and
Shen had settled for silver again. ``I think it was because we were
too nervous. This time, we want to win too much. There was too much
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   There was too much squeeze, too, on Canada's Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier, who had a lovely chance to win a bronze medal in
their global debut. But Sale double-footed her triple toe loop and
singled both double axels and the Canadians missed the podium by
one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport is life,'' said Pelletier with a shrug after Sale wept
in the kiss-and-cry area. ``This is nothing compared to what life
can bring you. We're going back with heads high. We're fourth in
the world. Last year, we were nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Abitbol and Bernadis thought they had a fine shot at the podium
until Bernadis had his arm opened nearly from wrist to biceps by an
assailant's razor. The wound turned out to be more psychological
than physical, but Bernadis was stung by whispers that he'd
concocted a fairy tale to garner sympathy from judges and a home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw on the ice was the truth and my injury is the
truth, too, as you can see,'' Bernadis declared, ripping off the
bandage to show the gash after he and Abitbol had claimed their
country's first pairs medal since Andree and Pierre Brunet won gold
in 1932. ``Sarah and I have proved we are great champions tonight.
We gave what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the evening had lacked drama. Ninety minutes
earlier, Dmitri Palamarchuk fell while hoisting partner Julia
Obertas and lay prostrate on the ice. It was a frightening reminder
of last autumn's horrifying practice tumble by US pairs skater Paul
Binnebose, who fractured his skull, nearly died in the hospital,and
is still undergoing therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the event's medical staff merely yanked Palamarchuk to his
feet and slapped his face when he grew woozy as he walked off the
ice. After Palamarchuk fainted and was out cold for five minutes,
he was brought to the nearby Hospital St. Roch and kept overnight
for observation.
</P>
<P>
   While Palamarchuk was still on the ice, officials shouted at
Canada's Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz to warm up. ``It was hard
on me,'' said Sargeant. ``I saw it happen. I saw him come by me on
the stretcher. But there was nothing we could do. We had to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaken, Sargeant and Wirtz botched their first two elements and
asked for a reskate, but were told by referee Alexander Lakernik to
pick up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Americans seemed exempt from the craziness. Kyoko Ina
and John Zimmerman ended up a disappointed seventh after each
missed a jump. ``The stars weren't aligned for us tonight,'' said
Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiffany Scott of Hanson, Mass., and partner Philip Dulebohn
were delighted with a ninth place effort in their global debut.
``Top 10 was our goal,'' said Scott. ``As long as we got a single
digit, we were going to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Russia's Irina Slutskaya, making her first
world appearance in two years, easily won her qualifying group
ahead of the US rivals Michelle Kwan and Sarah Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little nervous here because I didn't skate last
year,'' said the 21-year-old Slutskaya, who didn't make the Russian
team then after winning the silver behind Kwan in 1998. ``When you
go on the ice, it's difficult. It's like the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 19-year-old Kwan, who lost her world crown to Russia's
Maria Butyrskaya last year and finished behind Slutskaya at this
season's Grand Prix final, this is the week of redemption. She
hasn't skated without error at a major event since the 1998
Olympics in Nagano and was irked at herself Wednesday for doubling
the back end of her triple-triple combination and then popping her
triple salchow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to get tougher inside, and that goes for the whole
performance,'' said the two-time world champ, who's been juggling
skating and her UCLA studies this season. ``I keep on saying that.
But I have to turn it on and do it and stop saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a solid day for the Americans, who skated in the
tougher of the two groups. Hughes, who finished seventh last year
at 13, didn't land a triple-triple combo (she usually does two),
but pronounced herself satisfied. ``Same as any round,'' Hughes
said. ``Just go and skate your best. You need to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 27-year-old Butyrskaya, the world's oldest female
titlist, Wednesday was a walkthrough. Even though she staggered in
mid-combination and touched down on her double axel, it was more
than enough to dominate a bunch of Ukrainians, Uzbeks, and Poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite relaxed because I was in the easier group,'' said
Butyrskaya, who lost the Russian, European, and Grand Prix titles
to the resurgent Slutskaya this season. ``This is OK for
qualifying.''

   IRELAND: COPING WITH REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   To cope with more than 1,000 requests for political asylum every
month, the government is to spend $86 million to build temporary
housing for 8,000 refugees. The accommodations will include
so-called flotels, housing blocks on barges moored in ports. Most
of the refugees come from Eastern Europe and Africa.

   Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, rebuffed a call for an Irish

<TEXT>
<P>
   LETHEM, Guyana _ Shirley Melville, owner of the main watering
hole in this dusty border outpost, seemed perplexed. Just why do
her patrons prefer Antarctica beer, imported from Brazil, over
domestically brewed Banks Beer, at half the price?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about status,'' said Melville, 40, standing in the
doorway of Don &AMP; Shirley's Airport Cafe overlooking Lethem's small
airstrip. ``In Guyana, anything coming from Brazil is seen as
superior, even if it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, the giant of South America with an estimated 170 million
people, is busy flexing its economic muscle these days, pressing
forward with policies aimed at strengthening ties with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Guyana, nestled on Brazil's northern flank, with a population of
700,000 and port access to the Caribbean, is squarely on its radar
screen. So it should be no surprise that the allure of Brazilian
goods has penetrated even to this village of 2,000, a stone's throw
from the Guyanese-Brazilian border.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more vivid symbol of Brazil's increased presence in
the region _ and the concern it arouses _ than the heavy equipment
that is paving the 60-mile road between Boa Vista, a state capital
in northern Brazil, and Lethem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this fear Guyana will be slurped up when that road is
completed,'' said Nick Sellitto, an American who owns a business
exporting organic produce from Guyana. ``But I don't see that
happening any time soon, given the prehistoric, isolationist
thinking of the Guyanese government.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of inward-looking, socialist-inspired
development policies, Guyana is starting to open its economy to
investment in areas like timber cutting and mining.
</P>
<P>
   Many other people, however, are convinced that Guyana is about
to be drawn into Brazil's orbit. Vehicles making the
two-and-a-half-hour trip Wednesday tend to be sturdy trucks
transporting Brazilian miners over the border into Lethem, where
they board small propeller planes headed for gold mines in the
interior of Guyana or Suriname, to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the draw of riches,'' said Valdemir Costa Machado, 36, a
miner from the Brazilian state of Maranhao, as he waited for his
flight here. ``The only problem is that there are too many of us
Brazilians coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 10,000 Brazilians living in Guyana who chose to
stay after their stint in the mines has ended, the government says.
In Dutch-speaking Suriname, the number of Brazilians is estimated
at 40,000, nearly 10 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the risk of becoming a kind of adjunct to Brazil,'' The
Stabroek News, Guyana's leading paper, said in a recent editorial.
``If we are not to be swallowed up and lose our distinctive
identity, among other things, then we will have to devise policies
and strategies which will allow us to maintain an authentic
independent voice in the company of giants.''
</P>
<P>
   The road from Boa Vista is not likely to remain the domain of
adventurous gold miners for long. In a year or two it should be
completely paved, making way for all manner of vehicles including
air-conditioned passenger buses and small cars.
</P>
<P>
   A similar road project linking northern Brazil with Venezuela
led traffic to increase almost tenfold between those countries in
the last two years. In southern Brazil, improved transportation
links helped make possible the creation of Mercosur, the trading
bloc composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, though, roads remain precarious, effectively limiting
stronger commercial ties with Brazil. For example, the road between
Lethem and Georgetown, Guyana's capital and largest city, is
unpaved.
</P>
<P>
   For Sellitto and others who depend on that route for their
livelihood, this means they must travel in vehicles like Land
Rovers or old army-issue British-built Bedford trucks. The trip can
take two or three days, depending on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these vehicles date to the days before Guyana gained
independence from Britain in 1966 _ an illustration of the effect
more than two decades of isolationist policies can have on an
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `Mad Max' effect,'' said Peter McLachlan, a resident
of Lethem who drives a 38-year-old Land Rover, referring to the
1980 film in which rival factions in a post-apocalyptic world drive
vehicles held together with any material available. ``Guyana is a
surreal country, and probably no part of it is as surreal as
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Lethem seems as if time had frozen for 20 or 30 years.
Most of the village's residents _ mainly Indians from the Macushi
and Wapishana tribes _ get around on foot or by bicycle. With the
exception of limited commerce taking place over the border, the
economy is largely based on hammock-weaving and the cultivation of
cassava.
</P>
<P>
   Charred, decaying buildings near the airstrip still show signs
of the government's reaction to an uprising by local ranchers in
1969, when Lethem was little more than the administrative center
for a large cattle-ranching operation. After exiling the ranchers
to Brazil and Venezuela, the army burned every structure to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving, though, for while Lethem, and much of
Guyana's economy, might show the effects of socialist experiments
from the 1960s through the mid-80s, the country has introduced
several market-driven initiatives since 1992, when a government was
elected that favored opening Guyana to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The privatization of companies like Guyana Airways and Guyana
Telephone and Telegraph, in addition to awarding concessions to
foreign concerns to mine for gold or cut timber, have resulted in
inflows of investment from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Another important foreign project, a satellite-launching
facility to be operated by Beal Aerospace of Frisco, Texas, near
Dallas, which would take advantage of Guyana's location near the
Equator, is nearing government approval.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 through 1997, the economy grew for five consecutive
years _ more than 40 percent over all _ before contracting slightly
in 1998, largely because of falling gold prices. In 1999, the
economy grew nearly 3 percent, and this year 5 percent growth is
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making up for lost time,'' Moses Nagamootoo, Guyana's
information minister, said in an interview in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of a modern economy are more evident in the
capital, where cellular phones and sport utility vehicles imported
from rich industrial countries are common.
</P>
<P>
   In Lethem, by contrast, basic telephone service by satellite
hookup was initiated just two years ago. People in the interior use
short-wave radios as their main communication tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until mobile phone service arrives in Bom Fim,''
McLachlan said, referring to the Brazilian town across the river
from Lethem. ``If towers are installed allowing us to have cells
here, I'll be among the first to sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Guyana has slowly opened itself to foreign investment,
trade with Brazil remains minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Brazil nor Venezuela, Guyana's other big neighbor, is
among its leading trading partners _ outranked by such countries as
the Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the United States and Japan,
according to United States government figures. Not everyone sees
sense in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is retrograde that we don't have more contact with
Brazil,'' said Gerald Gouveia, owner of Roraima Airways, whose
regular flight between Boa Vista and Georgetown, begun only
recently, had to be discontinued for lack of demand.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Brazil, in addition to paving the road to the
border, is making overtures toward forming a stronger commercial
relationship with Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   In Boa Vista, the state government of Roraima offered to help
cover some of the costs for a Guyanese consulate. And business
interests have approached Guyana's government with plans to improve
the road to Georgetown, in addition to port installations there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're listening to the offers because we're not satisfied with
our current levels of foreign investment,'' said Nagamootoo, the
information minister. ``But we're cautious, because we still have
that British ethos from being an English-speaking colony and having
cultural and historical links to the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lethem, local authorities are also wary of stronger ties with
Brazil. ``I'm concerned of the effect a better road will have on
our unique indigenous culture,'' said Muacir Baretto, a Macushi
Indian who is the district chairman of the administrative region
surrounding Lethem _ a position comparable in some ways to a
governor in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the village's people, though, this sort of thinking
is beside the point, given the allure that migrating to Brazil
already holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, I can work as a maid and make a little money to
send to my children,'' said Joyce Clement, a 37-year-old member of
the Wapishana tribe. ``I love my country, but it can't offer me
that opportunity.''

MARKET PLACE:   A ONCE-HIGHFLYING HEDGE FUND APPEARS LIKELY TO SHUT
DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Undone recently by bad bets on old-economy stocks,
Julian H. Robertson Jr. is closing his Tiger Management investment
company, according to someone close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 67, who is revered for his long-term record as an
investor, appears to be succumbing to rapid change in the world
financial markets. At his peak two years ago, he had $23 billion
under management at Tiger, which runs six different investment
pools known as hedge funds, putting him on a par with George Soros,
the hedge fund manager known for his big currency bets.
</P>
<P>
   But a combination of investment losses and heavy withdrawals
have left Tiger a shadow of its former self. About $900 million
will be distributed to investors who have requested redemptions as
the first quarter ends on Friday, leaving the company with just
$5.2 billion in assets, according to the person close to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, Robertson has been on the wrong
side of a series of big investment bets. The first was a $600
million loss in the fall of 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt.
It was followed by a $1 billion loss on the Japanese yen later that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating then from global bets as many other hedge fund
managers did, Robertson refocused on beaten-down stocks in the old
economy, shares of US Airways Group, Bowater Inc. and Sealed Air
Corp. Those stocks, too, have proved disappointing, continuing to
lag far behind the white-hot technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Robertson wrote:
``We are in a market where reason does not prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of Tiger's demise have raced through Wall Street before.
But with Robertson's funds down about 13 percent so far this year
after a 19 percent decline last year, the person said, the end
seemed not just plausible but likely Wednesday. A hedge fund
manager who declined to be identified said, ``It's hard to come
back from being down that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser Seitel, a Tiger spokesman, said Wednesday: ``Tiger is not
commenting on the rumors. Tiger's investors have not been notified
about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Robertson nor Philip Duff, Tiger's chief operating
officer, returned phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   A native of North Carolina, Robertson spent much of his career
as a stockbroker and money manager at Kidder, Peabody. But in 1980,
he left to found Tiger, taking a name suggested by one of his young
sons.
</P>
<P>
   With $2 million of his own money and $6 million in outside
investments, Tiger surged from the start. Until 1998, it lost money
in only one year, 1987, the year the stock market crashed. In
several years, returns exceeded 40 percent. Even after the tough
years of 1998 and 1999, the Tiger Fund had a 27 percent average
annual gain since its inception almost 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Robertson started five additional funds,
available only to wealthy individuals. The Jaguar and Puma Funds
were opened in 1986, the Lion Fund and two Ocelot funds in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the unwinding of Long Term Capital Management, Tiger's
unraveling did not rattle world financial markets. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 82.61 points on the day, while the Nasdaq
lost 3.91 percent. Shares in some of the stocks that Robertson is
known to own were weak.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, in which Tiger had a 25 percent stake at the end of
the year, slipped 43.8 cents Wednesday to $25.438. According to
end-of-year filings, Tiger's big positions included UAM, the fund
management company in which it owned nearly 15 percent; Sealed Air
at 7 percent and the Bear Stearns Cos. at almost 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because Robertson has lost so much money in recent years, the
remaining assets could no longer generate enough fees to cover
operating expenses, according to a person close to the firm. As is
the case with other hedge funds, Robertson's clients pay incentive
fees of 20 percent to the manager only if their gains exceed what
is called a high-water mark. Because of that threshold, Robertson's
recent losses meant that he would have to be up 85 percent this
year to generate any incentive fees, according to the person close
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given that roughly $2 billion of the $5.2 billion
remaining at Tiger is said to belong to Robertson and his
colleagues, the $3 billion from outside investors would not
generate enough in management fees _ 1 percent annually _ to pay
for operations at the firm's elegant New York, London and Tokyo
offices.
</P>
<P>
   One thorny issue in the closing of Tiger is related to
Robertson's incentive fees, which have been kept offshore where
they compound tax-free until the funds are repatriated, according
to a source. This person said Robertson might have a $200 million
tax liability on those fees.
</P>
<P>
   While shutting Tiger Management seems to signal the end of an
era for Robertson, his legacy runs up and down Wall Street. Indeed,
13 hedge funds, known as Tiger Cubs, are run by Tiger alumni. Last
year, all but one of these funds had positive returns.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, even as word of Tiger's woes was once again
seeping into the markets, Robertson was honored at a reception in
New York held by a group of former Tiger managers. At the event,
the managers announced that they had made a gift to the University
of Virginia in Robertson's name. At the celebration and among old
friends, Robertson was near tears, someone in attendance said.

NEW DEADLINE ON ELIAN AS FIGHT INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez
saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy's
father was ready to fly ``immediately'' to retrieve his son, while
the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, it remained far from clear whether the boy's relatives
would give him up voluntarily or if the area's powerful Cuban exile
community would try to prevent his return home, no matter what the
family decided to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passports are ready, and of course the airplane is
ready,'' Castro said in a television broadcast from Havana that
added another potentially volatile element to a political drama
that has captured international attention and caused deep divisions
within this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a vivid indication of just how intense the situation has
become, the mayors of 23 municipalities around Miami Wednesday
declared that they would not help federal forces if they tried to
take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five
hours Wednesday night, and will resume talks Thursday. Earlier
Wednesday, the Gonzalez family's spokesman said the family would
not accede to the INS's key demand: that they agree in writing to
surrender the boy if an appeals court orders that he be returned to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Absent such a guarantee by Wednesday, immigration officials had
threatened to revoke the boy's permission to remain in the United
States and seek custody of him at 9 a.m. Thursday. But late
Wednesday, they extended the deadline for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The family's defiant stance has set up a potentially explosive
scenario in which federal marshals may have to be dispatched to the
city's Little Havana section to remove the boy from the home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If anything like that happens, the area's mayors said at a press
conference, they not only would refuse to provide any of their law
enforcement personnel for support, but also would hold the Clinton
administration accountable for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our . . . police officers or any other
resources to assist the federal government in any way, shape, or
form to inappropriately repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who spoke for himself and the
mayors of 22 nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their continued provocation, in the form of unjustified
threats to revoke the boy's parole, leads to civil unrest and
violence, we are holding the federal government responsible, and
specifically Janet Reno and the president of the United States, for
anything that may occur in this community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, who is of Cuban descent, said the local authorities
would maintain order if protests got out of control. But the
mayors' extraordinary proclamation demonstrated how profoundly the
differences over this issue have become in Southern Florida, where
Cuban-Americans make up about one-third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   They also served as a sort of official warning that widespread
demonstrations, which may be difficult to control, may be
inevitable if the INS carries out its promise to return Elian to
his father, even if Juan Miguel Gonzales comes to this country to
get his son, rather than waits for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton seemed concerned Wednesday about both the
prospect of violence and about the possibility that the Gonzalez
family in Miami, members of the Cuban exile community, and local
elected officials may be preparing to flout the federal
government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the law would be followed by everyone,
including them,'' Clinton said at a press conference in Washington,
referring to Elian's relatives. ``I don't think they should be
singled out, and I don't think they should have extra pressure put
on them, but on the other hand I think they should observe the rule
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Juan
Gonzalez has said that he would go to the United States only after
his son's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that he follows through on the revised plan _ while the
case is still in the courts and Elian still lives at his
great-uncle's house _ it could help to resolve the conflict, since
his relatives have said that they would be willing to give the boy
to his father if he came to America.
</P>
<P>
   But the political and emotional atmosphere here has grown far
more heated since that suggestion was made, and the family's more
recent comments have indicated that they may think Elian would be
better off in this country regardless of what else happens.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some officials of the Cuban exile community have
made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to Cuba and
will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening. A convoy
of large trucks, their drivers blaring their horns and shouting
their support for Elian, circled the neighborhood in which the boy
is living Wednesday and vowed to come back in greater numbers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to
form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to
keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States. Elian has been with
his relatives here since being rescued last Thanksgiving, laying on
an inner tube in the waters off Florida; he was one of three
survivors of an accident in which his mother and 10 other Cubans
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to kill everyone here,'' said Jose
Prado, a retired General Motors worker, when asked what would
happen if the federal government tried to return the boy to Cuba.
Prado was one of scores of Cuban-Americans standing behind a police
barracade near the Gonzalez home throughout the day Wednesday,
showing support for Elian remaining here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these exiles are going to jump this fence and fight
whatever we have to fight,'' said Olgalidia Garcia, a recent high
school graduate, as about a dozen people surrounding her vigorously
nodded in agreement. ``And we are going to block whatever we have
to block.''

HARD-HIT NEIGHBORHOODS CLEAN UP, TAKE STOCK

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Linwood neighborhood of mostly small
wooden rental houses, tucked in the shadow of the Montgomery Ward
building, appeared to sustain the worst tornado damage outside the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   In many places along Mercedes Avenue and Merrimac Street, homes
were shattered, glass carpeted the yards and leaning tree limbs
threatened to fall at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Under a warm spring sun and brilliant blue skies, the
neighborhood was alive Wednesday with the buzz of chain saws as
residents began clearing trees and limbs. Tufts of insulation were
shot through the chain link fences in some places, and a white
plastic dryer vent hose hung like a streamer in one tree.
</P>
<P>
   From the porch of his home at 2709 Mercedes, Pedro Salas looked
at a 40-foot long strip of industrial steel lying in his front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea where that came from,'' Salas said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks west, homeowners in the Rivercrest neighborhood
were clearing fallen trees and assessing their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Burk, 50, lost part of her roof in the 100 block of
Westview Avenue. Her back yard was a jumble of toppled trees. The
brick chimney of her 60-year-old house, a candidate for the
National Register of Historic Places, lay in a pile of bricks by
her front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 19 post oaks - `had','' she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was in good spirtits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really pretty neat, if you just like amazing things,''
she said in wonderment at the damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburb of River Oaks, close to where weather officials
think the tornado began its deadly journey, officials counted 80
damaged buildings. Among them, houses on Roberts Cutoff Road and
Blackstone Lane lost roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from River Oaks and Sansom Park worked into early
Wednesday morning, bringing plywood and plastic sheets to residents
to help with home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds of whirring chain saws filled the air there as well, as
neighbors helped one another remove the debris.
</P>
<P>
   The city lost many stately trees that were over 100 years old,
River Oaks Mayor Jack Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   At Castleberry High School, students were expected to be back in
classes Thursday despite widespread damage to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the fieldhouse collapsed and locker and weight rooms
were destroyed, school officials said. In the main building,
windows were broken and rooftop air-conditioning units toppled into
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, students and members of the National Guard 136th
Airlift Wing based at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base
pitched in to clean up the mess. They went from classroom to
classroom with vacuums to clean up the water and other debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' said interim Superintendent
Joddie Witte. ``We're going to have school tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In Linwood, more than a dozen homes and duplexes were destroyed
or heavily damaged. Among them, the duplex on the corner of Carroll
and Mercedes where Lee Harvey Oswald lived with his young family in
the 1950s was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the duplexes were built in the 1940s and were originally
used to house workers at the defense plants in west Fort Worth.
Residents said the tornado came just as they were seeing results in
their campaign to revitalize the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Salas, his wife and two children were not home when the storm
hit, but they returned less than an hour later to find little more
than broken glass, sheetrock and insulation everywhere. Salas said
he had been making home improvements since he moved in about two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my efforts are in the trash,'' he said somberly.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Salas home was what remained of Ted Haga's home. The
north wall of his living room lay about 30 feet from the house.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how he squeezed into a tiny hall closet to protect
himself from the winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wind just kept blowing and blowing and blowing,'' Haga
said, shaking his head. ``I kept thinking, `When's it going to
stop?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He spent Wednesday trying to salvage what was left of a 1974
Corvette and a 1969 classic Camaro. He did take time to prop up an
American flag on top of the battered home, a testament to his
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be alive,'' he said, a tired smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers said it was the second time disaster had struck the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these buildings were inundated to the gables'' during the
1949 flood of the nearby Trinity River, said James Ayres, who owns
12 duplexes.
</P>
<P>
   C.A. Riggs, who owns four duplexes, said he helped rescue people
from the neighborhood during the flood, and began buying houses
shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   He later became Oswald's landlord and testified before the
Warren Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, residents formed a neighborhood association and
began working with the Police Department to overcome gangs and
other problems, said Archie Pearce, who owns three houses on Foch
Street. Several duplexes were sold to individual owners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a lot better down here,'' Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tornado has put a question mark next to the
neighborhood's revitalization plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres pointed to a duplex that had lost a roof and said, ``I'm
going to have to make a decision to rebuild it or demolish it.''

CLEANUP BEGINS AFTER DEADLY TWISTER ASSAULTS FORT WORTH 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A large portion of downtown Fort Worth
remained cordoned from the public Wednesday as haggard city
officials scrambled to recover from the city's most destructive
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado, which assaulted downtown Tuesday night with winds
in excess of 150 mph, and accompanying storm injured 95 people and
killed four. Another person is missing and believed drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Of downtown's 150 blocks, 24 remained closed Wednesday and
likely would remain that way through the weekend. Officials asked
residents not to enter the area unless absolutely necessary for
fear that pieces of broken glass could fall on them from damaged
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The twister caused $157 million in damage to commercial and
public buildings, ranking it among the costliest of Texas
tornadoes. At least eight businesses were destroyed and 52 others
suffered at least minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to stress that, that includes no residential estimate,
no estimate for lost wages, income or anything else, just damage to
the structures themselves,'' said Fort Worth City Manager Bob
Terrell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, similar assessments took place Wednesday in the
neighboring communities of Arlington and Grand Prairie, where a
second tornado damaged more than 100 homes Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The four fatalities occurred in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carl Spence, 65, died when he was crushed inside a collapsed
industrial building. Howard Thornton, 52, of Arlington, was killed
by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, was recovered Wednesday
morning. His car had been swept into the Trinity River. The body of
Dicken's grandmother, a passenger, still had not been located as of
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Juan C. Oseguera died Wednesday at Harris Methodist Hospital
from injuries he received when he was struck in the head Tuesday
night by a large piece of hail, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Another man struck in the head by hail remained in critical
condition at the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr was amazed that more people
weren't hurt. About 35,000 people work downtown. But the tornado
hit after most workers and students from a nearby church-school had
left for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the tornado's 11-block swath of disaster stopped eight
blocks shy of commuter-filled Interstate 30.
</P>
<P>
   While this will likely be Fort Worth's costliest tornado, Texas
has experienced far more deadly storms. The most recorded deaths
from a Texas tornado was May 11, 1953, when 114 were killed and 597
hurt in Waco. More than 25 have been killed in nine other tornadoes
in the state since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible thing, but the saving grace is that we're
not dealing with hundreds of people dead and hurt,'' said Kem
Bennett, head of the Texas A&AMP;M University-based Texas Urban Rescue
Search Team, which searched Fort Worth buildings. ``I am amazed
because the damage you see would dictate that there would be a lot
more deaths and injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush declared Tarrant County a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth city officials said it will take through the weekend
to clean up downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge is getting these big, high-rise
buildings back in operation,'' said Barr. ``They can be boarded up
and made operable, but it will take weeks or maybe a month to get
all the glass back in. Some of it has to be custom ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado dropped down at 6:15 p.m. CST just west of downtown
Fort Worth and tore its way into the northern portion of the city
center. It damaged at least 20 major buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The twister left mounds of broken glass in streets and parking
lots, particularly around the popular Sundance Square area.
Curtains waved in the wind from gaping holes in several buildings
around the square. Debris covered awnings and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those buildings are major hotels, all of which had many
reservations because of the scheduled race at Texas Motor Speedway
this weekend. Most people kept their rooms, even though plywood
replaced picture windows by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed the Sundance portion of downtown Wednesday amid
fears of falling glass that could weigh as much as 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very severe downtown, with all kinds of destruction``
Bennett said. ``There are high-rise buildings with most of the
windows gone, buildings that are totally flattened, cars turned
over, power lines down, glass everywhere _ it's a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the offices damaged by the storm were those of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. FBI officials spent Wednesday looking for
sensitive documents, which may have blown from their offices in the
Cash America Building.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Mayor Elzie Odom estimated 93 of his city's homes
were uninhabitable. In Grand Prairie, the storm destroyed as many
as six houses and damaged others.
</P>
<P>
   To help, the Red Cross opened four shelters in Forth Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest hit neighborhood near Arlington Municipal Airport
suffered block after block of roofless, windowless homes.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowner Mahmmed Khan was still somewhat dazed Wednesday as he
stood behind his ravaged home.
</P>
<P>
   Khan had been monitoring the storm's progress on TV, he said,
but thought the danger was in West Arlington. He was upstairs,
shutting the window in his son's room when the tornado struck,
blowing out the window he had just closed and flinging him back
into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was flying me,'' Khan said. He decided he needed to get to
the safety of a bathroom, but the windows at either end of the
hallway he had to cross had turned the corridor into a deadly
gantlet of flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like flying saucers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khan's wife and two sons had been visiting relatives across town
when the tornado struck. They spent agonizing hours trying to find
him _ looking under overturned furniture in the house, checking the
hospitals and finally finding him at a shelter set up at a nearby
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just sitting on a bench, holding his head in his
hands,'' said Khan's 14-year-old son Wali. ``I was real, like,
scared.''

   &UR; EXCITE &LR;  _ AT&AMP;T has found its answer to the America Online-Time
Warner merger: taking control of ExciteAtHome in what could amount

</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications giant announced plans yesterday to
increase its control over Redwood City's ExciteAtHome, the
country's largest provider of cable modem service, giving it a
partner to take on AOL-Time Warner in the battle to deliver
high-speed Internet access. AOL agreed to buy Time Warner in
January for what was then a $165 billion deal, combining its
popular online service with Time Warner's cable lines and media
content.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T already controlled 56 percent of ExciteAtHome's voting
stock, but due to some byzantine agreements with other cable
partners that own stock in Excite, the New York company has only a
minority of the seats on ExciteAtHome's board. By Todd Wallack

 _ SF CHRON   Forbes ASAP May Be Redundant, But Rumors of Demise Are DOA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The rumor was too good to ignore. Too bad it wasn't true.
<P>
   A tipster told me Forbes ASAP was about to fold. I liked this
rumor, because I had always wondered about ASAP, based in the
Forbes building in Burlingame: Why does a big magazine like Forbes
continue publishing a bimonthly tech supplement? After all, Forbes
has not only beefed up tech coverage in the main magazine, but is
also pouring money into Forbes.com.
</P>
<P>
   ASAP's editor, Michael Malone, and Forbes President Jim Berrien
set me straight. ASAP is not only not DOA, it is A-OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's twice as big as it was last year,'' Malone said,
referring to the ad pages and revenue. In fact, Berrien said the
most recent issue has 94.2 ad pages, up from a paltry 42.3 a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Berrien said ASAP is ``a core piece of our franchise,''
especially as it benefits from the same advertising boom that's
boosting every tech-business journal.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is adding staff, and this week, he started writing a
weekly column for ABCNews.com, which should help promote the
magazine. The new art director has also redesigned the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby is a juggernaut,'' Berrien said.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes has a circulation of 850,000, ASAP goes only to
those 810,000 readers who subscribe. Yet while only two-thirds of
those people actually read ASAP last year, surveys now show the
figure is up to 83 percent, Berrien said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that's because of ASAP's raison d'etre: By
publishing only six times a year, it can take its time and produce
thoughtful, well-written pieces. Contributors have included
novelists Tom Wolfe and Kurt Vonnegut Jr., historian Stephen
Ambrose and even former heavyweight champ Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Other so-called New Economy magazines like Business 2.0, the
Industry Standard and Red Herring have ``mediocre writing,'' Malone
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thumb through them for information, but you don't read
them for enjoyment,'' Malone said. ``We're the last bastion of real
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say all is rosy. ASAP just lost News Editor Blaise
Zerega after only six months on the job; he returned to his old
stomping grounds at Red Herring, where he'll be a senior writer.
</P>
<P>
   He joins people defecting from the main magazine, such as Josh
McHugh, who went to the forthcoming ECompany Now, and Stephan
Herrera and Robert LaFranco, who both went to Red Herring. (Is it a
coincidence that Red Herring is spiriting staff from Forbes, given
that the Herring's founder and Editor in Chief Tony Perkins once
teamed with Forbes Publisher Rich Karlgaard to found Upside? Or
that Red Herring Publisher Ted Gramkow jumped from ASAP last year?
That depends whether you believe in coincidence in this incestuous
business.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet such battles to recruit and retain staff, at least point out
that reports of ASAP's demise were, as the saying goes, greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STAYING WIRED:
</P>
<P>
   With the departure earlier this year of Executive Publisher Dana
Lyon, the top business spot at Wired magazine moved for the first
time out of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Schutte, who's been with the magazine since 1994, ascended
to the publisher's post but is based in New York, home of Wired
parent Conde Nast. Not only does Schutte get to work more closely
with Conde Nast execs, especially those at other magazines, but
``our ad revenue is split between both coasts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Publisher Moira McDonald remains in San Francisco to
handle the West Coast accounts. Wired, with a monthly circulation
of 475,000, has had an easier time of  &LR; attracting nontech companies
to advertise than other mags, and that has gotten even easier since
it joined the Conde Nast stable in 1998, Schutte said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers such as Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole have found it
``easy to add Wired to the plan'' of other Conde Nast buys, such as
Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, Vogue and GQ. ``With tech, it works in
reverse,'' Schutte said. ``We're introducing tech and business
advertisers into other Conde Nast magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Schutte is off this week for Japan and South Korea, meeting with
big electronics firms as well as startups to sell them on trying to
reach Wired's tech-savvy readership.
</P>
<P>
   He has some other tricks up his sleeve as well: In July,
Digimarc, an Oregon company, will give special PC devices to 25,000
Wired subscribers. The device hooks up to the PC and allows users
to read a digital watermark on selected ads in the magazine, which
will launch a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a company called Digital Convergence will send
similarly equipped laser ``pens'' that link to the PC to every
Wired subscriber, so that they can read bar codes and launch Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of something very exciting,'' Schutte
said. ``It reminds me of when we started on the Net in '95, and
we'd all jump up and down when a Java applet moved something.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schutte's old boss Lyon is working feverishly to
start her new company, One Ventures, which will produce a magazine
and Web site devoted to all things design this fall. Chee Pearlman,
former editor of I.D. Magazine, will be editor in chief of the San
Francisco company.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon said last month that many of the ideas are still taking
shape. The audience will be ``people who are culturally creative,''
Lyon said, ``who have adapted technology in their lives.'' The
content will focus on design as it applies to everything, from
clothes to buildings to the Apple iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, the offices are in a Decatur Street loft
behind the San Francisco Gift Center _ a neighborhood once
dominated by fashion and design firms, and increasingly being taken
over by dot-coms.

 &HT;    Harvey Gators' energizer
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was only half an hour after Florida had beaten
Oklahoma State for the NCAA East Regional championship. The game
had left both teams physically and emotionally drained.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Florida locker room, Donnell Harvey was playing with
the young son of coach Billy Donovan. Harvey was running around the
locker room, having a grand time.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Gators, too exhausted to move, shook their heads
in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could play two more games,'' assistant coach Anthony Grant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's limitless energy was put to good use in the regional
championship game against Oklahoma State. The Gators' victory sent
them into Saturday's NCAA Final Four semifinal against North
Carolina. While the other nine players on the floor were running on
empty, Harvey was scoring 10 points, including a left-handed
tomahawk dunk that snuffed the life out of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Donnell is tired, he's more athletic than anyone on
the floor,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   That athleticism and relentless energy could make Harvey,
Georgia's Mr. Basketball in 1999, the difference in Saturday's game
at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels have the biggest front line Florida has seen:
Center Brendan Haywood (7-0, 271 pounds) and forwards Kris Lang
(6-11, 240) and Jason Capel (6-8, 230). After plodding through an
18-13 regular season, North Carolina in the tournament improved its
defense and started to use its size. In the South Regional
championship game, the Tar Heels played Tulsa, a quick, deep team
similar to Florida. North Carolina controlled the tempo and the
rebounds (35-28) and won 59-55.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida players say that the Tar Heels haven't seen
anybody like the 6-8 Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an unbelievable athlete and an unbelievable
competitor,'' sophomore forward Mike Miller said. ``He never takes
a play off and that's hard to do with the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and coaches usually have to speak for Harvey because
the native of Shellman, population 1,162, rarely will do it for
himself. He was raised by a strong grandmother who protected him
from drug dealers and instilled a strong work ethic in him. By the
time Harvey left Randolph-Clay High School, he was one of the most
decorated players in Georgia basketball history. He was the USA
Today player of the year, the Naismith player of the year and a
McDonald's and Parade All-American.
</P>
<P>
   At many schools, he would have been the focus of the basketball
program. For example, Jim Harrick, the new coach at Georgia, made
that pitch. Instead, Harvey chose Florida, where Billy Donovan
already had recruited several high school All-Americans and sold
them on a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a part of something special, and I thought
that's what Coach Donovan was going to do at Florida,'' Harvey
said. ``I didn't just want it to be about me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about as much insight as one can get out of Harvey, who
speaks softly but carries a big stick when he enters the game. With
exceedingly long arms, he has an wingspang that is estimated at 90
inches. At 220 pounds, he has a very low body fat percentage and
steel-spring legs. He leads the the team in rebounding with 7.0 per
game, even though he is playing only about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But his impressive physical gifts are not what make Harvey so
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is relentless,'' roommate Matt Bonner said. ``He
figures every rebound belongs to him. And if you get in his
way...''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan knew exactly why he wanted Harvey. Last season, the
Gators were within one rebound of beating Gonzaga and playing for
the NCAA West Regional championship. Instead, Gonzaga forward Casey
Calvary jumped over a group of Gators for a last-second tip-in to
beat Florida 73-72.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been in that game,'' Harvey whispered, ``we would
have had a chance to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harvey can rebound with anybody, the rest of his offensive
game needs some work. Florida officials think he needs another
season, maybe two, to be ready for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   As with most subjects, Harvey is quiet on this one. ``I haven't
really thought much about it,'' he said. ``I don't have a
timetable.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 AT&AMP;T Moves to Control ExciteAtHome  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
AT&AMP;T has found its answer to the America Online-Time Warner merger:
taking control of ExciteAtHome in what could amount to a $3 billion
deal.
<P>
   The telecommunications giant announced plans yesterday to
increase its control over Redwood City's ExciteAtHome, the
country's largest provider of cable modem service, giving it a
partner to take on AOL-Time Warner in the battle to deliver
high-speed Internet access. AOL agreed to buy Time Warner in
January for what was then a $165 billion deal, combining its
popular online service with Time Warner's cable lines and media
content.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T already controlled 56 percent of ExciteAtHome's voting
stock, but due to some byzantine agreements with other cable
partners that own stock in Excite, the New York company has only a
minority of the seats on ExciteAtHome's board.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, AT&AMP;T said it had worked out deals with two other
major cable operators and Excite investors, Cox and Comcast, to
take control of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that AT&AMP;T is serious about this space,'' said Clay
Ryder, an analyst with Zona Research, also in Redwood City. Ryder
said AT&AMP;T could now pump money into ExciteAtHome, or work more
closely in new areas such as interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also plans to use ExciteAtHome's brand and content to help
market its high-speed Net services over wireless and other
technologies. ``AT&AMP;T wants to up its ante,'' Ryder said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T agreed to buy Comcast and Cox's stock for at least $48 per
share between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 4, 2002. Comcast and Cox each
own 30 million shares, or 8 percent, of Excite. The repurchase
price is capped at $3 billion. Both companies will also resign
their seats on the board, which AT&AMP;T will be able to fill.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, however, both Cox and Comcast also agreed to extend
their agreements to use ExciteAtHome's Internet service for their
cable wires through 2006, although they can end the agreements
starting in June 2001 by sacrificing some of their ExciteAtHome
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also extended through 2008 its pact with Excite, which was
set to run out in 2002. Those three companies account for
two-thirds of ExciteAtHome's North American territory, which
includes 59 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us clarity and the ability to start planning after
2002,'' said Mark Stevens, ExciteAtHome's executive vice president
of business development. ``We have the ability to execute crisply
with long-term relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the complex deal, AT&AMP;T will increase its control
of the voting stock to 74 percent, up from 56 percent today. Its
financial interest will remain at 25 percent, but the company will
roll ExciteAtHome's earnings in with its own. However, ExciteAtHome
will remain an independent, publicly traded company, which will
also report its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent ExciteAtHome shares up nearly 10 percent to
$37.69, up $3.38.
</P>
<P>
   Both Comcast and AT&AMP;T said they plan to open up the cable
television wires to rival Internet service providers when the
exclusive portions of their contracts begin running out. But even
then, the cable partners pledged to continue using ExciteAtHome's
vast data network to let customers access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals like AOL could be able to use their marketing power to
sign up new customers and distinguish themselves with customer
service and different online services, but ultimately, all cable
modem users would still use ExciteAtHome's service for Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, ExciteAtHome scrubbed plans, announced in
November, to create a separate tracking stock for its portal
business.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and analysts said the tracking stock was originally
created to help the unit focus on its Internet media business,
without becoming entangled in ExciteAtHome's complex governance by
several cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   But now that AT&AMP;T will take control of the company, analysts
said it was no longer needed. ``They have their ownership house in
order,'' said Forrester Research analyst Bruce Kasrel. A tracking
stock, which lets investors place bets on only a single part of a
business, ``would have created confusion.''

 _ SF CHRON   Better Patents Pending 
 &HT;     By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The 210-year-old U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office is trying to get
with the lightning-fast pace of Internet time.
<P>
   Faced with mounting criticism that it has awarded patents for
online business processes that aren't original, the patent office
yesterday wed  &LR; said it would revamp its procedures to more
thoroughly scrutinize patents for electronic-commerce and Internet
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are inventing on their computers now instead of a
workbench or kitchen table,'' said Patent Commissioner Q. Todd
Dickinson in an interview. ``We've done a good job and need to do a
better job'' in awarding patents for computer innovations,
particularly ``business method'' software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, the patent office will now have a second
examiner review all applications in this area, require more
comprehensive searches of databases of prior art and double the
number of random quality checks it performs.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson wants to involve the computer industry more through
formal meetings and feedback mechanisms, including a roundtable
this summer. And the patent office will increase technical training
for examiners and seek to improve its database covering software
innovations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes come after months of industry outrage that
some Internet companies have landed patents _ which essentially are
20-year government-sanctioned monopolies _ for translating basic
business practices into the medium of cyberspace. Among the most
controversial are Internet bookseller Amazon.com's patents on its
``one-click'' shopping process and affiliates customer-referral
program, and Priceline.com's patent on online ``reverse auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a gap where people could file patents that are
not as exacting, as carefully drawn,'' as they could be, said Carey
Heckman, director of Stanford University's Law &AMP; Technology Policy
Center. ``Every time there's a little zig in the zag of
fast-changing technologies, for some time regular procedures like
patents will be caught off guard and people will take advantage of
it until the system can stabilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, observers said the changes should help reduce broad,
``kitchen sink'' applications and increase the quality of patents
awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible relief to hear the patent office admitting
there's a problem,'' said Sebastopol publisher Tim O'Reilly, who
has spearheaded calls for patent reform, notably in an open letter
to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last month that drew 10,000 responses in
31/2 days. ``A lot of patents are just a joke, but there's a lot of
complicity by the computer industry in this patent debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos released a statement applauding the patent office changes.
Earlier this month, he responded to O'Reilly's letter by suggesting
revisions to the system for patenting business methods and
software, including shortening patent life span in these fields to
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said that particular suggestion is not feasible due to
international treaty obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gray, an intellectual property lawyer in Menlo Park, said:
``Anything that helps screen and make more rational the process of
granting Internet-related patents is a good thing, no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that some recent patents are so broad they
give an unfair advantage to companies that who  &LR; did nothing more
innovative than beating &LR;  a path to the patent office door.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the system point out that the patent office is
open to rectifying problems. ``I make this challenge all the time:
Send in prior art and file a re-examination request,'' Dickinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rivette, a patent attorney and author of ``Rembrandts in
the Attic,'' a book on how to make the most aggressive use of
patents, said he thinks the patent office is doing the best it can
to handle rapid technological innovations and would need additional
funding to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to protect what you innovate or invent,''
said Rivette, chairman of Aurigin Systems, a Cupertino company that
makes software for comparing intellectual property against prior
art.
</P>
<P>
   Patent examiners must be attorneys with degrees in the fields
they cover, such as engineering or biotechnology. ``I haven't seen
anyone do an IPO for the U.S. government yet, so you have to pay
these people well,'' Rivette said.

 Giants Seek Edge With Video System  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If the Giants win the pennant this season, it might be thanks to
former Florida State University first baseman Matt Woodward.
<P>
   No, incumbent first baseman J.T. Snow hasn't been traded for a
bunch of minor league prospects. Rather, Woodward has joined the
Giants as a high-tech player development coach using a
state-of-the-art computer system installed in the team's new
Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will be the first team to employ the Video Coaching
System, which uses an Intranet tying in PCs, TV cameras and a
database program with a high-capacity DVD RAM storage drive.
</P>
<P>
   The still-experimental system is designed to record every pitch,
every hit, every out and just about every spit of tobacco juice
from four different angles during the 81-game home season at the
downtown stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The all-digital video system replaces the cumbersome videotapes
that most baseball teams use and gives the  &LR; players the ability to
instantly see what they're doing wrong or uncover weaknesses in
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, Snow strikes out against the Phillies' Curt
Schilling to end a game, Snow could storm into a video replay room
behind the Giants dugout, instantly watch the failed at-bat from
different angles and match his swing to one he used to homer off
Schilling in a prior game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see something different with your swing that you
hadn't noticed or the coaches hadn't noticed,'' said Woodward, who
will work for Giants administrative coach Carlos Alfonso and the
players to operate the system designed by Panasonic Corporate
Systems Co., the business-to-business unit of Matsushita Electric
Corp. of America.
</P>
<P>
   At 3Com Park, the Giants used two VCRs to record games from the
TV broadcast feed. If a player wanted to look at his swing during a
game, he would have to switch tapes, put the original tape in the
second VCR and rewind it to his last at bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the most efficient system, but it worked,'' said
Bill Schlough, head of the Giants' information systems. ``Here,
we're taking it to a whole new level.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pac Bell Park, Panasonic will station four remote-controlled
TV cameras custom-designed to provide a sharper image than needed
for regular TV broadcasts. The Giants hope to have views of the
field from behind the plate, center field and along the first- and
third-base lines but are still trying to figure out the best camera
locations.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras will be operated from a small room next to the
Giants locker room underneath the stands behind third base. The
video feeds into an elaborate system that includes nearly a dozen
monitors, four computers and a video-effects generator.
</P>
<P>
   The video and data will be stored on a 4.7-terabyte, 750-disc
DVD RAM drive, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of game action.
That should be more than enough capacity, room,  &LR; without recording
the lulls between pitches or innings, to capture the entire
162-game season, said Kelly Kotera, chief engineer for Panasonic
Corporate Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Using a database program developed for baseball by Dixon Sports
Computing of Long Beach, the images will be sorted with about 25
fields of data, like whether the pitch was a curve or a slider or
whether the pitcher was left- or right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The database will allow the video from different angles of the
same play, or two different plate appearances in different games,
to be replayed in synch, said Michael Dixon, president of Dixon
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tying the video into the database in DVD RAM makes it all come
together,'' Dixon said. ``We can look at all Barry Bonds' at bats
with two strikes on him against left-handed pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaching system will be accessible through a Web browser
from a PC set up in a room behind the Giants new dugout. General
Manager Brian Sabean will also have access from his office computer
to help him evaluate players.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player moves to another team, it might be that his value
in a trade is (determined by) how he does against left-handed
batters,'' said Chris Baumgard, Panasonic's national sales and
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, because the system uses standard Microsoft server
and browser software, players could access the system on the road
from a laptop. But that would require a high-speed Internet
connection because the video quality would be poor with
slower-speed connections, Kotera said.
</P>
<P>
   But players will have the use of a portable DVD player, which
they can use to watch the video clips while they're away from home.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are the first to combine digital video with Dixon's
database. The Cleveland Indians _ the first to use Dixon's database
combined with videotape _ gave it a shot in the middle of the 1995
season, when the team made it to the World Series for the first
time since 1954. Dixon also noted that then-Indians slugger Albert
Belle went on a home-run tear during the last two months of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized scouting is not totally new to baseball. Last year,
Philadelphia's Schilling, Arizona's Matt Williams and the New York
Mets' Darryl Hamilton used a computer scouting system with similar
features to the one in Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Petaluma pollster and entrepreneur Richard Hertz' Big League
Systems combined a computer database program with game videotapes
converted to digital video.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Kim, third base coach with the Boston Red Sox, said
Hertz' Big League Systems program did help the players prepare for
games. A batter like Williams (after he returns from the disabled
list) could take a laptop on the road and learn an opposing pitcher
has a tendency to throw a slider 49 percent of the time after
throwing a fastball on the corner of the strike zone, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go to 10 tapes to see what you want to
see,'' Kim said. ``It gets you to focus on his repertoire of
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kim noted most baseball teams balked at using such high-tech
systems because ``it's going to cost them more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hertz has struck out in the past trying to interest
teams such as the Giants, Red Sox, Oakland Athletics and San Diego
Padres. But he hopes the Giants' new system shows the value of
digital scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to take a bad club or terrible player and make
them great, but it's just another thing to give you an advantage or
get you better prepared,'' Hertz said.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic and the Giants aren't saying how much the Video
Coaching System cost, although Schlough said it's in the ballpark
of ``several thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the newfangled system earns the team more wins or hits
during the season is unknown because it hasn't been tried in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The more technologically savvy National Basketball Association
has more experience with high-tech scouting. This season, 22 of the
NBA's 29 teams, including the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles
Lakers, used a program called Advance Scout that is a showcase for
database mining programs IBM sells to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Advance Scout crunches game statistics such as points, rebounds
and minutes played to reveal strengths and weaknesses not seen in
the box scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 playoffs between the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat,
the program showed that when little-used point guard Darrell
Armstrong was in the game, teammate Penny Hardaway had better shots
and Miami's shooting percentage was lower. That helped Orlando
rally to win the next two games, although the Magic lost the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most high-tech gadgets can't guarantee success.
The Warriors are one of the NBA's doormats. And Dixon Computer
Sports' oldest customer, football's St. Louis Rams, had one of the
two worst records in the NFL in the 1990s before a miracle 1999
season that ended with a Super Bowl win.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes that the University of North Carolina men's
basketball team, which is in this year's NCAA Final Four, uses his
system.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Woodward, a Florida State Seminole from 1995 to 1998 and
the son of former major-league infielder and general manager Woody
Woodward, had a brief career as a Seattle Mariners farmhand. But
now he hopes that through video coaching he can help the Giants to
a few more hits or wins during the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   And in baseball, a few more hits in a season turns a .250
journeyman into a .300 hitter. Or, as the Giants remember from the
1993 and 1998 seasons, one win is the difference between the
playoffs and second place.

 _ SF CHRON   Web Street Inc. Moves Into Glass House 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
While some online brokers are setting up brick-and-mortar shops,
Web Street Inc. is opting for 360 degrees of glass.
<P>
   The Chicago e-broker is taking over the round see-through
building previously occupied by Sharper Image at Bush and Market
streets in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Web Street will announce today that it's opening real-life
financial centers in San Francisco, Boston and Denver. It already
has one, &LR;  in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Like other online brokers, Web Street has found that it helps to
have a physical location for people who need help navigating its
site or want to pick up their stock-market winnings in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first brokerage firm born online to
plant an outlet in the city, but it will be within a few blocks of
other online /off-line competitors, including Charles Schwab and
Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online firms that have branch offices have done a very
good job in terms of opening new accounts,'' said Dan Burke, a
Web-broker analyst with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass. On the
other hand, ``some brokers are doing well without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Web Street is leasing the high-traffic space _ 3,800 square feet
at street level and 2,900 in the basement _ from its owner, the
government of Singapore. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least five bidders for the property, including
several other online brokers and someone who wanted to turn it into
a television studio, said Kazuko Morgan, a real estate broker for
Whitney Cressman who handled the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Web Street plans to restore the quirky building to its original
splendor. Believe it or not, the circa-1959 building is a city
landmark, part of the old Crown Zellerbach complex.
</P>
<P>
   Web Street intends to bring back a spiral staircase, rip out the
carpets to expose the stone floor, and replace countertops and
teller booths like those that existed when the building was a Wells
Fargo bank.
</P>
<P>
   It will open in three to four months, assuming the city
permitting process goes smoothly, said Web Street Vice President
Harleigh Mandel.
</P>
<P>
   The site will have a high-tech look similar to the Beverly Hills
office, which has ``a wall of TVs, a curving stock ticker and flat
panel monitors all over the place,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly traded Web Street (ticker symbol: WEBS) is a
mid-size Web broker, ranking 13th with about 115,000 accounts,
according to Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   It originally targeted active traders, and was the first to
introduce real-time streaming quotes, Mandel says.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, which monitors and rates online brokers for
performance and customer satisfaction, ranks Web Street 13th
overall, but fourth for ``hyperactive'' traders.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked 16th overall in a recent analysis by Barron's.
</P>
<P>
   Web Street said it eventually plans to open locations ``in major
U.S. and international cities,'' including New York, Paris,
Frankfurt and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branch offices provide another channel of communication for
investors,'' said Burke. ``You can do it over the phone, over the
Web, by e-mail, in live chat sessions and with a live branch. If
you're not everywhere, you're really not helping everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto's E-Trade is planning to open a storefront in
Manhattan but has not said if it will move into San Francisco.

 &HT;    MIAMI TENSIONS RISE AS HAVANA OFFERS TO SEND ELIAN'S FATHER
 &HT;    Eds: Updates in first 8 grafs with details of Havana proposal,
end of day's negotiations in Miami.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With tensions rising and officials warning the city may
explode in protest, the showdown over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez racheted to an even higher level late Wednesday as
officials in Havana said Elian's father could come to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The development came as negotiations between federal immigration
officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse. U.S.
officials postponed a deadline for revoking the boy's custody
status.
</P>
<P>
   After months of angry rhetoric, Cuban leader Fidel Castro said
he would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to come to the United States
along with some of his son's school classmates and a team of
psychologists to live with Elian until the court battle over the
boy's fate ends, CNN reported.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials about the
proposed trip, and it was not clear if or when the visit would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ended a
tense five-hour meeting Wednesday night with Elain's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzales, who has cared for the boy since he was rescued at
sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting centered on an INS demand that Gonzalez pledge to
turn the boy over for a return to Cuba if the family loses its
court fight to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials emerged from their Miami offices about 9
p.m. EST, saying the meeting had reached no conclusion and would
resume Thursday. They postponed until Friday a deadline for
revoking Elian's parole, which could mean he might soon be taken
away from his Miami family, perhaps for a return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami's Cuban exiles held a huge rally in the
neighborhood known as Little Havana. Thousands of people gathered
in the darkness, shining flashlights into the sky and vowing to
continue their protests against any effort to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, more than a hundred protesters milled outside
Lazaro Gonzalez's home, chanting, praying and vowing to form a
human chain to keep the boy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to show the world that we're united and that we're
not going to allow Elian to go back to Cuba,'' said Hortensia
Prado(cq), one of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent prelude to what might come if the government
moves to take the boy, a convoy of dump trucks chugged down the
narrow streets of the neighborhood, horns blaring to the cheers of
the protesters. The drivers vowed to block all the streets leading
to the home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local officials lashed out at Attorney General Janet
Reno and President Clinton, warning that Miami's Cuban exiles may
burst into angry protest if Elian is removed before his court
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're provoking the community,'' Miami-Dade County Mayor
Alex Penelas said of Clinton and Reno. ``They keep pushing and
pushing the envelope and when it explodes, no one is going to be
able to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a noon press conference, Penelas and 20 other local officials
vowed that local police would make no effort to assist federal
officers should they try to remove the boy before his court case is
finished. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also issued a statement saying no
state officers would assist, either.
</P>
<P>
   After critics said the mayor was essentially inviting the
community to protest, Penelas issued another statement saying
police would not tolerate disruptions in the streets, such as the
ones that erupted in January after the initial decision by federal
officials that Elian should go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to the comments at a Washington news
conference by saying, ``I like the mayor very much but I believe in
the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the city appeared on the brink of some sort of
outburst, immigration officials repeated Wednesday that even if the
9 a.m. deadline comes and they revoke Elian's parole, they do not
plan to immediately go the Lazaro Gonzales's home and forcibly
remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obligation is on them,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
said in a television interview. ``They have said they intend to be
law-abiding, and we are relying on them to be law-abiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug of war
since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on
Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their
boat sank as they fled Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of
his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian
should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family then filed a federal court suit to challenge
the federal decision and to request an asylum hearing for the boy,
but last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them. The family
then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
which on Monday set oral arguments for May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the complicated standoff is the fact that since he
was rescued at sea, Elian has been legally in the custody of Reno.
Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore
the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that she would allow the appeal to be heard, but
has insisted that Lazaro Gonzalez sign a statement promising to
voluntarily turn Elian over if the family loses the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite edging up the pressure on the family, federal officials
have said they are reluctant to forcibly take the boy against the
family's will. But the family seems adamantly opposed to turning
the boy over until all legal channels have been exhausted,
including a possible hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's
exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the
never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. The boy has been the
subject of poems, paintings and an almost religious fervor, with
some people recently flocking to a bank near Lazaro Gonzalez's home
where a figure has appeared in a glass window that many believe
resembles the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Such intense feelings left worried police officials planning for
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great concerns that I can't see a peaceful resolution
to this situation,'' said Miami Police Chief William O'Brien.

`HIGH FIDELITY' HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of John Cusack's wonderfully acerbic new
comedy,``High Fidelity,'' Cusack's character, Rob, muses that there
are thousands of songs about misery and he wonders: Do I listen to
pop music because I'm miserable or am I miserable because I listen
to pop music?
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of question the self-obsessed Rob specializes in,
precisely because there's no easy answer. All the better: He can
torture himself for days while searching for the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Music, love and misery are insightfully intertwined in this
quirky comedy about a record store owner who sifts through his past
relationships to discover why women are always dumping him. Rob's
latest loss is Laura (Iben Hjejle), who has just left him for
living his obsessions. Rob baits her, saying she doesn't even make
his top-five list of painful break-ups. After Laura leaves, though,
he compiles a top-five list of reasons he misses her.
</P>
<P>
   Rob, as you can see, is big on lists. He owns a barely
functioning record store in Chicago where he spends his days with
his two clerks _ shy softy Dick (Todd Louiso) and the loud,
opinionated Barry (Jack Black) _ rattling off lists of musical
minutiae while serving or belittling the occasional customer who
manages to find the store. (Sample list: Top Five Songs For Letting
the Person Who Dumped You Know That Even Though They Broke Your
Heart You Can't Get Over Them).
</P>
<P>
   Rob can't get over Laura, particularly after he learns she has
taken up with a pompous, pony-tailed blowhard (Tim Robbins in a
hilarious cameo). Now, Laura is on Rob's break-up list (she's No. 5
with a bullet). A glutton for punishment, Rob tracks down the other
women on the list to find out why ``he's doomed to be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack and his ``Grosse Point Blank'' writing partners D.V.
DeVincentis and Steve Pink (along with Scott Rosenberg) have done a
brilliant job in bringing Nick Hornby's painfully wry 1995 novel to
the screen. The setting has seamlessly shifted from London to
Chicago, but that's the only change of substance. Rob's
angst-ridden monologues (Cusack spends much of the movie directly
addressing the camera) remain, as do all of his very real character
flaws. There are reasons women are wary of this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' sports one of the best supporting casts you'll
ever find in a movie. Lili Taylor, Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter and
Natasha Gregson Wagner dazzle as the women in Rob's life, and
Catherine Zeta-Jones steals several scenes as the ex-girlfriend Rob
knew was always out of his league. Joan Cusack plays Laura's best
friend with fetching candor, and Danish actress Hjejle grounds the
movie with genuine grace.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all are Louiso and Black, Laurel and Hardy teammates who
invest their characters with a touching authenticity that goes well
beyond the sort of cartoonish portrayals we usually get from comic
sidekicks. Such depth is this movie's strength, and Stephen Frears'
solid, simple direction allows these satisfying details and
characterizations to come to the fore. ``High Fidelity'' heads my
list of best movies we've seen so far this year. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The film: ``High Fidelity'' (R; language and some sexuality.) &QL;

JACKSON MEETS WITH COCA-COLA OFFICIALS ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (Eds: no byline) 
(cjl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson met Wednesday with top
Coca-Cola executives to discuss the company's treatment of minority
and female employees.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came three weeks before the company's annual meeting
on April 19, in Wilmington, Del. About 150 current and former Coke
employees plan to travel there to protest what they say is
discrimination against blacks in pay, promotion and performance
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Jackson called for ``a fair and just
settlement'' of a racial discrimination lawsuit filed against the
company by a group of Coke employees nearly a year ago. The lawsuit
seeks class action status, which could broaden the suit to include
as many as 2,000 current and former black workers. He also said
that the company had a historic opportunity to establish itself as
a leader among corporations in its treatment of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met for more than two hours Wednesday with Douglas N.
Daft, Coke's chairman and chief executive; Jack L. Stahl, its
president; Carl Ware, executive vice president; and Ingrid S.
Jones, vice president for corporate external affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ware said, ``The Coca-Cola Co. has had a longstanding
relationship with Rev. Jackson and, as always, we value his
insights and perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Coke nor Jackson disclosed details of the discussions.
But both spoke of their relationship: a Coke spokesman noted that
the company had been a financial sponsor of Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
organization, and Jackson said that the organization was a
Coca-Cola shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Daft has said that Coca-Cola is working to settle the employees'
lawsuit, whose allegations the company had denied.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, referring to the busloads of protesters expected to
travel to Wilmington, said Wednesday, ``Either the buses will roll
or justice will roll as water down a river stream.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``Pups'' has a story behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The flavorful, ultra-low-budget suspense feature by the English
artist who calls himself Ash premiered about a year ago to deserved
acclaim at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival. Two days
later, those kids shot up Columbine High School, and no distributor
has wanted to come near this sad but often satirical tale of
13-year-old bank robbers. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   At once depressing, uproarious, shockingly well-acted and
alarmingly realistic, ``Pups'' both attempts to figure out what
makes pubescents commit violent acts and acknowledges the essential
futility of trying to crack that mystery. It might amuse you or
appall you; the key thing is, it has the power to do both.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsupervised morning of videotaping an attempted
suicide, angry, asthmatic Stevie (film newcomer Cameron Van Hoy)
finds his mother's .44 magnum. He brings it along on a walk to
school with his girlfriend Rocky (Mischa Barton of ``The Sixth
Sense'' and ``Lawn Dogs''). Passing a Chatsworth bank he decides,
on a whim, to rob it. A hostage situation with the attendant media
circus results.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie and Rocky have some vague ideas about why they want a
bunch of money. But basically they're impulsive kids, who are no
more corrupt or bad than others their age. Rocky frets that she
looks too skinny on TV, but isn't above suggesting that her father
molested her just to see how it plays with the crowd and the cops.
Stevie swings wildly between swaggering with the power the gun
gives him and apologizing profusely to his adult captives.
</P>
<P>
   When Stevie realizes he can make outrageous demands of the FBI
agent in charge of managing the crisis (Burt Reynolds, in the solid
and world-weary mode he's aged into so well), he wants to be on
MTV. Kurt Loder magically appears, hilariously all-business yet _
as only he can be _ more empathetic than any other grownup around.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hostages, a trouble-making, wheelchair-dependent Gulf
War vet who claims to also understand why the youths are so
alienated, is played rather well by Adam Farrar. He's the
much-in-the-news stepbrother of Leonardo DiCaprio _ but that's
another story. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The film: ``Pups'' (R; violence, language, children in jeopardy). &QL; 
The stars: Cameron Van Hoy, Mischa Barton, Burt Reynolds, Adam
Farrar, Kurt Loder. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Ash. Produced by Daniel

TEXAS TORNADO DAMAGE IS IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>

Southwestern Insurance'') (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The governor's office declared Tarrant
County a disaster area Wednesday as workers began cleaning up the
devastation from tornadoes that ravaged Fort Worth and Arlington,
killing five people, wiping out neighborhoods and making downtown a
ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Damage in Fort Worth alone was projected to top $300 million,
with most of the destruction downtown and in the Monticello,
Rivercrest and Linwood neighborhoods. Figures for Arlington, where
100 homes sustained major damage and 1,000 had light to moderate
damage, were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr accompanied state officials on a
helicopter tour of the two cities and said he was ``just completely
shocked'' by the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mike Moncrief said he was awestruck by the disaster.
``I've seen the aftermath of Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls
(tornadoes), but I just didn't expect it here in our own back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two tornadoes hit Fort Worth and Arlington about 30 minutes
apart Tuesday evening. They plowed through the Fort Worth business
district, shattering plate-glass windows in high-rise buildings,
and ripped through a residential area south of Interstate 20 in
southeast Arlington. Fifty-six homes were damaged in Grand Prairie,
east of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service gauged the Arlington tornado at its
peak as an F3, which packs winds of 158 to 206 mph. The Fort Worth
tornado was an F2 with winds ranging from 113 to 157 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry granted the county disaster declaration in
the absence of Gov. George W. Bush, who was out of state
campaigning for president. The governor issued a statement saying
the damage is ``a tragic reminder of the fierce power of nature. My
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Our
state disaster recovery teams are already working with local
officials to assess the damage and provide relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington damage was primarily confined to the area around
Matlock and Bardin roads near the municipal airport; no serious
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the major path of destruction was along a
two-mile stretch from University Boulevard along West Seventh
Street through downtown. More than 80 people were treated at area
hospitals, and at least two were in serious or critical condition
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Bob Terrell estimated preliminary damage in Fort
Worth at $157 million, but comparisons already were being made to
the 1995 hailstorm, which produced $400 million in insured damages
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Insurance Information Service estimated that
the final damage total for the Tuesday tornadoes will exceed $300
million in Fort Worth alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hailstorm was more widespread, whereas now, the damage is
more concentrated and obviously more extensive,'' Assistant City
Manager Ramon Guajardo said. ``But I don't know which will be more
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 buildings hit by the tornado in Fort Worth, eight were
destroyed, 27 sustained major damage and 15 had minor damage. At
least one, the Cash America building, may have to be torn down,
Deputy Fire Chief Jim Tidwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also damaged in Fort Worth were the downtown Central Library,
the Cowtown Coliseum and the International Center.
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals treated more than 80 people for injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death toll stood at four Wednesday night, with one
person missing and presumed dead. Two victims were crushed on the
outskirts of downtown _ Carl Spence, 67, by a collapsing wall and
Howard D. Thornton by a truck trailer that toppled onto him _ as
the tornado plowed its way through the heart of the city about 6:30
p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the third victim _ Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, _ was
recovered Wednesday morning along a creek in the 9500 block of
Trinity Boulevard, behind the Bell Helicopter plant in northeast
Tarrant County. Dickens and his grandmother, Adele Warren, 62, were
in a car that was swept away by rising creek waters as they left
Bell Helicopter. Warren's body had not been located by Wednesday
afternoon, but she is presumed to be dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juan C. Osequera, 19, who suffered severe head trauma when a
softball-size hailstone hit him, died Wednesday night at a Fort
Worth hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon Wednesday, authorities had reopened many
downtown streets that had been barricaded, leaving the business
district a virtual ghost town bounded by glistening sidewalks
sprinkled with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Streets surrounding the most heavily damaged high-rise buildings
_ Bank One, UPR Plaza, Tandy Towers and the Tandy Technology Center
_ may remain closed through the weekend as workers remove cracked
or broken plate-glass windows, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and managers of downtown properties were allowed into
their buildings Wednesday afternoon to assess damage and secure the
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of downtown workers who received an
unexpected holiday Wednesday will probably be permitted to return
Thursday, Police Chief Ralph Mendoza and Guajardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the downtown area, the heaviest damage was in the
Linwood neighborhood. More than a dozen homes and duplexes,
including the former home of presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald, were destroyed or heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Also hard-hit in Fort Worth was the Monticello neighborhood,
where the storm ripped roofs from homes and uprooted 80-year-old
trees along Hamilton Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3900 block of Hamilton Avenue, winds lifted one family's
garage and moved it 10 feet north. A basketball goal was knocked
horizontally, and winds drove it into the family's white sedan,
embedding the backboard in the left taillight.
</P>
<P>
   The only reported neighborhood injury was a man working at the
West Seventh Street Barbershop. The owner's son, Michael Moore, was
the last to leave the barbershop, said his mother, Rosa Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just walked out of the shop, and the wind blew him
against the building and it collapsed on top of him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, the tornado destroyed a section of roof at the
Bell Helicopter Textron facility. Flying debris damaged a V-22
helicopter and an XV-15 demonstrator but did not damage two CV-22
Osprey helicopters housed there, Bell spokesman Bob Leder said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado skirted the I-20 corridor of car dealerships, then
slammed into a residential neighborhood flanking both sides of
Matlock Road just south of Bardin Road. Some houses, particularly
along Embercrest Lane and Chasemore Lane, caught the brunt of
powerful winds that left only clumps of rubble atop concrete
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents credited their survival or lack of serious injury
to residential construction that places bathrooms in the middle of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bathrooms saved lives,'' said Laura Donovan, whose home
on Sandalwood Lane was damaged but not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Fire Battalion Chief John McQueary also marveled at
the absence of serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a strict ``no fly
zone'' over downtown Fort Worth at the request of the FBI, said
John Clabes, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why is that the downdrafts from the helicopters
flying over downtown were blowing some of the remaining shards of
glass out of those tall buildings and blowing those shards down on
the people trying to clean up the mess below,'' Clabes said.
</P>
<P>
   The ban will remain in effect until the FBI or Barr requests
that it be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth suburb of River Oaks, Castleberry High School
students, whose classes were canceled Wednesday, are expected to
return Thursday. The campus sustained widespread damage to the
field house, vocational building and main building.
</P>
<P>
   River Oaks City Administrator Joy Williams said 80 structures
sustained damage.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods on the southern and western fringes of River Oaks
were hard hit, with fallen trees, broken windows and roofs blown
off.
</P>
<P>
   The city lost many stately trees more than 100 years old, Mayor
Jack Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired graphic artist Jerry Grimes, 65, now working part-time
for the U.S. Census, recalled how he was leaving Tandy Center on
Tuesday evening when he saw the storm developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started forming from the ground up,'' Grimes said. ``Then I
saw it begin a slow counterrotation. The sky turned black, and then
the clouds were pulled right out of the sky... The yellow stripe on
my back started to grow. At that point, I decided the tornado was
bigger and badder than me, so I took off.''

   ARLINGTON _ The five-hour drive back from Houston last week was
hard for Clay Gould. There was a lot of thinking time, not only
about the just-received bad news from the famed M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, but also about the future.
</P>
<P>
   At age 28, and being the nation's second-youngest head coach in
NCAA Division I baseball, life seemed to be serving up fat
fastballs for Gould.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, the pitch selection changed dramatically. A
sweeping curveball came in at the knees, outside corner. Every
hitter dreads being buckled by that particular pitch, and only five
springs ago, Gould was a UT-Arlington player being recognized as
one of the best hitters in college baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ready or not, Gould had major adjustments to make, meaning
there was much to ponder on that drive from Houston. Baseball had
always been such a large part of his young life. How in the world
could colon cancer be making this unwelcome intrusion?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually kind of funny that just as soon as we hit the
city limits of Arlington, I immediately felt better,'' Gould was
saying yesterday. ``My spirits quickly lifted. Just getting back
home, back to Arlington, quickly changed my whole attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, that figures. Gould's roots grow deep in Arlington.
Three generations deep.
</P>
<P>
   Gould was born, went to kindergarten, grade school, middle
school, high school and college, all within the same Arlington ZIP
code.
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, and married her last fall, also within
that same ZIP code. Their first child is due in August, and that
birth _ you guessed it _will be at the same hospital where Gould
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Gould has been all Arlington, all the time. The lone
exception was the one year at Texas A&AMP;M to receive his master's
degree and also serve as a graduate assistant coach for the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clay returned to UTA as head baseball coach and
immediately recruited one of the best freshmen classes in the
country _ ``Collegiate Baseball'' magazine ranked it 26th
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, very early in this first season, Gould felt
stomach pains, which were followed by a problem of digesting food.
From that, colon cancer was discovered in surgery two weeks ago at
M.D. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's the last thing you want to tell your family
members and your friends,'' said Gould, sitting in the baseball
office at UTA. ``Here I was, in the best physical condition of my
life, doing 50 minutes on the stationary bike every day, and adding
20 more minutes on the StairMaster, and from that, it's now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hear the word cancer, and they automatically think of
death. They feel sorry for you because they have a great amount of
concern for you. You have to tell them that it's still OK. I'm
gonna still be me. The recovery process is going to work. I sure
don't think about dying. Actually, I'm kind of eager to get the
next step started, and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   That next step is the chemotherapy treatments. ``The doctors are
certain they got out what they needed to get out, but the chemo
will be to make sure no active cells are still there,'' Gould said.
``The only thing that scares me about the chemo is the feeling of
fatigue that will come with it. I like to do what I like to do, and
if that means spending 12-hour days involved in baseball, so be it.
I love this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gould put on the uniform yesterday and coached again
from the dugout as the Mavs played Tarleton State. His biggest
worry until a few weeks ago was about his team's midseason slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at cancer as the best thing that ever happened to me,
because of the way it has already changed my perspective on life,''
Gould said. ``That change is for the better. I am more relaxed, I
have a different outlook and focus on the day-to-day process, and
it has also already made me a more positive person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now enjoy some of the things that before I didn't think I
had time to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat fastballs are never forever. But a positive attitude and a
strong will can overcome almost all. At the Arlington city limits
sign last week, Clay Gould found what he needed.

CUBAN BOY'S CASE COULD SWAY BUSH-GORE CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Could Vice President Al Gore's fate be tied to that
of a 6-year-old boy from Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   That is what some political analysts think as the nation waits
for the Clinton administration to take the next step in sending
Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans make up nearly 12 percent of voters in Florida,
the nation's fourth-most-populous state, and few doubt that Gore's
presidential campaign would suffer if the government sent Elian
back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County _ and an ally of
Gore's _ said Wednesday that the area's Cuban population, about
800,000 strong, would hold the administration responsible if it
returned the boy and civil unrest broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor omitted the vice president's name from those he said
would be held accountable, but he said, ``It's guilt by
association, and a lot of people think there is more he should be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate responsible parties, though, are the president
and Janet Reno,'' Penelas said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repeatedly declined to specify what he thinks should
happen to Elian, saying last week: ``This is a custody matter for
the courts to decide based on due process, with a full hearing in
which all parties are heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's Republican rival, has said
that Elian's fate should be decided by Florida's family courts,
which would probably be far more sympathetic to the relatives in
Miami who want to keep the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Florida tends to vote Republican in presidential elections, but
Bill Clinton and Al Gore won the state in 1996. They took more than
40 percent of the Cuban-American vote centered in Dade County, but
such support may be unlikely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said through a spokesman: ``If Elian gets sent back, the Cuban
community will remember which party wanted to hand a small child
back to Fidel Castro across a barbed-wire fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has given every sign of making a play for the state, if
only to spook Bush into spending more time and money there. Bush's
brother Jeb is governor of Florida and controls an extensive
get-out-the-vote machine there.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has visited the state several times, and he stayed in
Tallahassee on March 14 when he clinched the Democratic nomination.
He plans a return trip late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban voters could swing the state, and Florida could have a
pivotal role in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban American National Foundation said recently that it
would work actively against Gore. And there have been signs that
many of the 40,000 Cuban-Americans who are registered Democrats are
changing their party affiliation.

</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Bruins moved one giant step closer to playoff
elimination Wednesday night as the Canadiens rallied for a 4-3
victory over Boston at the Molson Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The crushing goal came with 14.4 seconds left in regulation when
ex-Bruin forward Sergei Zholtok zigzagged through center ice before
teeing up a slapper from the right point that eluded goaltender Rob
Tallas to the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns, his hand over his mouth, could only
shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Canadiens leapfrogged ahead of Buffalo by
one point for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came out strong, scoring a pair of goals a little
more than three minutes apart to take a 2-0 lead into the first
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Knuble, who made his Bruins debut March 11 against the
Canadiens, potted his 12th goal of the season and third with Boston
to get things started.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Axelsson made it all happen by skating the puck around the
right circle while being chased by rookie defenseman Francis
Bouillon. Axelsson backhanded the puck in front and Zholtok tried
to get his stick on it but missed. Knuble was there to rap it past
goalie Jeff Hackett at 10:06.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nickulas made it 2-0 with his third tally of the season at
13:25. Hal Gill relayed a pass up to Joe Thornton, who took off up
the left side of the ice. Thornton, in the left circle, saw
Nickulas driving to the net and dished a perfect cross-ice feed
that Nickulas buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens rallied to within one midway through the second on
a Benoit Brunet strike. Zholtok teed up a slapper from the right
circle that Tallas stopped. But Brunet, who had been battling with
Cameron Mann in front, got free and fired in the rebound from the
left side of the crease at 8:05.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brunet's 14th goal of the year, tying a career high set
last season, but it was just his 45th game of the year because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, smelling vulnerability, increased the pressuer
and eventually tied it on a freakish goal at 16:51. Patrice
Brisebois fed a lead pass to Brunet, who was scooting up the right
side. Brunet dished it to Sheldon Souray at the left point and
Souray, seeing traffic in front, flipped the puck at the net.
Tallas either didn't see it or was fooled because it sailed right
by him, pulling the Canadiens even.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case many times this season, the Bruins proved
themselves incapable of putting a team away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came close to regaining the lead on two bids by left
wing Sergei Samsonov early in the third but Hackett turned them
back.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the Canadiens to take their first lead of
the game at 5:43. With Steve Heinze off for high sticking,Bouillon
was credited with a goal after his shot caromed off Bruin
defenseman Brandon Smith and past Tallas for the 3-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins fought back to pull even at 7:57 on a goal by
defenseman Kyle McLaren. Thornton, skating up the right side,
sailed a backhand pass from the far end of the right circle and
McLaren, off balance, put the puck, along with himself, into the
net on top of Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams pulled out all the stops the rest of the way. One of
the Bruins' finest chances came with 5:15 remaining in regulation.
Center Brian Rolston found himself with a breakaway from center
ice. Rolston raced down the slot on Hackett, switched from his
forehand to his backhand, and tried to slip his shot inside the
right post. But Hackett blocked it with his left skate, making the
save.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston could only shake his head in frustration.

(ATTN: Russia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Conn., Utah,
Calif.) ANNA SOKOLOW, CHOREOGRAPHER, DIES AT 90   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for
her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness,
died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930s, Sokolow
was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual;
her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she
could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and
penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style
was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.
</P>
<P>
   She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often
choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein
musical ``Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement
to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the
actress Uta Hagen. Sokolow used movement ``as a human experience,
not formally, not mechanistically,'' Hagen said at a program at the
Kaye Playhouse in honor of Sokolow's 85th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950s often also dealt with
alienation, said at the same tribute, ``She has influenced us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the
disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style
was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent
screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to
youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young
people glaring confrontationally at the audience.
</P>
<P>
   If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her
work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that
in 1966 she was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the
initial dance grants made by the recently established National
Council on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Among her most famous pieces was ``Rooms'' (1955), in which
chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move
on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of
the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also
titled ``Rooms'' (1966), which featured, among others, Martha
Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later
choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography
was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt)
in two 1957 films, ``Bullfight'' and ``A Moment in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on
popular culture. Her ``Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ``beat
ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes
of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo
Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the
Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into
the orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock
musical ``Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened.
Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ``Street
Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows.
The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967
that ``you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works,
that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that
``the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a
few movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing her outlook, Sokolow once said: ``I don't have a dim
view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy
philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents
immigrated from Russia, and she was born in Hartford, Conn., in
1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they
struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease,
which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;
her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in
the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in poverty, but like many immigrants, the
Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing
at a settlement house. She continued her training at the
Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha
Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her
own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer
with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer
Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured
the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering
humanity, Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   She played a major role in developing modern dance in another
country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged
for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press
agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to
stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940.
Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions
influenced many young Mexican choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a
modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ``Lyric Suite,'' a
melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been
danced by Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and
several ballet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to
Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that
preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those
source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of
her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in
1958. Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and
choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among
them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing
and the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as
the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert,
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Not all her dances were somber. ``Magritte, Magritte'' was based
upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ``Odes'' was filled
with swirling movement patterns and ``Poem'' was lyrical.
Nevertheless, ``Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in
Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode that could be
interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as
pornographic by some theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Sokolow
looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued
working, and in 1995 her ``September Sonnet'' was much praised when
it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim
May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a
heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers.
Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H.
Scripps American Dance Festival Award.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce
disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by
telling students: ``I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on
you. But I love dance more than I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no known immediate survivors.

Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier if
you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your local
utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to the
site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical and
drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting into
one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill you.
These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them. (Edward R.

When you do the initial training, don't be on your best behavior

the side of the mouth and slightly below, a thumb's width to two

Choosing among available speech recognition software can be

well need to be replaced by a new one before dictation software can

   When Morris Peterson arrived as a freshman at Michigan State, he
quickly acquired a catchy nickname: ``Shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical 17-year-old. Shoot from the hip and leave the defense to
those who want to be bothered with it.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled through that first year, partly due to an injured
thumb but mainly because he lived in coach Tom Izzo's doghouse:
``Hey, Morris, found anyone on campus yet that you can guard?''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been inviting ridicule then to suggest that the
day would come _ as it has now _ that Peterson would be the Big Ten
Player of the Year and leading scorer on a Michigan State team
arriving for a second consecutive Final Four appearance, this time
favored to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   But early in his sophomore year, the blessed event that would
transform his life finally occurred: he hit iron on a slam dunk and
came down with a broken wrist. Decked out in a cast that reached to
his elbow, Peterson acquired a new nickname: ``The Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, he also developed a new outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast made it tough to shoot, so I had time to develop some
other skills, and to learn some things,'' he says. ``I learned how
to play Michigan State basketball. I learned that if you play for
coach Izzo, he doesn't care about you dropping shots in from 30 to
35 feet if you can't play defense. On this team, you run, you
scramble, you dive for loose balls, you battle people, no matter
what.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play like Antonio Smith did. He was a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, the now-departed Smith was the charter member of
the core group of players known as ``The Flintstones.'' The name
stems from the fact that they all grew up in Flint, Mich., and not
because they crush rocks during timeouts, although that has become
the hardhat image of Izzo's Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   There are three of them left now _ Peterson and point guard
Mateen Cleaves, both seniors, and junior shooting guard Charlie
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledged heart and soul of the Spartans, Cleaves _ who
won Big Ten Player of the Year honors in his sophomore and junior
years _ opted to return for his senior season for specific reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have loved every minute I have spent in this school,'' he
says. ``And I love the opportunity that it gave to all of us. And I
wanted to help us win a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise began badly for Cleaves, who sat out the first 13
games this season with a stress fracture. During that stretch,
playing a brutal schedule laced with ranked teams because, Izzo
says, ``I thought we needed a challenge,'' the Spartans went 9-4.
Since Cleaves' return, they are 21-3.
</P>
<P>
   During his recovery, Cleaves busied himself with a pet project:
badgering the 6-foot-7, 215-pound Peterson into ``being the
All-American we all know you are.'' Peterson had little choice but
to listen, since the two are roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of the quiet one,'' he says. ``Mateen, he'll get in
your face and he won't let up, but it always works. He can lift you
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the day he came into the room and told me about his
injury, I thought he was kidding, because he's always so up. Then I
saw the tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's your team now. You're the one everyone is
counting on, and you've got to get it done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As time wore on, a few things rubbed off. After hitting the last
of a series of shots that cemented an 86-76 victory over North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, Peterson started back upcourt, glanced up
at the stunned throng of UNC fans, and put his finger to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Shhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a little of Mateen jumped out of me there,'' he says,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, Cleaves resumed running the floor, running the
team on and off the court, and launching those patented MSU
comebacks _ ``They love to dig themselves out of a hole,'' one fan
marveled, after watching the Spartans wipe out a 14-point Syracuse
lead and win, 75-58, by scoring the game's final 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   That one followed a seismic locker room speech by Cleaves at
halftime, in which he cornered his towering roomie and said,
``You've got to lead us back, because we're counting on you. And
I'll kick your butt if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit a quick 3-pointer after the half, yelled at Cleaves
to ``keep it coming,'' and scored 16 points down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it goes the other way. On an evening when once-mighty
Michigan was in tatters, the hot hand belonged to Bell, and Cleaves
was near an all-time assist record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want that record,'' Bell told him, ``just keep bringing
it over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves wound up with 26 assists, Bell scored 32 points, and the
Wolverines went down, 114-63.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the group are the non-Flintstones _ A.J. Granger
(6-9, 230), who crashes the boards and shoots threes with equal
gusto, and Andre Hutson (6-8, 240), who had 17 points and 11
rebounds in the finals of the Midwest Regional while bearing the
primary responsibility for guarding Iowa State's Marcus Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Spartans are down to their last gasp, someone from
Flint usually gets the ball. The game-turning play against Iowa
State, hurriedly agreed upon during a timeout, was an alley-oop
pass from Cleaves to Peterson, who executed the dunk _ no iron this
time _ and set MSU on its way to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about the play afterward, Izzo smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't want to be trite about it,'' he said, ``but
that's what All-Americans are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Spartans win it all, Peterson will indulge himself a
brief ritual: to reach up on top of his locker and remove the cast
that has been there for two years as a reminder of a different
time.

   (NYT42) NEW YORK -- March 29, 2000 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT-B&AMP;W --
Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier if
you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your local
utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to the
site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical and
drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting into
one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill you.
These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them. (Edward R.

When you do the initial training, don't be on your best behavior

actually move; Position the microphone properly and consistently at
the side of the mouth and slightly below, a thumb's width to two

Choosing among available speech recognition software can be

well need to be replaced by a new one before dictation software can
be used successfully. Even a newer computer may need more RAM or a

how to use it well means an investment of time. (Tony Cenicola/The

WEB START-UP TO BUY IMS HEALTH IN PERPLEXING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internet health care company that went public less than six
months ago announced Wednesday that it was using its highflying
stock to buy a leading health care information provider that has
long been one of America's top 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   TriZetto Group, a start-up that provides software to doctors and
health care companies online, said it would acquire IMS Health
Inc., a decades-old company that gathers prescription information
for drug companies, for stock valued at more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The complex transaction gives IMS executives and shareholders
control of the new company, which nevertheless will be called
TriZetto. The deal left Wall Street analysts and investors of both
companies perplexed. Shares of TriZetto plummeted $24.5625, to
$33.50. IMS fell $5, to $16.625.
</P>
<P>
   Satish K. Tyagi, a managing director at SG Cowen, who follows
IMS stock, said shareholders in each company were uncertain about
the benefits of the deal _ and also about each other. Many IMS
shareholders have held their stock for many years, Tyagi said,
while many TriZetto stockholders may have invested just weeks or
even a day ago, hoping for a repeat of the whirlwind appreciation
of many Internet stocks. Indeed, before Wednesday, TriZetto shares
had gained more than 500 percent since the company went public on
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a shareholder of IMS, you're saying: `Wait a minute.
Who are these guys?' '' Tyagi said. And as for TriZetto investors,
Tyagi said, ``Those guys don't really care for these old-economy
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyagi said it was not yet clear why the experienced management
at IMS, a successful company founded in 1954, had decided to team
up with executives at TriZetto. TriZetto, based in Newport Beach,
Calif., was founded in 1997 by Jeff Margolis, 36. Margolis,
TriZetto's chairman and chief executive, will be vice chairman and
president of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``TriZetto is unseasoned,'' Tyagi said. ``They've only reported
one or two quarters as a public company.''
</P>
<P>
   But both companies boasted about the deal Wednesday, saying it
would create a company that was the dominant leader in the
fast-growing business of providing information services to health
care companies. The new company would have 9,500 employees and
would have had revenue last year of about $1.4 billion. Only about
$80 million of that amount was earned by TriZetto.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Weissman, the chairman of IMS, which is based in
Westport, Conn., said Margolis and other executives had many years
of experience in the business of providing information services to
health care companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal helps IMS move its business onto the Internet, Weissman
said. And TriZetto, which sells services to doctor groups, health
maintenance organizations and other insurance companies, gets
access to the thousands of drug companies that are IMS customers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies are most excited about creating a new
business, Weissman said, by combining the information that IMS has
on drug prescriptions with the data that TriZetto has on a
patient's health care history and the cost of that care. The
information would be sold to drug companies and health care
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking about this got both companies really excited,''
Weissman said. ``We don't know how anybody else will be able to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, IMS stockholders will receive 0.4655 share
of TriZetto for each IMS share. Based on TriZetto's closing price
on Tuesday, IMS shareholders would receive TriZetto stock with a
value of $27.03 for each IMS share. The deal, which is expected to
be completed this summer, will give IMS shareholders control of
about 85 percent of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Weissman will be chairman of the new company; Victoria R. Fash,
the chief executive at IMS, will hold that same title at the new
company. &QL;

Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier if
you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your local
utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to the
site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical and
drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting into
one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill you.
These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them. (Edward R.

When you do the initial training, don't be on your best behavior

actually move; Position the microphone properly and consistently at
the side of the mouth and slightly below, a thumb's width to two

Choosing among available speech recognition software can be

well need to be replaced by a new one before dictation software can
be used successfully. Even a newer computer may need more RAM or a

Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier if
you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your local
utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to the
site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical and
drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting into
one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill you.
These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them. (Edward R.

When you do the initial training, don't be on your best behavior

actually move; Position the microphone properly and consistently at
the side of the mouth and slightly below, a thumb's width to two

Choosing among available speech recognition software can be

INS DELAYS REVOKING CUBAN BOY'S TEMPORARY STATUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After 4 1/2 hours of negotiations between attorneys for
Elian Gonzalez's Miami family and immigration officials, the
federal government Wednesday night delayed for 24 hours revocation
of the boy's parole that allows him to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Talk were to resume Thursday morning on government demands that
the boy's relatives promise in writing to return him to Cuba if
they exhaust their court appeals to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have agreed to reconvene (this morning) and
continue to discuss this very important matter,'' Robert Wallace,
regional director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Miami, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials originally set a 9 a.m. Thursday deadline
for the written promise. The deadline has been extended to 9 a.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, meanwhile, escalated the political
tug-of-war by announcing that Elian's father is willing to travel
to the United States to claim his son and stay with him, while
their Miami relatives continue a legal battle to keep him in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Castro made the announcement during a live television broadcast
Wednesday, saying Juan Miguel Gonzalez ``is ready to immediately''
go to Florida to take custody of the 6-year-old boy, according to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Castro added that the trip was conditional on guarantees that
the U.S. government would turn Elian over to his father or at least
make a maximum effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone has said the boy's father would be
willing to stay in the United States during the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has demanded that Elian's Miami relatives promise in
writing to hand the boy over if they lose their court battle to
keep him in this country.
</P>
<P>
   If INS officials revoke Elian's parole, ``that means the end of
Elian's permission to stay in the United States and the end of
Lazaro Gonzalez status to provide temporary care,'' said Maria
Cardona, INS spokeswoman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the negotiations Wednesday included the process under
which Elian would be remanded to INS custody, Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the family said after Wednesday's negotiations
that ``there's no agreement and the government is going to make
sure there's no agreement that will hurt Elian Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle Elian has been living with, has
said he would be willing to release the boy to his father if Juan
Miguel Gonzalez came to Florida from Cuba, but he said he would not
deliver the boy to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to go find him
there,'' Lazaro Gonzalez told Spanish-language network Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, meanwhile, said hours
before Wednesday's crucial meeting began that the city would not
offer to its police resources to help federal officials remove the
child from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said he and the mayors of 22 nearby towns would hold
Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton responsible for
any violence that might occur if immigration officials revoked
permission for the boy to stay in this country, the AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never cease being police officers. It would just be
in the event of the retraction of Elian; that would not be our
jurisdiction. That would be something we would leave to the federal
authorities,'' Miami police spokesman Angel Caozadillas.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that some Miami officials warned
that the city could erupt in violence if federal agents tried to
forcibly take the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana
and send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In a White House news conference, President Clinton said
everybody should abide by the decision of the courts, adding ``I
have done my best not to overly politicize this. And I don't think
we should. There is a legal process here; we ought to let it play
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Elian have appealed a Miami federal judge ruling
that paved the way for the boy to be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exile community has rallied around Elian, lifting
him as a symbol of hard-fought freedom, whose mother died in a
desperate attempt to provide a better life for her son in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS decision to return the boy was based on two interviews
by an INS officer with Juan Gonzalez in December. As a result of
the meetings, the INS determined that Gonzalez was a fit father who
had maintained a relationship with his son after his separation
from the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez derailed attempts by family members in Miami
to seek political asylum for the boy by asking the INS officials to
withdraw those applications.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing his ruling last week, District Judge K. Michael Moore
said Elian's great-uncle had the right to seek legal action on the
boy's behalf and that the court had limited jurisdiction in the
case. He also stated that Elian's attorneys could proceed with the
lawsuit to determine if the INS violated the boy's right to due
process.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a group of U.S. lawmakers seeking to block the
deportation of the child introduced legislation to confer permanent
U.S. residency status on Elian and nearly all his Cuban relatives,
the AP reported. But even supporters of the measure, written by
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., suggested its chances of being enacted
seemed slight.

HOUSE ADDS $4 BILLION TO PENTAGON BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday night approved $4 billion in
additional Pentagon spending for this year, as lawmakers edged
closer to approving a $12.6 billion overall package that would also
help Colombia combat drug trafficking and pay for military
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted, 289-130, for a bipartisan amendment to the
larger bill that replenishes $4 billion in spare parts, safety
maintenance, military health care and other accounts that have been
spent faster than expected because of heightened overseas
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stretched very thin,'' said Rep. Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif., who supported the measure. The additional Pentagon
spending increased the overall House bill from $8.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, lawmakers had defeated an amendment to
delay, and possibly kill, about half of a $1.1 billion part of the
bill to help the Colombian military and its national police fight
the drug trade. The vote was 239-186 to kill the amendment, which
was mainly sponsored by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The larger spending bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate,
where the majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, has balked at
moving a separate emergency measure, arguing that it has become a
magnet for projects that are neither urgent nor emergencies. He
wants to include the most pressing aid into Congress' regular
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's proponents on Capitol Hill and in the
administration say that approach would delay delivery of badly
needed aid for months, endangering Washington's commitment to prop
up Colombia's democratic government. The government is beset by
rebels and traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore this issue,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert in a
passionate speech on the House floor. ``We can't ignore it in this
Congress. We can't ignore it in our street corners, and we can't
ignore it in the place where this stuff comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders are trying to build enough support
behind the bill to force Lott to relent. By piling more military
spending into the bill, the move puts the majority leader in the
difficult position of reversing his opposition, angering fiscal
conservatives in his party, or blocking popular military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other Republicans have regularly criticized President
Clinton for sending U.S. forces on too many overseas missions,
jeopardizing morale and retention and undercutting the country's
war-fighting ability.

Digging a hole can be hard work, but the job can be made easier if
you have the right tools. Before breaking ground, call your local
utility companies and outline your plans. Have them come to the
site and locate and mark any underground water, gas, electrical and
drainage lines, and telephone and television cables. Cutting into
one of these can disrupt service and possibly injure or kill you.
These line markings are only approximate, so to be on the safe
side, avoid digging within two feet of them. (Edward R.

Choosing among available speech recognition software can be
daunting. If a computer is more than a couple of years old, it may
well need to be replaced by a new one before dictation software can
be used successfully. Even a newer computer may need more RAM or a

 CLINTON MAKES CAROLINA CAMPAIGN STOP   AND WEIGHS IN ON CONFEDERATE
FLAG DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ President Clinton showed Wednesday that while
he might not be a candidate anymore, he still knows how to pull off
an attention-getting campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   He spent about four hours on the ground here, from the time Air
Force One touched down at Columbia Metropolitan Airport until it
lifted off again en route to his home away from home in Chappaqua,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But in that brief time, Clinton managed to raise more than
$500,000 for the Democratic cause, press a volatile issue that is
making Republicans squirm and thumb his nose at Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas without even uttering his name.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped square in the middle of the raging debate over
the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina
Statehouse. He called on flag supporters to stop living in the past
and compared the standoff to the senseless clashes that are
occurring throughout the world between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flag controversy here, you shouldn't be surprised by how
tough this has been,'' Clinton said to loud applause. ``Why are the
Catholics and the Protestants still fussing in Northern Ireland?
Why did the Orthodox Christians run the Albanian Muslims out of
Kosovo, a million of them? Why did 800,000 people in Rwanda get
killed in a tribal war in 100 days _ with no guns practically, they
were almost all hacked to death? I could go on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a line he first delivered during a visit to Selma,
Ala., this month, Clinton said, ``As long as the waving symbol of
one American's pride is the shameful symbol of another American's
pain, we have bridges to cross in this country and we better get
across them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks at a tribute for Rep. James E. Clyburn,
the first black congressman from South Carolina since
Reconstruction. The event was held at Allen University, a small
historically black college whose mission is to ``teach the mind to
think, the hands to work and the heart to love.''
</P>
<P>
   The locale stood in marked contrast to the educational
institution that Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, visited in February. Bush has been roundly criticized for
giving a speech at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., in
which he failed to criticize anti-Catholic statements by the
university's founders or its restrictions on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the president's visit said they did not choose the
location to score political points. Clyburn, chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus, has been an advocate of black
institutions, and he encouraged organizers of the tribute to hold
it at such a school. All the same, Democrats were relishing what
they saw as the symbolism of the dueling visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Jones University and Allen University are about as far
apart as two places can be,'' said Dick Harpootlian, chairman of
the South Carolina Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian said the money that Clinton helped raise would go to
Democratic state legislators who have been singled out by
supporters of the Confederate flag. One such race, he said, pits
Jim Bryan, a longtime Democratic state senator who wants the flag
taken down, against Daniel B. Verdin, who is a leader of the
pro-flag forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said he needed the help in what he expected to be a tough
race against Verdin, who is commander of the South Carolina
Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and has vowed to make
the flag a prime campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Verdin believes passionately in his cause. ``Any so-called
`compromise' would be dishonoring to the 20,000 plus South
Carolinians who gave their lives for the cause and dishonoring to
the more than 75,000 others who defended hearth and homeland from
ruthless and barbarous invaders without giving their lives for the
cause,'' he said in a memo on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech Clinton urged such flag supporters to give the
rest of the world a lesson in tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the South has got something to teach the rest of the
country and to help our country teach the rest of the world _ we've
got to let this go,'' he said. ``I know, you say, this is easy for
you to say, but, look, everybody's got a beef in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on the flag controversy stood in marked
contrast to those of Bush, who has studiously avoided taking sides
in the battle. Bush has said it is a state issue, not a
presidential one.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential aide, however, said Clinton thought differently.
``The president has to play the role of a unifier whether it's a
symbolic issue like the flag or a specific, ugly racial incident,''
the aide said. ``The president has to bring the country together.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, expressed little concern that a visit by a
president who never carried South Carolina would sway many voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to death that Bill Clinton is coming to South
Carolina,'' said J. Sam Daniels, executive director of the state
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels called Clinton ``one of the most corrupt, scandal-ridden
presidents we've ever had,'' and said his comments on the flag
would not help resolve the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help the issue to have another outside force coming
into this state,'' Daniels said.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
It should be an interesting race, to say the least, among the
Chicago Bulls, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Rockets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who are in Minnesota tonight to play the
Timberwolves, have long been out of the playoff race, but there is
another race to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   That race is wide-open, with Chicago's Elton Brand the slight
favorite and the Clippers' Lamar Odom more of a long shot. Steve
Francis of the Rockets is somewhere in between, closer to Brand
than to Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Francis could be much higher on many ballots, but in one of the
strangest ironies, the things Francis refuses to do _ padding his
stats, playing extra minutes, jacking up shots whenever the mood
strikes him _ are the things that make him a better player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Francis said. ``It might come back to haunt me
(in the Rookie of the Year voting), but as long as my coach and my
teammates believe in me, that's what's keeping my confidence high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up by 40 (points), and I could be shooting those
wide-open shots, but I'm looking to get others involved. And I
think that all comes with learning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the things, though, that could wind up costing him the
Rookie of the Year honor because his stats aren't as gaudy as they
could be.
</P>
<P>
   But they're still pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Francis averages 17.6 points, second only to Brand's 19.4-point
average among rookies. Brand is the top rookie rebounder (10 per
game), but Francis leads in assists (6.6). Among the three top
rookies, only Francis is in the top 10 in scoring, rebounding (5.2
per game, sixth), assists, steals (1.58, third), minutes played
(35.5, third), blocks (.33, eighth) and 3-pointers made (91,
first).
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good for a guy who, at least according to some critics,
wasn't supposed to be able to play point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stress enough how much I think the position that I
play is probably the hardest position because the competition is so
tough,'' Francis said. ``It (Rookie of the Year) would be a great
feat and a great honor, and I would definitely accept it, but I
still think I have to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody but myself, but I
want people to realize that I can be a legitimate point guard in
this league, and be a point guard for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be, if history is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   He is on track to become just the seventh rookie in NBA history
to average 15 points, five rebounds and five assists, joining Oscar
Robertson (30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists with
Cincinnati in 1961), Alvan Adams (19 points, 9.1 rebounds and 5.6
assists with Phoenix in 1976), Magic Johnson (18 points, 7.7
rebounds and 7.3 assists with the Lakers in 1980), Michael Jordan
(28.2 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists with Chicago in 1985),
Penny Hardaway (16 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.6 assists with
Orlando in 1994) and Grant Hill (19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and five
assists with Detroit in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   All but Johnson and Hardaway went on to win Rookie of the Year
(beaten out by Boston's Larry Bird and Golden State's Chris Webber,
respectively).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look strictly at skills, there's not a better rookie
out there,'' said one Western Conference scout. ``He can handle the
ball, break you down, stick the outside shot, dunk on you, pass the
ball and even rebound. There is not a more skilled rookie out
there, but I'm not sure that's what the (Rookie of the Year) voters
are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   He has exactly what Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich was looking
for when the organization decided to send popular players Othella
Harrington, Michael Dickerson and Brent Price, along with Antoine
Carr, to Vancouver for the rights to Francis, who was taken by the
Grizzlies with the second pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a really good attitude,'' Tomjanovich said of
Francis. ``We had good feelings about the trade from the beginning,
but when I saw him play in those eight exhibition games I took him
aside and told him, `Steve, you have a chance to be one of the best
players ever to play your position, and you're going to be a star
in this league. Do you want to do it the right way?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And by that, I meant playing both sides of the ball, not being
a guy who's going to say, `Hey, I have the ball so I'm going to get
all the shots.' And he was on the right wavelength. And then
there's the way he carries himself with people. He's a fun guy to
be around. Kids love him, and he's good to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great opportunity (for success) because a lot of guys
don't have that whole package of talent and personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's what drew Francis back into the gym at 9 p.m.
Monday for more work on his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think about trying to get better,'' Francis said. ``I
want to be better. The reason why I came (to the gym) is because I
was watching a game on TNT, and just watching those guys I started
thinking that all of our games should be (nationally) televised,
which keeps me aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning awards would be a bonus. Francis, 23, has bigger plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully five years from now I'll just be coming off a trip
to the Olympics,'' Francis said. ``And I want to be a three- or
four-time All-Star and at least to the Western Conference finals by
then, as well as having a chance to better my skills and help my
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, if I can be the Finals MVP and make the Olympic team,
I'll give the Rookie of the Year to anybody.''

AGENT'S CONTACT WITH PLAYERS IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Tenn., Ga., Ill., N.C., Mich., Ohio, Ind.) (Exclusive) 
(DW) 
 By JOE DRAPE and JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A professional sports agent who figures prominently in the N
CAA's investigation of St. John's basketball program appears to
have broken the law in two states by repeatedly contacting
prominent college players without registering as an agent in those
states or alerting the athletes' universities about the
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone records and diary entries belonging to the agent, Andy
Miller, show that he had numerous phone conversations with Mike
Miller, the star guard for the University of Florida, which on
Saturday will play in the Final Four of the national college
basketball tournament. The records also show repeated calls to Tony
Harris of the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Both states have strict laws governing agents, including a
requirement that they register with the state and that they notify
the university when contacting an athlete. In Florida, violating
these provisions can be considered a felony; in Tennessee, it is a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not registered in either state. After athletic
officials at the University of Florida were contacted Wednesday by
The New York Times, they spoke with Mike Miller. According to Jamie
McCloskey, the University of Florida's associate athletic director
for compliance, the player acknowledged that Andy Miller had called
him at least 45 times since Sept. 1 and that he had spoken to the
agent at least 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Tennessee said Wednesday that Harris had
acknowledged speaking with Andy Miller at least a dozen times. A
Tennessee spokesman said the school planned to report Miller to the
state agency that oversees agents.
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey said Wednesday that Florida would turn the information
over to the authorities in Gainesville and that the school would
also inform the Southeastern Conference and the NCAA about Miller's
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's phone records and diaries, which were reviewed by The
Times, are evidence in a lawsuit filed against him by the agent
Eric Fleisher, Miller's former employer at Assist Sports
Management. Fleisher accuses Miller of stealing his clients and is
seeking $30 million in compensatory and punitive damages from
Miller; Wilhelmina Models Inc., with whom Miller is associated; two
other businesses; and 10 former clients.
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not return repeated calls to his Manhattan office and
cellular phone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules do not forbid contact between an agent and a player,
but they do prohibit the player's reaching an oral or written
agreement with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's phone records show that he reached Mike Miller on his
cell phone and at his girlfriend's home, speaking to him as long as
23 minutes. He began contacting him last July 20, according to the
records. Under Florida law, agents are allowed only to send written
materials to players, as long as they send the same materials to
the school's athletic director. Agents are not permitted to
initiate contact with a player, as Mike Miller said Andy Miller
did. If the player initiates the contact, the agent is obliged to
alert the university.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief phone interview Wednesday, Mike Miller said of Andy
Miller, ``He started calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey said Mike Miller admitted having met at least once
with Andy Miller _ at a basketball game at Rutgers University last
December _ and that the agent had offered the player tickets to a
professional basketball game the next night in Orlando between the
Magic and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who feature Kevin Garnett,
Andy Miller's biggest client. Mike Miller told the school officials
that he declined the offer, sparing himself a violation of NCAA
rules against players' receiving extra benefits.
</P>
<P>
   McCloskey said he called Andy Miller Wednesday after talking to
Mike Miller and explained to him the Florida statute saying agents
must be licensed by the state. According to McCloskey, Andy Miller
said he was unaware of the statute, which was enacted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association Players Association, which
regulates agents, gives a synopsis of every state's requirements to
agents, according to Ron Klempner, an attorney for the players'
association. There are 361 athlete agents registered in Florida,
according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   If the State Attorney's office determines that Miller violated
the law, it could charge him with a third-degree felony, according
to Jerry Wilson, a supervisor in the bureau of investigations of
Florida's Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which
oversees agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlicensed activity is a felony and we basically get him to
stop,'' Wilson said. ``If we have good information, let's say we
have the diary, if we have good hard evidence, we'll ask him to
stop. That's the least of his problems. The felony is an extremely
serious charge. We'll write a report and turn it over to the State
Attorney and he'll be charged.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Tennessee officials, informed that several
Volunteer players' names appeared in Miller's diary and phone
records, said Wednesday that they had no record of Miller's seeking
permission to contact those players, most notably Harris. Harris
told Malcolm McInnis, the university's associate athletic director,
that Miller began calling him last year and that the two talked as
recently as midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the conversation was general, the kinds of
things one might say if we were attempting to establish a
relationship,'' McInnis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said he would probably turn the information over to the
state's Division of Elections, a section of which oversees agent
activity. According to Donnie Jones, an administrative assistant in
the sports agents permits department of Tennessee's Division of
Elections, activity by an unregistered agent is a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Renfro, a spokesman for the NCAA, said neither Miller nor
Harris violated rules so long as there was no written or oral
agreement and no extra benefit was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indicative of how deep some agents will go to compromise
a student-athlete,'' Renfro said. ``I hope this is a lesson for
student-athletes that they need to be aware of the contacts they
make innocently and how it could affect their career.''
</P>
<P>
   The records show that Andy Miller attempted to reach at least 24
players from at least 17 teams that were in this year's NCAA
tournament, including Cincinnati, North Carolina and Michigan
State. Along with Mike Miller and Harris, he also placed many
telephone calls to Seton Hall point guard Shaheen Holloway and
Indiana's A.J. Guyton.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Miller has been linked to the former St. John's point guard
Erick Barkley. Barkley brought Miller to a meeting last week with
Coach Mike Jarvis shortly before Barkley declared that he would
enter the National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   In Miller's day planner on Dec. 17, he makes a notation:
``Barkley _ meeting with Bearup in January.'' He was referring to
an Atlanta-based financial adviser, Bret Bearup.
</P>
<P>
   Bearup, who represents a number of NBA players, including Elton
Brand of the Chicago Bulls, said he spoke with Barkley at Miller's
request in late January or early February. Bearup, who talks
frequently to Miller, according to Miller's phone records, said
Barkley made it clear to him that he was turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   Bearup said Wednesday that Miller was Barkley's agent, although
Barkley has not announced that. Bearup said an employee of his at
ProTrust Capital had arranged a $50,000 line of credit earlier this
week for Barkley to draw on until he begins earning an NBA salary.

   One of the allegations in Fleisher's lawsuit, filed in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan, was that Miller lured away
Fleisher's clients with promises of ``romantic liaisons'' with
unnamed Wilhelmina supermodels.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents obtained by The New York Times, Miller
sent a faxed letter to Thomas LaVilla, an outside consultant for
Wilhelmina, from the Assist Sports Management office on June 10,
1998. After initial pleasantries, the letter reads: ``Kevin Garnett
has a crush on a young black model who was recently seen on a
L'Oreal television campaign. Do you have any thoughts on this
matter. Let me know. Best regards, Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVilla responded the same day with a letter that read in part:
``Andy, attached please find Kevin's new girlfriends. We will be
getting back to you on the particulars. If he likes one _ just give
me a call. Best regards _ Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gord Esch, the owner of Wilhelmina models, said recently he
thought the letters were a joke. ``Using these letters to get
publicity for a lawsuit, dragging Wilhelmina into this, is just
absurd,'' Esch said.

FORT WORTH'S 911 STAFF FIELDS 1,600 CALLS IN 4 HOURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The calls came rapidly: the panicked
19-year-old with an apartment full of children; the calm woman atop
a hill as a tornado churned toward town; a breathless department
store security guard reporting that a man was dead.
</P>
<P>
   As a deadly twister snaked its way across west Fort Worth and
into downtown Tuesday night, the 911 calls tracked its progress and
its deadly touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just scared, because we think a tornado's coming,'' a
frantic 19-year-old woman cried into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, well ma'am, just go, try to reach safety somewhere. Go
where it's safe,'' call-taker P. Guillory told the teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where? We don't know where,'' the young woman said, as
children began screaming and crying in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Guillory repeatedly told the woman to move everyone into a
closet. Then the screams rose in pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scared. It's coming! The tornado is coming!'' the teen
said.
</P>
<P>
   After securing a promise from Guillory that she would call back,
the young woman hung up the phone to take the children to the
closet.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was one of the nearly 1,600 fielded by Fort Worth's
911 call takers between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Tuesday. The tornado
touched down shortly before 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Others callers were calmer, describing the tornado above
Rockwood Drive heading east toward downtown Fort Worth or reporting
that their office building had been hit by the tornado and was
encircled by shattered glass and live power lines.
</P>
<P>
   An employee inside the Montgomery Ward store called to say that
about 100 people were in the store when the twister struck it and
churned toward the Cash America building across the river.
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard a child crying in the darkness but was
unaware of any injuries. But a call from a store security officer
four minutes later brought blunt bad news from another part of the
property.

   ``There's at least one dead,'' the man told call-taker C. Burt.
On a static-filled cell phone, he said the man was dead in the
distribution area. The victim was later identified as Howard
Thornton, 52, of Arlington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he knew of anyone else injured, the security guard
said he was unable to get into the main building because of downed
power lines and a broken water main.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a confirmed hit,'' Burt said.

TORNADO DISPLACES ELDERLY, DISABLED RESIDENTS

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Elizabeth Hester sat at the edge of a cot
and sipped orange juice from a paper cup at the Will Rogers
Memorial Center.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the center is home to the 76-year-old woman, who has no
family to take her in. Nearly 195 senior and disabled residents
were displaced from the Hunter Plaza Apartments downtown after a
tornado shattered windows on the building's west side Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Transportation Authority shuttled the residents
to Will Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard glass. It was flying,'' Hester said. ``I went up under
the table'' and then hid in a bathroom. When it settled, she said:
``I was shaking so bad. ... I thought I was going to have a heart
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chisholm Trail Chapter of the American Red Cross provided
cots, food, medical care and counseling to 105 residents. An
additional 89 were unaccounted for Wednesday afternoon, said Gloria
Owens, assistant executive director for the Fort Worth Housing
Authority, which owns Hunter Plaza. They may have gone home with
relatives or gone to local hospitals, housing workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth fire officials evacuated residents about two hours
after tornado winds heavily damaged the 11-story building at 200
Burnett St. At least one tenant had cuts on her hand, said Lt. Kent
Worley, a Fire Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the residents left with only a few personal belongings,
which they stuffed into grocery sacks and tote bags. Firefighters
tried to retrieve medications, checkbooks and other items at
Wednesday at Hunter Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents rely on wheelchairs, motorized scooters or
walkers. At least two people use oxygen machines. Some were still
wearing their pajamas Wednesday night, although few said they were
able to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses and outreach workers from the Red Cross, the Fort Worth
Public Health Department and Mental Health Mental Retardation of
Tarrant County provided counseling and medical attention, such as
monitoring blood pressure and filling prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man said he saw his medications fly out the window,'' said
Ajay Amin, an outreach worker for the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents appeared irritable, confused or sad. One man was
concerned that food he had just purchased would spoil in his
refrigerator because the electricity at Hunter Plaza was cut off.
Others appeared more at ease as they ate snacks, chatted or curled
up on floor mats. A few kept a lookout for relatives to take them
in.
</P>
<P>
   It could be more than a month before residents can return to
Hunter Plaza, workers said. Owens said the housing authority will
cover the cost of temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find shelter at Westchester Plaza, an assisted-living
facility that caters primarily to seniors at 554 S. Summit St. It
has opened 60 apartments to help as many people as possible, said
Carl Ballew, executive director of Westchester Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can stay as long as necessary,'' Ballew said. ``This is
something we have to do, because it's what God tells us to do. Help
others.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Tyrone Nesby, who put the ``lip'' in Los Angeles
Clippers, has not talked himself into a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   For sassing interim coach Jim Todd late in the first half of
Tuesday's loss to Dallas, Nesby's penance was a seat on the bench
for the rest of that game. He's expected to be in action tonight
when the Clips take on Milwaukee at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is status quo,'' said Todd, whose displeasure with
the second-year small forward included a tribute to friend and
ex-teammate Troy Hudson written on Nesby's sneaker. After the point
guard was waived Monday, Nesby blamed the transaction on a personal
problem between Todd and Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said the decision on Hudson was strictly a basketball
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in the heat of battle, tempers flair, but
everything's cool,'' Todd said, referring to Tuesday's situation
that reached a boiling point when Nesby snapped back at the coach,
who had reprimanded him for not hustling back on defense. ``We're
going forth ... Nez will play.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily promote joy in Clipperville, where
Nesbygate was only one dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor (ankle sprain) and Lamar Odom (calf strain) are
listed as goners for the Milwaukee game. This will be Taylor's
sixth absence in a row, while Odom is expected to be out for the
fifth time in seven games due to pain in both calves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make much sense for me to come back before I'm
completely healthy,'' Odom said. ``If I do that, I could get hurt
worse and miss a lot more time.'' &QL;

   ADASIYE, Lebanon _ When Lt. Col. Robin Abboud looks down from
his home high in the rugged hills of southern Lebanon, the view is
of Israel. Less than 500 yards away lies the border fence topped
with electrified barbed wire, and beyond it a military road flanked
by minefields that snakes steeply uphill to an Israeli army post
bristling with radars and lookout towers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israel that the 42-year-old Lebanese colonel sees most
plainly is the Israel that lies beyond the bands of steel _ the
Israel represented, a few miles down a lush valley visible from his
veranda, by the town of Qiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of neat green fields, gleaming apartment blocks and
tidy industrial zones, the town looks like a poster for all that
Israel has carved out of these stony biblical lands during the last
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare the history of Israel and the Arabs, of Judaism and
Islam, if you will,'' Abboud said over Arab pastries and thimble
cups of thick Turkish coffee in his living room. ``The Arab past
has been a history of deception, of rivalry and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at the Jews _ how they decided, after the Holocaust,
to establish Israel, to commit themselves to each other and to
create the only real democracy in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the vision makes for a stark contrast with Lebanon,
where progress has been confounded by years of religious and ethnic
enmity and a civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990. Lately,
though, Abboud's view has been tinged with melancholy and even
fear.
</P>
<P>
   For Abboud, the colonel, an Arab and a Shiite Muslim, is also _
in the eyes of a Lebanese military court _ a traitor, sentenced in
absentia to life imprisonment at hard labor for having served more
than two decades in a militia force allied to Israel in its
military presence in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Now Israel is preparing to leave, and as a member of the South
Lebanon Army, or SLA _ , a 3,000-member militia of Lebanese
Muslims, Christians and Druse _ Abboud is more than ever a marked
man.
</P>
<P>
   The critical moment came this month when the Israeli cabinet
endorsed a campaign pledge made last year by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to withdraw the 1,500-soldier Israeli contingent back into
Israel by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, from the SLA militia's viewpoint, the Israeli
cabinet decided to complete the pullout with or without an
agreement with Lebanon and Syria. The Syrians effectively control
most of Lebanon through the 35,000 troops they maintain beyond the
military buffer zone that Israel controls within nine miles of its
border.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The territory Israel is vacating has become a curious hybrid, a
place where the resentments that its presence engenders have been
offset by advantages: superior roads and other public services,
like water and power, stores richly stocked with foreign goods
imported duty free through Israel, and _ at least for SLA officers
and their families _ prosperity unrivaled elsewhere in rural
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also an elusive sense of lifelessness and a lack of
authenticity, as if this were no more than a stage set, to be
dismantled when the players move on.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the villages are half-deserted, abandoned by residents
who long since migrated north to other parts of Lebanon or abroad.
In shops and cafes, people not working for the Israelis or their
Lebanese allies shy away when approached by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hills and valleys held by the Israelis, flanked by the
Mediterranean to the west and the snowy peaks of Mount Hermon to
the east, have been marked by the ebb and flow of conquest for
thousands of years. The Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans, the
Ottoman Turks, the British and the French all left their traces
before being driven out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 22 years, the retreating power is Israel, and the
repercussions for the South Lebanon Army are profound.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement among Israel, Syria and Lebanon setting
terms for the withdrawal, the men of the militia force, and
possibly even the 5,000 other residents of the buffer zone who work
in Israel _ in total, counting families, about a quarter of the
120,000 residents of the zone _ appear to be prime targets for
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary members of the militia, many little more than
conscripts, Lebanese officials have said the punishment will be
prison terms _ probably of a year, possibly two or three _ but the
outlook for the force's 350 officers is grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   A small flicker of hope remains in the possibility of a peace
agreement between Israel and Syria before the July withdrawal date,
which would enable Israel to negotiate the terms for withdrawal
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Israeli-Syrian peace talks deadlocked, President
Emile Lahoud of Lebanon has ruled out talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, SLA officers say that with the Israeli deadline
near at hand, too little time may be left for negotiations.
Anxieties have been heightened by warnings from the leaders of
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, the Shiite Muslim militant group
backed by Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the Muslim cleric who leads Hezbollah,
has described the South Lebanon Army's soldiers as ``criminal
collaborators who must be tried for treason,'' and has warned
Western countries inclined to offer the militiamen refuge that
they, too, should expect to ``treated as enemies'' by Hezbollah.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, pledges of lenient treatment for defectors that
Hezbollah held out several years ago have been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent speculation in Israel that militia members
may have tried to curry favor with Hezbollah by tipping its
guerrillas about Israeli military movements _ thus resulting in a
wave of casualties suffered by Israeli forces earlier this year _
Hezbollah leaders say it is ``too late now'' for the militiamen to
switch sides in hope of being spared.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 30 a Hezbollah bomb assassinated the SLA's top field
commander, Col. Akl Hashem, as he walked his dog in his village
near here. For Hezbollah the attack was second only to its most
startling operational success, the roadside bomb in February 1999
that killed Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, the 36-year-old Israeli
officer who was the main liaison to the militia. He was the
highest-ranking Israeli soldier to die since Israel declared the
border area its ``security zone'' in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Hezbollah has shown its ability to infiltrate
deep into the occupied zone and pick off militia members at will.
</P>
<P>
   It announced in early March that it had carried out a ``death
sentence'' against a corporal in the militia's security branch. The
man, a Shiite Muslim, was saying goodbye to his wife and children
after breakfast at his home in the village of Markabe, two miles
south of Colonel Abboud's home in Adasiye, when a Hezbollah hit man
shot him in the head with a silenced pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has prompted scores of defections from the militia
and prompted discussions within the Israeli high command about an
accelerated withdrawal if the Lebanese force begins to
disintegrate. The militia maintains many of the 90 hillside forts
that are the backbone of the Israeli zone, and undertake risky road
patrols and door-to-door searches. Its scouts are stationed in
every Israeli post.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Israel seems to have decided there is no future
for the militia inside Lebanon, but it is against providing refuge
in Israel. Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said
that ``bringing the members of the South Lebanon Army and their
families to Israel and transforming them into refugees is not a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to a report in Yediot Ahronot, an Israeli
newspaper, Israel has identified 200 senior officers who with their
families will be accepted as refugees elsewhere, most likely in the
United States, Canada, France and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also said to be preparing an indemnity fund. Israeli
newspapers have suggested that it will involve an average severance
payout of $30,000, with a maximum, for senior officers, of $175,000
_ apparently to be paid out of the $74 million that Prime Minister
Barak has set as the cost of a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats have said Israel has been told that there is no
possibility that the money will come from increased U.S. subsidies
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is much solace to men like Abboud. Like all SLA
men, the colonel wears an olive green Israeli army uniform, with
the Hebrew acronym for ``Israeli Defense Forces'' above his left
breastpocket.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Israeli military colleges with distinction.
And last year his 15-year-old daughter, Zeinab, was saved by
Israeli doctors who performed a double heart valve replacement
operation at Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva
outside Tel Aviv, with Israel absorbing the $80,000 cost.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel can barely disguise his sense of abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Of his Israeli military counterparts, Abboud had only praise,
saying, ``We have shed blood together, and that is the strongest of
all bonds.'' But for Israeli politicians, the colonel had a barely
disguised contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth means nothing in politics,'' he said. ``You have only to
compare what Benjamin Netanyahu was saying only two years ago with
what Barak is saying now to see that. In politics, there is no
principle, only self-interest, whether it be individuals or
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Shiite Muslim, Abboud has particular reason for concern.
For the moment he is rejecting emigration with his wife and eight
children _ he has a sister in Canada _ but staying in Lebanon is
clearly not an option.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, at the house of another SLA officer, a visit
to the washroom led past a kitchen where fitted appliances had been
pulled from the walls. In the next room, a mass of personal
belongings, including furniture and exercise equipment, had been
stacked, apparently for packing.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the prospect of being driven from their homeland,
possibly for ever, the SLA officers, many of whom were low-ranking
corporals and sergeants in the Lebanese army before the Israeli
occupation, stand to lose luxuries accumulated over the years of
Israeli occupation _late-model BMWs and Mercedes-Benz, sumptuous
homes with pink granite facings, marbled floors and copies of
18th-century French court furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents of the occupation zone said that Israeli
military commanders had turned a blind eye for years to corruption
and criminality among high-ranking SLA men. These practices are
said to have included drug-trafficking, protection rackets,
skimming of tax revenues, and vehicle-theft rings.
</P>
<P>
   But if the good life they have led suggests that SLA officers
made a Faustian deal in siding with Israel, the reality seems more
complex. As these men tell the militia's story, it grew from a
desire among people in southern Lebanon to protect themselves
against armed Palestinians who, in the 1970s, became a law unto
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel invaded in 1978 to halt Palestinian attacks across
the border, many Lebanese flocked to throw flowers on Israeli tanks
_ while others, now SLA veterans, say they took up arms alongside
the invaders as the only force that seemed capable of bringing
order.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the Palestinians were routed, matters became more
complicated still. Since the mid-1980s, Hezbollah has cast itself
in the role of a ``national resistance force.'' Then, in the 1990s,
Lebanese nationalism was rekindled from the rubble of the civil
war, when the country disintegrated into a mosaic of armed
fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the SLA was isolated. Abboud, looking back,
tells the story in a wistful tone. ``Things just developed,'' he
said, ``in ways none of us could have foreseen.''

CUBAN FATHER IS READY TO RECLAIM CUSTODY OF SON, CASTRO SAYS

<P>
   MIAMI _ As the relatives of Elian Gonzalez continued to defy
immigration officials, and politicians here seemed to side with
them against the federal government, President Fidel Castro of Cuba
announced Wednesday night that the boy's father was preparing to
come to the United States to reclaim him.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Cuban television, Castro said Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez ``is ready to immediately'' go to Florida with a
large group of relatives if the U.S. government committed itself to
turning the boy over to him.
</P>
<P>
   But adding to the confusion of the day, a State Department
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Elian's
father had not yet asked for a visa. The official also
characterized Castro's speech as ``odd.''
</P>
<P>
   While immigration officials had expected the father to make a
visa request and to come to the United States to pick up his son if
the courts found in his favor, the official said, ``the rest of
this caught us by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban president's remarks came after warnings from local
authorities in South Florida that Miami could erupt in violence if
federal agents tried to forcibly take the boy from his
great-uncle's house in Little Havana and send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our respective resources, whether they be in
the form of police officers or any other resources, to assist the
federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately
repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said Alex Penelas, mayor of
Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle
and temporary guardian, still had not signed an agreement to hand
the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives lose
a fight to keep him when the case is heard in May in the 11th U.S.
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't cooperate in anything,'' Gonzalez told a
Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house,
and they'll have to go find him there.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure built in this city, the home of a large number of
Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service said they did not plan to remove Elian on Thursday morning
even if his Miami relatives continued to defy them. But an INS
spokeswoman said the agency would revoke Elian's permission to stay
in the United States, clearing the way for his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments in Havana, Castro said that Elian's father would
be accompanied by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's
former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the perfect formula for reinserting Elian,'' Castro
said. He also said that the group would be willing to wait as long
as it takes to bring the boy back.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interest Section in
Washington, said Cuban officials and State Department officials
will meet Thursday morning to discuss arrangements for such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   While immigration officials had expected the father to make a
visa request and to come to the United States to pick up his son if
the courts found in his favor, the State Department official said,
``the rest of this caught us by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asked by phone
Wednesday night whether the State Department had given Elian's
father any assurances of official help in reclaiming his son, said,
``I'm not going to answer any questions on Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Castro's announcement, a Justice Department
spokesman said, ``Certainly it changes things. How it changes
things is a little hard to say at this point. If the father shows
up in Miami and decides to go and ring the doorbell of his
relatives and find his son, well the family in Miami is on record
as saying they would turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually
do this remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Craig, a lawyer for Elian's father, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been clear that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would come
to the United States if he were assured that by coming he could
take custody of his son. I think all that has happened tonight is
that the president of Cuba has said that there is no Cuban
government impediment to him coming and remaining here as long as
it takes to exhaust the appeals, if by coming he can take custody
of Elian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel will come here, his absence is not an issue, he
will come here to the U.S., if by coming he is given custody of
Elian.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there are two other players in that. The
relatives in Miami have said they won't release Elian. And the INS
and the government of the United States have not said, `Yes, that
if you come, we will arrange for you to have Elian's custody.'
Those two hurdles have not yet been overcome. The conversations
that are going on right now in Miami hold the key.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials were apparently unable to reach an
agreement with Gonzalez on Wednesday night, saying that they would
reconvene Thursday at 9 a.m. Earlier, immigration officials had
said they would officially begin arranging Elian's trip back to
Cuba if there had been no agreement by 9 a.m. on Thursday. They
have now extended the deadline for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, where many people see the return of the boy to
Cuba as delivering him to the hated Fidel Castro and communism more
than as returning a 6-year-old boy to his father, mayors and other
elected officials held a news conference to show solidarity not
with the federal government but with the family here. Their message
was that if federal officials want to take Elian away in what
threatens to be a violent confrontation with demonstrators, they
are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the responsibility of the Miami Police Department to
snatch Elian Gonzalez from his Miami family and be sent back to a
communist regime,'' said Joe Carollo, the mayor of Miami. ``Local
police should not be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, the mayor Miami-Dade County, said, ``If their continued
provocation, in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy's
parole, leads to civil unrest and violence, we are holding the
federal government responsible and, specifically, Janet Reno and
the president of the United States.''

   Immigration experts said the mayors' comments were frightening,
and amounted to what seemed to be defiance of a federal agency
while presenting the possibility of a breakdown of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disturbing,'' said Max Castro, a senior research
associate for the Dante B. Fascell North-South Center of the
University of Miami, and an expert on Cuban issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If federal officers backed by Janet Reno and federal court
attempt to carry out a lawful order, the local authorities will not
intervene?'' asked Castro. ``It borders on the irresponsible. It's
a defiance of legal authority. It almost gives people more
encouragement'' to defy federal agents when they arrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials called the comments troubling.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not respond with strong language to the
mayors' decision to side with the family, saying that ``whatever
the law is, whatever the decision that is ultimately made, the rest
of us ought to obey it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the mayors' comments had circulated on news wires and
television, Penelas said he did not mean to say that the police
here would not enforce the law if illegal demonstrations take
place.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration experts said the city's politicians are trying
to have it both ways, and wondered what would happen if an illegal
demonstration broke out at the house or some other location between
federal officials and people who want to keep Elian here.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said the police would ``keep public order.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, that might not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are provoking this community to an extent that I nor
anyone else can control,'' said Penelas, of the government's
handling of the case. ``If blood is shed on the streets,'' he said,
``yes, I will hold them responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day that brought many surprises in the Elian story, Mayor
Carollo of Miami said he had information that federal officials
were mobilizing in South Florida to take the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 48 hours the federal government has had federal
agents in the area of the old Homestead Air Force Base,'' he said.
``There were federal agents scouting and observing the area to see
what would be the best way of bringing the father in and taking
Elian out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not deny that this is being considered,'' he said of
his discussions with federal officials. ``I am strongly advising
that this not be done. This is not going to be in the best interest
of our government of Miami and against the best interests of Elian
Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had spoken with Jeffrey Weiss, director of the asylum
division and international affairs for the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that he knew of no plan by the Defense Department
to provide facilities for a reunion of Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans make up almost 800,000 of Miami-Dade
County's 2.1 million people. As Elian's Miami relatives continued
to negotiate with federal officials, leaders in the exile community
practiced ways to prevent the boy's repatriation. Some drilled in
the street, linking arms and marching to a cadence called by their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, demonstrators formed a human cross on
Southwest Eighth Street, holding candles and flashlights aloft. The
police blocked off traffic for them.

TAG-TEAM TELEVISION: NBC JOINS XFL VENTURE

(DW) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation's proposed smash-mouth eight-team
football league called the XFL received a mammoth injection of
credibility Wednesday when NBC Sports announced that it was a 50
percent partner in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision to join the league, and carry games in prime time
on Saturdays from February to April, signals its avid desire to
reach male viewers 12 to 24 years old, whom the WWF attracts in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vince McMahon, we believe we're getting the best promoter
to that audience,'' Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said
in reference to the federation's chairman during a news conference
at the WWF's Midtown restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The federation's ``Raw Is War'' series on the USA cable network
outdrew ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' in 1999 among males 12 to
24 by 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes NBC's purchase of $30 million in shares of a
new class of World Wrestling Federation Entertainment stock. The
venture expects to spend close to $100 million before it makes a
profit in its third season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's partnership with the XFL creates risk for the network
because of the WWF's often crude, tasteless programming, featuring
unflattering and stereotypical portrayals of women and
African-Americans. A pimp character, the Godfather, is preceded
into the ring by bikini-clad women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In response to the suitability of an octogenarian ``pregnant''
female wrestler being body-slammed by the brawny Kurt Angle,
McMahon asked, ``Where's your sense of humor?''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said, ``In my viewing of Vince's programs, I wouldn't
classify anything as vulgar.'' But he acknowledged that some parts
of the USA program or ``WWF Smackdown'' on UPN are inappropriate
for his 13-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``NBC is a pretty forward-thinking network. It gave us
`Saturday Night Live' and `Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the host of ``Saturday Night Live'' was the Rock,
the popular wrestling star and best-selling author. It produced the
show's highest rating in two years and its strongest male
demographics in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday nights, we need to reinvent what's on,'' said
Scott Sassa, the president of NBC West Coast. ``We need a big event
to get people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, NBC and the WWF think the XFL's blend of
``extreme fun,'' capitalizing on the end of the National Football
League season, is the type of programming craved by young men
weaned on scripted pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL will be played without a fair-catch rule, require
receivers to keep only one foot inbounds on passes, institute a
35-second play clock, limit halftime to 10 minutes and bring back
the bump-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   Players, coaches, locker rooms and huddles will be wired for
sound, and cameras will be in locker rooms, on sidelines and inside
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth of America hasn't seen the type of football we're
going to present,'' McMahon said. ``A generation of fans haven't
seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said NBC's presence ``puts up a modicum of a firewall''
against the WWF's storied excesses creeping into the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   Although McMahon says the games will be legitimate _ just more
fun, unlike the stodgy old NFL, he contends _ he is reticent about
detailing the participation of star wrestlers in marketing or the
use of scripted shtick before and after games, or at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Rock won't be going out for a long pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the XFL wonder whether there are enough credible
players to field eight teams, whether there is enough fan interest
to fill stadiums like RFK Stadium in Washington, and whether the
WWF can transfer to football the magic touch it possesses in
television, publishing, music and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Pilson, a sports industry consultant and former president
of CBS Sports, said: ``The issue for me is whether the promotion
power of NBC and the WWF can create demand. Right now, there is
little demand or interest in a winter-spring outdoor professional
football league.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The tricky part is, whereas you can choreograph
wrestling, you can't do it with football. And bad football is bad
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Igiel, president for the broadcast division of the Media
Edge, a unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam, said: ``Of all the things we don't
need is more football. I don't care what McMahon has to do with it.
It may be an interesting experiment to observe, or McMahon will
make it a travesty that won't be pretty to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The XFL follows in the failed cleats of the U.S. Football League
and the World Football League. The World League of American
Football, created in 1991 by the NFL, nearly folded before being
recreated as NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of future Kurt Warners, the former NFL Europe
and Arena Football League quarterback who led the St. Louis Rams to
a Super Bowl victory this year, gives psychic sustenance to the
XFL's partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you consider how many play Division I college football,
and only 250 are drafted,'' Ebersol said. ``The brand of football
will depend on the openness of the rules and the desire of the
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The close McMahon-Ebersol connection goes back to the mid-1980s,
when Ebersol produced a wrestling show on NBC that helped make the
television executive wealthy.  &QL;

CORPS OF ENGINEERS WILL RETHINK MISSOURI RIVER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has put the
brakes on its new plan to control flows from Missouri River dams _
in the name of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The corps' plan, which was announced early this year, had been
hailed as a historic consensus among states in the Missouri River
basin. The corps has struggled for a decade to revise its river
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however, now says the corps'
new plan does too little to help restore threatened fish and birds
along the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   So the corps has agreed to shelve the plan, at least for 90
days, and to enter into a formal process under the federal
Endangered Species Act in a new effort to restore those species.
</P>
<P>
   This news troubled downstream river users Wednesday, including
farmers, the barge industry in Missouri and a coalition of states
along the Missouri that had helped broker the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible,'' said John Madgett, senior vice president
of Mid-West Terminal Warehouse Co., the largest river terminal in
the Kansas City reach of the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to mess up farmers, and it's going to mess us
up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to halt the corps' revision of the so-called Master
Manual, the document by which the river's flows are managed, is
tantamount to eliminating navigation on the lower river, Madgett
said.
</P>
<P>
   That would impose a huge economic cost on farmers, industry and
consumers, one much greater than the loss of a fish that once
roamed the river, Madgett said.
</P>
<P>
   If the endangered-species advocates ``had been around when the
dinosaurs were here,'' Madgett said, ``we'd all be eaten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Madgett was referring to American Rivers, a national river
conservation group that has worked diligently behind the scenes to
support the Fish and Wildlife Service and restore the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has listed as endangered three species on
the Missouri: the pallid sturgeon; the interior least tern; and the
piping plover. The sturgeon population, in particular, is in
danger, wildlife officials say.
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers will file, as early as Thursday, a legally
required notice that it intends to sue the corps for failing to
protect endangered species, said Chad Smith, the group's regional
representative.
</P>
<P>
   The corps deserves praise for deciding to halt its revision of
the Master Manual process, Smith said. ``It's a positive step,'' he
said. ``I applaud the fact that the corps has the guts to say they
feel like they made a bad decision with the initial preferred
alternative and they need to think about it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added that the formal consultation on the Missouri River's
current operation should have occurred years ago. The service had
indicated that the river's operation, as early as 1990, placed
endangered species in jeopardy. But it had never pushed for a
formal consultation process under the federal Endangered Species
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The key problem, according to the service, has been the corps'
leveling of flows, eliminating spring high water and supplementing
reduced natural flows each summer. But proposals for increasing
flows in spring or allowing the river to dwindle in summer have
angered downstream users because they fear it could flood cropland
during planting season or halt barge traffic in summer.
</P>
<P>
   By law that consultative process can last as long as 90 days. At
its conclusion the service will produce a ``biological opinion''
that will detail the threats to endangered species from the corps'
operations of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the corps will take to heart what the Fish and
Wildlife Service says and make that part of its new
recommendation,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Johnston, a corps spokesman in Omaha, Neb., confirmed
Wednesday that the corps planned to announce this week that it
would delay its process of revising the Master Manual and enter
into consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said Brig. Gen. Carl Strock, commander of the corps'
Northwestern Division, had decided that he wanted a plan for the
river's operation that would not result in the Fish and Wildlife
Service's saying it jeopardized endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the indications are that the current water control
plan does not contain all the elements that would preclude a
`jeopardy opinion,' &UR; '' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting those flaws may conflict with other legal
requirements, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Congress has precluded the corps from instituting
higher flows in spring.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, federal law requires the corps to maintain
navigation on the lower river, except during extreme drought. So it
is unclear whether altering or shortening the current season _ now
April to December _ would be legal.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, Johnston said, is that the corps' plan, announced
in January, will be back on the shelf. ``Any alternative will be
reviewed in light of what comes out of this consultation'' with the
service, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The corps' decision also perturbed Richard Opper, executive
director of the Missouri River Basin Association, which includes
Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the association won a near consensus _ Missouri being
the lone dissenter _ on how the corps should operate the Missouri's
dams. In turn the corps adopted the basin association's
recommendation as its ``preferred alternative,'' its choice for the
river's future operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service sat in on those discussions, Opper
said, and he wishes those representatives had expressed these
concerns as forcefully earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some anger over this,'' Opper added. ``There
already is. But that's because people care passionately about this
river....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do our best to find a way out of this.''

SANTA FE TRAIL ENTHUSIAST FEARS FOR TRAIL SWALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was a bit like deja vu for Walter Cook, a
Santa Fe Trail enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the din of bulldozers lured the southeast Kansas
City man into his back yard where he saw the hulking machines
clawing away at trail swales _ long depressions that resemble ruts
in the landscape, left by wagon trains traveling through the area
more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, when Cook heard the bulldozers roaring in back of
his home, he knew exactly what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Cook contends that the landowner, Blue Ridge Bible Church, is
destroying the last of a Santa Fe Trail swale _ an estimated 55
feet long _ east of Manchester Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Cook protested when the Blue Ridge Bible Church
developed an adjacent plot containing a 120-foot swale to build a
soccer field for its Blue Ridge Christian School at 8524 Blue Ridge
Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   Now the church plans to use the land currently under development
to expand the soccer field to include a track, said William Ross,
the church's pastor.
</P>
<P>
   The digging started Monday but was temporarily halted Wednesday
when the Kansas City Public Works Department learned the church did
not have all the necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Swenson, project manager for the Public Works
Department's engineering section, said the church had not secured a
land disturbance permit. But Swenson said once that hurdle is
cleared early next week, the church could resume digging.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is none too pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it a neighborhood landmark, but it is a historical
landmark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross said that as far as he knows, the area has not been
declared a national historic site. He declined to comment on
whether he considered the depressions to be trail swales. He would
say only that there has been great debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't agree that this is a swale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the authenticity of some trail swales has become a
greatly contested issue among trail historians.
</P>
<P>
   The routes used by early pioneers through the Kansas City area
changed a lot between the 1820s and 1850s, said John Mark
Lambertson, director of the National Frontier Trails Center in
Independence. The resulting trails and swales have led to a lot of
confusion and controversy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has taken up the leadership of trying to identify and
document these swales and put them in some kind of protected
status,'' Lambertson said. ``So unfortunately, all the controversy
has muddied the waters of preservation, of preserving what little
remains of the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of trail swales remain, he said. They include
those in Harmon Park in Prairie Village, Kan., Minor Park in south
Kansas City, and swales discovered last year in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Ross added that swales still exist on the west side of
Manchester Avenue near 85th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook is not encouraged by what remains. He said he is more
concerned about what is vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have a legal right to do so (develop the land),'' he
said. ``But from a moral and ethical standpoint, it is not the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say the bottom line is that it is their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are free to do with it what we wish so long as it is within
the limitations of what the city will allow us to do,'' Ross said.

TOM EVANS CHOSEN RANGERS' STARTER AT THIRD BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers' original plan was for third
baseman Mike Lamb to spend the season in Triple A. There was a
slight variation when Todd Zeile signed with the New York Mets. But
the plan is back in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers officially named Tom Evans as their starting third
baseman yesterday and told Lamb he will begin the season with the
Oklahoma Redhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make the ballclub,'' Lamb said. ``It's a
disappointment not to make it and be told you're not good enough at
this point in time. That doesn't mean a month from now, a year or
two, I won't be ready. I will be ready. The next opportunity will
be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates mulled over the situation almost every day
this spring and said a final decision wasn't made until yesterday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plan a year ago and at the bottom of my heart that's
the best way to go,'' Oates said. ``Lamb will start the year at
Triple A, get a full year and see how it goes. Maybe he won't need
a full year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Year at
Double-A Tulsa last year, hitting .324 with 21 homers and 100 runs
batted in. That led the Rangers to believe he could skip Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Evans got off to a hot start in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evans played very well for us,'' Oates said. ``He did
everything we asked him to do. He played good defense. This is the
right fit for our ballclub. We get the best of both worlds. We get
to see what Evans can do, and Lamb gets a chance to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans has been in Triple A for most of the past three seasons.
He hit .280 for Oklahoma last year with 12 home runs and 80 RBI. He
is batting .302 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for me,'' Evans said. ``Everyone in
the game wants to make it to this level and show what they can do.
I realize nothing is set in stone. That's the way I'm going to
approach it, doing my best to keep the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was once a top prospect for the Toronto Blue Jays, but a
series of injuries kept him from winning a regular spot. He has
just 48 major-league at-bats with a .229 average, one home run and
two RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, I need to play solid defense,'' Evans said.
``Johnny told me I would be hitting deep in the order. If you look
at the heart of the order, those are the guys who are going to put
up numbers. I don't consider myself an out, but anything I add to
that will be a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb finished this spring batting .280 and made five errors. He
will stay with the Rangers for their final three exhibition games
before being sent to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be an everyday big-league third baseman,'' Oates
said. ``He's going to have to work on his defense, but he's going
to hit when he's a big-league third baseman.'' nn

MAVERICKS OWNER-TO-BE CUBAN TURNS DOWN CHALLENGE FROM TURNER
ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That heated war of words between Mavericks owner-to-be Mark
Cuban and national reporter Peter Vecsey escalated late Tuesday
night when Vecsey issued a challenge to Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey said he wants to meet Cuban on a Turner Sports telecast
so the two can air their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey is an analyst for Turner Sports _ which carries NBA games
_ and a columnist for the ``New York Post.'' Vecsey recently
criticized Cuban for having a 10-man coaching staff. He also
criticized the Mavericks for their wild on-court celebration after
they came from 22 points down to defeat the San Antonio Spurs,
97-96, on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban took exception with Vecsey, telling the ``Star-Telegram:''
``You can quote me on this, Peter Vecsey is an idiot. I wanted to
do some research on Peter Vecsey's background, and I saw an
interview he did where he called himself a journalist. And if he's
a journalist, we're all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Vecsey's Turner Sports studio partners, Ernie
Johnson and Kenny Smith, kidded him about Cuban's remarks. Vecsey
responded by challenging Cuban to come on a telecast to debate the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Ore., with the Mavericks, Cuban said such a
challenge is a win-win situation for Vecsey.
</P>

of saying `yes' is that it's on his court.

   ``He controls the time. He can set it up so he gets five minutes
to ramble and I get 10 seconds. There's no chance in a situation

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said he understands plans change, but it doesn't make
the scenario that played out this spring any easier for him to
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   He had a renaissance defensive season at shortstop, but when
Eric Young was traded to the Chicago Cubs, it left a hole at second
and the Dodgers had no one in their system to patch it. So
Grudzielanek was asked to move to second base. Dodgers officials
told him they wanted Alex Cora to start at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with Cora in the minor leagues and 35-year-old Kevin
Elster slated to start opening day in Montreal, Grudzielanek can't
help but wonder what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it, no question,'' said Grudzielanek, who signed
a four-year , $18 million contract in the offseason. ``I want to
know what the hell they're doing. But what are you going to do? I'm
trying to push myself away from that. I'm just kind of curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird seeing what they said would happen not
even come close to happening, and having a couple guys fight over
there (for the spot) and picking up a couple of guys. It's strange,
and to move me over there and move me out of my spot for something
that was out of control and didn't happen, it was kind of
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   With Elster nothing more than a one-year plug-in at the
position, it fuels speculation about what's going to happen next
season. More than Cora being ready, it's perceived throughout the
industry the Dodgers will make a run at signing free agent-to-be
Alex Rodriguez in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   However, Grudzielanek, who said he might not have played his
last day at shortstop for the Dodgers, added that he was placing
all his energy on improving at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to worry about that over there,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``I'm trying to concentrate on my position, and what's next
for me is to start the season. I'm a second baseman, so that's how
it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's not just Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and the
front office who are glowing about the transition. Several scouts
who've watched the Dodgers for extended periods this spring said
Grudzielanek was impressive at second, considering the position
switch is in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because I've been out there so much in the middle
of the infield,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I've seen plays, what I
wouldn't do if I was playing over there. I tried to learn what to
do and how to do it correctly and more consistently. They turn
double plays differently or do this or that. There's a lot of
options and you have to try and do what's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing I have to do is on the ball to my left, I
have to make that play more consistently. I get caught sometimes
when I'm trying to turn too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Karros puts foot forward: The night's rest apparently did
wonders for Eric Karros' bruised left ankle. A day after putting a
scare into the Dodgers, Karros was at Dodgertown working out
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Karros would likely return either Friday or
Saturday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came in he was walking normally,'' Johnson said.
``There's nothing structurally wrong. I'll check with him (today),
but he's going out doing some tee work. That tells me all I need to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros was hurt when he fouled a pitch off his ankle Tuesday.
X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Dodgers survived another scare in the
bottom of the first Wednesday against Atlanta when Chipper Jones
lined a ball off pitcher Kevin Brown's left ankle. After a few
minutes talking to medical personnel behind the mound, Brown
continued to pitch until the fifth inning. He left after reaching
his pitch count (70) and, though he iced afterward, said he was
fine. Brown finished the Grapefruit League 3-0 with a 1.35 ERA. . .
. If the Dodgers carry 12 pitchers for the first week of the
season, it might not mean outfielder Geronimo Berroa's chance to
make the club is gone. The Dodgers' hope is they would need to
carry an extra pitcher for only a week, and the Dodgers could keep
Berroa, a nonroster invitee, off the roster a week into the season
before losing him. ``We have until the end of the first week of
April to see. That's part of the options we have,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. . . . The Dodgers optioned pitchers Eric
Gagne and Mike Judd and catcher Paul LoDuca to Triple-A
Albuquerque. . . . Johnson said the club would carry infielder Jeff
Branson through today before either releasing him or sending him to
the minors.

<P>
   Before she left for work last Thursday night, Cynthia Bernal
made sure there were bottles in the refrigerator for her
3-month-old son, Andrew, and food for 6-year-old Jacob and
1-year-old Matthew. She set out clothes for them to wear the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Cynthia did every night before leaving the home she'd
recently purchased in the West Valley and heading for her night
shift job at a post office station in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Vicki Fernandez, was staying with Cynthia and the
boys, helping out, but Cynthia made sure everything was in order
before she left for work. She and her husband, Edmund, had gone
through some difficult times, like a lot of couples, but Cynthia
wouldn't allow it to affect her life with the boys. Mostly because
her life ``was'' the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her world revolved around them completely,'' Vicki says of her
daughter. ``For her it was work and her sons. She didn't do other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Cynthia purchased a van, figuring it was the kind
of vehicle a young mother needed with three children. She was
saving for a trip to Disneyland, which she figured to take this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynthia was 19 when she had Jacob,'' her mother says. ``But
she started working right out of high school, and she has been with
the post office for five years. She believed in doing right for her
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The work day began for Cynthia at 10:45 p.m. The next morning,
she'd trade off with her mother, who'd leave for work as her
daughter arrived home. Last Thursday, knowing there was
construction on Interstate 10, Cynthia left the house earlier than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Safety investigators say that shortly after
10 p.m., near 51st Avenue, where freeway traffic was slowed by
roadwork, a car driven by 29-year-old Jacquline Nez plowed into the
back of Cynthia's van.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics revived her, but the injuries were too severe. Early
the next morning, as her boys slept in their beds, Cynthia's family
watched as she was removed from life support and died. She was 25.
</P>
<P>
   A trust fund for her sons has been set up in Cynthia Bernal's
name at Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Nez, suspected of driving under the influence, has
been charged with manslaughter and several counts of endangerment.
According to prosecutors, she faces up to 27 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a person do what this woman did?'' Vicki asks. ``Now,
the rest of us must make sure that Cynthia is remembered, and tell
her boys how special their mother was.''
</P>
<P>
   She thought local news outlets might do part of that job.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in the days since Cynthia's death, her family has
read several stories about another young woman, Emily Ell, who was
killed by a drunken driver. She died on her prom night last year,
and the driver, Richard Foley, recently received 20 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   It made all the papers and the TV news.
</P>
<P>
   And they read about the brother of the boxer Michael Carbajal,
Angel, who died in a bar fight that spilled out into a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It was in all the papers, too. And on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from an obituary, there has been nothing about Cynthia
Bernal. And today, as Vicki Fernandez buries her daughter, she
wonders if there has been a more important story reported recently
in ``The Arizona Republic,'' or any newspaper, than one involving
the tragic death of a loving mother who did nothing but work hard
and care for her boys.

FORD AND UAW TENTATIVELY AGREE TO CONTRACT AT CLAYCOMO PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers
union have tentatively agreed to a new contract covering the
Claycomo plant.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary agreement was reached earlier this week after a
round of talks that had continued through last weekend, said Jerry
Kline, president of UAW Local 249.
</P>
<P>
   Kline said the local agreement would be explained and voted on
by hourly Ford employees at 2 p.m. Sunday at Winnetonka High
School.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the local contract will supplement the national
agreement Ford reached with the UAW in September. The four-year
pact would expire in September 2003, Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   Kline declined to comment on specifics of the agreement until it
was discussed with the union's members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our major concerns were addressed in the
negotiations,'' he said. ``It's a good contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kline said several health and safety issues were in
dispute, including a proposal by the union for a new entrance for
commercial tractor-trailers supplying the plant.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,900 people would be covered by the agreement at the
Claycomo plant, which builds F-series pickups and is about to
launch a compact sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also was satisfied with the tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with the way things have proceeded,'' said Ed
Miller, a Ford spokesman.

ADVERTISING: TOUGH, BUT FUNNY TALK AS MADISON AVENUE TACKLES
DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A typical meeting of the Advertising Club of New York
usually doesn't begin with recitals from five urban slam poets,
proceed with a stand-up comedy routine and segue into frank,
sometimes raucous discussion of divisive issues facing the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a good reason for the most recent meeting, held on
Tuesday night, to be different from most others: The subject was
that most perplexing and problematic topic, diversity in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatively Incorrect'' was the provocative title of the
meeting, which drew almost 300 people to the Altman Building in the
Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea. The room was so crowded that
many stood for much of the two-hour program.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded, too, was the platform holding the speakers, eight in
all, who ranged from top agency executives to performers _ or is
that not really a range? Their points of view, however, certainly
ranged widely, from confrontational to diplomatic. When comments
generated heated outbursts, the tension was typically defused with
humorous asides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get away from the issue of institutional racism,''
said Anne Simmons, president at dRush, a joint venture of Deutsch
Inc. and Rush Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also need to do a better job of showing the dollars and
cents are there,'' she added, referring to the spending power of
minority consumers. ``Great ideas sell to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true, agreed Federico Traeger, vice president
and executive creative director at the Bravo Group, an agency owned
by Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. that focuses on Hispanic consumers,
particularly as more campaigns are created to appear around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But among general market agencies producing mainstream
campaigns, ``there's a little bit of a `conquistador' attitude as
they come up with ideas and then supply them to the
African-American, Hispanic and Asian-American agencies,'' he added.
``We have to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The moderator, Macio Parilla, a comedian who is also a
copywriter at the Uniworld Group, which specializes in ads aimed at
black consumers, suggested there were limits to how much work
clients will give ethnic agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate executive doesn't want to sit with his cigar
buddies and hear them say, `I see you have Negro.com Inc. as your
general agency.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Paik Goodhart, a Jewish Korean-American comedian, said
that ``it almost behooves agencies to take notice of diversity''
simply because ``America is changing, minute by minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Atsuko Watanabe, executive vice president and general manager of
Admerasia, an agency specializing in the Asian-American market,
echoed that, adding that Madison Avenue also should ``commit to
diversity'' because ``there are economic rewards to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Jamal Joseph, a writer and director who is a
former Black Panther, agreed with that perspective, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to be brave enough to talk in a climate where so
much money is being made about having a responsibility to do more
than just sell and make money,'' Joseph said, adding: ``No one
comes from the ad world to talk to kids to say, `You know, you can
be in advertising,' and tell them why it's exciting and
interesting. If you're serious, you'll reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can touch the drug dealer,'' Joseph said. ``They have to
be able to touch the doctor, the lawyer, the ad exec.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Berlin, chief executive at Berlin Cameron &AMP; Partners, a
general market agency with clients like Coca-Cola and General
Motors, said he feared that ``advertising lags behind'' society,
because ``clients feel pressure and agencies feel pressure even
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we react,'' he added. ``We tend to respond to
people who approach us rather than approaching anybody, whether
from Harvard or the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph disputed that perspective with these words: ``How willing
are people at agencies to challenge the thinking of clients who
say, `Let's not rock the boat'? Clients need to hear it's time to
get off the plantation, even if it's an electronic plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   Parilla, the moderator, kidded Berlin's being the sole white
male speaker by directing tough audience questions to him ``like
you're Mr. White Guy Know It All.''
</P>
<P>
   Parilla, who is black, said that when he goes to work he ``can't
wear a suit, because there are brothers in my neighborhood saying,
`You're going to beat that case.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a stand-up routine that tickled the audience, Parilla also
offered a list of ``10 things white people want in exchange for
addressing the diversity issue.'' The fanciful list included this
imaginary demand: ``We want to know how ethnic agencies create
advertising with the same budget we use for catering our
meetings.''

 ASPs AND ADDING CHARACTER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here and there, at work:
</P>
<P>
   One of the stiffest corporate dress codes in the world is
relaxing by a hair. After decades of a firm no-facial-hair policy,
Disney theme parks will allow employees _ presumably the male ones
_ to grow mustaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney empire carefully cultivates a clean-cut image.
Permission to be more hirsute wasn't granted lightly. Disney
summoned focus groups, polled guests and employees, and convened
meetings. Finally it accepted neatly trimmed, upper-lip hair.
</P>
<P>
   Bans remain on beards, multiple earrings, flagrant fingernails
and other makeup or hairstyles not considered Main Street enough
for patron approval. As it is, the change may be so innocuous that
few will notice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few employees may care. These days, young men's
preferences tend toward goatees or I-haven't-shaved-in-days beards,
not mustaches alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Disney marketing magic might make mousetaches all
the rage.
</P>
<P>
   - At any moment, when I glance up from my desk, I might see a
Baroque pianist, a Civil War re-enactor, a tenor or a master
quilter walk by. And they all work here.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing about co-workers' talents differentiates them from
others and makes conversational connections. It's a reminder that
any workplace is not a pack of automatons, but a collection of
individuals with personal passions.
</P>
<P>
   The value of knowing about co-workers' interests and talents is
partly why the Business Committee for the Arts is promoting a
program it calls art &LR; work. This October, the national group wants
businesses to encourage employees to bring art they create or
perform into their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions include hanging employee artwork on the walls or
posting it on the company's Web site or intranet; holding readings
of employees' written work; presenting vocal, instrumental, dance
and theatrical performances by employees; and inviting family and
community to share.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the national art &LR; work program, call
Michele DeSantis at (212) 664-0600.
</P>
<P>
   - Do you know an Aberrant Self-Promoter? Are you one?
</P>
<P>
   Sigrid Gustafson, a researcher in industrial and organizational
psychology, says 5 percent of workers are ASPs who ``believe they
are superior to others and have the right to do what they please.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson, who works at the American Institutes for Research in
Washington, says ASPs have trouble operating within workplace
structures. These types also are likely to carry out corporate
sabotage and espionage, so it's good to figure out who they are
before hiring mistakes are made.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson will share her assessment tools for identifying ASPs
with colleagues at the Society for Industrial and Organizational
Psychology convention in April in New Orleans. Check the
organization's Web site at www.siop.org for information.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Einstein//Noah Bagel Corp., the national
bagel company built in part on the efforts of a Kansas City bagel
bakery, has reported that because of its deteriorating financial
condition, there is ``substantial doubt'' that it will survive.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, filed Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the company reported that it was trying to
reorganize its finances and was hunting for new bank financing.
Without the financing, it expects to be unable to pay interest it
owes in June.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein//Noah operates 22 Einstein Bros. Bagel stores in the
Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the company also was negotiating with the
holders of $125 million in debentures and other creditors about
converting their debt into stock in the company. That transaction
would leave current stockholders ``with little, if any, meaningful
stake in the reorganized company.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein//Noah was started in 1995 by the combination of several
bagel companies around the country, including the Bagel &AMP; Bagel
stores in the Kansas City area. Bagel &AMP; Bagel was formed by Gail
Lozoff in 1988 and had its first shop in Brookside. Einstein, which
started with 54 stores, currently has 540 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the company, including Lozoff, could not be
reached for comment. Lozoff, 49, is chief marketing officer of
Einstein//Noah.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein is 52 percent owned by Boston Market, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in October 1998. McDonald's Corp. agreed in
December to buy Boston Market's 859 stores for $173.5 million cash
and assumed debt. There was talk at the time that Einstein might be
acquired by New World Coffee-Manhattan Bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's stock was de-listed by the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on
March 7 because the company failed to meet minimum financial
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a $3.5 million net loss on sales of $375.5
million for the fiscal year that ended in December. It reported a
loss in 1998 of $235 million after taking a write-down of $212.4
million in good will and assets. It had profits of $3.7 million in
1997 and $10 million in 1996.

TORNADO LEAVES TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION IN DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 1st graf to update death toll and 8th graf with details about
the deaths; also rewords 3rd graf, mainly to change reference to
`more bodies' to `possible victims')

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Although at least four people died and 100
were injured Tuesday evening when tornadoes swept through downtown
Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the most common sentiment
expressed here Wednesday was relief that more people had not been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a tragedy of monumental proportions. We
have sidestepped a major disaster,'' Lt. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas
said after surveying the damage Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials searched through the rubble Wednesday for more
possible victims.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's streets were littered with debris, and battered
buildings, demolished automobiles and downed trees marked the
blocks-wide swath of the twister that sliced through the city.
Trees still standing near the city's center were stripped of leaves
and covered with dangling shards of building insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs of warehouses were thrown into the street.
Tractor-trailers were tossed about. The roof of one church had
collapsed and the facade of another's steeple was stripped away to
reveal twisted steel girders.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, fighting massive traffic snarls and hazardous
conditions created by debris that drifted down from damaged
high-rise buildings, sealed off about 2 square miles of the city's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a very dangerous situation,'' said Police Chief
Ralph Mendoza. ``We could have 200-pound pieces of glass dropping
from some of these buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people died in collapsed buildings in Fort Worth. Laura Van
Hoosier, a spokeswoman for Harris Methodist Fort Worth Hospital,
said that a 19-year-old man, Juan Carlos Oseguera, died Wednesday
from injuries received during the storm from ``a soft-ball-sized
hail stone that hit him in the head.'' And one man was found dead
Wednesday day after being swept from his car into the Trinity River
by flood waters at the edge of downtown. A passenger in the car was
still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Don Coash, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a forecasting
firm in Wichita, Kan., said the destruction was a result of
separate twisters in Fort Worth and Arlington that remained on the
ground much longer than usual for such storms.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and weather forecasters said that early warning
of the impending storm, and the fact that most downtown workers had
already returned home for the day, had played a major part in
limiting the loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who was filling in for Gov. George W. Bush, who was
campaigning in the Northeast, said that he had spoken to the
governor earlier Wednesday and that they both wanted to express
``heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth and
Arlington, a disaster area Wednesday morning and has sent a request
to the federal government for a disaster relief, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth residents spent Wednesday surveying the damage and
reliving the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Gearhart, 23, had been waiting with his roommate for a
Dallas Stars hockey game to begin on television in his apartment
when, he said, ``Everything started to get really dark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Papers started flying down the street, and we could see banks
of clouds swirling and intertwining above us,'' Gearhart said.
``When big chunks of wood started blowing past, we hit the
stairwell to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The twister split into two funnel clouds just west of his
apartment building, Gearhart said, and both leapfrogged past and
hit the 35-story Bank One building down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank One just got mauled,'' Gearhart said.
</P>
<P>
   This was to have been opening day for the Nostalgic New Orleans
Apartments, an eight-unit building that Brett Thomas and his
brother Mark had worked six months to restore. Instead, they spent
Wednesday picking through the wreckage left of their project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first ad ran in this morning's paper,'' Brett Thomas said,
as he sat on a chimney that had blown off a building across the
street. The roof of his two-story building sagged, and broken glass
littered the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The twisters struck near sundown, moving from the west to the
southeast through downtown Fort Worth, retreating into the sky to
drop down again in Arlington, 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Gehren said the funnel passed about two blocks from her
house. ``The power went out, and my husband had just managed to get
the garage door closed when the wind picked up and we started
hearing explosions,'' Gehren said. ``I started screaming and didn't
stop until it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people remained without power Wednesday, according
to Pat Nichols, a spokeswoman for the major electric supplier in
the area, Texas Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, still scrambling to respond to the disaster,
said it was too early to say exactly how much damage had been done
in financial terms or how long it would take to recover from the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Terrell, Fort Worth's city manager, said a preliminary
survey by his staff had found 52 commercial structures damaged and
eight buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn., was struck by a similar storm in April 1998
that killed one person and did $200 million in damage. Billy
Fields, coordinator of that city's Tornado Recovery Board, said it
would probably take Fort Worth three or four years to rebound from
the tornadoes.

CELL PHONE PLAN AIMS TO HELP LIKELY VICTIMS CALL 911, FAST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A plan to use old cellular phones to help protect the
elderly and other people who are vulnerable to crime is to be
announced Thursday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor will ask people to donate their old or unused cell
phones at one of more than 300 drop-off points that will be set up
around the city, said Rhea Mallett, the coordinator of the city's
domestic violence program.
</P>
<P>
   The phones will be reprogrammed to dial 911 at the push of a
button, and distributed to cabdrivers, the disabled, the homebound,
victims of domestic violence and neighborhood-watch groups.
</P>
<P>
   Collection sites for the program _ known as Phones, or People
Helping Others Needing Emergency Services _ will be located at
movie theaters, police and fire stations, Grand Central Terminal
and Pennsylvania Station. The city expects to collect 10,000 phones
a month.
</P>
<P>
   People will be asked to donate the phones in clear plastic bags
along with their batteries and chargers.
</P>
<P>
   The phones are being reprogrammed free by Bell Atlantic Mobile.
It will be impossible to make calls from the phones or to receive
calls. The phones will be given away, with the help of a number of
corporate sponsors, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic started a similar program just over a year ago and
has given away 10,000 phones, said Lynette Viviani, a spokeswoman
for Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett, the city coordinator, said the earlier program had been
a success. ``I know that a taxi driver has used it twice to report
accidents,'' she said. ``He was able to get ambulances quickly.
Those few minutes can save a life.''

STUDY BACKS UP WHAT GEORGE FOREMAN SAID: JOB CORPS WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public
Affairs at Princeton University, and editor of The Journal of
Economic Perspectives.) 
(cjl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Job Corps, an original anti-poverty program from Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society, was on the ropes and facing deep budget
cuts in the mid-1990s, George Foreman came to its defense. ``Job
Corps took me from the mean streets and out of a nightmare
lifestyle into a mode where the most incredible of dreams came
true,'' Foreman, the two-time heavyweight boxing champion, said.
</P>
<P>
   More scientific evidence is in a study by Mathematica Policy
Research quietly released last week. The study finds that the Job
Corps measurably improves the education and job prospects of
disadvantaged youth. It also offers clues as to why.
</P>
<P>
   The Job Corps is the most intensive and expensive of the
dwindling number of government programs for disadvantaged youth.
The $1.3 billion cost last year amounts to about $20,000 for each
participant. Although critics mistakenly argue that the Job Corps
is as expensive as a year at Harvard _ ignoring the public subsidy
and endowment spending that raise Harvard's true costs for each
student well above $50,000 a year _ the costs are high.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are also high. The program serves more than 60,000
mostly poor, urban high school dropouts who are between the ages of
15 and 25. A third of the male participants had been arrested at
least once before joining the program; two-thirds of all
participants had never held a full-time job. If the Job Corps does
not improve the prospects of disadvantaged youths, then
less-intensive programs are unlikely to help either.
</P>
<P>
   The Job Corps is expensive because 90 percent of students are
sent from their neighborhoods to one of 116 residential campuses in
46 states. There they stay for about eight months of academic
education, vocational training, counseling, health education and
job placement assistance. Students train for jobs in the new and
old economy, from Jiffy Lube to Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematica's ``National Job Corps Study''
(www.ttrc.doleta.gov/opr/FULLTEXT/jobcorps/outcomes/), financed by
the Labor Department, presents initial results of the most
scientifically rigorous evaluation of the program ever done.
Researchers followed 9,409 applicants to the Job Corps between
November 1994 and December 1995 who were randomly selected for the
program, and another 6,000 applicants who were randomly assigned to
a control group that was excluded from the Job Corps services for
three years. Applicants were surveyed 12 and 30 months after they
applied; almost 80 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
   The study compares the self-reported employment, earnings and
criminal activity of the participant and control groups in the 30
months after students applied to the program. By the last survey,
participants had typically lived on their own, away from the Job
Corps, for a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The participants received about 1,000 more hours of education
and job training than members of the control group. For high school
dropouts, attending the Job Corps raised the percentage who earned
a General Educational Development degree to 40 percent from 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years after applying to the Job Corps, the
average applicant selected for the program earned 8 percent more
each week than the average control group member. Because only
three-quarters of the selected applicants actually attended the Job
Corps, the Mathematica analysts figured that the program raised the
average participant's earnings by 11 percent. This increase is
about what labor economists expect for every year of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Program participants also had slightly higher employment rates,
average weekly work hours and hourly earnings. For 16- and
17-year-old boys _ a group whose prospects are notoriously
difficult to improve with other employment training _ earnings
increased, according to Peter Z. Schochet, co-author of the study,
by an impressive 20 percent. Extrapolating from the most recent
quarter, the Job Corps appears to raise the average participant's
earnings by almost $1,000 a year, to $9,563 from $8,642.
Participants also received about $425 less in public assistance
during the study period.
</P>
<P>
   A striking finding is that participants were about 20 percent
less likely to be arrested, charged or convicted of a crime, and if
convicted, they served less jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Except for women with children, students slotted for a
nonresidential Job Corps program had no statistical improvement
relative to comparable control group members. Evidently, by sending
young people to residential campuses, the program overcomes the
distraction of gangs, drugs and poverty that plague their normal
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Some social scientists, like Lisbeth Schorr of Harvard, have
argued that complex, multipronged social interventions cannot be
evaluated with scientific treatment and control methods. The
National Job Corps Study proves them wrong. Orley Ashenfelter, a
Princeton economist, commented that the methods used in the study
have made labor economics a powerful science.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematica will wait to complete a 48-month follow-up survey
before performing a cost-benefit analysis of the Job Corps next
year. Nonetheless, the short-term results are similar to those
found in an earlier evaluation of the program by Charles Mallar,
then at Mathematica. That study, conducted in 1982 without the
benefit of random assignment, concluded that every dollar spent on
the Job Corps returned more than a dollar in benefits for society.
</P>
<P>
   Had the new study shown the Job Corps to be a bust, the program
surely would be on the ropes again. Instead, the program works for
the same reasons it helped George Foreman: it takes troubled youth
out of ``the mean streets'' and places them in a safe and
disciplined environment where they learn valuable skills.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the number of the Job Corps slots has been stable for
decades, while the number of disadvantaged youth has exploded.
President Clinton's latest budget proposal requests only a small
increase. Why not set a loftier goal? Why shouldn't the Job Corps
be able to accommodate every eligible youngster in the country?

DEAFNESS NO HANDICAP FOR LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's nothing extraordinary about junior college
transfer John Cousins making an impressive showing in USC's first
spring practices. Until you consider the former West Los Angeles
College linebacker is completely deaf in his left ear and can
barely hear in his right ear.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the handicap hasn't deterred Cousins, who made several
nice plays in the Trojans' first scrimmage last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hearing doesn't really come into affect,'' Cousins said.
``Players help me out and I can get signals from the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins said his hearing has gradually declined over the years
from strain and pressure problems. He underwent an operation on his
right ear, but it did little to improve his hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been deaf in my left ear for more than 10 years,''
Cousins said. ``I lost most of the hearing in my right ear in the
last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins is not totally deaf, however, and wears a hearing aid in
his right ear, although it does not give him regular hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hearing aid amplifies the sound,'' Cousins said. ``I hear
everything, but it's not like it can replace your ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than the hearing deficiency, Cousins' biggest
transition has been playing linebacker full time. He was primarily
a defensive end at West L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing real well,'' said USC linebackers coach A.J.
Christoff. ``He just needs to make the adjustment to linebacker.
I'm excited about his progress. He has great athletic ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Christoff said he has learned to tailor his coaching toward
Cousins' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to coach as much as possible where I'm looking at him,''
Christoff said. ``From a distance, it's hard to talk to him, but
straight up close, it's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins has a good shot at playing time next season, because the
strongside-linebacker position is wide open, with Kori Dickerson,
Chris Prosser and Scott Huber also fighting for the starting role.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scrimmage follow up: After getting a chance to watch tapes of
last Saturday's miniscrimmage, USC coach Paul Hackett offered some
detailed explanations about how the Trojans looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long, long way to go. The defense is ahead of the
offense,'' Hackett said. ``I think we have a strong secondary. I
thought (linebacker) Darryl Knight made some plays. (Defensive end)
Lonnie Ford played real well, but I expected that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought John Cousins and (defensive end) Omar Nazel made
some plays and showed their athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty problem: The Trojans had 11 penalties in the
scrimmage, which was reminiscent of last season, when they had 128
in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to have a full (officiating) crew (at practice)
and talk about it and work on eliminating penalties,'' Hackett
said. ``If I had a magical answer, I would use it. I don't think
for a first scrimmage, the penalties were outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Next scrimmage: The Trojans will hold their first extended
scrimmage on Friday afternoon at Howard Jones Field. They will also
hold scrimmages on April 8 and April 15.
</P>
<P>
   __ Local candidates: Several former area quarterbacks are
spending this spring trying to make the team as walk-ons. Among
those competing are John Terzian of Harvard-Westlake High, Taylor
Talt of San Marino and Ray Kasper of Loyola.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting candidate could arrive in summer camp, when
6-foot-8 volleyball player Trevor Julian is expected to try to make
the team as a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett would like to keep one or two walk-ons to complement
scholarship quarterbacks Carson Palmer, Mike Van Raaphorst and Matt
Cassel.
</P>
<P>
   __ Strange injury: Defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed is
questionable this week after feeling a pop in his shoulder while
rolling over in bed, Hackett said.

EMBRAER POSTS RECORD EARNINGS, EXCEEDING FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Embraer, a leading manufacturer of small
passenger jetliners and Brazil's biggest exporter, reported
Wednesday that fourth-quarter and full-year earnings in 1999 soared
to records on strong sales in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The results at Embraer far exceeded the forecasts of securities
analysts and underscored the company's transformation from a
money-losing state-run enterprise six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in Brazil's manufacturing costs, caused partly by
the country's currency devaluation in early 1999, also contributed
to Embraer's strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer's net income in the October-December quarter more than
quadrupled to 226.3 million reais, or $130.3 million. For all of
1999, the company's earnings nearly tripled, to $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jet manufacturer's 1999 sales totaled a record 3.38 billion
reais, or $1.95 billion, up 114 percent from 1998 sales of 1.58
billion reais.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results were much better than anyone expected, which should
better position Embraer to expand in other areas, especially those
that are defense-related,'' said David Wheeler, a managing director
in the Brazilian office of Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   This year, analysts expect Embraer's sale of jets to rise nearly
50 percent, to 150 from an estimated 100 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer is often cited as an industrial symbol of Brazil's
economic modernization. Its clients include some of the largest
American and European airlines, and Embraer has continuously
pressed forward with expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   The sale last year of a minority stake to a French aerospace
consortium led by Aerospatiale Matra and Dassault Aviation was part
of this push. The alliance is seen as enabling Embraer to improve
its technology to win more military contracts for its fighter jets,
which currently account for only about 10 percent of production.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American nations including Mexico and Chile have
reportedly shown interest in acquiring military aircraft from
Embraer. The company's aggressive efforts to get more international
orders have caused considerable friction with competitors, most
notably Bombardier of Montreal. Both companies have roughly a third
of the $55 billion market for regional jetliners, which are
commonly defined as aircraft with 100 or fewer seats.
</P>
<P>
   The generous financing made available to Embraer's clients from
the Brazilian government has resulted in a dispute with Bombardier
at the World Trade Organization, with Bombardier accusing Embraer
of benefiting from unfair subsidies. A ruling on the dispute is
expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a politically charged issue, so I'm sure that whatever
the decision is one side will appeal, and the dispute will
continue,'' said Mauricio Botelho, the president of Embraer.

Stabenow, D-Mich., by attending a cocktail party in Washington on
Tuesday that raised $250,000. Stabenow led Sen. Spencer Abraham, a
freshman Republican, by 52 percent to 48 percent in a poll early
his month by Epic/MRA Inc., a polling company in Lansing, Mich.
Abraham's standing suffered partly because he had backed Gov.
George W. Bush, who lost to Sen. John McCain in the state's
primary, a poll spokesman said.

   Just how closely are the Bush and Gore campaigns watching each

Gore's office on the U.S. Newswire, an electronic service, that had
dropped the word ``vice'' from his title, the Bush camp likened the
mistake to other verbal slips or grand claims by Gore. ``Since he
invented the Internet, inspired ``Love Story'' and discovered Love
Canal, it's fitting that the vice president promote himself to
president,'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman. But it
was the Bush campaign that was overreaching: The Newswire said it
made the error.

CDNOW STOCK PLUMMETS AFTER AUDITOR EXPRESSES CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (cjl) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in the online music retailer CDNow Inc.
fell 30.9 percent to $3.50 Wednesday after the company filed an
audit with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressing
``substantial doubt'' about the future of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the audit foreshadowed challenges that would be
faced by online retailers in general as narrow margins fail to
compensate for marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, by the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, was published
as part of CDNow's annual report, filed on Tuesday with the SEC. It
states that ``recurring losses from operations'' cast doubt on
CDNow's ``ability to continue as a going concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, CDNow had $34.5
million in operating losses. While posting $53 million in sales, it
spent about half that _ $26 million _ on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The audit put a fine point on previous disclosures from CDNow
that its current liquidity would run out before the end of the
year. In Tuesday's filing, the company said it had sufficient cash
to operate through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow had pinned hopes for its future on a merger with Columbia
House, a direct-mail music company owned jointly by Sony and Time
Warner, but the deal fell through earlier this month. In backing
out, Time Warner and Sony said they would invest a combined $51
million in CDNow, money that had already been factored into the
company's ability to operate through September. At least $21
million of that investment has already been delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Olim, CDNow's president and chief executive, played down
the significance of the audit language, saying that Arthur Andersen
was obliged to give only a qualified endorsement, given that CDNow
had acknowledged it lacked enough money to operate through the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think there is new information, which there is not,''
he said, adding he has ``high confidence'' the company will find
new investors. CDNow has retained the investment banking firm Allen
&AMP; Co. to find a new partner, though Olim declined to discuss the
progress of the search.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the struggles of CDNow appear to be a painful
harbinger for online retailers, analysts said, because CDNow failed
to achieve profitability despite being early to market and
establishing a strong brand name _ assets that popular wisdom has
long equated with success in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand development in and of itself does not guarantee
success,'' said Ken Cassar, senior retail analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a market research firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly susceptible, Cassar said, were commodity
businesses, like online pet stores or beauty stores, which have low
margins and offer products that differ little if at all from their
competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of online retailers are going to go out of business,
and a number are going to be identified by traditional retailers
that don't yet have an online strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar said that while CDNow had failed to capitalize on its
early lead _ for example, it did not broaden its product base to
ticket sales _ it remained a viable takeover candidate. He added
that it was too soon to write a eulogy for the company.

FOR SOUTER, A CHANGE OF MIND AND A DEFT MEA CULPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (With SCOTUS-NUDE)  
 (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his concurring opinion in the nude dancing case
Wednesday, Justice David H. Souter of the Supreme Court was hardly
the first to make what judges have long regarded as a painful
confession: that he had changed his mind on a question of law.
</P>
<P>
   Souter now believes, he wrote, that cities should have to prove
that nude dancing is actually causing them harm. In a 1991 nude
dancing case, he was willing simply to make the assumption of harm.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his change, Souter joined a long line of judges
who have deflected the potential embarrassment of a public
recantation by a graceful turn of phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have demanded the evidence then, too,'' Souter said,
``and my mistake calls to mind Justice Jackson's foolproof
explanation of a lapse of his own, when he quoted Samuel Johnson,
`Ignorance, sir, ignorance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring
opinion in a 1950 case, McGrath vs. Kristensen, in which Jackson
explained why he was abandoning a position he had advocated 10
years earlier as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Wednesday, Souter also alluded to Justice Felix
Frankfurter's explanation for a change of heart, in 1949: ``Wisdom
too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely
because it comes late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it is enlightenment on my part, and acceptable even if
a little late,'' Souter said of his own new position.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, quote perhaps the most famous of all
judicial recantations, that of Baron Bramwell, a 19th-century
English lawyer and judge, who explained himself in the 1872 case of
Andrews vs. Styrap by saying: ``The matter does not appear to me
now as it appears to have appeared to me then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, it was hardly incumbent on Souter to provide a
compendium of prior recantations. The words with which Jackson
concluded his apologia in McGrath vs. Kristensen are undoubtedly
sufficient: ``If there are other ways of gracefully and
good-naturedly surrendering former views to a better considered
position, I invoke them all.''

2 ILLEGAL MINORS, 2 TALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY DANIEL GONZALEZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Juan Sebastian and Elian Gonzalez are two immigrant boys
with a lot in common, yet their cases are being handled in widely
disparate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys arrived in the United States through heart-wrenching
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, as the world knows, is the 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued
in the waters off Florida on Thanksgiving after his boat sank and
his mother and 10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   David, an obscure 13-year-old Indian boy from Guatemala, was
discovered in October wandering alone in the equally dangerous
Arizona desert after he was abandoned by his stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian has been showered with media attention, David's
plight is far more representative of the thousands of minors
apprehended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, immigration lawyers and human-rights
activists say, unaccompanied minors apprehended by the INS are
quickly returned to their countries. Otherwise, they languish in
detention centers, sometimes for months, until their status is
sorted out away from public scrutiny and with little or no legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real problem,'' said Jo Becker, advocacy director of
the children's rights division of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Elian, he's been able to stay with relatives, go to
Walt Disney World and Universal Studios and receive lots of gifts.
In contrast, there are several thousand children a year who are in
similar situations who have arrived here without their parents and
are picked up by the INS and placed in detention.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many immigrants, both Elian and David escaped hardships
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Elian left a Communist country that's run by a dictator. David
comes from a region of Guatemala still reeling from the aftermath
of a protracted civil war that killed thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's case has somehow floated to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is surrounded by the love and affection of relatives in
Miami, bathed in the riches of capitalism, and represented by
high-powered attorneys and politicians fighting to keep him in the
United States. David sits deprived of his freedom in a juvenile
detention center in Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has a loving father waiting for him in Cuba. David, if
deported, will most likely wind up a street kid in Guatemala, where
he could fall easy prey to gangs, prostitution, or worse, his
lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Elian's case highlights the disparate treatment under
the law of unaccompanied minors. . . . The vast majority of
unaccompanied minors are initially subject to detention,'' said
Chris Nugent, director of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights
Project, a non-profit organization that provides legal services to
immigrant detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Most unaccompanied immigrant children are from Mexico and
Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,
Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration attorneys and human-rights activists describe
Southwest Key, the detention center where David is held, as a model
facility where undocumented juveniles attend school and are
generally well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker says many undocumented juveniles apprehended by the
INS are placed in juvenile jails where they are mixed with
juveniles accused of committing crimes, sometimes as serious as
rape, assault and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of treating the undocumented juveniles as de facto
criminals, Becker said, a better alternative would be for the INS
to hand over undocumented juveniles to local child-welfare
authorities while their cases are being processed.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Bergeron, a spokesman for the INS in Washington,
D.C., calls those contentions ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The facade that this child is in jail is simply an attempt to
mischaracterize the circumstances under which he is being cared
for,'' Bergeron said. ``A 13-year-old with no competent or capable
relatives, and no means to support himself, should not be free to
come and go as he pleases.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did these undocumented juveniles enter the United
States illegally, Bergeron said, the conditions inside the
facilities where they are held are often better than the conditions
they left. The average stay is 37 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Key, where David is being held, is staffed by
teachers, child psychologists and other specialists, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   The only time undocumented juveniles are placed in juvenile
jails, Bergeron added, is when the undocumented juveniles in INS
custody are accused of committing a crime or are placed there for
their own protection.
</P>
<P>
   During fiscal 1999, there were 4,607 undocumented juveniles
under age 18 in INS custody, according to agency records. During
the same year, 1,218 undocumented juveniles were returned to their
own countries.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Flanagan, a Phoenix lawyer representing David for free,
stumbled upon the boy's case. Without her efforts, David likely
would have already been returned to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan is trying to obtain special immigration juvenile status
for David, which would allow the boy to apply for permanent
residency in the United States. She argues that David has no
relatives to return to in Guatemala and that his father, although
possibly a legal resident of the United States, is an unfit parent.
If she is successful, David may eventually be placed in foster care
or in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   David was picked up by the INS on Oct. 6 on the Tohono O'odham
Reservation in southern Arizona, a barren stretch where many
illegal immigrants have died. In interviews, David told Flanagan
that his stepmother abandoned him in the desert after the pair
crossed the border near Sasabe. The pair were trying to reunite
with David's father, who moved to the Valley several years ago
looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says his stepmother left him with very little water, no
food and no money,'' Flanagan said. ``She said she was going to
come back, but she didn't. He waited for her, then started walking
and walking. He was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   David told Flanagan he comes from San Jose, a dirt poor village
outside San Sebastian Coatan in the indigenous Huehuetenango region
of Guatemala. There are no schools in San Jose, and David can't
read or write. He speaks Spanish, but his first language is Chuj, a
Mayan language pronounced ``chew.'' His real mother is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian Gonzalez have argued it would be unfair to
send the boy back to a Communist dictatorship. Eric Popkin, a
sociology professor specializing in Cuba and Guatemala at Sarah
Lawrence College, said the conditions in Guatemala are worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, what I see is economic hardship, particularly in the
1990s after the fall of the Soviet bloc,'' said Popkin, who has
spent time in both Cuba and the Huehuetenango region of Guatemala.
``In San Sebastian, there is poverty and misery. Absolute
misery.'' &QL;

FOOTBALL FANS RUNNING THROUGH HOOPS IN GATORLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the story goes, the sports information office of a
Southeastern Conference school once crafted a news release
announcing that the school's head basketball coach had ``resigned
to accept a promotion as defensive line coach of the football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the ``promotion'' really did happen, though
no one remembers who or exactly where.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sunshine State, college basketball used to be merely the
diversion between the bowl game and the launch of spring football
practice. The Gators' basketball coach in the 1950s was, in fact,
Johnny Mauer, who doubled as the football staff's defensive
backfield coach.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the Gators played their hoops in a brick earache
known as Alligator Alley. The building was said to hold around
7,000, an audience that seemed to sway with the fickle fortunes of
the basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here the Gators are, a Final Four team for the second time
in seven seasons. They could win it all, much to the chagrin of
college basketball purists, including Lon Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   Florida basketball isn't just a good story this 1999-2000
season. It's a walking ``X-Files'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   If you quizzed the average college hoops fan and asked which
Final Four hopeful boasted five McDonald's All-Americans on its
roster, the answer likely would have been anything but Florida. But
it's true. Coach Billy Donovan, he of the Eddie Munster haircut,
starts four of the prep All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   How he got forward Mike Miller to Gainesville, Fla., from South
Dakota defies all basketball logic and area codes. But in truth,
Donovan has a rich Final Four pedigree of his own, having played in
one and assisted in one, and he seems to have inherited his old
boss' knack for gathering the talent.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a sophomore, explained at a news conference yesterday,
``I had to make a sacrifice in that I had to go far from home, and
to a program that didn't really have all of the hype and publicity
that the other schools that I was looking at did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I fell in love with coach Donovan and what he was
preaching to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's old boss, of course, is Rick Pitino and there are
remnants of the ex-Kentucky coach's system everywhere. The Gators
like to press and shoot the 3-pointer. And Donovan substitutes like
a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   They have a way, as Pitino's Kentucky teams did, of imposing
their tempo on people, as it showed in the East Regional victories
against Duke and Oklahoma State. No one wants to run with the
Gators, but the Blue Devils and Cowboys found themselves hurrying
things, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   During the SEC season, the Gators won a snore-fest at Georgia,
33-20. Illinois, coached by Kruger, tried the same thing in the
NCAA tourney's second round, and the Gators escaped, 40-33.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Kenyan Weaks suggested, ``You really have to try and play
a half-court game, I guess. You have to get us in foul trouble,
make shots, get offensive rebounds. Do the things that are
weaknesses to us, and I think you can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a lightly regarded No. 12 seed, thought it worked the
game plan to perfection in the tourney's first round, but the
Gators survived, 69-68, on a basket at the overtime buzzer. In the
Florida locker room afterward, there were tears of relief.
</P>
<P>
   It speaks volumes about how far basketball at Florida has come
that Donovan's team actually felt pressure not to underachieve.
When Kruger bolted for the Big Ten four years ago, he said it was
because, in part, Illinois was much more ``basketball country.''
The insinuations were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   At least Steve Spurrier hadn't tried to promote him to
special-teams coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think early in the year we had a very hard time handling
success and the amount of preseason hype,'' Donovan said. ``I think
our guys came into the season with inflated opinions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But through the course of the year, I think our team has
remained relatively humble.''
</P>
<P>
   If you grew up in SEC country, there is more than a passing
irony in having a Florida basketball team favored over
tradition-rich North Carolina in the Final Four semis.
</P>
<P>
   And they could win it all. It would be the highlight of spring
football practice.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    `Greatest of sorrows': Shock turns to grief at vigil for victims
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider and David Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. _ While about 1,000 people were grieving the death
of two children in the worst train-school bus wreck involving
Georgians since 1974, another of the injured children died.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Pritchett, 9, died about 8 p.m. Wednesday at T.C. Thompson
Children's Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn., hospital officials said.
The hospital is where all the injured children were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Amber's death came about an hour after a vigil had begun in
Murray County for the victims of the crash. Word did not reach
those at the vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of grieving for the five injured and three killed
in Tuesday morning's crash started with childrenlowering the flag
at their school to half-staff and ended with about 1,000
tear-stained faces glistening in candlelight at a vigil on the
courthouse lawn about 15 minutes away in nearby Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes was among those at the vigil at the
Murray County Courthouse. ``This is the greatest of sorrows: the
memory of joy in the face of grief,'' he said. ``We cannot
understand why they were taken.'' As the frenzy of Tuesday's crash
at a narrow railroad crossing subsided, residents of this
blue-collar community of about 600 felt the full weight of their
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I was numb. Today I woke up and realized that she
was not there,'' said Jenny Agan, 26, the aunt of Kayla Silvers, a
6-year-old who died in the crash early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla was among seven students on thebus picking up students for
Northwest Elementary School. They all lived near one another in
this enclave of trailer homes and small dwellings at the top of a
hill. Daniel Pack, 9, also died when the 33-car CSX freight train
collided with the bus at the unprotected crossing. Two children
remain in critical condition. Brittany Gaddis, who stumbled from
the twisted hulk of the train to a nearby store, was released from
the hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two children myself,'' a weeping Karen Ross of
Chatsworth said as she stood among the crowd in 40-degree
temperatures. ``This has made me aware of what can happen any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Clark drives her daughter, Felisha, to preschool at
Northwest Elementary. ``I'm lucky my little girl wasn't on the
bus,'' Clark said at the vigil. ``It makes you stop and think.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Silvers, who discovered his daughter Kayla dead in the
wreckage, told the crowd, ``Cherish (your children). You'll never
know how much you miss them until they are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Chaney, who organized the service, was overwhelmed by the
turnout. The wife of the pastor at nearby Mount Zion United
Methodist, Chaney started out planning a small service at the
church. But it quickly became apparent the church wouldn't hold
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very profound,'' Chaney said. ``This sends a message to
the families that we love them and support them. I hope this helps.
We will continue to pray for them.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials had braced Wednesday for a hard day of sorrow
and tears _ and they got it. In Tuesday's confusion, many students
hadn't heard what had happened or, if they had, did not know who
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   For the students and teachers, the second day of grieving hit
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my heart is broke,'' said Zachary Mantoota, 8. He
rides that bus some days, but was driven to school Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He said his class talked about ``how that train hit the bus. A
couple of kids were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   In chats with his grandmother, he shared his own sadness. He
knew Amber Pritchett and was friends with Kevin Sherrill, 8, who
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had deep sadness and love. It really tore my heart out to
hear him,'' said grandmother Janice Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwest Elementary, Principal C.L. Dunn tried to keep the
day as normal as possible. ``We feel the children need a sense of
routine right now to reassure them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grief counselors visited the classes of the accident victims.
Bus routes were reconfigured to avoid train crossings. Some buses
carried yellow ribbons in tribute to the students.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents kept their kids off the buses, driving them to
school. Among them were the parents of Zachery Watson, 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crying a lot last night,'' said his father, John
Watson, who was among those who helped at the accident scene.

   At the railroad crossing on Liberty Church Road, eight small
yellow ribbons hung on the wooden post holding the yellow sign with
the X on it to symbolize a railroad crossing. The post on the other
side of the one-track crossing, sideswiped as the train dragged and
shredded the bus, had been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National
Transportation Safety Board measured and marked the site in
preparation for an accident restaging today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to mirror the conditions, to determine at what point a
driver could see the train and hear the train,'' said NTSB
spokeswoman Lauren Peduzzi.
</P>
<P>
   The train's on-board computer revealed that the warning whistle
had been blowing and that the train was traveling at about 50 mph
on impact. The speed limit at the crossing, where trains can pass
as often as every half-hour, is 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials acknowledged that many questions remain and
that it is too early to ascribe any blame. Dana Keeton, spokeswoman
for the Tennessee Highway Patrol, rattled off a short list of some
outstanding issues: Was the bus moving or was it stopped upon the
tracks? Did the bus driver follow the law by stopping before the
tracks to check both ways? Why was the bus on the tracks when a
train was coming?
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB expects to release a preliminary report in about a
week, but a full finding could take 10 months, said Peduzzi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Keeton said the bus driver, Rhonda Cloer, whose own
daughter was among the injured students, had only one previous
violation on her driving record, a 1991 speeding ticket. The record
did not indicate whether that occurred while she was driving a bus,
said Keeton.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The governor's office declared Tarrant
County a disaster area Wednesday as workers began cleaning up the
devastation from tornadoes that ravaged Fort Worth and Arlington,
killing five people, wiping out neighborhoods and making downtown a
ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Damage in Fort Worth alone was projected to top $300 million,
with most of the destruction downtown and in the Monticello,
Rivercrest and Linwood neighborhoods. Figures for Arlington, where
100 homes sustained major damage and 1,000 had light to moderate
damage, were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr accompanied state officials on a
helicopter tour of the two cities and said he was ``just completely
shocked'' by the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mike Moncrief said he was awestruck by the disaster.
``I've seen the aftermath of Oklahoma City and Wichita Falls
(tornadoes), but I just didn't expect it here in our own back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Two tornadoes hit Fort Worth and Arlington about 30 minutes
apart Tuesday evening. They plowed through the Fort Worth business
district, shattering plate-glass windows in high-rise buildings,
and ripped through a residential area south of Interstate 20 in
southeast Arlington. Fifty-six homes were damaged in Grand Prairie,
east of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service gauged the Arlington tornado at its
peak as an F3, which packs winds of 158 to 206 mph. The Fort Worth
tornado was an F2 with winds ranging from 113 to 157 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry granted the county disaster declaration in
the absence of Gov. George W. Bush, who was out of state
campaigning for president. The governor issued a statement saying
the damage is ``a tragic reminder of the fierce power of nature. My
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Our
state disaster recovery teams are already working with local
officials to assess the damage and provide relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington damage was primarily confined to the area around
Matlock and Bardin roads near the municipal airport; no serious
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the major path of destruction was along a
two-mile stretch from University Boulevard along West Seventh
Street through downtown. More than 80 people were treated at area
hospitals, and at least two were in serious or critical condition
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Bob Terrell estimated preliminary damage in Fort
Worth at $157 million, but comparisons already were being made to
the 1995 hailstorm, which produced $400 million in insured damages
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Insurance Information Service estimated that
the final damage total for the Tuesday tornadoes will exceed $300
million in Fort Worth alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hailstorm was more widespread, whereas now, the damage is
more concentrated and obviously more extensive,'' Assistant City
Manager Ramon Guajardo said. ``But I don't know which will be more
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 buildings hit by the tornado in Fort Worth, eight were
destroyed, 27 sustained major damage and 15 had minor damage. At
least one, the Cash America building, may have to be torn down,
Deputy Fire Chief Jim Tidwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also damaged in Fort Worth were the downtown Central Library,
the Cowtown Coliseum and the International Center.
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals treated more than 80 people for injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death toll stood at four Wednesday night, with one
person missing and presumed dead. Two victims were crushed on the
outskirts of downtown _ Carl Spence, 67, by a collapsing wall and
Howard D. Thornton by a truck trailer that toppled onto him _ as
the tornado plowed its way through the heart of the city about 6:30
p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the third victim _ Ashlyn B. Dickens, 24, _ was
recovered Wednesday morning along a creek in the 9500 block of
Trinity Boulevard, behind the Bell Helicopter plant in northeast
Tarrant County. Dickens and his grandmother, Adele Warren, 62, were
in a car that was swept away by rising creek waters as they left
Bell Helicopter. Warren's body had not been located by Wednesday
afternoon, but she is presumed to be dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juan C. Oseguera, 19, who suffered severe head trauma when a
softball-size hailstone hit him, died Wednesday night at a Fort
Worth hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon Wednesday, authorities had reopened many
downtown streets that had been barricaded, leaving the business
district a virtual ghost town bounded by glistening sidewalks
sprinkled with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Streets surrounding the most heavily damaged high-rise buildings
_ Bank One, UPR Plaza, Tandy Towers and the Tandy Technology Center
_ may remain closed through the weekend as workers remove cracked
or broken plate-glass windows, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and managers of downtown properties were allowed into
their buildings Wednesday afternoon to assess damage and secure the
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of downtown workers who received an
unexpected holiday Wednesday will probably be permitted to return
Thursday, Police Chief Ralph Mendoza and Guajardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the downtown area, the heaviest damage was in the
Linwood neighborhood. More than a dozen homes and duplexes,
including the former home of presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald, were destroyed or heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Also hard-hit in Fort Worth was the Monticello neighborhood,
where the storm ripped roofs from homes and uprooted 80-year-old
trees along Hamilton Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3900 block of Hamilton Avenue, winds lifted one family's
garage and moved it 10 feet north. A basketball goal was knocked
horizontally, and winds drove it into the family's white sedan,
embedding the backboard in the left taillight.
</P>
<P>
   The only reported neighborhood injury was a man working at the
West Seventh Street Barbershop. The owner's son, Michael Moore, was
the last to leave the barbershop, said his mother, Rosa Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just walked out of the shop, and the wind blew him
against the building and it collapsed on top of him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, the tornado destroyed a section of roof at the
Bell Helicopter Textron facility. Flying debris damaged a V-22
helicopter and an XV-15 demonstrator but did not damage two CV-22
Osprey helicopters housed there, Bell spokesman Bob Leder said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado skirted the I-20 corridor of car dealerships, then
slammed into a residential neighborhood flanking both sides of
Matlock Road just south of Bardin Road. Some houses, particularly
along Embercrest Lane and Chasemore Lane, caught the brunt of
powerful winds that left only clumps of rubble atop concrete
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents credited their survival or lack of serious injury
to residential construction that places bathrooms in the middle of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bathrooms saved lives,'' said Laura Donovan, whose home
on Sandalwood Lane was damaged but not destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Fire Battalion Chief John McQueary also marveled at
the absence of serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a strict ``no fly
zone'' over downtown Fort Worth at the request of the FBI, said
John Clabes, an FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why is that the downdrafts from the helicopters
flying over downtown were blowing some of the remaining shards of
glass out of those tall buildings and blowing those shards down on
the people trying to clean up the mess below,'' Clabes said.
</P>
<P>
   The ban will remain in effect until the FBI or Barr requests
that it be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth suburb of River Oaks, Castleberry High School
students, whose classes were canceled Wednesday, are expected to
return Thursday. The campus sustained widespread damage to the
field house, vocational building and main building.
</P>
<P>
   River Oaks City Administrator Joy Williams said 80 structures
sustained damage.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods on the southern and western fringes of River Oaks
were hard hit, with fallen trees, broken windows and roofs blown
off.
</P>
<P>
   The city lost many stately trees more than 100 years old, Mayor
Jack Adkison said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired graphic artist Jerry Grimes, 65, now working part-time
for the U.S. Census, recalled how he was leaving Tandy Center on
Tuesday evening when he saw the storm developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started forming from the ground up,'' Grimes said. ``Then I
saw it begin a slow counterrotation. The sky turned black, and then
the clouds were pulled right out of the sky... The yellow stripe on
my back started to grow. At that point, I decided the tornado was
bigger and badder than me, so I took off.''

LEOPOLD BELLAK, 83, EXPERT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Leopold Bellak, a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and
psychologist best known for his contributions in the fields of
psychological testing and abnormal psychology, died March 24 at a
nursing home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. A resident of neighboring
Larchmont, he was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellak was widely known in the field for his work with the
Thematic Apperception Test, known as the TAT, which uses a series
of evocative pictures to reveal subjects' unconscious fantasies,
and the development of a version of the test for children, the
Children's Apperception Test, referred to as the CAT.
</P>
<P>
   Bellak wrote about 200 scholarly articles and some 40 books,
lectured widely and wrote extensively about brief and emergency
psychotherapy and about adult attention deficit disorder. He was
also known for his work on schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   With a colleague, Dr. David M. Abrams, Bellak published ``The
Thematic Apperception Test, the Children's Apperception Test and
the Senior Apperception Technique in Clinical Use'' (Allyn &AMP;
Beacon). The sixth revised edition appeared in 1996 and remains in
print, as do many of his other titles.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association honored Bellak in 1993
with its annual award, the ``Distinguished Professional
Contributions to Knowledge.'' The association described his work as
seminal and noted ``his building of bridges between varied
disciplines in the behavioral sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Leopold Bellak was born in Vienna, arrived in the United States
in 1938 and became a citizen in 1943. He served in the Army Medical
Corps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After studying medicine at the University of Vienna for three
years, he went on to study psychology on a scholarship at Boston
University and on a fellowship at Harvard, receiving M.A. degrees
at both, in 1939 and 1942. He completed his M.D. at New York
Medical College in 1944 and trained at St. Elizabeths Hospital in
Washington and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the staff at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of
Yeshiva University from 1971 to 1988. He also maintained a private
practice in psychiatry and psychoanalysis in Larchmont, starting in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   Bellak is survived by two daughters, Trina Bellak of
Gaithersburg, Md., and Kerin Adams of Englewood, N.J., and a
granddaughter, as well as his former wife, Sonya Baychok Sorel
Bellak, of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his books in print is the autobiographical
``Confrontation in Vienna'' (CPS, 1994). It opens with a class
reunion there in the early 1980's and traces his early years in the
Austrian capital until the Nazis took control of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other major titles in print include ``Handbook of Intensive
Brief and Emergency Psychotherapy'' (CPS, 1987), and, with Samm S.
Baker, ``Reading Faces'' (CPS, 1981.).
</P>
<P>
   Bellak, who was an early advocate of walk-in psychiatric clinics
in hospitals, regularly appeared on television talk shows
discussing a wide variety of psychiatric issues. He also narrated a
series, ``The Human Mind,'' for PBS, exploring consciousness from
ancient times to the days of Freud and on to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between my bald head and my Viennese accent,'' he said on that
occasion, in 1982, ``I guess I represent psychiatry.''
