 &HT;    First lady is Democrats' as N.Y.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albany, N.Y. _ It's official.
</P>
<P>
   It was just before 9:30 p.m. Tuesday when first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton formally accepted the nomination of New York's state
Democratic party as its candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in frequent applause by President Clinton and 11,500
othersat the party's annual convention, Mrs. Clinton completed a
journey that had begun nearly 11 months ago. She eventually reached
into all 62 counties in New York and took the role of presidential
spouse into vast, unexplored territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the chance of a lifetime,'' Mrs. Clinton said near the
end of a 40-minute speech that touched on such grand themes as the
need to unite all Americans across class and race lines, as well as
more specific concerns, such as affordable health care and
broadband access for all of New York. ``The test we will be judged
on is whether we, as a party and a people, are up to meeting this
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken was the name of New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who had been presumed to be her Republican opponent until
a prostate cancer diagnosis and marital woes cropped up about three
weeks ago. Giuliani hasn't yet decided whether to pursue the
nomination at his party's convention May 30 _ but the first lady
indicated she didn't care who she runs against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake _ this election is not about me or any
Republican opponent,'' she said, pausing slightly for emphasis.
``It's about the people of New York and our common mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton may be breaking ground as the first first lady to
run for national elective office, but she still got the traditional
red, white and blue balloon drop at the close of the event in the
Pepsi Arena in this capital city about 150 miles north of
Manhattan. Indeed, the evening had all the trappings of a standard
political convention, from the Dixieland band and bunting outside
the arena to the colorful signs and frequently purplish prose
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But much about it also felt unprecedented, starting with the
candidate herself and the singleminded determination of nearly
everyone present to unite in support of her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton's nomination was never in doubt _ a party
official who jokingly, yet traditionally, asked for the names of
other nominees was practically booed out of the arena _ some drama
did hang over the event.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the candidate didn't know if her husband would be
here. On Tuesday, President Clinton made it clear how far he's
willing to go to help his wife win a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not yet registered to vote in New York,'' the president
said during a Rose Garden ceremony, ``but I intend to register to
vote for her in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the huge crowd stood twice to applaud the
president, who sat to his wife's right on the stage with Democatic
Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring, and Charles
Schumer, who nominated her. One prolonged round of applause was
prompted by the first lady's own tribute to her frequently
embattled husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted the president is here this evening and I am so
grateful for his support,'' Mrs. Clinton said as Schumer and
Moynihan leapt to their feet, practically pulling the president up
with them. ``I would not be standing here tonight if it were not
for Bill and all he has done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani, who met privately with doctors earlier in the
day to discuss his cancer treatment, was not mentioned Tuesday
night, he made his presence felt. Minutes before the kilt-clad,
bagpipe-blaring Albany Police Fife and Drum Corps presented the
colors at 5:30 p.m., Giuliani's campaign e-mailed reporters a
statement accusing Mrs. Clinton of trying to ``reinvent'' herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still only one candidate in this race with the record
of success and follow-through that has improved the lives of New
York families,'' the statement continued. ``When New Yorkers think
about their futures, about lower taxes, new and better jobs, health
and education reform, safer neighborhoods and a better quality of
life, they think about Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the delegates here, this day was all about Mrs. Clinton
and a singular moment in time.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lori Garel, 12, who missed a day of school in the Bronx to
ride a bus here with her mother, Pat: ``I'm excited because the
first lady is running for Senate and maybe president some day. And
it's about time.''

FRUSTRATION AND LOSSES MOUNT FOR THE YANKEES  
 BY BUSTER OLNEY  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jorge Posada retreated to the runway leading from the
Yankees' dugout, trying to hide from prying eyes, and he smashed
his bat in a rage, hammering it against a wall once, twice, a third
time.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is mounting for the Yankees, who cannot get hits
these days, cannot score runs, cannot win. They lost their fifth
straight game Tuesday night, by 4-0 to the Chicago White Sox, while
managing just three hits against Cal Eldred and two relievers at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have scored three runs or fewer in four of the last
five games. Orlando Hernandez (4-3) allowed two runs in eight
innings, but for the second straight start the Yankees could not
score for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not merely in an offensive funk, some temporary
condition, like an annoying runny nose. They have played nearly a
quarter of their season and rank next to last in the American
League in scoring, and this is a full-blown epidemic of scoreless
innings.
</P>
<P>
   They found no cure in the early innings against Chicago's Cal
Eldred, who began the game with a 2-2 record and a 5.36 earned run
average. It's getting somewhat monotonous, Paul O'Neill said the
other day, to constantly say that the opposing pitcher threw a good
game. It's about time the Yankees started hitting, O'Neill added.
But Eldred did have good stuff Tuesday night, a fastball that ran
and sunk and sailed.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox were trying to be patient against Hernandez,
taking his first pitch repeatedly, and they could not score in the
first four innings, either. But with one out in the fifth,
Hernandez threw a fastball on the outer half of the plate to the
burly Carlos Lee, and Lee launched a high fly, the ball soaring and
carrying into the seats in left field, above where the Yankees'
Shane Spencer stood and watched.
</P>
<P>
   Just one run. To a team that cannot get hits, to the Yankees, it
must have seemed like 20 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer lined a single leading off the fifth for the Yankees'
first hit and the 31,143 fans roared enthusiastically, with
anticipation of the rally they have come to expect. Then Spencer
was quickly erased when Scott Brosius grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Eldred bounced a fastball off the left shoulder of Clay
Bellinger, and with Bellinger running on the pitch to the next
batter, Chuck Knoblauch lined a single into center field, Bellinger
taking third. Ricky Ledee came to bat, under growing pressure to
produce runs, and he coaxed a walk from Eldred, loading the bases
for O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred challenged O'Neill with high fastballs, O'Neill fouling
off three in a row. With the count 1-2, Eldred whipped another
fastball, O'Neill swung, the ball climbing away from his bat and
toward left field. Fans roared, but O'Neill knew: He ambled toward
first base, knowing it was not enough, knowing Lee would settle
under the ball easily and make the catch well in front of the
warning track.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' frustration continued in the next inning. After
Tino Martinez singled, Posada swung at one pitch wildly, as if
desperate to hit a two-run homer, and fouled the ball back. He
eventually struck out, then snapped in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko smashed a triple opening the seventh, and Chris
Singleton _ one of those former Yankees whose name haunts club
officials _ drove a double down the left-field line, scoring
Konerko. The White Sox led, 2-0. He added a hit-and-run single in
the ninth inning to set up Chicago's two-run rally against Mariano
Rivera. &QL;

C. ERIC LINCOLN, 75, EXPERT ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ala., Tenn.)   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, author of several of the most important
scholarly works on the religious experience of black Americans,
died May 14 at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and
heart trouble, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln wrote ``The Black Muslims in America,'' the first
scholarly examination of the movement, and was a co-author of ``The
Black Church in the African-American Experience,'' a landmark study
of the political and social influence of religious institutions in
black America.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, professor emeritus of religion and culture at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., where he taught from 1976 to 1993,
wrote or edited more than 20 other books, including ``The Avenue,
Clayton City,'' a novel published in 1988, for which he won the
Lillian Smith Book Award for Best Southern Fiction, and a series of
books in the 1970s called the C. Eric Lincoln Series in Black
Religion.
</P>
<P>
   An ordained United Methodist minister, his friendships and
expertise were truly ecumenical. He was a friend of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Alex Haley, and in 1990 was
cited by Pope John Paul II for ``scholarly service to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the tradition of African-American public
intellectuals, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, John Hope Franklin and John
Henrik Clarke,'' said Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of religious
studies at DePaul University in Chicago. ``He was able to translate
lofty concepts into ideas understandable by the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Forbes, senior minister of the Riverside Church
in New York City, called Lincoln a ``Renaissance man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a poet, a hymn writer, a novelist, a horticulturist, an
expert on architecture and a gourmet cook,'' Forbes said. ``He was
a publisher and the promoter of the publishing careers of young
scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1961, ``The Black Muslims in America'' remains the
authoritative text on the organization. ``After 40 years, it still
remains the gold standard, as far as background and history on the
Nation of Islam,'' said Steven Barboza, author of ``American
Jihad,'' a collection of interviews with Muslims in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Church in the African-American Experience,''
co-written with Lawrence H. Mamiya, was based on 10 years of study
and fieldwork. In a 1990 review in The New York Times Book Review,
Forbes called the volume an ``important study'' that provided a
``long-needed'' look at the black church and gives the reader ``a
portrait of black churches that reflects their complexity and
variety,'' thereby ``translating general impressions into solid
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Eric Lincoln was born in Athens, Ala., on June 23, 1924.
He was abandoned first by his father, then by his mother, and was
brought up by his maternal grandmother, Mattie Sowell Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from a Protestant high school in Athens and was the
valedictorian. He went to Chicago, where he worked and studied,
before traveling to Memphis, where he graduated from LeMoyne
College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he received a master's of philosophy from Fisk
University in Nashville. He received a bachelor of divinity degree
from the University of Chicago in 1956 and was ordained a United
Methodist minister the next year. He earned a master's in education
and a doctorate in social ethics in 1960 from Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Before devoting himself full time to academic life, he worked as
a sales representative for Pepsi Cola, a manager for a Memphis
nightclub and a road manager for the Birmingham Black Barons
baseball team. His teaching career included positions at Brown
University and the University of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is survived by his second wife, the former Lucy Cook of
Durham, four children, Hillary Anne Lincoln of Durham, Less C.
Lincoln of Atlanta, Joyce Lincoln of Memphis and Cecil Eric Lincoln
of Memphis; a brother, William Blye of Chicago; and six
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, the impact of race motivated Lincoln's
academic work, said his son Less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to understand about my dad and racism is that it was
a studyable adversary to him,'' Lincoln said. ``It is something we
can have control over. Through education and awareness, it can be
eradicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln had been recording his thoughts and observations on the
subject for in a series of notebooks for more than 50 years. Those
notebooks and most of his personal possessions were destroyed in a
fire at his home in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's last book, ``Coming Through the Fire,'' published in
1996, was a distillation of his thoughts on race. In the book, he
calls for ``no-fault reconciliation _ the recognition that we are
all of a kind, with the same vulnerabilities, the same
possibilities and the same needs for God and each other.''

URBAN RUNOFF THREATENS HEALTH OF REGION'S SHORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Southern California's legendary beaches -
inspiration of Beach Boys tunes and ``Baywatch'' backdrops - are
confronted with major problems from water pollution to
overdevelopment, according to a study of the nation's coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The study - compiled by the Surfrider Foundation, an Orange
County-based advocacy group - was based on some 50 factors, ranging
from water quality to public access to weather. The ``State of the
Beaches'' report included a top-10 list of the nation's best
beaches, with two from Southern California - Newport Beach and
Santa Barbara's East Beach - making the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The group didn't even rate Los Angeles County's beaches, which
have been repeatedly criticized for serious pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban runoff is the single biggest threat to California's
receiving waters,'' said Surfrider Executive Director Chris Evans.
``In the short term it shuts beaches down. We don't really know in
the larger scheme everything it does to marine life, but it's bad
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Runoff contains anything that washes down storm drains, from
pesticides to dog waste to hazardous chemicals. The drains,
intended to carry rainwater, often empty close to the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the beaches that seem to be chronically
polluted over the years include Malibu's Surfrider Beach, Will
Rogers State Beach and Santa Monica's beach near its pier, said
Marc Gold, executive director of Heal the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The pier, he said, is especially unhealthy because pigeons tend
to congregate there, while fishermen and others tend to toss food
waste off the pier.
</P>
<P>
   A storm-water diversion project is going to be built near the
pier within two to three years that will capture dry weather runoff
and pump it into the sewer system for treatment, rather than
sending it untreated straight to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, Gold says he has seen little improvement in the
area's beaches over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done a very good job of reducing our polluted
runoff problems,'' he said. ``That's obviously the largest water
quality problem not only in L.A. County, but Southern California
and the nation. It's something that's not being adequately
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that California has some of the most stringent
policies on water quality monitoring, thanks to a new state law
passed two years ago. Unfortunately, the group said, that means the
beach closure rates are higher here than most other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's better than a lot of states at public water
quality posting,'' Evans said. ``That may explain why we have a lot
of hot results for dirty beaches. The water is definitely tested
more in California than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many states have loose standards for testing and poor
public notification, it is difficult to measure how they stack up
in terms of water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers feel the brunt of ill effects since they spend the most
time in the water, often in the same locations day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu surfer Jeff Duclos has gotten what he calls the ``hat
trick'' of beach-related illnesses over the years - ear infections,
sinus infections and rashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a dubious badge of honor,'' said Duclos, who
co-chairs Surfrider's Malibu branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories of surfers who surf Malibu are consistent - ear
infections, sinus infections, rashes, fevers. There's a whole
litany of things you can get. It seems quite clear that it's not
coincidental and it clearly has to do with the degraded condition
of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   County health officials say every individual has to make an
effort to help Southern California's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should just be more aware of what they're dumping on
the ground,'' said Richard Kebabjian, chief of the county health
department's recreational health program. ``They should pick up
after dog droppings. They should pick up after horse manure from
stables - anything that will run out to the environment or make its
way into a flood control channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is overdevelopment of structures along
California's beaches, Evans said. But it is difficult to know the
extent of the problem because of a lack of available information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now in California, nobody knows the answer to this
question: What percentage of the California coast is armored with
hard structures like seawalls, jetties and groins?'' Evans said.
``How can the Coastal Commission issue the next permit if they
don't know what's the cumulative effect of everything that's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been four beach closures in Los
Angeles County, the same as for all of 1999, Kebabjian said. Beach
closures generally result from an extraordinary event, such as a
broken sewer line. Postings about water quality go up when bacteria
counts pass certain levels. There are typically one or two postings
every day somewhere in the county, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County has had two beach closings so far this year,
according to a county official.
</P>
<P>
   California, with its 1,100 miles of shoreline and tougher
testing standards, usually leads the nation in beach closures,
according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. In 1998, the
state had 3,273 closings and advisories out of 7,236 nationwide,
according to Ann Notthoff, the group's California advocacy
director.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. County had 147 closings and advisories that year, while
Ventura County had 237. San Diego County, by contrast, had 877,
while Orange County had 498. Figures for 1999 have not been
compiled yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Surfrider Foundation's report was mostly funded by Mazda of
North America, which provided $100,000.

RATES HEAD HIGHER, BUT CONSUMERS AREN'T DETERRED _ YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In an effort to dampen consumer spending and
cool an overheated economy, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised
interest rates by half a point, pushing a key rate to its highest
level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, from 6 percent to 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks immediately reacted by announcing they were
raising their prime lending rates by half a point, which will
affect millions of dollars in consumer and business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Bank and Bank of America bumped their rates from 9
percent to 9.5 percent effective today. Firstar raised its rate the
same way, but the increase was effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But if the hot Kansas City housing market is any indication, the
rate increase may not have the effect Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
envisioned. Some consumers remain unfazed by interest-rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Mary Hunzinger of Lee's Summit, for example, locked in
a home loan on Tuesday at 9 percent, just as banks were bumping up
interest rates. And he still thought he got a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing was getting the house we wanted in the
price range we wanted,'' Jeff Hunzinger said. He doesn't think
consumers are going to be overly influenced by a bump in rates.
``We're in fairly prosperous times right now. Most people are
living well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether we will continue to live well is, of course, at the crux
of the central bank's actions. Fed policy-makers worry that
consumer demand for homes, cars and other goods and services
spurred by the boom economy is too much for the available supply of
labor and produced goods.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this predicament, the Fed warned, ``could foster
inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
outstanding performance.'' This was the sixth time the Fed has
increased the funds rate since last June, but it was the single
biggest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is saying, `Hold it folks, you are too optimistic,'
'' said Sheryl Garrett, a Kansas City-area certified financial
planner. ``Our companies aren't going to continue having so much
productivity. Technology can't solve all our problems. We still
need human beings to do the work. And we're running out of human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, any encroaching doomsday scenario might seem
theoretical at best to many consumers, especially in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunzingers reflect a strong housing market in which home
values have surged, despite rates rising about 2 percentage points
in less than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson County alone, more than 2,666 homes were sold through
April. While that's down from 3,065 homes sold during the same
period last year, it's still as peppy as the boom years of 1996 and
1997, when interest rates were closer to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only thing holding back more record home sales is
the lack of enough finished new homes to sell, said Jerry Meyer, a
veteran senior salesman for Century 21 Heartland and number
cruncher for the Johnson County (Kan.) Board of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The overall economy grew at a fast 5.4 percent annual rate
during the first three months of this year. And a lot of the reason
was consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity and grew at rates that haven't been seen in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the nation is at a 30-year low of 3.9 percent.
In parts of metro Kansas City, it's less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the government reported that consumer prices, which had
risen earlier because of higher gas prices, remained unchanged in
April. But officials said the Fed remains worried that rapid
economic growth will spawn inflationary wage increases because of a
lack of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed hopes ...MORE

RATES HEAD HIGHER, BUT CONSUMERS AREN'T DETERRED _ YET

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...a lack of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed hopes that incremental rate increases will slow spending
and economic growth without bringing growth to a screeching halt or
into the unwanted abyss of a recession. It's a tricky balancing
act, one some economists view skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that we need to increase the cost to
business and consumers of taking out loans,'' said Peter Eaton,
director of the University of Missouri-Kansas City Center for
Economic Information. ``I'm not convinced we have to increase the
cost of production, because that means having to lay people off,
and that's where consumers get hurt directly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garrett believes the Fed move was necessary. ``Greenspan is
trying to reduce consumerism to make it less attractive for us to
go into debt,'' she said. ``It's like food. You need a certain
amount of food to survive. But if you overeat you will become
unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, convincing consumers is another thing. After all, they've
been encouraged to spend for a decade to spur the economy. And now
they're being told to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this debate _ are we tilting at windmills or not?''
said Dennis McKee, president of County Economic Research Institute,
the economic research institute in Johnson County. ``Consumer
confidence here and across the nation is high. It's historically
high. So people do feel good about their economic prospects. And so
they are willing to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll reach a point when the cost of credit is too
expensive, and that will slow us down. The cost of money to
business will be too much and their production will slow down. And
they'll add the cost to consumer goods.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the reality, the Fed's bold rate increase might be a
time for consumers to sit up and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   James Nutter Jr., executive vice president of James B. Nutter &AMP;
Co., a major Kansas City mortgage company, said it is key to watch
what the Fed does next.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy seeming in some areas to be picking up speed
in the last few months, there's a good chance he will continue to
raise rates,'' Nutter said. That means that consumers who still
want to spend must be savvy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Nutter, whose company gave the Hunzingers their
loan Tuesday, said that as interest rates rise, a fixed-rate
mortgage might offer more value. ``What I'd tell anyone is that if
they are thinking of buying a house, buy now.''
</P>
<P>
   While mortgage rates will register the greatest impact from the
rate increase, auto loans, credit cards and home equity loans will
also be affected to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Stewart, president and CEO of Metcalf Bank, said that so
far, rising interest rates ``haven't appeared to slow down the
consumer.'' But he said that consumers should begin planning their
borrowing more soberly and base it on what they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Car loan rates are expected to rise moderately, and so will some
lower-cost credit-card rates, though many Americans are already
conditioned to paying the higher credit-card rates.
</P>
<P>
   Home equity loans are expected to jump, making them less
attractive as vehicles to consolidate debt. Borrowing on the equity
of your home to invest in the stock market, an act of faith to
begin with, will turn into a reckless gamble, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is carrying debt is going to pay for it, if they
don't have a fixed rate,'' said Jeff Sheets, a spokesman for the
Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Savers, notably, stand to benefit from rising rates for
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed actions will have the most perilous effect on those
consumers who continue to borrow heavily beyond their means.
``Right now is the time to accelerate paying off your debt as much
as you can,'' Sheets said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who will be hurt most are the people carrying the
most debt and who can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Hunzingers were waiting optimistically, with
their new loan, to see if their offer on their new house was
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   What the Fed does or doesn't do, Jeff Hunzinger said, ``is not
going to affect us one way or another.''

`WORLD-CLASS TALENT' SIGNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Finally.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a week of talk that Mexican standout Luis Hernandez
would join the Galaxy, Ivan Gazidis, Major League Soccer's
executive vice president of player relations, announced the
completion of the deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud to sign a world-class talent such as Luis
Hernandez,'' Gazidis said in a press release. ``He is a unique
player whose on-field ability and dynamic personality are matched
by few players throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream of mine to make it big in the United
States,'' Hernandez said by telephone from Mexico. ``The time is
right for me to move on and experience soccer outside of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be going to a city I am very familiar with. I
love Los Angeles and look forward to scoring many goals for the
great fans of Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing couldn't have come at a better time for the Galaxy,
which had informed starters Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino and Roy
Myers last Wednesday that they would be headed to other teams in
order to pave the way for Hernandez's allocation to the Galaxy.
Mathis and Franchino didn't play in Saturday's match in Dallas and
none of the three will play in San Jose tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge, huge acquisition,'' Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid
said. ``We're talking about one of the premier forwards in this
part of the world. Luis is a proven scorer and someone who will
generate a lot of interest among our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding Hernandez to the Galaxy is the greatest addition MLS
has ever made,'' Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri said. ``Marco
Etcheverry (of D.C. United) is a great name and a big star, but I'd
have to rank Hernandez above him. ... Luis is a world-known name,
and he's proven himself in Mexico and in the World Cup. He has
lived up to his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will not join his new teammates in San Jose for
tonight's match against the Earthquake but is expected to arrive
Friday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Hernandez will make his MLS debut Saturday
night, when the Galaxy play D.C. United at the Rose Bowl. Galaxy
officials said 10,000 tickets have already been sold and they
expect as many as 50,000 for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis flew Tuesday to Monterrey, Mexico, to help put the
finishing touches on the deal with Hernandez and his Mexican club
team, Tigres of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   Although MLS doesn't release financial details, reports in
Mexico claim that the league paid a nearly $5 million transfer fee
to Tigres to buy Hernandez's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican publications reported ``El Matador,'' as Hernandez is
known, signed a three-year contract with MLS worth nearly $1.5
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has scored 35 goals in 73 appearances with the Mexican
national team. That ties him for the lead with former Galaxy
striker Carlos Hermosillo on the Mexican national team's all-time
scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 31, a two-time Mexican League Most Valuable Player
(1997 and '98), scored 13 goals for Tigres this season, more than
half of his team's total of 25. He scored four goals in four
matches for Mexico during the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hernandez is acclimated, Schmid said he doesn't expect it
to take long for his new forward to make an impact. When Carlos
Hermosillo joined the Galaxy in 1998, it took five or six games for
Hermosillo to become familiar with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will take Luis long at all,'' Schmid said.
``The way Luis plays is very conducive to our team. We use a lot of
speed, and he's all about speed, quickness and touch.''
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, New York/New Jersey picked Mathis and
New England took Franchino in the special dispersal draft to make
room for Hernandez. Myers also had to leave Los Angeles to help the
team comply with the league limit of four senior international
players per team and to clear salary cap room for Hernandez. Myers
was sent to New York/New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a world-class player and in turn had to part
with some young talent, but this has been a passion of ours and a
process that we helped create,'' Galaxy president Tim Leiweke said
in a press release. ``We strongly believe that Luis will be a major
factor in allowing the Galaxy to once again compete for the MLS
championship this year and for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we are receiving what will be one of the most
important and best players ever to play in Major League Soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   When paired with Cobi Jones on the Galaxy's front line,
Hernandez will help form a deadly combination of speed, skill and
hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want to say he's similar to Cobi, but I think
he's different,'' Schmid said. ``Luis is more of an 18-yard box
player than Cobi. For a player of his size (5-foot-7), he loves to
get in on the end of crosses and he's always popping up in
different places in the box. And like Cobi, he's got tremendous
speed.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday night accepted
the nomination of the New York Democratic Party for U.S. senator,
plunging into a race shrouded in confusion with a speech that
reflected her uncertain political reality: She still did not know
if her opponent this fall would be Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a political transposition. The Democratic
convention was based here in the state capital, but the attention
of the 11,500 Democrats who assembled in the Pepsi Arena, among
them the president of the United States, was firmly focused on New
York's City Hall. Right through Tuesday evening, Democrats were
still trading rumors that Giuliani was about to seize Mrs.
Clinton's spotlight by finally announcing whether his diagnosis of
prostate cancer and the public unraveling of his marriage would
lead to his exiting the race.
</P>
<P>
   In this extraordinarily unsettled atmosphere, the first lady _
indeed, all the Democrats who spoke during the five-hour session _
offered none of the kind of sharp partisan attacks on Giuliani that
would be customary at this kind of political gathering. Clinton's
acceptance speech presented her election as a contest between
political philosophies, an attack not on any candidate but on
Republican policies that the first lady's aides said would stand
whether her opponent ended up being Giuliani or another Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it: This election is not about me or any
Republican opponent,'' Clinton said. ``It's about the people of New
York and the common mission that we are pledged to. What is that
mission? I think it is to strengthen our families and to protect
our children, to improve our schools and to extend health care to
every New Yorker. To free our families and our communities from the
terror of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to describe the mission as ``to strengthen our
families, to protect our children, improve our schools and to
extend health care to every New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   The sole official task at hand for this gathering of 352
delegates, joined in the bleachers by an audience of thousands,
Democratic office-holders, activists and lobbyists, was to nominate
Clinton. They did that with a single shout of ``Aye!'' at 9:13
p.m., and then Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state Democratic
Party, went to the microphone and announced: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome the next senator of the United States,
Hillary Clinton, and the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic and confident tone of the session suggested how
far Clinton had come since she began traveling the state last
summer, a reflection both of what Democrats described as the
evolution of Clinton's political skills and of the recent
difficulties that have confronted Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   She was the unanimous choice of delegates here. No other
Democrat even managed to gather the 15 signatures needed to have
his or her name entered into nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a united Democratic Party. We're going to work in this
campaign; we're going to be victorious in November,'' Clinton told
a crush of reporters and state legislators who turned out to see
her at a prenomination reception sponsored by the Assembly speaker,
Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If the events here were largely predictable, the Democratic
Party took pains to take note of what transpired here in Albany: A
first lady was chosen for the first time to run for public office.
The words ``History in the Making'' were affixed to the front of
the lectern, and this city buzzed as the news spread that President
Clinton would accompany his wife to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Even on what should have been the most orderly of days, there
were touches of disorder throughout the evening, in keeping with
the history of both the Democratic Party of New York and the
nation's first family. With jockeying among elected officials for a
high-profile spot at this unusually high-profile convention, the
party was unable to produce a copy of its program until just 45
minutes before the convention was gaveled to order, and the
convention was running behind schedule within the hour.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to attend was a last-minute change of
course, the outcome of a debate in the first lady's camp over
whether his appearance would overshadow her on her day, or whether
it would seem odd for a candidate's spouse not to be by that
candidate's side at such an event.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and her aides were tinkering with her speech
until the last moment, just as her husband frequently does with
his.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign, which has pushed ahead full throttle even
in the midst of uncertainty about the candidate himself, had a
response to Clinton's speech out more than two hours before she was
scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how hard Mrs. Clinton tries to reinvent herself,''
said Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign,
``there is still only one candidate in this race with the record of
success and follow-through that has improved the lives of New York
families.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in some senses, a tricky political day for Clinton's
campaign, as it sought to balance competing forces _ taking
advantage of what should be a stellar moment in the campaign,
without seeming to be overly harsh toward Giuliani at a time of
personal difficulty for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Giuliani's name in a speech that went on
for 39 minutes. Her speech was, in fact, notably unadventurous, as
she endorsed a number of Democratic positions on issues that her
aides hope will be key in the campaign. Among them were gun
control, increasing the minimum wage, providing affordable health
care to all, and opposing broad-based Republican tax cuts in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, in terms of the length of her remarks as well as
the laundry-list presentation, her speech was reminiscent of the
State of the Union addresses that were given for eight years by the
man who sat silently behind her on the stage Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton smiled and clapped throughout the evening,
particularly when his wife firmly attached herself to his record
and offered an effusive tribute to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted that the president is here this evening,'' she
said, making no mention of the debate among her and her aides as to
whether he should attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I am so grateful for his support,'' she continued as the
hall fell silent. ``I would not be standing here tonight were it
not for Bill and were it not for all he has done for me, and I
could not be prouder as an American and as a New Yorker to have a
president who has meant so much to our country. We are a better
country than we were in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience rose in an ovation to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first lady seemed to be taking pains not to be too
partisan, Sen. Charles Schumer, the Democrat elected in 1998,
offered in his nomination speech a hint of the line of attack that
he has counseled her to use in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hillary's victory,'' Schumer said, ``we're going to tell
Trent Lott that he's no longer running the United States Senate.
We're going to tell Trent Lott that his dream of a Supreme Court
that overturns Roe vs. Wade and an NRA that writes all gun
legislation is dead, buried, gone with Hillary Rodham Clinton's
victory.''

YOUNG AUDIENCE SPENDS NEW MONEY ON ART 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Soaring prices and persistent bidding at Christie's
sale of contemporary art Tuesday night proved how few good works
are on the market these days and how much money people have to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices were scary,'' said Douglas Cramer, the television
producer and collector, after the sale. ``It was such a young
audience I thought for a moment I'd wandered into `Gladiator.' It
must be Internet money.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $14.4 million, just above its high estimate of
$14.1 million. Of the 55 works offered, only five failed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's defines contemporary art as works from 1970 to the
present. As a result, Tuesday's night's sale featured works by many
of today's fashionable artists, from Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst to
Matthew Barney and John Currin. Record prices were set for 15
artists, including Sigmar Polke, Thomas Struth and Charles Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of new, younger buyers,'' said Philippe
Segalot, head of contemporary art for Christie's worldwide. ``One
first-time buyer bought one of the top 10 works tonight, a Warhol
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale included a group of five works by Koons. And while not
all brought optimistically high prices, some did. The most
expensive work in the sale was his ``Woman in Tub,'' a 1988
sculpture of a woman sitting in a bubble bath, grabbing her
breasts, as someone with a snorkel attacks her from the bottom of
the tub in a scene reminiscent of the shower sequence in
``Psycho.'' Four bidders tried hard to buy the work, estimated at
$800,000 to $1.2 million, and it finally sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another top seller was ``Two Women,'' a 1968 dot painting by
Sigmar Polke. The painting, which depicts a pair of model-like
figures clad in short, fur-trimmed coats and knee-high boots, comes
from an unnamed German collection and was been exhibited only once,
in Frankfurt in 1983. German Pop paintings like this are hard to
find, but ``Two Women'' came with a hefty estimate: $1 million to
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop two bidders from wanting it badly. It sold to
Thomas H. Lee, founder of the Snapple beverage company and a
seasoned collector, for $1.6 million. It was almost twice the
previous record for the artist: $882,500, set in 1988 when
Christie's sold his ``Loesungen I-IV.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Christie's had given the sellers a guarantee _ a
undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the
seller, regardless of the sale's outcome _ of a reported $1.2
million. The gamble paid off.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the
first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates
do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Six bidders went for Gerhard Richter's ``Skull (545-3)'' a 1983
painting that is one of the artist's haunting series of a human
skull. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.4
million, more than twice its high estimate of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, an artist who has performed well at auction at Christie's
recently, made another record price, for ``Boy'' (1992), a painted
fiberglass, steel and fabric sculpture of a boy in short blue
pants, reaching out as if to shake someone's hand. Estimated at
$600,000 to $800,000, it sold for $886,000 to Larry Gagosian, the
dealer with galleries in New York, Los Angeles and London.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat brought such strong prices
last spring that Christie's included three Tuesday night. All sold,
but none above its high estimate. ``Glenn'' (1985), one of the
artist's classic graffiti paintings, dominated by a black head with
an angry open mouth, was expected to bring $600,000 to $800,000; it
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $732,000. Two other
Basquiats, ``All Colored Cast I'' and ``All Colored Cast II,'' both
from 1982, sold for $457,000 and $446,000, both to unidentified
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs by the German artist Thomas Struth have been sought
after recently. A 1992 photograph of the Pantheon in Rome,
estimated at $70,000 to $90,000, set a record for a contemporary
photograph, selling to an unidentified buyer for $270,000.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Antoni, the feminist Conceptual artist and sculptor, also
broke a record last night with ``Gnaw.'' This 1992 works consists
of two 600-pound cubes, one of chocolate and the other of lard,
both decorated with bite marks, along with two dozen heart-shaped
chocolate candy boxes and 300 lipsticks displayed in a mirrored
room on a glass shelf. Estimated at $80,000 to $100,000, it was
bought by Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the Manhattan dealer, for $204,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christie's catalog did not divulge the seller's name,
art-world experts say the seller was the British collector Charles
Saatchi. Part of Saatchi's vast collection of contemporary art was
shown at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last fall in ``Sensation: Young
British Artists From the Saatchi Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi helped to finance the show, as did Christie's, which
contributed $50,000. Both were said to be purposely using a museum
show to inflate the value of the artists on view. While Antoni is
an American artist and was not in ``Sensation,'' she has been a
trendy figure in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Christie's included 20th-century furniture
in its contemporary art sale because executives there thought it
would bring higher prices in the context of art. In some cases this
was probably true, but bidding was less competitive for these works
and tended to slow down the rest of the sale. ``Golden Eye Table,''
a polychromed wood and marble table by the 1980s Italian furniture
designer Ettore Sottsass, was expected to bring $20,000 to $30,000;
it sold for $30,550 to an unidentified telephone bidder. A giant
lamp, estimated at $30,000 to $40,000, sold to another telephone
bidder for $64,625.
</P>
<P>
   Four Warhols were on offer Tuesday night, all abstract images
and all with estimates that experts said were too high. The market
knew better; none performed as well as expected. But a 1984
``Untitled (Rorschach Series),'' sold to an unidentified first-time
auction buyer who was bidding by telephone for $424,000. While just
above the low estimate of $400,000, the price was still considered
a strong price even in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices amazed many of the more knowledgeable buyers in
the audience. Leaving Christie's on Tuesday night, Eli Broad, the
chairman of the Sun America financial services company and a Los
Angeles collector, called the sale ``heady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he asked. ``What happens when the economy softens?'' &QL;

   U.S.-CHINA-REACT (Brooklyn Park, Minn.) _ The American flag
flies over Wal-Mart in this Minneapolis suburb. The parking lot is
packed with Ford SUV's and Chrysler mini-vans. Even the stucco
facade is a patriotic melange of red, white and blue. Yet the
appeal of America's most successful retail chain, with its ``We
Sell for Less'' slogan emblazoned over the front door, stems in
part from the enormous low-cost production capacity of a far-away
nation that many people in this country view as a moral outcast and
potential military rival: China. From $16.95 Looney Tunes Tweetie
Birds to $5.94 Rawlings NCAA Final Four basketballs, Wal-Marts are
two-square-acre valentines to the idea that America should trade
with Communist China _ or, as President Clinton put it when
visiting a nearby farm late last week, ``reaching out a hand, not
shaking a clenched fist.'' But even as they fill their carts,
shoppers have their doubts. By Joseph Kahn.

   CHINA-WORKERS (Beijing) _ Up to 2,000 unpaid workers and
retirees have besieged their factory and government offices in a
northeastern city, Liaoyang, a city of 1.8 million in the Rust Belt
province of Liaoning. The protest is the latest example of growing
labor unrest as China's once-dominant state industries collapse. By
Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-CONSTITUTION (Paris) _ Since the French Revolution,
France has remodeled its constitution four times. Now it looks as
if the Fifth Republic, 52 years old, may soon be refashioned too. A
proposal to cut the president's term of office to five years from
seven is gaining support from political leaders on both the right
and the left. It is an idea that has been put forward many times
before but has died in one political tangle or another. But this
time it looks as if political interests may increase its chances.

Brooke Ellison, a quadriplegic from Long Island, is graduating from
Harvard early next month, having navigated the campus for four
years in a wheelchair she steers with an electronic touchpad near

the 3rd/4th/5th richest guy in the world (we're still figuring this

   GORE-ADVISERS (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore has
assembled a large team of foreign policy advisers whose members
could form the national security nucleus of a Gore administration.
The current role of the advisory group is somewhat nebulous,
however, since Gore has never relied on outsiders for advice on
foreign policy and the new panel has not yet contributed much of
substance to his campaign. The vice president has great faith in
his own national security experience and instincts. He has an
intimate, 20-year relationship with his national security alter
ego, Leon Fuerth, through whom all foreign policy information
flows. The vice president has participated in every major national
security debate over the past decade and has access to intelligence
and foreign policy expertise throughout the government. By John M.

   INTERNET-DETECTIVES (San Francisco) _ Within hours after a
destructive computer program began circulating this month, borne by
an e-mail marked ``I Love You,'' a handful of high-tech detectives
around the globe leaped into action. Scrutinizing clues left in the
computer code, and pursuing evidence accumulated in hidden corners
of cyberspace, the detectives homed in on several suspects in the
Philippines. But the detectives are unlikely to testify at trial,
or receive official commendation. That is because they are not
police officers, but ordinary citizens. They are among a growing
number of Net habitues turned cybersleuths whose work has become
vital to the pursuit of Internet criminals. These amateur
detectives are taking part in what the authorities say is
unprecedented cooperation between law enforcement and citizens. But
the police say the cooperation also is a mixed blessing. By Matt
Richtel.

   BATTLE OVER BATTLE FLAG
</P>
<P>
   If South Carolina lawmakers hoped that the NAACP would drop its
economic boycott now that they have agreed to move the Confederate
battle flag from the Statehouse dome, they had not counted on the
group's tenacity. Kweisi Mfume, the national president of the
group, said Tuesday that the NAACP might even consider expanding
the boycott beyond tourism, because the state plans to move the
banner to a flagpole in front of the State Capitol, near a monument
to Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group's original boycott resolution demanded that
the flag be moved out of a position of sovereignty, Mfume argued
that the flag was no less prominent in front of the building than
it was on top. The state Senate and House are expected to iron out
minor differences on a bill to move the flag in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   DECISION IN KENNEDY CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles city attorney declined Tuesday to file
misdemeanor battery charges against Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy,
D-R.I., over a confrontation with a security guard at Los Angeles
International Airport in March. The prosecutor's office summoned
Kennedy, 32, and the guard, Della Patton, 58, to a hearing last
week to review a videotape of the incident. Kennedy had earlier
acknowledged acting rudely and apologized, but he denied hurting
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   George L. Mallory Jr., a lawyer for Patton, who has complained
of shoulder pain and has not worked since the incident, said he
expected to approach Kennedy about a settlement and would sue if
those talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   GUBERNATORIAL EARLY BIRD
</P>
<P>
   It's a year early, but the 2001 gubernatorial race in Virginia
is already taking shape, with one self-made millionaire announcing
this week that he is stepping aside for another in the Democratic
competition. A former congressman, L.F. Payne Jr., a
Charlottesville developer who lost as the Democratic Party's
candidate for lieutenant governor in 1997, took himself out of the
running and endorsed Mark R. Warner, who heads a venture capital
firm in Alexandria. Payne said Warner had ``the right experience,
the right ideas and the right values'' to win the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's base is in rural conservative Democratic politics and he
showed his popularity in managing to finish ahead of the rest of
his ticket in the Democrats' bid to take the Statehouse in 1997.
But he conceded that Warner, whose base is in the northern suburbs,
had a dominant edge in organization and fund-raising among
high-tech corporate donors. In the meantime, Payne may take on an
organizational role in Warner's campaign. The Republican nomination
for governor next year is expected to be contested by Lt. Gov. John
H. Hager, who defeated Payne in 1997, and Attorney General Mark L.
Earley.
</P>
<P>
   `LIVE TAX FREE OR DIE'
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire announced Tuesday that she
would seek a third two-year term. But she did not say whether she
would renew her pledge to veto an income tax, which is seen by some
state leaders, albeit reluctantly, as the best way for the state to
respond to a court order to reform school financing.
</P>
<P>
   Year in and year out, taxes are the hottest political issue in
New Hampshire, a state that, along with Alaska, has no personal
income tax or general sales tax (its official motto is ``Live Free
Or Die'') and whose residents take great pride in roughing up
politicians who do not pledge to oppose new levies. Shaheen, a
Democrat, took ``the pledge'` in her 1996 and 1998 campaigns but
she has thus far avoided discussing what she might do in the 2000
campaign _ though she did agree to a temporary tax, at one point,
as the state initially tried to respond to the court
school-financing order.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Democratic primary, she will face state Sen. Mark
Fernald, who supports a state income tax to solve the school
problem. On the Republican side, four candidates are competing for
the nomination, with mixed views on the tax question. There is also
an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   PAYBACK TIME
</P>
<P>
   Call it political payback _ the kind with potential to undermine
party unity in one of this year's major presidential and
congressional battlegrounds: Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter circulated last week during the state's Republican
convention, Gov. John Engler and the state Republican Party
chairman, Rusty Hills, agreed to elect supporters of John McCain as
delegates to the Republican National Convention this summer in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, McCain won the Michigan primary in February,
upsetting Engler's candidate, George W. Bush. But by the time the
convention votes were in, McCain's primary victory had effectively
been overturned. Most of the 58 delegates selected for the national
convention were Bush backers. In protest, McCain, just days after a
peace parley with Bush, has canceled a trip to the state this
Friday that was to have benefited Sen. Spencer Abraham of Auburn
Hills and and a Republican House hopeful, Mike Rogers of Brighton,
both caught in tight contests that very well could be crucial in
determining control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hills said he and Engler signed the letter in good faith but
they had little control over the outcome.

RIVALS ASKING FLAKE TO RETURN CONSULTING FEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Two of Jeff Flake's Republican opponents in the 1st
Congressional District called on him Tuesday, May 16, to return the
$72,000-a-year consulting fee he is receiving from an Arizona
non-profit group.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the opponents, Tom Liddy of Chandler, suggested that
Flake's failure to act could jeopardize the GOP's credibility in
the race, which has attracted national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Republican, Jeff Flake ought to understand that he has
put our party in a bad situation, and he ought to put it right,''
Liddy said. ``It should either go back to Ira Fulton or to poor
kids, but it should not be in the pocket of a guy who is running
for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Money for Flake's fee was made available by a donation to the
Arizona School Choice Trust from Flake's campaign finance chairman,
Phoenix area developer Ira Fulton, an arrangement that should now
be reversed, according to two of Flake's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, May 16, Democrats followed through on their
promise to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
asking for an investigation into whether the consulting fee
represents an excessive campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaint to the FEC, Democrats allege that Flake has
inadequately accounted for the hours he says he has worked for the
non-profit group:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe . . . that no records exist
reflecting the amount of pledged time that Mr. Flake has spent
`consulting' with or for the School Choice Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Patterson, chairman of the board of the trust, told The
Arizona Republic last week that Flake has not been required to keep
regular hours at the organization or file regular paperwork there
because he is a contract worker.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to several board members interviewed by The
Republic, Flake has regularly attended board meetings to report on
his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP opponent, Susan Bitter Smith, agreed with Liddy that
Flake should return his fee, noting that last year, the School
Choice Trust had more applicants than it had dollars to provide
scholarships. She said repayment of the fee ``would be a good first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line victims of all of this are the kids that
didn't get funded,'' said Bitter Smith, who is also a former member
of the trust's board of directors. ``Returning it would be a start,
but I don't know if it fixes all the other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake, who did not return calls for comment, has defended the
consulting fee and its source, saying that Fulton never intended to
make a political contribution when he agreed to donate $50,000 to
the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Flake has also said that his services as a fund-raiser for the
School Choice Trust are well worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the consulting fee, Flake is helping the School
Choice Trust establish an employee payroll deduction program with
large Valley corporations that could help bring in thousands of new
donations to the group. Those duties, Flake has said, require him
to put in about 30 hours a week, mostly at night.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy also blasted the Democrats for disingenuously attempting
to make hay of the matter and suggested that Flake return the money
over time if he is unable to make a one-time payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should just pledge and commit to do it over a course of
time,'' Liddy said. ``We all have to be reasonable about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also called for Flake to repay his fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at a minimum, that is a good course of action,'' said
Cortland Coleman, executive director of the Arizona Democratic
Party. ``However, that will not deter our action in filing with the
FEC, the U.S. attorney or the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   The party intends to file separate complaints with the Internal
Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney's Office later this week. &QL;

BILINGUAL STUDENTS ATTAINING FLUENCY IN RECORD NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A record number of Los Angeles Unified students
learning English have achieved fluency in the first full school
year since passage of Proposition 227, a ringing endorsement for
proponents of the measure that ended bilingual education classes in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,400 students, or 10.3 percent of the district's
English learners, made the transition to fluency between December
1998 and December 1999, according to district records, compared
with 9.9 percent during the previous year and 8 percent in the last
year of bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Proposition 227, which voters overwhelmingly passed
in 1998, said the numbers vindicate their view that children can
learn English quickly without spending years in Spanish-language
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either it's 227, or it's a remarkable coincidence,'' said Ron
Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wrote the ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Many educators and Latino activists who opposed Proposition 227
aren't willing to concede just yet. They point out a number of
other factors that could have influenced students' performance,
including smaller class sizes, reading-intervention programs and a
greater number of teachers trained to work with English learners.
</P>
<P>
   But some, at least, confess relief that the predicted plunge in
student achievement following passage of the ballot initiative
never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I think it's positive that scores didn't crash, but
is it really working? It's too soon to tell,'' said Theresa
Fay-Bustillos, vice president of legal programs for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which opposed the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two years following Proposition 227's passage aren't
much time to assess the measure's impact. But the initial numbers
are encouraging, many educators said.
</P>
<P>
   Scores on the Stanford 9 standardized tests rose last year for
students with limited English speaking skills, although the
dramatic gains initially reported by many districts were due to an
error in grading the exams. Instead, scores for English-language
learners in Los Angeles rose by one or two percentage points in
most grades - roughly the same level of improvement shown by fluent
English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students who made the transition to fluency
increased from 24,851 in the last year before the proposition to
32,402 in the most recent tally, which runs from December 1998 to
December 1999. To make the switch, students must prove their
language skills on written and oral tests administered by the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers, including Canoga Park instructor Sheryl Rosario,
said the immersion classes in which most English learners are now
enrolled can teach students how to speak the language, and do it
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is working,'' she said, as her kindergarten and
first-grade pupils, who don't speak fluent English, wrote sentences
on sheets of lined paper. ``If you keep giving them Spanish,
they're just going to give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with that assessment. But all agree
Proposition 227 greatly changed the way Los Angeles Unified teaches
English-language learners, who comprised nearly 45 percent of the
district's student population in 1998-99, the last year for which
data was available.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 84,626 elementary school pupils attended
English-immersion classes within the district. An additional
109,241 students attended another type of class that allows
teachers to give some help in a second language, although most of
the instruction must be in English. And 21,941 students were placed
in bilingual classes at their parents' request, a right they
retained after the proposition was passed.
</P>
<P>
   District officials, while not discounting the proposition's
impact, said it can't be the sole factor behind the rising number
of English-fluent students.
</P>
<P>
   Some year-round schools, for example, didn't begin implementing
the proposition until January 1999. The changes at those schools,
therefore, could contribute to the rise in the fluency transitions
recorded by last December but not to the more substantial gains
made the year before.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they said, other forces have been at work. The
district has increased its training programs for teachers who work
with English-learners. It has launched extensive reading
intervention programs during the past year as part of its effort to
end social promotion, the practice of advancing underachieving
students to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   And it has made the rate of students making the transition to
fluency a key figure used in assessing each school's overall
performance. Schools don't face penalties if they post lackluster
rates, but teachers and district officials said the increased
emphasis has an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you put that into your accountability system, of course
schools are going to pay more attention to it,'' said Rita Caldera,
an administrator in the district's language acquisition branch.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers like Rosario make the immersion classes work through a
combination of patience and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Her students don't always breeze through lessons. When they come
back from breaks spent in Spanish-speaking households, Rosario will
endure a few mute stares while students try to remember the
language she works so hard to teach them. Sometimes she has to mime
instructions when a student can't catch the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell a kid, Please push your chair in, and they'll just
stare at me. So I'll have to model it. I'll say, This is your
chair. Push it in,'' she said, gently moving a child-size chair
under a desk as she spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Fay-Bustillos said that while she's encouraged that students
seem to be adapting to English-immersion classes, she wonders
whether they will pick up enough of the concepts being taught to
excel at later grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're going to witness in a classroom is verbal
fluency,'' she said. ``But that's not the same as literacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is grateful that the wrenching debate over
Proposition 227 and its aftermath have forced Californians to pay
attention to the education students with limited English skills
receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a welcome focus,'' she said. ``It wasn't there
before.''

EDITORIAL: MRS. CLINTON`S MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   In her first outing as a candidate for elective office, Hillary
Rodham Clinton has demonstrated a firm grasp of a basic rule of
politics. That is the one about never interfering when your
opponent is being engulfed with bad news. Indeed, Clinton has
campaigned with such quiet decorum during Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
travails that the public may be tempted to overlook the
accomplishment represented by her formal nomination on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since she entered the Senate race, Clinton has
molded herself into a formidable candidate, matching Giuliani in
the polls even before a combination of health and marital problems
put his candidacy in doubt. To do that, she survived a blizzard of
rookie mistakes and learned, by her own admission, that being a
candidate is much harder than coaching a spouse on how to run. She
seems more willing to campaign outside the moving cocoon provided
by her White House connection. She has managed to contain, if not
totally defuse, the carpetbagger issue. While she will never be a
spellbinding orator, she sticks with discipline to a message
designed to rally core Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton began with the advantages of fame,
connections and money, her candidacy also carried a risk of
self-destruction through bad performance. Neither President Clinton
nor her advisers could shield her from that. To have emerged as at
least an even bet for victory this fall is an accomplishment that
no one should begrudge her.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd, then, that her moment of adulation by 8,000
Democrats at the state convention should be overshadowed by
suspense over Giuliani's future. But this is a novelistic campaign,
even by New York standards. The story turns for the moment on a
question that may lie beyond political calculation, and that is
whether Giuliani's prostate cancer is susceptible to a treatment
that will leave him the time and energy to run. Depending on how
that is settled, other issues may come into play. For example, by
admitting to a relationship outside his marriage, Giuliani may have
pushed American or, at least, New York politics toward a new rule
book on the political impact of private behavior. Or he may have
moved some members of blocs he will need in a tight election _
suburban Republican wives, for example _ toward his opponent.
Another theory is that a hubristic and perhaps self-destructive
mayor will seem humanized by illness and romantic conflict. He
might then, according to this reasoning, actually run better
against a first lady who, for all her success inside the Democratic
Party, is still a divisive figure for many voters.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the Republicans have to turn elsewhere for a
candidate? There is no shortage of eager congressmen, led by Rick
Lazio and Peter King. Gov. George Pataki would clearly be the GOP's
strongest runner, but that would mean risking his national
aspirations on a late-starting effort. Republican leaders have gone
forward cautiously with such speculations, properly reluctant to be
seen as pressuring Giuliani about a difficult and upsetting medical
dilemma. Similarly, the Democrats at Albany on Tuesday night were
put on notice by party leaders to avoid gloating or overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   But it is beyond human nature to suspend curiosity and even
amazement about one of the most riveting Senate races in decades.
No one could have foreseen both the political impact of fate and
his personal choices on Giuliani's campaign. Similarly, no one
could have guaranteed that Clinton would move with such relative
ease from untested newcomer to nomination by acclamation, as she
did on Tuesday night.

EDITORIAL: BEHIND THE RATE HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates Tuesday,
and Wall Street cheered. The textbooks say that higher interest
rates are supposed to draw investors out of the stock market and
into the bond market. Yet the Dow Jones stock market index rose
more than 125 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason appears straightforward. Investors were worried that
inflation was beginning to creep up and that the Fed might be
waiting too long to push it back down. They feared that if
inflation kept rising, the Fed might be forced to crack down hard
in the future, a reaction that would knock the economy off its
high-growth path. So Wall Street reacted warmly when the Fed raised
short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, double the
size of each of the five previous rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction is as much psychological as financial. A
quarter-point rate increase carries about as much economic wallop
as a half-point increase. What is really going on is a signaling
game. By choosing the larger of two possible rate hikes, the Fed
signaled to businesses, workers and investors that it intends to
clamp down on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The economy remains strong. Unemployment has fallen below 4
percent. Spending rose by more than 8 percent at the beginning of
the year, a pace few economists believe can continue without
creating shortages and a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   What worries the Fed are the first signs that inflation is
rising above 2 percent a year, a beneficial target. Consumer prices
have risen by 3 percent over the past year. Even subtracting out
energy and food, two volatile sectors, prices rose slightly more
than 2 percent. There is nothing alarming about these numbers _
indeed, producer price inflation remains low _ but fears remain
that rapid growth is beginning to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking fact is how slowly wages are rising in the face of
severe labor shortages. Indeed, only in the past few years have
wages risen faster than prices. The best way to create room for
wages to rise further is to keep the economy growing. For that to
happen, the Fed believes it must convince everyone that inflation
will remain under tight control. That is what the Fed said it would
do Tuesday. Wall Street believed what it heard.

KARL SHAPIRO, 86, PRIZE-WINNING POET 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Shapiro, whose mordant verse, written when he was a young
soldier in New Guinea in World War II, earned him a Pulitzer Prize
in 1945, died May 14 at a hospice in New York City. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most embroidered adjectives could describe the success
Shapiro achieved in his early days. His recognition was instant,
his acclaim was broad-based, his readers anticipatory, his future
boundless. Louise Bogan wrote in The New Yorker in 1942 that
Shapiro was ``on all grounds, the finest young American talent to
appear in many seasons,'' and Selden Rodman, writing in The New
Republic, called Shapiro a ``true spokesman for our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro earned such praise for poems like ``Elegy for a Dead
Soldier,'' which appeared in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``A white sheet on the tailgate of a truck
</P>
<P>
   Becomes an altar; two small candlesticks
</P>
<P>
   Sputter at each side of the Crucifix
</P>
<P>
   Laid round with flowers brighter than the blood,
</P>
<P>
   Red as the red of our apocalypse
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus that a marching man will pluck
</P>
<P>
   To stick into his rifle or his hat,
</P>
<P>
   And great blue morning-glories pale as lips
</P>
<P>
   That shall no longer taste or kiss or swear.
</P>
<P>
   The wind begins a low magnificat,
</P>
<P>
   The chaplin chants, the palmtrees swirl their hair,
</P>
<P>
   The columns come together through the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and early '60s he edited Poetry magazine and
then Prairie Schooner and published much poetry and criticism. But
in time his recognition faded, his acclaim evaporated, his readers
appeared distracted, even fickle, and his future proved much more
limited than anyone imagined on that spring day in 1945 when the
young veteran dropped by Columbia University to have lunch and pick
up his Pulitzer for ``V-Letter and Other Poems.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review,
could say that Shapiro had become ``more a name than a presence.''
The Journal of the American Medical Association once mistakenly
included him in a list of writers who had committed suicide, and in
1978 he showed up as a ``late U.S. poet'' in a crossword puzzle in
The Times. He sued the AMA (which settled out of court, Shapiro
said) and called his 1990 autobiography ``Reports of My Death.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, he acknowledged that he had spent more
than 20 years trying to stem a decline of interest in his work. To
be ``put on a pedestal before your clay was dry was to invite
disaster,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Kizer, who won her own Pulitzer Prize for poetry 40
years after Shapiro won it, wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1985
that Shapiro not only invited disaster ``but lusted after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some poets, however, who continued to believe in Shapiro's work.
Stanley Kunitz and David Ignatow put together an anthology of
Shapiro's poems to be published in 1998 called ``The Wild Card:
Selected Poems, Early and Late'' (University of Illinois Press).
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview, Kunitz agreed that as Shapiro grew older,
``there was a waning of invention, the freshness of his work did
seem to lessen.'' But he asserted that he was ``one of the most
neglected poets'' and that ``the protean nature of Shapiro's work''
was such that it deserves to be reevaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz said that Shapiro's decline was due more to his roiling
the literary waters and angering critics than to the loss of
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offended many in the literary culture with a certain
brashness of tone in voice, a refusal to be conciliatory,'' Kunitz
said. ``He was a guy who took great chances. He was a gambler. He
played the wild card for high stakes and this is not what the
academician/critics wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article for The Times Book Review in 1959 that drew wide
attention, Shapiro shocked readers and fellow poets alike when he
wrote that he thought poetry was ``a diseased art,'' and he made no
bones about his belief that he thought the principal carriers of
the disease were such modern poets as T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens,
Marianne Moore, Yeats and Ezra Pound.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro likened Eliot and Pound to Jekyll and Hyde and said that
if Eliot appeared to be the more savory of the two it was only
``because of his identification with the British church and
state.'' In Shapiro's view, Walt Whitman was the only world-class
poet America had produced.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers he thought worth reading were William Carlos
Williams, Dylan Thomas and Henry Miller. ( Shapiro thought so much
of Miller that he wrote an introduction to a 1961 edition of
Miller's ``Tropic of Cancer,'' which for 20 years had been
suppressed in the United States as obscene.)
</P>
<P>
   In a famous episode in American letters, Shapiro years earlier
had also found himself a lonely figure on the poetry barricades. In
November 1948, the Fellows in American Letters of the Library of
Congress, an advisory body, met to award the first Bollingen Prize
in Poetry for the best book of verse by an American poet during the
previous year. The fellows were Shapiro, Leonie Adams, Conrad
Aiken, W.H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Katherine Garrison Chapin, T.S.
Eliot, Paul Green, Robert Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter, Theodore
Spencer, Allen Tate, Willard Thorp and Robert Penn Warren.
</P>
<P>
   After several ballots, the prize went to Ezra Pound for ``The
Pisan Cantos.'' Only two fellows, Chapin and Shapiro, voted for
another author, William Carlos Williams, and Green abstained.
</P>
<P>
   During the war years, Pound was in Italy delivering pro-Fascist
radio broadcasts. By V-E Day, May 8, 1945, he was in the custody of
the United States Army in Genoa, then was confined at Pisa until
November, when he was brought to Washington. Three months later,
having been declared psychologically unfit to stand trial on
treason charges, he was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital. He
was still there when he was awarded the Bollingen.
</P>
<P>
   Pound's award on Feb. 20, 1949 met widespread criticism in the
press and in Congress. The Library of Congress withdrew from
awarding the prize. Pound received his $1,000, but the Library
returned $9,000 to the Bollingen Foundation, which later granted
the money to the Yale University Library so that the prize could
continue. Shapiro received a Bollingen Prize himself in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After he publicly disassociated himself from the award to Pound,
he recalled, ``I was suddenly forced into a conscious decision to
stand up and be counted as a Jew. Jewish organizations got in touch
with me, Jewish papers wanted me to write things for them, make me
a spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a role with which he could ever feel entirely
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he wrote poems about the Jewish experience and about
the war, he always wanted to be regarded as just a poet, not a
soldier poet or a Jewish poet. Indeed, he became quite interested
in Christianity, at one point studying to become a Catholic. But he
regarded himself as ``above religion.''

   Carl Jay Shapiro was born in Baltimore on Nov. 10, 1913, the son
of Joseph Shapiro, a traveling salesman, and the former Sarah
Omansky. As an adult, he legally changed the spelling of his first
name, substituting the ``K'' for the ``C.'' His family moved to
Chicago when he was 6 but returned to Baltimore when he was 16.
There he finished high school and began to write poetry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of Baltimore he once wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera of my eye depicts
</P>
<P>
   row-houses and row-lives;
</P>
<P>
   glass after glass, door after door the same
</P>
<P>
   face after face the same, the same,
</P>
<P>
   the brutal visibility the same.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He had an unsatisfying stint at the University of Virginia and
studied music at the Peabody Institute. He played the piano and
considered poetry ``the music of language.'' With financial aid
from an uncle, Shapiro's first slim volume of poems was published
in 1935 by a friend of his uncle's, a publisher of medical
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro then won a scholarship to Johns Hopkins University but
stayed there only two years. He left to seek work, but shortly
before the United States formally entered World War II, he was
drafted into the Army. He never earned a degree.
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to a medical unit and sent to New Guinea. After
he witnessed the amputation of a soldier's leg in New Guinea, he
wrote a poem that began:
</P>
<P>
   ``One day beside some flowers near his
</P>
<P>
   nose
</P>
<P>
   He will be thinking, When will I look
</P>
<P>
   at it?
</P>
<P>
   And pain, still in the middle distance,
</P>
<P>
   will reply
</P>
<P>
   At what? He knows it's gone,
</P>
<P>
   O where! and begin to tremble and cry.
</P>
<P>
   He will begin to cry as a child cries
</P>
<P>
   Whose puppy is mangled under a
</P>
<P>
   screaming wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   After his ``V-Letter and Other Poems'' won the Pulitzer, his
verse was sought after in many anthologies. A year later, he
attracted more attention with his ``Essay on Rime,'' also written
in New Guinea. It discussed ``rime'' in its widest connotation, and
it was noteworthy for its intellectual acuity, the scholarship for
which was evident even though it had been created without
consulting any books. F.O. Matthiessen, reviewing it in The Times
Book Review, said, ``The book may very well be the most remarkable
contribution to American art yet to have come out of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   But certain others found it disturbing. Delmore Schwartz,
reviewing it for The Nation, took offense at Shapiro's condemnation
of intellectuals _ Shapiro wrote that he'd rather be a milkman or
barber than an intellectual. Years later, Shapiro wrote a foreword
to the ``Letters of Delmore Schwartz'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro was undeterred by his critics and kept writing, but his
stature was not helped by the libretto he wrote in 1955 for a
one-act comic opera by Hugo Weisgall called ``The Tenor.'' The
Times dismissed the opera as ``very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he won better notices with his ``Poems of a
Jew,'' in which he said that ``the free modern Jew is neither hero
nor victim. He is man left over, after everything that can happen
has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He worked, not always happily, describing himself as shedding
jobs ``like a poodle shaking off bath water.'' He taught writing at
Johns Hopkins from 1948 to 1950; edited Poetry magazine from 1950
to 1956; and taught literature at the University of Illinois and at
the University of California at Davis, where he remained from 1968
to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro also received the Shelley Memorial Prize of the Poetry
Society of America, the Oscar Blumenthal Prize, and, on two
occasions, Guggenheim fellowships. Among his works were ``English
Prosody and Modern Poetry'' (1947); ``The Bourgeois Poet'' (1964);
``To Abolish Children'' (1968); ``Edsel,'' his only novel (1971);
``Adult Bookstore'' (1976); ``Collected Poems, 1948-1978'' (1978),
and ``New and Selected Poems, 1940-1986.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz regarded ``The Bourgeois Poet'' as Shapiro's finest book,
reflecting the full flower of his creativity as well as the
influence of the Beat Poets, who transfixed Shapiro for a few years
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's first marriage, to Evalyn Katz, his editor and agent,
ended in divorce in 1967. He is survived by two children from that
marriage, a son, Jacob, of Alexandria, Va., and a daughter, Kathy
Shapiro, of Montpelier, Vt. He married Teri Kovach in 1967. She
died in 1982. He married Sophie Wilkens in 1985. She also survives
him, along with three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

CONSUMERS ALREADY FEELING HIGHER INTEREST RATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY AND GREG WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Federal Reserve Board's half a percentage
point increase in interest rates Tuesday likely means consumers
will pay more for home loans, car loans and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they already are.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts say the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee action is an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation in check. Many expect another rate hike in June after the
group's next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers shopping for a new home in the past several weeks got
a preview of the Fed's action because mortgage rates moved up in
anticipation of Tuesday's increase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last week interest rates for a 30-year fixed
mortgage in California averaged 8.81 percent, up from 8.28 percent
at the end of April, according to a survey by HSH Associates, which
publishes mortgage rate information.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have now risen 1.75 percent in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is quite a traumatic increase, and a lot of it is already
incorporated in (mortgage) rates, and it is lowering sales,'' said
G.U. Krueger, deputy chief economist for the California Association
of Realtors, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh evidence surfaced this week that rising rates are having
the desired effect of reeling in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Southland Regional Association of Realtors
reported that sales of single-family homes in the San Fernando
Valley fell 9.1 percent in April on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Realtors cited rising interest rates as one culprit - the
first time in years rates have chilled the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making it harder to buy a home. The cost of housing
becomes more expensive,'' Krueger said about rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   When home-buying slows, so can purchases of such big-ticket
items like washers, dryers and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   And with prices also rising, sales could slow even further, some
predict. Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carney, head of the Real Estate Research Council at
California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, doubts that the
Fed's action will have any effect on the residential housing
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it will have no dampening effect on consumer
confidence. It's at a very high level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local Fed watchers - Carney among them - say Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and company aren't finished increasing
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there are dramatic changes in the economy, you will see
the Federal Reserve raise interest rates by another half-point at
their next meeting,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Following another increase, Kyser expects the Federal Reserve to
take a break to see whether the rate hikes have had the desired
effect of slowing the economy enough to control inflation without
causing a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weiss, senior vice president and chief investment
officer with City National Investments, a division of City National
Bank, said: ``This one wasn't a shock to us, but this is not the
end of the interest rate hike cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the central bank increased the federal funds rate to
6.5 percent from 6 percent. The federal funds rate is what banks
charge each other on overnight loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also raised the discount rate, the interest it charges
to make direct loans to banks, from 5.5 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's half-point increase in the funds rate was followed by
an announcement by Bank of America, Bank One and City National Bank
that they were boosting their prime lending rate by a similar
half-point from 9 percent to 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The prime rate is the key measuring stick for millions of loans,
including mortgages, car loans and credit card balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is ... to the extent the Federal Reserve is able
to tame inflation, that will keep long-term interest rates
steady,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   So what should consumers expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to wake up tomorrow and find their rates a
half-point higher,'' James E. Glassman, a managing director at
Chase Securities, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's progressively growing more expensive'' to borrow for
millions of consumers whose aggregate personal savings rate, as a
proportion of disposable income, has dwindled to virtually nothing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the highest borrowing rates - typically on credit
cards for those with subpar incomes or repayment histories - will
be hit relatively lightly because they reflect more the lenders'
cost of administration and write-offs of uncollectible accounts
than the cost of money.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be some direct effects.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, for example, ties its credit card rates to the prime
rate, which it raised a half-point Tuesday to 9.5 percent, in
lockstep with the Fed, as has become the pattern in recent years.
The bank's policy is to review these rates on the last business day
of the month, meaning its card rates will rise for July payments on
purchases made in June, said Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sixth increase in interest rates within 12 months,
analysts say California's robust economy should continue to expand,
albeit at a slightly slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year, we are going to see the local economy
move at a slower pace, which isn't bad,'' said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, president and chief executive officer of the
Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, said he fears higher
interest rates will dampen enthusiasm for developing commercial and
residential real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we need all the new units we can build because
demand for housing is outpacing supply,'' said Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss notes that because Los Angeles County's economy is
dominated by aerospace, technology and entertainment, it is
somewhat insulated from direct shocks linked to interest rate
hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss compared the latest rate hike to a dose of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it doesn't taste good while you're taking it, but
there is a good chance it will benefit your long-term health,'' he
said.

EDITORIAL: IMITATIONS OF `WEST WING' 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial of Wednesday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   In this season's final episode of ``West Wing,'' President
Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen) will deal tonight with a
downed pilot in Iraq, a balky space shuttle and a battle with
Congress over campaign finance reform. As it happens, the last of
these issues is unfolding in the real Washington this week, in
almost the same way. But while Bartlet is bravely trying to reshape
the Federal Election Commission and ban soft money, President
Clinton (played by himself) and the real Democrats are battling
only half-heartedly for reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the real Washington, the fight is over the drive by Trent
Lott, the Senate majority leader, to place Bradley Smith, a
notorious opponent of campaign finance laws, on the Federal
Election Commission, where he would be responsible for enforcing
those laws. Lott is offering the Democrats all kinds of incentives
to go along. On television, the Senate majority leader (Lott's
counterpart) is trying to block a Democratic effort to make the
commission stronger by appointing reformers. He, too, is offering a
deal _ let the commission remain weak with its existing members in
return for action on a pet Bartlet proposal.
</P>
<P>
   We have a hunch that Bartlet will rebuff the Republican
deal-makers and carry through on reform. Clinton and Tom Daschle,
the Senate minority leader, should stand as firm. They might be
pleased to note that, in TV land, Bartlet's approval ratings have
risen with his seizure of the reform banner, just as Sen. John
McCain's did in real life this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' producers are betting that viewers are rooting for
a campaign finance cleanup. Washington will never want to compete
with most goings-on in the show. This one is worth a try. &QL;

CUTE HOUSTON STADIUM PLAYS UGLY ON PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston, we have a problem. But there's nothing you
can do about it now.
</P>
<P>
   The ribbon is cut. The $248 million is spent. And Jose Lima's
earned-run average is already higher than the cab fare from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Enron Field is ... uh ... cute. It is a
matchbox of washed stone and eye candy, squeezed purposefully into
a corner nook of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that nobody lives in downtown Houston. The new home
of the Astros, like so many of the knee-jerk,
must-have-a-skyscraper-view ballparks of these times, was built on
the premise that if you squeeze it in, they will come.
</P>
<P>
   And they have. Despite Lima and despite the home team's
disappointing record, the Astros have performed in front of sellout
and near-sellout crowds all season.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your father's Astrodome. This is not even a distant
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the inert, beer-stained Astrodome, home of baseball
in Houston for 35 seasons, Enron Field is a Disneyland. It has a
playful hill butting the wall in straightaway center field. It even
has a toy train.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the train. Enron Field adjoins the city's historic Union
Station. The locomotive that chugs along the makeshift track atop
the left-field seats blows steam and whistles like the real deal
whenever an Astro hits a home run. It's not really a train, in
other words, but it plays one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting managers have labeled it a shrill nuisance, yet it's no
more annoying than those infernal bell chimes at Yankee Stadium.
The real tragedy of the Enron Field choo-choo is that it detracts
from the home-run-cued cartoon on the adjoining scoreboard _ the
snorting steer and the galloping cowboys from the Astrodome's
original ``scoreboard spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much of a good thing, however, soon gets boring, and Astros
fans sound as if they don't know what to make of their new
playhouse on the corner of Crawford and Texas streets.
</P>
<P>
   Through their first 19 games there, the Astros are 6-13 and a
total of 69 home runs have been hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this place,'' outfielder Henry Rodriguez said, echoing
the sentiments of many players.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, alas, is that Henry plays for the Chicago Cubs.
Astros pitchers are singing a song that is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   In ye olden days, cities built ballparks to match the
surrounding landscapes. Topography was relative. Thus, the
venerable Fenway Park boasts its famous left-field wall. The Polo
Grounds was more or less the shape of a shoe box.
</P>
<P>
   When Baltimore's Camden Yards opened in 1992 to rave reviews and
nightly sellouts, baseball's ears perked. Not every new stadium, it
discovered, needs to be built like the grand opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Yards' charm is its lack of spaciousness. Cal Ripken
seems so close you could almost touch him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, nobody polled the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The home run sells, the lords of baseball decided. Enron Field's
left-field foul pole is a very intentional 315 feet from home
plate. Against the Astros Sunday night, Cincinnati's
left-handed-hitting Eddie Taubensee, trying to poke an outside
pitch the other way, nearly poked a 315-feet, 6-inch home run over
the left-field wall. It was foul by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Right field at Enron is only 326 feet, and the inviting alley in
right-center is 373 but buttressed by a mere seven-foot wall.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, right field at the new Pacific Bell Park
measures 307 feet. I'll bet the right-field line at your nearby
high school field is farther.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, unlike the old parks, these are not accidents of
geometry. Astros owner Drayton McLane obviously wanted his team's
new home to play this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful place,'' said Lima, whose first seven
starts produced 16 home runs and a 9.53 ERA. ``But it's worse than
Coors Field on pitchers. You can see the hitters smiling as they're
walking up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarming stat of the month: The home run per-game ratio at Enron
Field (3.63) is higher than at the mile-high home of the Colorado
Rockies. Enron Field is Coors Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Quaint and cozy are admirable features for a ballpark to have.
But hitters today are bigger, stronger and fueled by all sorts of
natural (and unnatural) herbs and spices. They can't fit in places
like Enron Field and Pac Bell Park anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make the new home of the Astros a bad place. But it
totally changes the baseball landscape in Houston, where the heroes
have always seemed to be pitchers _ Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, Don
Sutton, J.R. Richard, Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10 in the fourth game at Enron Field, the Cardinals and
Astros combined for eight home runs. In 35 years at the dead-air
Astrodome, the most ever hit was six.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans, judging by the talk shows, are mortified. But it's
too late _ the train has left the station, in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   I think the new place is, uh, cute.
</P>
<P>
   Too cute?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 17:
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the mining industry in Montana has made few
environmental concessions to anyone. But in a surprising and
salutary development, the Stillwater Mining Co., which operates two
platinum mines in the Beartooth Mountains at the edge of the
Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, has signed a good-neighbor agreement
with a coalition of local environmental and citizens' groups
operating under the umbrella of the Northern Plains Resource
Council.
</P>
<P>
   This striking agreement holds the East Boulder and Stillwater
mines to a higher set of environmental standards than those
required by state and federal authorities. It institutes oversight
committees with members drawn from mine management and citizens'
groups. The company will place thousands of acres under
conservation easements, and it will finance audits of its own
environmental performance. Most important, it has agreed to an open
exchange of information with the council and will invest in what
the council calls ``groundbreaking new water treatment and waste
reduction technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to attribute the fact of this agreement to the
profitability of these mines, which has given Stillwater Mining
greater latitude to negotiate. But this agreement could not have
come about without enlightened leadership at the company or the
dedication of negotiators for local citizens and environmentalists.
The result makes genuine environmental protection consistent with
continued productivity. With luck, this may become a model for
similar agreements elsewhere. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ A couple of weeks ago against Kansas, Baylor catcher Kelly
Shoppach made two aggressive tags while blocking the plate to keep
runs from scoring.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He glared at one Kansas baserunner who got face-to-face with
him, then spiked the ball on the plate and ran back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the first person on the field to greet
Shoppach was Baylor football coach Kevin Steele.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'm giving you the option,'' Steele said. ``Fullback or
linebacker, whichever you prefer. It's all yours. Just put on the
pads, and we're good to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of his
last two football seasons at Brewer High School in Fort Worth, just
chuckled and said thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to every Baylor football game, and it wasn't out of the
question that I might play,'' Shoppach said. ``Growing up in Texas,
that's all you ever want. But when it came down to it, I thought I
had a better future in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears he was right because Shoppach and his teammates did
something this season no living Baylor alumnus has done _ win an
outright conference baseball championship. The last time that
happened was 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-ranked Bears (42-14, 23-7 Big 12) enter the Big 12
tournament in Oklahoma City as the top seed after clinching the
league title last weekend with a three-game sweep at Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were loose and relaxed, and we knew what we had to do,''
Shoppach said. ``We went there to win the title and play like the
best team in the Big 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, which learned Monday it will host an NCAA regional for
the second consecutive year, will play Texas A&AMP;M in a first-round
game tonight at the Bricktown Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach and the Bears hope to add the tournament championship
to their regular-season title, but the big goal is a trip to the
College World Series. Baylor fell one game short of reaching that
plateau last season, losing to Oklahoma State in a Super Regional
at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us remember how that felt,'' Shoppach said. ``We don't
want to feel that way again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team's cleanup hitter, Shoppach has been a big part of
Baylor's success this season. He is hitting .311 with nine homers
and 39 RBIs. It has been a pleasant surprise to coach Steve Smith,
who wasn't so sure about Shoppach's future after his freshman year
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly had some soul-searching to do, and he did it,'' Smith
said. ``He needed to change his attitude, and he needed to change
his life. And physically, he needed to get in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-10 Shoppach, a stocky and muscular guy, put on some pounds
while sitting the bench as a freshman, tipping the scales at 250
pounds near the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly came down here, and he let himself go,'' Smith said.
``He became pessimistic and real negative in his thinking. He came
in thinking he was not going to start and lost his competitive
nature. He didn't realize that I was open about it. I was waiting
for him to step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen, so Smith felt it was time to have a
serious chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year at the end of the season, I meet individually with
each of the players,'' Smith said. ``It's usually a very pleasant
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was not a dialogue. This was about a 10-minute
monologue. Bless his heart. He came in with a smile on his face
about leaving for the summer, but when he left, he was very stoic.
I don't think he said one word the entire time he was in my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith told Shoppach he wanted him to return in shape, but he
also wanted him to return with the attitude he saw in Shoppach when
he was one of the best high school athletes in the state. He had
scholarship offers in football from Texas, Baylor, Oklahoma and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed with him in high school,'' Smith said. ``He
was the leading rusher, leading receiver. He kicked off, he punted,
and he returned punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so physically strong. It was funny watching him play
baseball in the summers. The kids in the stands would be talking
about him. I heard them whispering, `Shoppach.' It was like he was
a folk hero. He was this larger-than-life guy in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the person Smith saw last year at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like he was a depressed and melancholy guy,''
Smith said. ``My level of confidence in Kelly was not very high. I
was uncomfortable with the situation, and I told him what I thought
he needed to do to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach took Smith's advice to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Smith was very honest, and it was good for me,''
Shoppach said. ``He was right. I came in here not sure what my role
would be. You're not the leader that you were in high school, and I
didn't take that transition well at all. I knew I had to change and
be the best I could be for my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shoppach arrived for his sophomore year last fall, one
change was obvious.

<P>
   ``I left for Liberal, Kan., where I played ball last summer, at
245 pounds,'' Shoppach said. ``I came back at 195 pounds. I started
running, and the weight just came off. Right now I'm at 215, which
is the ideal weight for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith admits he has been surprised at Shoppach's transformation,
physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray my own kids will respond to me the way he
did,'' Smith said. ``What he is now, in terms of makeup, is what I
expected him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach came back for his sophomore year knowing he would have
to beat out senior Bryan Loeb for the starting catcher's job. Loeb,
who was drafted by the New York Mets, elected to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach's renewed dedication earned him the job. He has started
41 of 56 games behind the plate, making only two errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly is as good defensively as anyone I've ever been
around,'' Smith said. ``He can go a long way in the game of
baseball on that alone. And he will get better as a hitter with
time. He has the one thing you can't teach, and that's physical
strength.''

 By NEAL FARMER  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ University of Houston lefthander Shane Nance
has a way of taking over a game. He already has set a school record
with 30 career wins, and as the 2000 season draws to a close, his
fastball has been clocked at 93 mph _ the hardest he has ever
thrown the baseball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there is another area in which Nance has made an unexpected
contribution for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Nance is batting leadoff and has shown a propensity for power.
He was just what the Cougars needed when they suffered through a
midseason slump _ mostly at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one thing that has kick-started us out of our
doldrums, I think it was when he went into the leadoff spot,'' UH
coach Rayner Noble said. ``He contributed for us, and that was big,
especially when combined with what he has been doing on the
mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 39-14 and ranked No. 6 by Baseball America, plays at 3
p.m. today in the first round of the Conference USA tournament. The
top-seeded Cougars will face No. 8-seeded Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the tournament receives the league's automatic bid
to an NCAA regional, although UH already is in the playoff field by
virtue of being named a host of one of the 16 first-round
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Nance had a chance to bypass his senior season at Houston when
he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 24th round of
last year's draft. He met with Noble after the draft, wanting to
discuss UH's future and what could be accomplished in the 2000
season. With 10 seniors returning, all involved thought it could be
a special year. The discussion turned to Nance's being able to play
the outfield and serve as a designated hitter, which intrigued him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, batting was not what we were going to talk
about,'' Nance said. ``The conversation just went that way. I told
them that we were going to have a good team this year, and if I
could help the team by playing in the outfield and swinging the
bat, then I could do that. I said that if I was going back for my
senior year, I wanted to play as much as I could. I wasn't worried
about getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   So on opening day this year Nance was batting second in the
lineup, alternating between DH and left field. He found his stroke
Feb. 22 with a two-homer game against Rice that included a grand
slam. He continued batting second until he was injured March 10 at
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Nance and center fielder Jason Pekar slammed into each other in
the outfield while chasing a bloop hit, and Nance missed four weeks
at the plate and six weeks on the mound with a shoulder injury. He
returned as a pinch hitter April 8 against South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Nance continue to swing the bat well and was moved to leadoff
April 18 against Baylor in a game he also started on the mound.
Houston scored 10 runs in the first inning and cruised to an 11-2
win.
</P>
<P>
   Nance has been the Cougars' catalyst on offense, just as he has
been Mr. Dependable as a starting pitcher. He has a 7-1 record in
10 starts and a team-leading ERA of 2.33. In 65 innings, he has
given up 17 earned runs (23 total), allowed 58 hits and struck out
55 while walking 19.
</P>
<P>
   As a hitter, he is batting .361 in 97 at-bats and has reached
base in 48 percent of his plate appearances. He has scored 25 runs
while knocking in 21.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Caraway, who hit leadoff for the Cougars when the season
began, was in a slump when he was replaced by Nance. Now they both
are hitting well, with Nance batting leadoff and Caraway ninth
against righthanders and Caraway hitting leadoff with Nance last
against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Noble compares Nance with former college stars Jason Jennings of
Baylor and Brooks Kieschnick of Texas as players who made
differences for their teams with the bat as well as their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane is fiery and really creates things,'' Noble said. ``When
Shane came in as a freshman, at that point he probably was a better
outfielder than a pitcher, although he was pretty good at both.
When I saw how valuable he was going to be on the mound, I didn't
let him hit much or play in the field much. I know it has been a
passion of Shane's to play in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance admits as much, but he also knew his route to the pros was
via the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe playing outfield and batting brought back a little bit
more of a fire or a sense of urgency for me, since this is my last
year here,'' he said. ``I think I am just as focused as I always
have been. But I think it brought back a hunger.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE bottom is still down there somewhere, below the chair-throwing,
the vase-tossing, the boss-abusing, the player-choking and the
authority-flaunting, to name just a few benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight's fall is not finished, and the gentle thud from the
soft landing provided by Indiana's farcical university president
Myles Brand was both an echo and an omen.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more where that came from. You can count on it,
which is what Brand seems to be doing. And the bump, bump, bump to
wherever this finally comes to rest is going to sound like a body
going down an empty well.
</P>
<P>
   Do the letters IU stand for ``invertebrate uncles'' or ``idiotic
utterances''? For to implement a zero-tolerance policy on Knight at
this point is the equivalent of reading Willie Sutton the
bank-robbery laws after all the money is gone.
</P>
<P>
   After 29 years of head-butting, son-kicking, verbal tirades,
childishness and unadulterated cruelty to so many, what constitutes
an act that would embarrass the university and thereby prompt
Knight's dismissal?
</P>
<P>
   An altercation with a Puerto Rican policeman during an
international competition? Been there.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting an LSU fan off his feet and dumping him into a trash can
at the Final Four? Done that.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing one of his players by the throat? Unleashing a
profanity-filled blast at a 64-year-old female secretary and
heaving a vase against a wall behind her head? Knocking the sports
information director to the floor? Motivating his team at halftime
of a game with the shockingly disgusting _ even for him _ action of
waving used toilet paper in their faces?
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a laundry list of antisocial,
I-don't-have-to-answer-to-anyone behavior that has defined Knight
far more than his basketball genius for the better part of three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   His defenders will claim it is all old news that is being used
in a dose of new-millennium political correctness to tarnish an
icon.
</P>
<P>
   And to an extent, they will be correct. It is old news, and
that's why Brand and the Indiana board of trustees should have
embarrassed faces that are redder than one of Knight's sweaters
because they have never lifted a finger to act in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has won a lot of basketball games and three national
championships that kept the wolves at bay for so long. He has also
struggled to find success in the first round of the NCAA Tournament
in recent seasons _ unheralded Pepperdine dropped the ax this year
_ and that has brought critics who were previously willing to
tolerate his antics out of the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   But it should not _ and it is not _ about simply winning and
losing as long as the stated mission of a well-respected university
is to instill values in, as well as educate, young minds. How does
it serve the university in any way to have Knight ranting, raving,
scowling, sneering and cursing in front of an IU banner at all who
ever questioned his methods or his madness?
</P>
<P>
   Bullies. Motivating by fear. So big in their own minds. So small
is their recognition of the respect they are never given outside
their range of direct influence.
</P>
<P>
   Knight would long ago have been fired at any Fortune 500 company
or from any small business in the private sector. But in
Hoosierland, his intimidation of the powers that be in the
university administration allowed Knight to feel invincible and
only fueled more unacceptable acts for which he was never held
accountable. Compared to Coach Bob, eels are Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   What Brand would have us believe is that he is coming down hard
on Knight with the zero-tolerance mandate, when what he is really
doing is taking the easy, spineless way out. In a state where the
coaching legend is still a political force, not to mention one of
the school's biggest fund-raisers, Brand does not want Knight's
blood on his hands. So he will wait for another body to be thrown
on the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Brand wants Knight to pull his own switch, and he knows it will
eventually happen. Bobby-baiting will become an unofficial sport
around the Big Ten. Will it be a goading fan at a road game who
causes the next explosion? Will a notoriety-hungry reporter
challenge Knight in front of the TV cameras and set him off? Or
will it be a Charlie Bauman, the Clemson football player who was
punched out by another self-destructive dictator/coach, Woody
Hayes, a generation ago?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom is still down there somewhere, waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The blame will be Bob Knight's. The shame will be Indiana's.
</P>

FELLOW HOTHEAD PINIELLA THINKS KNIGHT CAN CHILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that Bobby Knight has promised not to add to his
considerable lead in the ``America's Funniest Tantrums'' video
archive _ the entirety has been broadcast on multiple channels this
week _ there is a chance for the runner-up to cut into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Lou Piniella is concerned, no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Portland Trail Blazers forward Rasheed Wallace, rising fast, is
welcome to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing a person has to control is his temper _
fought it all my life,'' Piniella said before Tuesday night's game.
``My temper is not planned; it just comes out. Bobby's had a
similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's wound a little different. It's just a question of
how you control yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has become the new national wager _ the date
when Knight loses whatever control he alleged himself to have.
</P>
<P>
   For all the deserved blistering that Indiana University honchoes
are taking for belatedly dealing with the longest-running pout in
non-diapered history, there was some shrewdness involved in the
sanctions of their basketball coach this week. What they lacked in
guts, they made up for in strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees put Knight in a box so tight that he is virtually
doomed to fail. But by giving him a final chance, the onus for his
departure has shifted onto Knight.
</P>
<P>
   If he had been fired outright, the president and trustees would
have been held accountable for the basketball team's subsequent
mess. And given Knight's contentiousness, he probably would have
figured a way to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly and most importantly, a firing would have
allowed Knight to hold himself as a martyr, felled by the
pointy-headed campus liberals who never wore a jock yet benefited
from the glory he brought the university.
</P>
<P>
   The legions of mouth-breathing Hoosiers fanatics who accorded
Knight unfettered loyalty would have stormed the red castle armed
with torches and pitchforks.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy's only vulnerability is if Knight develops a career
first: Civility.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is among a teensy minority who thinks he can pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta believe he'll do it,'' said Piniella. ``You have to
resolve to yourself that you have to change. You're the only one
who can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would have resigned. I read it as true
contrition, and you're going to see a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners manager became acquainted with Knight when Piniella
was running the Cincinnati Reds from 1990-92. A big baseball fan,
Knight made several trips to Riverfront Stadium, where the two were
friendly enough that Piniella had a standing offer to be Knight's
guest for any Hoosiers home game.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella described Knight the way almost everyone does who is
not in a chokehold or covered in his spittle: Friendly, bright,
well-read and passionate.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Piniella's own considerable history as a
player-throttling, cap-stomping, base-throwing desperado, he no
longer subscribes to Knight's apparent tactics of anger and
intimidation as a tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' said Piniella. ``When I played, yes. But I've
calmed down a lot. Early in my managing career, I was more
confrontational. Now, I'm not. I don't want confrontations. I don't
want problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed at the high school, college and
professional level in how you relate to the players. If I meet with
a player, it's on an individual basis in the privacy of my office.
That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get players to play relaxed while installing a
winning attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Piniella has entertained Mariners fans for years
with his near-smackdowns with umpires, he was much more fiery in
his earlier tenures with the Yankees and Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable was his post-game clubhouse brawl with Rob Dibble
after the Reds reliever called him a liar. That videotape gets
almost as much play as Knight's chair-hurling episode.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight marked a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started it,'' he said. ``It was embarrassing for me as a
manager. I said to myself, `You either start calming yourself down
or get yourself out of the business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella credits his wife, Anita, for pulling his foot off the
accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing she suggested, which I've done for quite awhile now,
is if I'm upset about something, I don't address it right away,''
he said. ``Go home, sleep on it, think some more, have lunch over
it. It works very well.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many years in sports, the 56-year-old Piniella also has
learned something about self-control that has apparently escaped
Knight, 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least at the professional level, I think the most important
thing is that you can't want it more than your players want it,''
he said. ``Look, if your team is going out there and playing hard
for you and not beating itself with bonehead plays, that means your
level of play is consistent with the talent on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect more, just because you want it more. You've
got to find that equilibrium. If you don't, it just puts more
pressure on your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   The line is apparently so fine it has escaped Knight for most of
his life. Unless, of course, he never cared to search.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that is, and will be, the difference in the tantrum
archive between No. 1 and No. 2.

 KATHRYN McDONALD, 82, FAMILY COURT JUDGE, ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judge Kathryn A. McDonald, who as administrator of
the family court system of New York City was a champion of
children's rights, died May 16 at Mount Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan. She was 82 and lived on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her daughter, K. Ann McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a graduate of Columbia's law school, was named the
administrative judge for the five New York City Family Court
complexes in 1986. She had the title of administrative judge of the
Family Court of New York City and retired from the post in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, she tried to improve the courts despite an
explosion in the number of cases, budget cuts and crumbling
facilities. The courts faced other new problems in the '90s, as
well. In 1995, with difficult custody decisions being complicated
by AIDS, and by relatives who had taken in the children, grown to
love them and become unwilling to give them up without a fight,
McDonald said: ``A lot of the custody cases in the last few years
have been families fighting each other. It's an in-house thing.
It's an awkward thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she said that largely because of drug addiction, more
and more of the Family Court cases involved abused or neglected
children, who had flooded the court system and in turn had
overburdened the foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving her law degree in 1963, she became a lawyer for
the Legal Aid Society's juvenile rights division and then
attorney-in-charge of Legal Aid's Manhattan office. In 1976, she
became a Family Court judge. She was briefly supervising judge of
the Family Court in New York County before becoming the
administrative judge.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering law school in 1960, she worked in personnel and
labor relations for 20 years. But one afternoon, she and a friend
watched proceedings in Family Court at time when poor children were
not given assigned counsel. Recalling that experience in an
interview in 1986, she said: ``The rich kids all had lawyers, and
the poor kids had nobody. I decided that I wanted to become a
lawyer and represent children.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was the administrative judge, she also headed the New
York Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, which was
established after a two-year study had found that ``gender bias
against women litigants, attorneys and court employees is a
pervasive problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In that post she carried out recommendations intended to rid the
state courts of sex bias.
</P>
<P>
   With her in charge, the committee reported in 1987 that
sensitivity training for judges and other programs had helped
reduce such bias.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Austin was born in Albany, grew up in Long Lake, N.Y.,
and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Cornell. She was
married for six decades to Robert J. McDonald, who was a tax lawyer
with the New York law firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. He died last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her daughter, K. Ann McDonald of Manhattan, a litigation
lawyer with the Manhattan law firm of Robinson Murphy &AMP; McDonald,
Judge McDonald is survived by a brother, Malcolm Patrick Austin of
Chicago.

IN BOOM TIMES, THE HAVE-NOTS INFLUENCE THE DOMINICAN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs grafs 2, 4, 5 and 6 for updating with preliminary vote
figures) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Dominicans turned out in
large numbers Tuesday to elect a president _ either one who would
build on the current government's policy of economic liberalization
or one who wants to reconsider some of the changes to help the
millions of poor and rural residents who say the boom years have
overlooked them.
</P>
<P>
   While this Caribbean nation has enjoyed four years of robust and
unprecedented growth, dissatisfaction among the poor has been great
enough to drive the candidacy of Hipolito Mejia, of the
left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party. Mejia, an agronomist
and businessman who was a cabinet official in the 1970s, has
campaigned on a platform of increased social spending, assistance
to farmers and a reassessment of the current government's
privatization policies. Preliminary results based on 27.7 percent
of the polling places were giving him 49 percent of the vote early
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the same sentiment has also propelled the unlikely candidacy
of former President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking his eighth
term in office. Balaguer, an autocrat who was close to the dictator
Rafael Trujillo, is 93 years old and blind. In his infrequent and
brief stump speeches, he has had to be helped to the podium by
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his Social Christian Reformist Party was garnering
26.7 percent of the vote. He has promised price controls and more
public housing and public works.
</P>
<P>
   The third main candidate, Danilo Medina, of the governing
centrist Dominican Liberation Party, known as the PLD, has vowed to
continue his party's economic policy but with an eye toward having
the benefits flow down to the neediest sectors of society.
Wednesday morning, he had 23.6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff is scheduled for June
30. While some polling places experienced delays, the vote
proceeded without disruptions or conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Leonel Fernandez, a lawyer who was
educated in the United States, has been praised by international
groups for having enacted a series of economic changes that have
stimulated a growth rate of approximately 8 percent and have
attracted considerable investment here over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who is prohibited by law from a second consecutive
term, also focused on improving transportation and roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a fairly progressive government by Dominican
standards,'' said one diplomat here. ``It has done more than most
governments in recent Dominican history.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Medina, who was a top aide to Fernandez, said the
recent economic growth _ which last year made the Dominican
Republic's economy the fastest growing in Latin America _ should
continue under their party's supervision. They said that the
country's stable currency and finances would improve the country's
ability to invest in schools and health services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to work, you can work,'' said Idelfonso Cora, as
he waited to vote for Medina. ``I support Danilo because of the
growth under the PLD has been the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governing party's economic changes and capital projects
have not played as well among some poor and rural voters, who feel
the initiatives have done little to improve their circumstances.
There are continuing complaints about high food prices and a lack
of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have to get on boats and go to Puerto Rico
because there is not enough opportunity here,'' said Samuel
Collado, a security guard who was waiting to vote for Mejia. ``We
want a government that will help the poor, not just the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others have especially been rankled by the government's
privatization of state run sugar and electrical production
industries. In the town of Guerra, about 15 miles outside of Santo
Domingo, voters said the privatization of the sugar company had a
devastating effect on their town, which used to thrive on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar cane?'' said Maria Altagracia Lebron. ``Don't even talk
about that. We used to live from that, but not anymore. There is no
cane or anything, because the government privatized it. And who
does that favor? The millionaires who have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mejia said he would review the privatization policies, he
may have no choice but to continue, said one diplomat, because he
is also enough of a businessman to know that it was ultimately the
only choice the country had.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, both he and Medina tout similar promises of
helping those who have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about personality,'' said one diplomat. ``There is
also a more direct connection between the parties and the people.
The concept that one candidate might do good for the whole nation
is alien. It's what can you do for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the master of that retail political strategy has been
Balaguer, who has honed it over decades, dispensing jobs, food and
favors _ as he does at Christmas, when crowds line up outside his
home to receive baskets of goodies. That generosity, combined with
his autocratic style, has always had its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who support him got things _ a job, a school or a
building,'' said one diplomat. ``I also think there is some sort of
nostalgia for the caudillo, the strong leader. They feel they want
a society where they do not have much chaos. If you see someone who
gives you order, you react to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign season was relatively free of violence and was seen
by many as among the most tranquil in years. Nonetheless, there
were disquieting incidents of violence and angry accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, two supporters of the governing party were shot
and killed by. Mejia's bodyguards during a campaign swing in the
town of Moca. Although the bodyguards said the two were suspected
of planning to attack Mejia, the police dismissed that motive.
Several suspects were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the violence that wracked this nation during
Balaguer's rule, the family of a journalist who was killed by a
death squad linked to the military in 1975 tried to block
Balaguer's candidacy, accusing him of complicity. The Central
Electoral Council declined to pursue the case, saying there was not
enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer's supporters, in turn, accused the governing party of
plotting to assassinate Balaguer, saying that his age and frail
physical condition made him vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer could still be in a position to exercise influence
should his party come in second. It is expected that Mejia could
face a challenge from a united front forged between his two
opponents. At the same time, Mejia's supporters say their
candidate's strength among the poor and rural voters has not been
reflected in the polls, and observers said that his party's
organizing capacity gave him a strong advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good candidate,'' said Alfonso Bolque Brito, a street
vendor. ``He is the only one who can put food in the mouths of
those who are unhappy.''

 BANK SALES REPS CAN PEEK INTO YOUR ACCOUNTS TO PITCH PRODUCTS  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My friend Kay called last week with a story that
is becoming all-too-common now that the walls separating banks,
brokerage firms and insurance companies have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, she was waiting in line at Wells Fargo's
Stonestown Galleria branch in San Francisco when a well-dressed,
elderly man hobbled in on the arm of his health care attendant and
settled himself into a seat at one of the desks on the sales floor.
</P>
<P>
   After making small talk with the Wells Fargo rep on the other
side of the desk, he asked, ``Can you tell me why you called me
down here regarding my account?''
</P>
<P>
   Because the man was hard of hearing, the rep talked loud enough
for everyone in the bank to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The rep said the man had $100,000 in his checking account, and
he wasn't earning any interest on it. The rep said he could be
earning money in another type of account. Then he scribbled down
some numbers on a piece of paper and showed it to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   The man said something like, ``I'm 84 years old. I've worked all
my life. I'm not interested in making any more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the rep continued asking the man questions about
his income, his mortgage and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Kay forgot about the incident until the week before last, when
she came home one night and found a cryptic message on her
answering machine. Someone at ``Wells Fargo'' wanted to talk about
``her account.''
</P>
<P>
   She had recently sold some mutual funds and had temporarily
parked $85,000 in her checking account. ``The money was in there
three or four days when I got the call,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Had she not remembered the episode at the bank, Kay says she
would have panicked, thinking that someone had gotten her ATM card
and cleaned out her checking account.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned the call the next day, she got a recording
from a woman with Wells Fargo's investment arm. Kay left her own
message, saying, ``If there is a problem with my checking account,
call me. If there's nothing wrong, don't call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay feels her privacy, and the man's, were invaded. ``If I get a
call from Merrill Lynch, I know they're there to sell me stuff. But
I feel old-fashioned about my bank.''
</P>
<P>
   She wonders: Can banks legally pry into your checking account to
sell you other products?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Kay, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   What Wells is doing is known as affiliate sharing _ or using
customer information from one division (such as banking) to sell
products (such as mutual funds or insurance) from other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Under new regulations that were just approved last week,
financial institutions can share customer information with their
affiliates, as long as they tell customers once a year they're
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Since its merger with Norwest, Wells has become a leader in this
business of cross-selling.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1998 annual report, CEO Dick Kovacevich said that the
average Wells customer has only 3.2 Wells products. ``We want to
get to eight,'' he wrote. ``We expect to sell at least one more
product to every customer every year.''
</P>
<P>
   You can expect to see a lot more cross-selling now that banks,
insurance companies and securities firms are free to merge. They
gained that right under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, passed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that act, consumer and privacy advocates wanted
strong protections on customer information.
</P>
<P>
   What they got were the watered-down regulations that were
finally issued last week, but still won't go into effect for eight
more months.
</P>
<P>
   You can read the 176-page directive at  &LR; www.bog.frb.fed.us &LR; 
 &LR; /BoardDocs/Meetings/2000 &LR;   &LR; /20000510/OpenMemos.htm. &LR;  Click on
``Proposed New Regulation P.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regs, financial institutions can share information
with their affiliates _ and with nonaffiliated third-party
companies _ as long as they notify customers when they open an
account and annually thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions must allow customers who don't want their
information sold to third parties to ``opt out.'' But they do not
have to let customers ``opt out'' of affiliate-sharing
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another loophole: ``If there's a joint marketing
agreement between the bank and a third party, the customer doesn't
have to be provided with an opt-out,'' says Frank Torres,
legislative counsel with Consumers Union in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups failed in their attempts to get an ``opt-in''
policy that would have required financial institutions to get
permission from customers  &LR; before  &LR; sharing their financial secrets.
</P>
<P>
   So now, ``the burden is on you,'' says Ken McEldowney, executive
director of Consumer Action in San Francisco. ``I find this very
ironic. Banks say they want to share information to let you know
all about these wonderful services. But they don't have enough
faith in their products'' to rely on consumers opting in.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates agree that Wells wasn't breaking any laws
when it peeked into customers' bank balances to try to sell them
other products.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Chaney, a bank-stock analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co., even
thinks Wells may have been doing the older guy a favor _ depending
on what the rep was trying to sell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has 100,000 in his checking account and he doesn't use
$100,000, then they are doing a service saying, ``Mr. Jones, you
don't need $100,000 in your checking account. We could sweep it
into a money market account and get 4 or 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Wells Fargo rep probably violated the older man's
privacy when he announced his bank balance for all to hear. And
consumer advocates think that sales reps should identify themselves
more clearly when they're making cold calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly abide by the law,'' says Craig Litsey, senior
counsel with Wells. ``There's a requirement that we identify the
caller and the business they're with. We may say Wells Fargo Bank
or Wells Fargo Securities. More often than not, it's (just) Wells
Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   If a sales rep did shout out a customer's bank balance, ``it's
unfortunate and not typical of how we operate,'' Litsey says.
</P>

 NOT MUCH HERE STAYS UNDER WRAPS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oops, that Egyptian priestess mummy at the de
Young Museum wasn't a priestess after all, but a young man.
</P>
<P>
   That mummy ain't no mommy, but what's the surprise? As Japantown
Gerry points out, ``This  &UR; is  &LR; San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Home of the cross-dressing mummy.
</P>
<P>
   World's first case of a person being outed by a CAT-scan.
</P>
<P>
   The mummy is so well-preserved that scientists suspect he may be
a patient of Dr. Seth Matarasso, San Francisco high-society's
plastic surgeon. Seth's motto (or it should be): ``Where the elite
meet to discreetly delete their crow's-feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The CAT-scan of the mummy also showed that the man's skull and
other bones had been fractured. Which leads scientists to theorize
that the mummy may have been an ancient San Francisco pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that he was trampled by a ferocious Munisaur.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE MOVIE ``The Mummy,'' scientists burn tania leaves to
bring the Egyptian mummy back to life. Alvin Guthertz wonders if
the de Young Museum folks gave that a try. Why rely on CAT-scan
clues when you can get the story from the mummy's mouth?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, by law, tania smoke can be inhaled only for
medicinal purposes, and the mummy has no prescription.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S HEAR IT for Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the guy was starting to look like a bulldog whose only
mission in life was to take a bite out of Willie's trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mayor was for, citizen Clint was against _ the
49ers' stadium-mall, Willie for re-election, the sale of The
Chronicle to the Hearsts and the Examiner to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   But as someone close to Reilly recently told me, ``Some people
only see Clint's anger. They don't realize that this guy is angry
for the right reasons. He doesn't like what he sees happening
behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Reilly, as his foes contended at the trial, is
miffed at being shut out of a sweet real-estate deal when his bid
for the Examiner was nixed.
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly's lawsuit and trial have given us an eye-opening
education into newspapers and politics and business in this cozy
little city.
</P>
<P>
   A LEAN NEWSPAPER, that's what would-be publisher Ted Fang
promises if he is allowed to ``buy'' the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't a lean newspaper be a violation of the city's new
anti-fat-discrimination law? Would it deprive the portly &AMP; stout of
a voice?
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, there is an angle Reilly and his attorney, Joseph
Alioto, missed. If the Fangs are saying to the Hearsts, ``Give us
$66 million and we'll take that newspaper off your hands,'' isn't
that a violation of the city's ban on aggressive panhandling?
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR BROWN, according to court testimony, called the Examiner
``a civic treasure.'' He has also said that the Ex isn't fit to be
used as toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments seem somewhat conflicting. But the
contradiction helps explain how the same newspaper that doggedly
uncovers startling corruption in a mayor's administration can also
glowingly and unequivocally endorse that mayor for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Only in S.F.: a cross-dressing newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLY SKIES, with an edge: United Airlines briefed travel
agents with the following memo (boldface mine):
</P>
<P>
   ``United is currently experiencing some flight cancellations due
to weather conditions and crew shortages. United and its pilots are
not in a labor dispute and pilots continue to fly their assigned
flights  &UR; (thank God!)  &LR; in a professional way  &UR; (whew, &LR; 
 &UR; no silly pranks!).  &LR; To manage the situation, United is fine-tuning
its schedule of 2,400 flights and canceling a small number of
flights up to a week in advance, then notifying customers so they
can make alternate plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Says travel agent Janice Hough: ``So all those cancellations are
not labor-related, they are simply `fine-tuning.' And by the way,
`up to a week in advance' includes less than an hour in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY KNIGHT, say what you will about the guy, it was darn
decent of him to give Indiana University another chance.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAYOR'S quickness saved him a spill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycling to work with a group of folks, Willie sailed through
the intersection of Bush and Polk. Two of the riders farther back
in the pack weren't so lucky, they got Bushwacked, mowed down by a
motorcyclist who ignored a traffic cop's stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   Only in San Francisco: Ambulance to Work Day.

PRESSURE FROM FIRMS, HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS PUT END TO SOME ABUSES 
 OF CHINA'S LABOR FORCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZHONGSHAN, China _ ``Stop that line!'' yelled Jill Tucker, as
she strode through the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly line slowed to a halt. The young women who were
busy gluing parts of Reebok sneakers looked up in surprise, while
flustered male supervisors scurried around.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker pointed. ``They're not wearing gloves. It's the same
problem as before. This is ridiculous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloves quickly were found and donned, thus protecting the
workers from the toxic cement, and the gluing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the best-case scenario for U.S. corporate behavior in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker is Reebok's human rights director for East Asia. Her job
is to make sure that the firm's factories are free of health and
safety hazards and other sweatshop-style labor abuses.
</P>
<P>
   She is part of a new attempt by some leading American firms to
improve working conditions in China's notoriously harsh factories.
The success or failure of their work is central to the debate in
Washington over whether to give permanent trade benefits to China.
</P>
<P>
   Do trade and corporate investment help improve the human rights
situation and pave the way for democracy in China, as the Clinton
administration and the trade bill's backers say? Or, as opponents
contend, are U.S. firms simply profiteering from communist
repression, taking advantage of 20-cents-per-hour wages and the
Chinese government's denial of workers' rights?
</P>
<P>
   During recent visits throughout the vast Pearl River delta
industrial zone of southern China's Guangdong province, interviews
with dozens of workers, company and government officials uncovered
plenty of evidence to support both conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that Reebok and (to a lesser extent) other American
firms are making changes for the better. They provide jobs, improve
working conditions and set a relatively good example for Chinese
and other foreign firms, whose factory conditions are generally
draconian.
</P>
<P>
   But it was equally clear that some of the U.S. firms' own
practices do not meet the corporations' own codes of conduct or
international labor-rights norms. Nor have they prompted the
Chinese government to improve enforcement of its own labor laws or
international workers' rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Zhongshan, Tucker's reform plans are complicated by the fact
that she is not really in charge. As in nearly all other plants
producing for U.S. brands in southern China, the factory is owned
and operated by a subcontractor _ in this case, Yue Yuen, a
Taiwanese firm. Yue Yuen, which also makes shoes for New Balance,
Timberland and Dr. Martens at the same factory, produces for nearly
all other American brands at other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Yue Yuen may be unknown to U.S. consumers, but it is a colossus
in the wholesale footwear industry. The firm's factories in China,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Los Angeles produced 14 percent of
all branded athletic footwear sold worldwide in 1999, as well as 14
percent of casual shoes _ adding up to a total of 87 million pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhongshan factory, for example, is as big as a small city,
with 35,000 workers, nearly all of whom live on site in highrise
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   During Tucker's visit to Zhongshan with a Chronicle reporter, it
was apparent that her frequent outbursts _ pointing out missing
gloves here, missing goggles and the wrong kind of solvent there _
were not just a show for the press.
</P>
<P>
   In December, because of similar problems, Reebok punished Yue
Yuen by transferring about $40 million in annual sneaker contracts
from the Zhongshan plant to one elsewhere in China owned by another
firm.
</P>
<P>
   And because of pressure from Reebok and other American firms,
Yue Yuen has ended several practices that had earned harsh
criticism from human rights groups _ including its system of fining
workers for misbehavior and its practice of paying mainly by piece
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok's concerns have helped us pay more attention to human
rights issues,'' said Edward Ku, executive director of Yue Yuen. He
said that within a year, the company would switch completely to
less toxic, water-based glues on all its factories' production
lines _ another longtime demand of activists, who say the chemicals
cause health problems among workers.
</P>
<P>
   Evident throughout the factory is a strange mix of Reebok's
idealism and Yue Yuen's stern paternalism. Slogans everywhere
exhort workers: ``Work diligently because life is hard and short
(The spirit of Yue Yuen).''
</P>
<P>
   But Wang Pingli, one of the 35,000 workers, says she is happy
she made the trip late last year from her village in Shaanxi
province, 800 miles to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Yue Yuen ``is the best place to work in the area, because the
factory takes care of me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Wang, what makes Yue Yuen a desirable place to work is its
 &UR; zhi du  &LR; _ a system of rules partly derived from Reebok's code of
conduct and partly from Yue Yuen's own Confucian ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Zhi du regulates the conduct of both management and workers. It
means, among other things, that Wang works a maximum of 60 hours
per week, with five days of paid vacation a year, three months of
maternity leave if she gets pregnant, the services of a company
clinic and a pair of Reebok shoes as an annual bonus. Most
important (and most unusual in Guangdong), she is paid on time,
once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wang gets three meals a day and a bunk bed in a 12-woman room in
a high-rise dormitory. Factory regulations stipulate that she place
her toothbrush in just the right angle in her rinse cup, hang her
face towel just so, participate in early-morning drills and obey
the 11:30 p.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Wang is paid 650 yuan, or about $80, per month. To
her, it's a good deal, because back in her village she earned
nothing. In a few years' time she will have saved enough for a
dowry, she said. ``Or maybe enough to start a shop of my own,'' she
added brightly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sticky details, which seem to show the limits of
Tucker's good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the 60-hour week violates Chinese federal labor law,
which sets a maximum of 49 hours. Though the law is ignored
throughout Guangdong and other export-production zones in China,
Reebok's corporate code of conduct, as well as those of other U.S.
companies, pledges compliance with national labor laws in all
countries they operate in.
</P>
<P>
   More important, from the point of view of the AFL-CIO and human
rights activists who oppose U.S. trade concessions to China, is the
violation of internationally recognized labor organizing rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the Zhongshan factory and everywhere else in China, labor
peace is guaranteed by the only union allowed, the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions, controlled by the Communist Party and
factory management. Strikes are expressly  &LR; banned and union
functions are mostly limited to organizing after-hours recreation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The union president is invariably a management executive. The
union boss at the Reebok section of the plant, Xu Lan Ying, is also
the section's personnel director. She said her main purpose as
union chief is ``to help the factory run smoother and more
productively.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Xu said she had been chosen in a democratic union
election, she could produce no documentation to prove it. When
asked about the union outside the factory gates, Wang and her
co-workers said no such election ever occurred. Several were even
unaware of the union's existence.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked about the union, Tucker also was unaware that
it existed. Later, she said it was ``not really a union,'' and
Reebok had never communicated with it.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say that elsewhere in China, workers who
disobey their union chiefs or try to organize independent unions
are automatically fired or worse. Dozens of labor activists are
languishing in prison on charges of ``disrupting public order'' or
``counterrevolutionary crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to compare Yue Yuen with many small companies, it's
paradise,'' said Chan Kawai, executive director of Hong Kong
Christian Industrial Committee, a labor-rights group that has
carried out extensive studies in Zhongshan and at other south China
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fundamental rights of workers _ the right to freedom
of organization and the right to collective bargaining _ are still
repressed. Because they are so big, Reebok and Yue Yuen should do
more to give a voice to workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the limits of its efforts in Zhongshan, Reebok is
undeniably a leader of the U.S.  &LR; corporate reform movement. Along
with other firms  &LR; European and American firms such as Adidas, Levi
Strauss, Nike and Mattel, it has hired dozens of inspectors to
check factories for substandard conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker is an example. Formerly the director of International
Development Exchange, a liberal San Francisco group that carries
out small-scale aid projects in poor nations, she also worked at
the Asia Society in Indonesia before being hired by Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker seems torn by the criticism, defending her record while
agreeing with much of what her detractors say. ``Shoes are going to
be made in China no matter what,'' she said. ``It's the reality of
the industry. I think we just have to do whatever we can to improve
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But where there are no Jill Tuckers or zhi du, working
conditions are grim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at other factories in Guangdong say rampant exploitation
and poor conditions are routine. Workers are forced to toil 70, 80
and even 90 hours per week, protective equipment is rare, physical
abuse common, dorms filthy and unexplained ``penalties'' often
reduce paychecks to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. human rights groups have harshly criticized Disney,
Wal-Mart, K-Mart and the Gap for conditions in their China &LR; 
 &LR; Chinese factories. They say these companies, and others like them,
will be big beneficiaries of China's expected entry this year into
the World Trade Organization, which will phase out U.S. apparel and
textile import quotas and stimulate yet more foreign investment in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongshan's deputy mayor, Wu Rui Cheng, said he wants more &LR; to
attract more companies like Reebok _ or DuPont and Union Carbide,
and many others that have local factories. But when asked about
Reebok's human rights pressure, he wrinkled his nose. ``We have our
own laws about how to treat workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many U.S. firms seem to give the Chinese government
contradictory messages about reform. The American Chamber of
Commerce in China recently distributed to all top government
officials in Beijing a 97-page ``white paper'' proposing extensive
changes to Chinese laws and regulations that affect foreign
investors. The government has already made some of the requested
changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the report fails to mention any of the U.S. critics'
concerns _ enforcement of workplace health, safety, environmental
and labor laws, or  &LR; and union rights. And it  &LR; the report goes so
far as to ask the government to cut labor costs _ especially in
coastal areas such as Guangdong _ because it says wages there are
``among the highest for developing countries in Asia. ... These
high labor costs have already discouraged some potential
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the hackles of Medea Benjamin, director of Global
Exchange, a San Francisco group cooperating with Reebok, Mattel,
Levi Strauss and other organizations to create a common set of
rules for U.S. firms' factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the rhetoric that companies have a democratizing
effect, most U.S. companies are not only taking advantage of
China's low wages and repression, but they're actually pressing the
government to lower standards,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber Chairman Timothy Stratford defended his group's stand.
``I don't see any contradiction with our members' codes of
conduct,'' he said. ``We're upholding the highest standards, and
we're living by them.''

 U.S. ECONOMY SPINS AROUND HIGH TECH  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just as some might be tempted to start taking
the tech revolution for granted, along comes the American
Electronics Association with a report showing that, yup, high-tech
firms continue to pour cash and jobs into the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   California, naturally, still leads the way in just about every
growth category _ except for highest wages paid. New Jersey, of all
places, has slipped past the Golden State with an average tech wage
of $68,700, compared with California's $66,900.
</P>
<P>
   William Archey, the association's president, conceded that
annual reports detailing the rise and rise of the U.S. tech
industry are probably becoming old hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started issuing this report a few years ago, people
were like, `Wow!' '' he said. ``I told my staff that, sooner or
later, this wouldn't be a big deal. Perhaps that time is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is still carrying the ball,'' said Gary
Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in San
Francisco. ``This is clearly a tech-led expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, he said it's hard to overstate the impact that
industries like semiconductors and communications equipment are
having on U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Tech manufacturing and services accounted for 6.5 percent of
U.S. gross domestic product in 1998, compared with 5.6 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be news to San Francisco,'' Archey said, ``but it
is news to about 45 other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more noteworthy developments in the association's
latest report, titled ``Cyberstates 4.0,'' is that, for the first
time, all 50 states posted gains in high-tech jobs between 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas, Virginia, Colorado and Georgia led the way in
creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In California alone, a record 835,000 people were employed in
some facet of the tech industry as of 1998. Only education and
health care produced more jobs statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Fun fact: Seventy of every 1,000 workers in California's private
sector are employed by tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has the highest density of tech workers (84 per 1,000),
followed by New Hampshire (83 per 1,000) and Massachusetts (79 per
1,000).
</P>
<P>
   California leads the way in high-tech exports ($53 billion),
venture capital ($17 billion) and total R&AMP;D expenditures ($42
billion).
</P>
<P>
   At $42 billion in R&AMP;D, the state accounts for a fifth of all
research and development spending nationwide, or nearly as much as
the next four states _ Michigan, New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts _ combined.
</P>
<P>
   While California is tops in creation of high-tech jobs _ up 30
percent since 1993 _ tiny Delaware is setting the pace in
tech-export growth, climbing 134 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   California's tech exports grew just 4 percent in the same
period, but nevertheless account for almost a third of America's
total $181 billion in technology shipped abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the association is projecting that total U.S.
tech employment will jump 45 percent from 5 million last year to
7.1 million by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we cheerleading?'' Archey said. ``Damn right. I don't
apologize for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is the country's biggest tech industry group,
representing some 3,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of the beginning, that's where we are,'' Archey
said. ``Technology has become part of the fabric of the community,
but it's still very new.''

 SMALL FIRMS TAKING OFF AS BIG SPENDERS ON THE NET  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; U.S. small businesses are emerging as a
dominant force in online buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they spent $25 billion for goods and services over
the Internet _ more than 12 times the previous year, according to a
study released Tuesday by New York's Access Markets International
(AMI) Partners Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, business-to-business spending topped online
consumer spending _ by a whopping $5 billion. Meanwhile, the number
of small businesses transacting business online jumped 55 percent
to 2.8 million from 1.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a spectacular rise in online purchasing by
businesses with one to 99 employees,'' said Andy Bose, chief
executive officer of AMI-Partners. ``We are projecting that
small-business online purchases will register $118 billion by 2001,
emerging as a critical driver of overall B2B e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, co-sponsored by Inc. magazine, also reports these
statistics on the growth of online business with small businesses:
</P>
<P>
   -- 4.2 million (57 percent) of the 7.4 million U.S. small
businesses access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Almost 17 million, or one quarter of 68 million
small-business employees, use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1.3 million small businesses are interested in using the
Internet to collaborate with other small businesses to buy in
groups to obtain better prices for products and services.
</P>
<P>
   -- 670,000 small businesses have ventured into the online
auction arena and nearly 1 million small businesses plan to bid for
products and services this year.
</P>
<P>
   -- An estimated 600,000 small businesses sold goods and services
via e-commerce sites in 1999, up from 400,000 in 1998. Meanwhile
sales rose to $25 billion from $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all the findings were positive.
</P>
<P>
   While small businesses are turning to the Internet and making
online purchases in record numbers, many are skeptical about
whether launching e-commerce sites and selling online will actually
boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence of e-backlash among small businesses,'' said
Bose. ``Six out of 10 small businesses don't believe that the Web
is well suited for selling their wares, and they feel overwhelmed
by the technological challenges involved in establishing a solid
online presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they are concerned by high costs, inadequate
technical support and security issues involved with conducting
business online and outsourcing critical business functions.
</P>
<P>
   The average small business spends $170 a month on Web site
support, according to Bose. Some are not sure what they are getting
for their money but feel they have no choice given all the
predictions for growth in online commerce.
</P>
<P>
   AMR Research of Boston released a study this week that suggests
B2B e-commerce will reach $1.7 trillion by 2004. It contends that
many companies that do not take an aggressive approach in preparing
for the digital marketplace will lose customers and ultimately
fail.
</P>
<P>
   B2B e-commerce momentum is being driven by two main
opportunities, according to AMR:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost Savings: Reductions in selling, general and
administrative expenses could exceed $50 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   -- Trading Exchanges. These allow smaller companies to solicit
customers, respond to bids and take orders via the Internet with
minimal investment in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of B2B exchanges and auction sites are available to
help businesses buy and sell everything from industrial parts to
chemicals. A growing number of online businesses are helping small
businesses pool their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, small businesses spent $220 billion on business
services, and an increasing number are turning to online providers
to handle everything from hiring and training employees to handling
insurance, payroll, direct mail and other corporate chores.

 USE OF ONLINE BARTERING SHOWS GROWTH  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Finally, an Internet trend Fred Flintstone could
grok.
</P>
<P>
   Barter, which has been around since a hunter first traded a
woolly mammoth tusk for a flint ax, has moved online in a big way.
Its primary adherents are small businesses that benefit by getting
goods and services without having to lay out cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're starting out, cash flow is everything,'' said
Catherine Fischer, co-owner of the Parkway Theater, an Oakland,
Calif., movie house that serves up pizza, pasta and beer to its
audiences. ``By bartering, you can get goods and services you need
to get your business going without tying up your cash.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, she estimates that she has bartered
for $10,000 to $15,000 of services _ plumbing repairs, bulk
mailing, pest control, even a $2,000 security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a credit card that you don't have to pay back
in cash,'' she said. ``You do pay it back, but it's by people using
your business as opposed to your sending in money.'' Fischer uses a
site called BarterTrust after starting with a service that was
acquired by BarterTrust.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other Web sites have sprung up recently to help small
businesses barter online, including BigVine, LassoBucks,
BarterItOnline and uBarter.
</P>
<P>
   They list a diverse range of professional services _ accounting,
consulting, legal, photography, training _ and some nuts and bolts
like car repair, office cleaning and printing. Travel and
entertainment items, such as restaurant meals, catering services,
airline tickets, hotel rooms and meeting rooms are also big, as is
advertising space. Products available for barter include fax
machines, credenzas and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most cultures adopted cash-based economies millennia
ago, barter never really went away. About $16 billion worth of
goods and services were bartered in 1999. Much of that happened
through small regional exchanges and informal community networking.
</P>
<P>
   What Internet barter sites bring to the party are a broader
reach, unconstrained by geography, and critical mass _ plus the
ability to add services such as escrow and financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scale matters, and the Internet provides scale,'' said Mike
Edelhart, chief executive of Internet Barter Inc., which runs
BarterTrust.
</P>
<P>
   But that means a barter system is only as good as the number of
listings it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people using a barter system, the more effective it
is,'' said Arthur Lazere, publisher and editor of arts-review Web
site culturevulture.net.
</P>
<P>
   Lazere, who uses BigVine, said he likes it as a way to generate
more resources for his small business. He offers ad space on his
Web site and has used his barter credit for Internet marketing
services. ``I'm a frugal person, so this appeals to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been pleased with BigVine's customer service, so
far he has been able to use the system only for icing-on-the-cake
items. He would like it to add basic office supplies like printer
cartridges so he could rely on it to reduce some of his set
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Online barter is rarely a straight tit-for-tat exchange. If a
dry cleaner needs someone to install Windows 2000, he might not
want to wait for a computer professional with rumpled clothes to
come along.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each barter system uses its own in-house currency, a
kind of Monopoly money that works only within that system. Often,
users can prime the pump by putting an initial amount on a credit
card or a system's in-house credit.
</P>
<P>
   Barter clients post their wares at fair-market value _ the same
rates they would charge cash customers. When someone takes them up
on the offer, they get that dollar amount of credit on the system,
which they can redeem whenever they want.
</P>
<P>
   The barter exchange takes a cash cut of the transaction _
anywhere from 4 to 10 percent, split between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   For tax purposes, barter accounting is straightforward. There's
even a line on tax forms for barter income. Businesses report
barter gains as if they had received that amount in cash, deducting
the commission as an expense.
</P>
<P>
   Besides conserving cash, online barter has another plus for
small businesses: It exposes them to a new world of potential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like BarterTrust is acting as an advertising or
promotional agent for us,'' said Larry Bearg, vice president of
Planet Organics, a San Francisco company that delivers organic
produce to Bay Area households.
</P>
<P>
   That's because his firm is listed on the site and comes up in
any searches its clients do for food-related products. BarterTrust
also is letting him enclose a brochure about Planet Organics in its
next mailing to customers _ at no charge. ``Those are customers I
wouldn't reach otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bearg estimates that he has done about $8,000 to $10,000 worth
of barter during the past five months. In exchange for produce
deliveries, he has received locksmith services, had signs painted
on Planet Organics' five vans, done photocopying, and placed ads in
the Bay Guardian and East Bay Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Two Bay Area companies, Internet Barter Inc. of San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   and BigVine.com of Redwood Shores, Calif., are leaders in the
charge to online barter. Both have amassed large war chests (of
cash, not bartered services) and both have impressive blue-chip
backing.
</P>
<P>
   BigVine, which launched its site in late January, has $60
million in venture backing from American Express, the Starwood
Hotels chain, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Co., among others.
</P>
<P>
   Its agreement with American Express lets it market directly to
the 2 million firms that hold small-business AmEx cards or that
accept the card.
</P>
<P>
   ``What eBay did for auctions, we're trying to do for barter,''
said BigVine chief executive Bippy Siegal.
</P>
<P>
   The company practices what it preaches. BigVine has bartered for
its water machine, food it provides to employees and construction
in its building, Siegal said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Barter has $70 million in backing from investors
including General Motors and GE Capital Corp. The private company,
started last April, has grown rapidly by acquiring smaller regional
exchanges, including ones in Mexico and Canada, and putting them
online. In 1999 it facilitated $120 million worth of transactions;
its revenues totaled $10 million. The company is undergoing an
audit to determine its net profit or loss for 1999, and said it
expects to turn a profit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although 90 percent of BarterTrust users are small businesses,
several big corporations, such as Panasonic, TWA and Maytag, also
list their wares on the site, to the tune of about $1 million in
inventory each, Edelhart said. ``Big companies want one more way to
reach out to small businesses. No company ever has all the
distribution channels it needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edelhart is in talks with both GM and GE about offering their
goods on the service. ``It's quite conceivable that a year from now
you could barter for a GM truck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sprenger's experience with barter goes back to his
childhood. His father owned Calistoga Mineral Waters in the 1970s.
``I remember him doing a lot of bartering for boxes and bottles,
all kinds of stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a no-brainer for the Santa Rosa, Calif., golf pro to
try out BigVine. He's particularly happy that some people who
signed up for barter lessons turned into cash customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free way to advertise to a broader market,'' Sprenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he needs plumbing or car repairs, he plans to look first on
the site. ``The whole idea of bartering is pretty great,'' he said.

 HP'S 2ND-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE A VIGOROUS 17%  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The evidence is mounting that Chief Executive
Officer Carly Fiorina's campaign to re-energize Hewlett-Packard is
paying off.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Palo Alto, Calif., computing giant posted
results for its second fiscal quarter that far exceeded analysts'
estimates. The impressive report was the company's third straight,
following a year of uneven results.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges and gains, earnings per share from
continuing operations in the quarter totaled 87 cents, compared
with 73 cents for the same period last year. The consensus estimate
among analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was 82
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Including one-time items, such as an early retirement program
and costs associated with spinning off HP's former
test-and-measurement business into the soon to be independent
Agilent Technologies, earnings per share was 79 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings from continuing operations, again excluding
one-time items, were $899 million, up 17 percent from $766 million
in last year's second quarter. Net revenue from continuing
operations for the quarter, which ended April 30, was $12 billion,
up 15 percent from $10.5 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the effect of currency fluctuations, revenue growth
was 17 percent. In the second quarter of last year, it was only 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ``continuing operations'' qualification excludes results
from Agilent. The spin-off of that company will be completed June
2, when HP investors will receive the 84.1 percent of Agilent
shares the parent company still owns.
</P>
<P>
   HP's growth was especially strong in its computing systems
business, which includes everything from high-end servers to
low-cost consumer PCs. Overall, revenues in that category were up
19 percent, compared with no growth in the same quarter a year ago.
Home PC revenues were up 85 percent, on an increase in unit
shipments of 105 percent, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the notebook PC arena, where HP in the past has lagged behind
its competitors, revenues and unit shipments were up 180 percent
and 248 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Unix servers _ a segment Fiorina identified as a
major problem area for HP last fall, shortly after she took over
the company in July _ were up 26 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, she emphasized that the
company's restructured and reinvigorated server sales force _
``unlike some competitors'' _ is not signing unprofitable deals or
trading hardware for future service revenues.
</P>
<P>
   HP also reported solid growth in its printing and imaging
business, which includes printers, scanners and supplies. Personal
printers and scanners, plus supplies, showed the largest increases.
In the office arena, company officials said, demand for color
printers is growing strongly, but there is a continuing shift away
from personal monochrome laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Agilent reported net income of $166 million (36
cents a share) compared with $157 million (41 cents) in the same
quarter last year. Excluding a gain of 4 cents per share on
investments, Agilent said, earnings were 32 cents a share, matching
the First Call consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter was up 24 percent, to $2.49 billion.

 LOWER PRICES FOR GAS NOT EXPECTED TO LAST  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gas prices in the Bay Area have dropped 8 cents
a gallon over the past four weeks, reaching their lowest level in
more than two months, according to a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the California Automobile Association survey also said
that consumer savings will only be temporary because prices are
expected to rise again during the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest drop that we've seen in quite a while,'' said
Paul Moreno, a spokesman for the automobile association. ``But
unfortunately, it's not going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of self-serve unleaded gas in the
Bay Area now stands at $1.78, down from $1.86 last month. In San
Francisco, the price of a gallon of self-serve unleaded gas is
$1.86, down from $1.92.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said that gas prices declined because of an increase in
crude oil production by OPEC countries and healthy gas production
by California refineries.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that crude oil prices have been on the rise
recently, which should make gas more expensive as drivers take to
the road in what is expected to be a busy summer vacation season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a matter of one or two weeks before gas costs
more,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current decline in gas costs, prices are still a lot
more expensive than in January, when a gallon of self-serve
unleaded gas averaged $1.46 in the Bay Area.

 FIRMS USE WEB TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Northern Mountain Supply reinvented itself by
going online.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 22 years, the Eureka, Calif., company sold camping
and other outdoor equipment at its retail store. Then, in 1996,
Scott Sway, the company's president, decided to set up
Northernmountain.com and a digital catalog. Since then, the
company's workforce has grown to 26 from 12. In less than two
years, sales have doubled and profits are up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being located `behind the redwood curtain' in Humboldt County,
we don't have local access to a lot of supplies and resources,''
said Sway. Going online overcame that obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   The company found its business software and buys many of its
supplies on the Web. It markets almost exclusively via search
engines, and Sway said the company researches information online
``before virtually every major decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sway is one of dozens of Northern California business owners who
responded to a recent Chronicle survey of readers about their
online experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Many moved to the Internet to strengthen relationships with
their customers, expand their markets and increase their
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of going online can range from nothing for free
services on the Web to many thousands of dollars for fee services
and professional advice.
</P>
<P>
   While some businesses have found nirvana on the Web, others have
found it nerve-racking, costly and a huge investment of time.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Loomis Group, a 50-person, 12-year-old San
Francisco advertising/public relations agency, began using the
Internet five years ago to send creative work to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Walker, the agency's media relations manager, said the
move has saved ``tremendous time and money'' compared with sending
the design by FedEx or taking it in person to the client. Loomis
also uses Web kiosks to let clients view all invoices, PR materials
and ads on their own terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Bell, owner of a San Rafael, Calif., executive search
firm of the same name, says urgency is the name of the game in his
industry, too. He finds the Internet and high-speed DSL connections
essential in searching for potential employees and quickly
e-mailing job information and resumes back and forth between
companies and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt Williams, president of Group S in Alameda, Calif., also
is a fan of online services ``to speed up the startup process.''
His company, which is developing online sales productivity tools,
turned to another online company called HRPath.com to set up a
hiring structure, including employee handbook and application
forms, as well as insurance coverage and payroll services. Williams
also endorses online recruiting services such as Monsterboard and
Career.com.
</P>
<P>
   At AquaPrix, a Hayward, Calif., company that distributes water
purification systems, ``we are always looking for ways to stretch
every dollar,'' said chief executive Lynne Leahy. That's why she
has turned to the Internet for office support services like payroll
and banking. ``Online means it's done instantly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it primarily markets the water systems to corporations,
AquaPrix also has some products for consumers, which it sells on
its Web site. It hopes to expand that e-commerce function.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy also uses e-mail to communicate with customers, sending
out twice-monthly updates with tips and news about drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   She would like to buy office supplies online but has found that
Web sites have a more limited selection than superstore catalogs.
And she is hoping to expand into barter for advertising and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to operate in Silicon Valley or deal with
high-tech types to get hooked on the Net. The Great Plate Bar &AMP;
Grill in Tracy, Calif., uses the eBay auction site to buy items
ranging from plates, silverware and pizza pans to sound equipment
and copier toner cartridges. The restaurant uses the Net to buy
``most everything but food,'' says co-owner Shawn Perry.
</P>
<P>
   When a piece of equipment breaks down, Perry likes going online
to find tech support or repair manuals. He said the restaurant used
Microsoft FrontPage to develop a Web site to attract new customer
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Hooks, owner of Timeout for Fun and Games in Oakland,
Calif., is expanding her Web site from solely providing information
to selling chess sets and other products online.
</P>
<P>
   She has switched from CitySource to CloudSource, an Oakland
startup that specializes in offering small businesses custom Web
sites for a fixed fee, and is eagerly awaiting promised e-commerce
features.
</P>
<P>
   Some budding entrepreneurs say they owe their business concept
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Izabel Loinaz is a flamenco dancer who needed a day
job. So a year ago, she started a personal assistant service called
Peace of Mind for individuals and businesseses.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 to $45 an hour, the San Francisco resident will organize
a garage or entire office and do chores like picking up dry
cleaning for time-pressed clients. But Loinaz spends most of her
work hours on the Web, researching products and services and buying
them for customers.
</P>
<P>
   She said her favorite online small-business Web sites for
general information are Onvia.com, AllBusiness.com and the Small
Business Administration's Score site. She likes the Professional
Organizers Web Ring and the National Association of Professional
Organizers for networking, marketing tips and checking out the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   When she developed her own Web site, she registered her domain
name with NetworkSolutions.com. To research products and prices to
ensure she gets the best price for her customers, Loinaz visits
Epinions.com, Productopia.com, Deja.com, PriceWatch.com and
About.com. She said she gets the best price, including shipping
costs, on most equipment from Palm units to photo scanners from
Buy.com. She also likes Webvan and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although some users find they often spin their wheels on the
Web, Loinaz said, ``I have been doing it long enough that I usually
know exactly where to find what my customers want at the best price
in half the time it would take me to drive anywhere in this city.''
However, she admits it is sometimes nice to see and touch before
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers find it necessary to visit real stores.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Bardsley, who operates Applied Bioengineering out of his
home in Cupertino, Calif., said online shopping services should
give customers at least as much product information as they might
find in a store.
</P>
<P>
   But when he visited OfficeSupplies.com, he was dismayed to find
that's not necessarily the case. He wanted to buy Shaeffer
ballpoint pen refills but gave up when he couldn't get product
photos or precise measurements to ensure that he was buying the
right product. He also ran aground trying to buy HP Bright Paper
because it wasn't stated whether the $5.56 price was for 250 or 500
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Many entrepreneurs find it even more difficult to set up a Web
site and e-commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Lobosco took his San Rafael, Calif., management consulting
firm, Allies Consulting Services, online five years ago and vividly
remembers all the problems, beginning with a defective USRobotics
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right Internet service provider wasn't a snap,
either. Lobosco started with America Online, shifted to Best
Internet and now is considering changing to Advanced Telecom Group
and upgrading to faster DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of dealing with the Internet and getting various services
is a headache for the nontechnical and uninitiated,'' said Lobosco.
Even though he has a technical background and was able to resolve
some problems, he said creating a Web site was a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local, small-scale Web site developers give the impression of
fabulous results in a short time, when the truth is far
different,'' he warns. Many developers ``don't try to learn about
the company's business or needs and are more concerned with their
own ego and agenda. They get a business to pay for the developer's
chance to `show off,' and the result is a hideous mix of terrible
site structure, inappropriate graphics, poor marketing materials,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lobosco figures that in the long run, going online
will save his management consulting firm time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about building our brand and educating our prospects,''
said Lobosco. ``Instead of printing up materials and mailing them,
which is costly in time and money, we have information on the
Internet, which is easy to change and always there.''

PRISON SYSTEM FOR YOUTH BLASTED BY WITNESSES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ A former California Youth Authority ward, a former
department employee and Davis administration officials told a
Senate committee Tuesday that the troubled agency is failing its
mission to rehabilitate youthful offenders.
<P>
   Witnesses recounted a litany of horrors from assaults, rapes and
drug use among wards to sexual and physical abuse of wards by
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You prepare yourself for what I consider battle. You have to
fight. You must survive. I did so,'' Armando Lopez, who served
seven years in the CYA for second-degree murder, told the Senate
Public Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing was the first comprehensive look lawmakers
have taken of the 7,300-ward prison system for young offenders in
the wake of recent accounts of inmate abuse, biomedical experiments
on wards and the resignation of the agency's director last December
after only 10 months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses cited deep budget cuts in the early 1990s for
sharply increasing the ratio of counselors and parole officers to
wards, reducing treatment of mentally ill wards and increasing
stress-repated workers compensation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve White, the Davis administration inspector general for
prisons and the CYA, said lack of money was part of the problem, as
was an ``implosion of spirit'' in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned the system is totally out of whack,'' said Sen.
John Vasconcellos, chair of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who now works at a Southern California CYA parole office,
painted a harrowing picture of incarceration where 90 percent of
violence occurs without knowledge of guards, where gang members are
pitted against each other, where ``hovering'' over a youth
authority official can lead to months of incarceration with just
one hour a day outside of a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lopez, 23, praised some of the programs designed to
help wards return to society, he said some of the staff ``did not
have the skills'' and, often with the threat of rival gang members
in the same class, ``you're not thinking about studying.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Sen, Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, if drugs are
prevalent, Lopez said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. Every type of drug you can think of is in there.
Methamphetamines. Marijuana. Everything is accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Polanco asked about the incidence of male rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed two rapes and another I heard of,'' Lopez said.
``I only seen one person defend himself from an attempted attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Midyett, an Oakland police officer, whose son is a CYA
ward, echoed some of Lopez's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Sean, entered the CYA at 17 for an assault with a
deadly weapon. Since then, Midyett said, his son's sentence has
been lengthened by 18 months for testing positive for cocaine,
tattooing himself, not working and fighting a member of a rival
gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean feels safer in lockdown and that's sad,'' Midyett said.
``If what is described is rehabilitation, what is punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Presley, Davis' cabinet secretary for youth and adult
prisons, acknowledged there have been problems at the authority,
but said the Davis administration was taking steps to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   He said biomedical research on wards had been ended. He also
said he began a series of audits by the Board of Corrections of
several CYA facilities to assess their operation and treatment of
wards.
</P>
<P>
   Vasconcellos praised the new director of the agency, Jerry
Harper, former undersheriff for Los Angeles County, for a
willingness to focus more energy on the department's goal of
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis appointed Harper to the job in March, nearly
four months after Davis' first choice for CYA head resigned amid
revelations of ward abuse by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Vasconcellos said he and Polanco were working on a plan to pour
more money into the department to add counselors, improve medical
care and increase employee training.

 GROW A BUSINESS: CHAMBER CELEBRATES 150TH YEAR  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wednesday night, the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce hosts its 150th anniversary gala at the Festival Pavilion
at Fort Mason. For the $200 price tag, guests will be treated to
the city's culinary treats and a specially written ``From Gold Rush
to Cyberspace!'' performance by Steve Silver's Beach Blanket
Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and Gov. Gray Davis' wife,
Sharon, are scheduled to attend and should like this twist on
``California Dreaming'' by the Mamas and the Papas: ``All the
mayors are Brown and the governor's Gray.'' (The other Brown is
Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown.)
</P>
<P>
   Also likely to draw laughs are these revised lyrics for Peggy
Lee's ``Fever'': ``The worldwide Web is taking over, cyber cafes
everywhere. Yahoo taxis all around me, I like a man who's wealthy
and square. Got dot-com fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber was formed by 19 San Franciscans in May 1850 to
arbitrate business disputes. Its first case in 1851 had little to
do with local issues. It involved four jugs of linseed oil broken
on a voyage from London. Now the chamber has 2,200 members and more
than 250 programs and events. The organization focuses on such
public policy issues as the business climate, affordable housing,
public education, transportation and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley Fun Raiser
</P>
<P>
   An even more select, invitation-only party and charity auction
will be held this Friday evening at the Atherton, Calif., home of
Ron Conway, founder of Angel Investors, which has invested more
than $160 million in more than 100 local startups since the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Buffett will give a brief pep talk on the virtues of
financing worthwhile causes. Then Conway hopes to raise $1 million
or more for local charities by auctioning off such things as a golf
game with Tiger Woods, tennis match with Pete Sampras and Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Humvee. Dana Carvey will act as emcee.
</P>
<P>
   IPO Pullback
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere that the IPO frenzy is fading. Just
look at this week's anemic IPO calendar of local activity.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Case, CEO of Chase H&AMP;Q, also sees a major change in how new
stocks are priced since the Nasdaq minicrash last month. He notes
that in the first quarter, only 2 percent of companies that went
public sold their shares below the pricing range that they filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By contrast, over the
past 30 days, three-quarters of companies priced their stock below
their planned range.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPO pricing tends to adjust near instantaneously to market
conditions,'' Case says. Nevertheless, he adds that the market
correction was ``much needed and healthy'' and predicts IPO
activity this summer will be ``robust'' even if it doesn't set new
records. What is likely is that more startups will turn to debt
financing or find a wealthy merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Hambrecht &AMP; Quist did last year. The San Francisco
investment bank was acquired by New York's Chase Manhattan Corp.,
whose top executives held their annual meeting in San Francisco on
Tuesday to present their case to West Coast digerati. A handful of
execs flew in on Chase's Gulfstream, including Chase CEO Bill
Harrison and Jimmy Lee, the head of global investment banking whom
Michael Douglas styled his slick Gordon Gecko character on in the
movie ``Wall Street.``
</P>
<P>
   Startupfailures.com
</P>
<P>
   If you are getting nauseated by all the VC success stories and
tales of dot-com millionaires, you might want to visit a new Web
site called Startupfailures.com. It was launched this month by Nick
Hall, who previously started two companies that failed and worked
for a third.
</P>
<P>
   Hall dubs the site ``the place for bouncing back'' and offers
discussion boards, ``Ask a coach'' services, failure feedback, job
listings and other resources for those who have hit a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   He offers soothing statistics such as only 6 of every 1,000
business plans win venture funding and 60 percent of companies that
do receive financing go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose,'' states Hall, ``is to take the stigma out of
failing and help entrepreneurs recover quickly from the failure and
get back in action.''
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a week, Hall's site has attracted about
40,000 visitors, and he is talking with potential sponsors.
However, he is unsure if or how Startupfailures.com might move from
philanthropic community service to profitable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Hall has an angel investor. His wife, a sales
manager for Playtex Products, helps support his ventures. In
addition to Startupfailures.com, Hall is president of the Silicon
Valley Association of Software Engineers, currently a nonpaying
position. He is also author of ``The Future Scrapbook: Having the
Design of Your Life.''

 THE BEST WEB PORTALS FOR ENTREPRENEURS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Small business portals say they can help
entrepreneurs set up a Web site with ease, save money ordering
goods and services online, and simplify their management chores.
But as many small businesses have discovered, it's often not as
easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is often simplistic. One-size-fits-all services have
their limits. Most portals refer customers only to ``preferred''
partners with whom they have a self-serving business relationship.
And many sites charge fees and don't necessarily save users time or
money.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, numerous Web sites are worthwhile. In its May 1
issue, Fortune Magazine ( &LR; www.fortune.com &LR; ) provides an A to Z list
of winning features of some of the best portals for small
businesses. Here is a brief summary:
</P>
<P>
   -- ABC Business _ Originally Go.com's small-business portal and
now part of ABCNews.com, this site offers a useful weekly ``Small
Business Builder'' column and some personal financial calculator
tools.
</P>
<P>
   -- AllBusiness.com _ It offers plenty of details on running a
business, including more than 300 ready-to-download forms, from
licensing agreements to venture capital term sheets. It also
provides answers to frequently asked questions and concise but
basic how-to guides as well as services from more than 40 partners.
</P>
<P>
   -- BCentral.com _ Microsoft's small-business portal lets users
submit their Web sites to search engines, check how many visitors
they receive on them and create customer mailing lists. It also
offers a free banner-ad exchange program and a variety of paid
services.
</P>
<P>
   -- Business Owner's Toolkit _ The site's SOHO (small office/home
office) guidebook offers how-to information on marketing, taxes,
incorporation, financing and employees that is of special interest
to fledgling small-business owners. It offers some business forms
but only scant advice on moving your business online.
( &LR; www.toolkit.cch.com &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   -- DigitalWork.com _ Various Web sites license its services,
which focus on offline business needs such as press releases,
direct-mail campaigns and recruiting. It offers a list of preferred
providers, but usually only one per category.
</P>
<P>
   -- Freeworks.com _ Although there's little content, it is a
novel and free way to process expense reports, travel requests and
purchase orders throughout a company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Inc.com _ Affiliated with Inc. magazine, the site has good
material but it's not always easy to find it. There are useful free
tools for finding health insurance and calculating your company's
fiscal health. In addition, there are fee services for tasks such
as processing payroll.
</P>
<P>
   -- Office.com _ It covers more industries from architecture to
solid-waste collection than other sites and offers specific news as
well as general advice. Business services are available from
preferred vendors and Winstar, its parent company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Onvia.com _ This site's useful request-for-quote service
covers dozens of categories, including health insurance, business
loans, Web design and even tax-law advice. Instead of providing a
link to a preferred vendor, it passes requests to a network of
providers who then submit quotes. Downside: Users must fill out a
new form for each service, and without reviews or user feedback,
it's not easy to gauge the quality of a vendor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Quicken.com _ It provides good general business information
and easy access to credit-card rates, tax information and forms,
payroll and other services. Although it provides links to other
sites, it has few business tools to run an online business.
</P>
<P>
   -- Smalloffice.com _ This site is not easy to navigate but
offers plenty of advice on how to start and run an online business,
such as building customer support into your Web site and tools to
help find a local Web designer or HR firm. Users can post questions
to online advisers.
</P>
<P>
   -- SmartAge.com _ Site offers tools, some free, to help run a
site, such as checking your server's performance and tracking your
popularity on search sites. Some tools and templates are basic.
</P>
<P>
   -- SmartOnline.com _ Site offers a few interactive features for
businesses that are just getting off the ground, such as the $15
Smart Incorporator quiz to help a user choose the best way to
organize and generate the required paperwork. Some of the 1,800
legal forms and 500 business letters are free.
</P>
<P>
   -- Workz.com _ Site offers most everything one needs to know
about running an online business, from creating banner ads to
accepting credit cards to comparing vendors. For example, it
compares prices for site-submission services and dozens of merchant
account providers. Workz also offers free tools such as checking a
site for dead links and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   -- Yahoo.com _ Although the site touts Yahoo's own Web services,
a user will find useful resources when searching for a topic like
e-commerce, finance and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   -- ZDNet.com _ The site of Ziff-Davis, publisher of PC
publications, offers sophisticated tutorials on e-commerce, Web
design, intellectual property and other issues.

 WEB PORTAL LYCOS WILL BE BOUGHT FOR $12.5 BILLION  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Terra Networks, the Internet arm of Spanish
telecommunications firm Telefonica, said Tuesday that it will buy
Lycos, the Web portal, in a $12.5 billion deal aimed at creating a
global technology giant to rival America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, called Terra Lycos, will have its hand in the
Internet, wireless communications and television. It will also be
an international force, with operations in 37 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the Internet is going global,'' said Rob
Enderle, a technology industry analyst with Giga Information Group,
a market research company. ``Clearly, a lot of the growth on the
Internet is going to be international, and this will put the new
company in a good position for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Terra Lycos, to be based in Madrid, will be the world's
third-largest Internet company in terms of revenue after America
Online and Yahoo. The combined companies expect to take in $500
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Terra Networks, with 2 million Internet subscribers, has Web
sites throughout the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. Lycos,
of Waltham, Mass., has the fourth most-popular Web property in the
United States and a strong field of Internet sites in Asia, Latin
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Andrews, an analyst with the Gartner Group, a market
research company, said that the deal links Terra Networks to a
wealth of online commerce and content for its Web sites. He added
that buying Lycos gives Terra Networks a portal for its wireless
Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrews questioned whether Terra Networks had to buy Lycos.
He said that Terra may have been able to partner with Lycos for
much less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear to me that the two companies need to own each
other to have their promise fulfilled,'' Andrews said. ``The notion
that a company with the breadth and depth of experience of Lycos
will mainly serve to create a front end for Terra is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger comes a year and a half after Lycos considered being
acquired by USA Networks, the cable television firm led by Barry
Diller. That deal fell through because of shareholder skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Terra-Lycos merger also follows a series of other big
acquisitions in the Internet industry. In January, America Online
announced a deal to buy media giant Time Warner, while Disney
bought Web portal Infoseek in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Villalonga, the Terra Networks and Telefonica chairman who
will lead Terra Lycos, said that the deal gives his company a big
advantage over its competitors because of its geographic reach and
access to broadband, wireless and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``From today, AOL has a competitor,'' Villalonga declared.
</P>
<P>
   Also announced Tuesday was a marketing agreement between Terra
Lycos and Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate. Bertelsmann,
already a partner with Lycos Europe, will pay $1 billion for a
five-year deal to offer its books, films and music on the Terra
Lycos Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Lycos and Terra Networks must still pass
regulatory hurdles and be approved by shareholders. The companies
said that the agreement will probably be finalized this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Terra Networks to pay $97.55 in its own
stock for each Lycos share. That is nearly double the price of
Lycos stock on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos will continue to be operated out of its headquarters in
Massachusetts. No layoffs are expected. Bob Davis, Lycos president
and chief executive, will be chief executive of Terra Lycos.

 HOLOCAUST CLAIMS LAW SITTING UNENFORCED, ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The author of California's law requiring insurers
to settle the claims of Holocaust victims is accusing Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush of not enforcing it.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, has asked Attorney
General Bill Lockyer to investigate why no insurance companies have
had their licenses revoked as allowed by a law Knox authored.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has been under fire for pushing earthquake insurers
to contribute to a nonprofit foundation he established in lieu of
their paying large fines. Two legislative inquiries are proceeding,
and Lockyer has gone to court to stop the foundation from spending
any more money.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said revocations should have been started May 7, but he has
had no word from Quackenbush's office as to why no action has been
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no confidence that further reasons wouldn't
be found for further delays,'' Knox said. ``It was time to involve
the chief law enforcement officer of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lockyer said his office has received Knox's
request and is reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Knox's bill, all insurance companies that
conduct business in the state were required to produce a list of
Holocaust-era policies. The goal was to allow survivors or their
beneficiaries to determine if they are owed money. Knox said any
company that did not provide the information should have had their
license to do business in the state revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that fail to fully and timely disclose their claims
can have their licenses lifted,'' he said. ``The thing the
insurance company is supposed to do is pay claims to people. The
failure to pay claims is a reason to deny doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   But several insurance companies have filed lawsuits challenging
the constitutionality of the laws. Quackenbush's office said a
delay in regulatory action against the companies was part of the
response to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed very aggressive opposition _ a 133-page brief and 800
pages of evidence _ to the lawsuits,'' Quackenbush said in a
prepared  &LR; statement. He said his office decided to ``defer
initiating regulatory action until after the court ruled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To permit adequate opportunity to take discovery and prepare
that extensive opposition to the insurance companies' motions, we
agreed in court-filed documents to defer initiating regulatory
action until after the court ruled.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knox said the court should have been the one to stop any
action mandated by the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act does not authorize that kind of deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has been under fire for allowing insurance companies
to duck up to $3 million in fines by contributing to a nonprofit
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was supposed to pay for earthquake research and
consumer aid, but Quackenbush acknowledged at an Assembly hearing
last week that no money has yet  &LR; gone to earthquake victims as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, money has been paid to some of Quackenbush's political
operatives; a $500,000 contribution was given to the Greater
Sacramento Urban League; $12,000 went to the National Latino Peace
Officers Association; and $200,000 benefited the 100 Black Men
program.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush also wanted to create a foundation with $4.2 million
that three Dutch insurance firms gave that is intended for poor
Holocaust survivors. Knox has requested Lockyer to determine
whether the Dutch firms donated this money in lieu of fines, as
they did with the Northridge foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Quackenbush said none of the money has been
spent, and that the foundation idea has been scrapped because of
the problems with the earthquake foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will present to the Legislature next week a proposal to set
up an appropriate vehicle to implement the distribution of these
monies to California survivors,'' he said.  &LR;

 CALPERS HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS MAY RISE  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 1 million members of the California Public
Employees Retirement System are likely to see significant increases
in their health insurance premiums and drug co-payments next year.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS' health benefits committee yesterday approved a hotly
debated compromise plan that would raise premiums an average of 7.3
percent in 2001 and double co-payments to $10 from $5 in certain
cases. The CalPERS board will vote on the plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If co-payments are left unchanged, premiums would have to
increase 9.2 percent to offset rising health care costs, said
CalPERS spokeswoman Pat Macht.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS is the nation's largest public pension fund and
represents current and retired state and local government
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unions representing state workers want the state to absorb the
looming increases, using the current budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's plan modified another co-payment increase
recommended by the health benefits committee staff in April.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, co-payments made for doctor's office visits
would remain $5. Increases will be used to encourage members to buy
generic drugs and to order drugs through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   A $10 co-payment would be charged when brand-name drugs are used
to treat short-term illnesses in cases where cheaper generics are
available.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 rate would also be charged for refills of
``maintenance'' drugs for long-term conditions when the drugs are
bought at a pharmacy. Pharmacies typically fill a maximum of 30
days' worth of medicine. When ordering prescriptions through the
mail, CalPERS members would be assessed a $10 co-pay for a 90-day
supply.

 STOCKS CLIMB DESPITE ATTEMPT TO COOL ECONOMY  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trying yet again to pour cold water on the
red-hot U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve raised short-term
interest rates to a nine-year high Tuesday and signaled loud and
clear that further increases may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wall Street shrugged off the widely expected Fed
action as investors unleashed money they had kept aside while
waiting for the central bank's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 126.79 points to close
at 10,934.57, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose
109.92 points to 3,717.57. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index
gained 13.68 points to 1,466.04.
</P>
<P>
   The market's resilience reflects the persistent ``irrational
exuberance'' that Fed chief Alan Greenspan has been trying to curb
for years as well as attempts by Fed officials in recent weeks to
soften the blow of an aggressive rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's target for the influential federal funds rate
_ the level that it expects banks to charge one another for
overnight loans _ was lifted half a point to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also raised the discount rate for its direct loans to
financial institutions to 6 percent. These are the highest such
levels since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Steepest Increase in 5 Years
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increases were the first time in five years that the
Fed boosted its benchmark rates by more than a quarter of a point
and the sixth time in 11 months that Greenspan and company have
moved to reduce inflation risk by trying to put the brakes on
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has expanded by more than 5 percent in each of the
last three quarters _ the first time this has happened in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, a half-percentage-point increase would have
caused the market to plunge,'' said Allan Roness, research director
at JW Genesis Securities in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people saw this coming,'' he said. ``And where else are
you going to put your money _ in your shoe?''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Not Intimidated
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New
York, said Wall Street's ho-hum response to the rate increase
suggests that investors are growing bolder in the face of continued
monetary tightening from the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is more afraid of the market than the market is of the
Fed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Meehan said investors' take-it-on-the-chin
attitude now may serve to embolden the Fed to raise rates even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action indicates that the Fed can be much more aggressive
without panicking the market,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed clearly suggested that more interest rate increases are
on the horizon. It said in a statement that economic risks ``remain
weighted toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also noted it is concerned that the ``disparity in the
growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   A June Raise Possible
</P>
<P>
   The next meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee is set for
June 28. Analysts say a quarter-point increase is possible then or
shortly thereafter if the economy keeps blazing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   While rate increases are generally bad for the stock market
because they raise the cost of corporate borrowing and cut into
profits, traders received Tuesday's action more with relief than as
a sign of impending catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been waiting for this since the first quarter,''
said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in
Boston. ``There's been a whole lot of cash waiting to get back in
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors may be unfazed by higher rates, but the impact of the
Fed's move certainly will be felt by consumers forced to pay more
for car loans, mortgages and home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and other lenders
immediately responded to the Fed's action by raising their prime
lending rates half a point to 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Card Peril
</P>
<P>
   Cantor Fitzgerald's Meehan said the ones who really will feel
the pinch will be consumers who have run up enormous piles of debt
on their credit cards. ``These people will get hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, this is precisely the effect intended by
the Fed. By slowing consumer spending, or even making it downright
painful, the central bank intends to drive a stake through the
heart of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday that the April
consumer price index was unchanged from a month before, but rose
0.2 percent when food and energy were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   While this is less than the 0.4 percent increase posted in
March, the overall consumer price index is expected to increase by
4.3 percent for the entire year _ the largest gain in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, predicted that ``there are still several more
tightenings in the pipeline'' and that the Fed could act again as
early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed Impact
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferies' Hogan said Greenspan may sit back and watch
awhile before making another move. He pointed out that it can take
weeks or months before the full economic impact of a rate increase
becomes visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving forward, we're going to have a nice summer rally in the
stock market,'' Hogan said. ``Earnings have been good and inflation
remains low.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering this view is the fact that retail sales fell last
month for the first time in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that
construction starts on new houses and apartments jumped 2.8 percent
last month _ even though the average interest rate for a 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage has topped 8 percent, compared with about 7
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unemployment hit a three-decade low of 3.9 percent
last month, raising the possibility that increased labor costs for
employers will be passed along to consumers in the form of higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility Predicted
</P>
<P>
   With further interest rate increases looming, JW Genesis' Roness
said investors can expect share prices to become even more
volatile. ``You're going to have to pick stocks more carefully,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts noted that Wall Street has lost ground since
the beginning of the year. They believe this could help deter the
Fed from pushing rates much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1, the Dow has dropped about 5 percent and the
Nasdaq nearly 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the platform that we start trading higher from,''
Jefferies' Hogan said.

 NOT MUCH HERE STAYS UNDER WRAPS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oops, that Egyptian priestess mummy at the de
Young Museum wasn't a priestess after all, but a young man.
</P>
<P>
   That mummy ain't no mommy, but what's the surprise? As Japantown
Gerry points out, ``This  &UR; is  &LR; San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Home of the cross-dressing mummy.
</P>
<P>
   World's first case of a person being outed by a CAT-scan.
</P>
<P>
   The mummy is so well-preserved that scientists suspect he may be
a patient of Dr. Seth Matarasso, San Francisco high-society's
plastic surgeon. Seth's motto (or it should be): ``Where the elite
meet to discreetly delete their crow's-feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The CAT-scan of the mummy also showed that the man's skull and
other bones had been fractured. Which leads scientists to theorize
that the mummy may have been an ancient San Francisco pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that he was trampled by a ferocious Munisaur.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE MOVIE ``The Mummy,'' scientists burn tania leaves to
bring the Egyptian mummy back to life. Alvin Guthertz wonders if
the de Young Museum folks gave that a try. Why rely on CAT-scan
clues when you can get the story from the mummy's mouth?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, by law, tania smoke can be inhaled only for
medicinal purposes, and the mummy has no prescription.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S HEAR IT for Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the guy was starting to look like a bulldog whose only
mission in life was to take a bite out of Willie's trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mayor was for, citizen Clint was against _ the
49ers' stadium-mall, Willie for re-election, the sale of The
Chronicle to the Hearsts and the Examiner to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   But as someone close to Reilly recently told me, ``Some people
only see Clint's anger. They don't realize that this guy is angry
for the right reasons. He doesn't like what he sees happening
behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Reilly, as his foes contended at the trial, is
miffed at being shut out of a sweet real-estate deal when his bid
for the Examiner was nixed.
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly's lawsuit and trial have given us an eye-opening
education into newspapers and politics and business in this cozy
little city.
</P>
<P>
   A LEAN NEWSPAPER, that's what would-be publisher Ted Fang
promises if he is allowed to ``buy'' the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't a lean newspaper be a violation of the city's new
anti-fat-discrimination law? Would it deprive the portly &AMP; stout of
a voice?
</P>

   Incidentally, there is an angle Reilly and his attorney, Joseph
Alioto, missed. If the Fangs are saying to the Hearsts, ``Give us
$66 million and we'll take that newspaper off your hands,'' isn't
that a violation of the city's ban on aggressive panhandling?

<P>
   MAYOR BROWN, according to court testimony, called the Examiner
``a civic treasure.'' He has also said that the Ex isn't fit to be
used as toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments seem somewhat conflicting. But the
contradiction helps explain how the same newspaper that doggedly
uncovers startling corruption in a mayor's administration can also
glowingly and unequivocally endorse that mayor for re-election.

   FRIENDLY SKIES, with an edge: United Airlines briefed travel
agents with the following memo (boldface mine):
</P>
<P>
   ``United is currently experiencing some flight cancellations due
to weather conditions and crew shortages. United and its pilots are
not in a labor dispute and pilots continue to fly their assigned
flights  &UR; (thank God!)  &LR; in a professional way  &UR; (whew, &LR; 
 &UR; no silly pranks!).  &LR; To manage the situation, United is fine-tuning
its schedule of 2,400 flights and canceling a small number of
flights up to a week in advance, then notifying customers so they
can make alternate plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Says travel agent Janice Hough: ``So all those cancellations are
not labor-related, they are simply `fine-tuning.' And by the way,
`up to a week in advance' includes less than an hour in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY KNIGHT, say what you will about the guy, it was darn
decent of him to give Indiana University another chance.

   THE MAYOR'S quickness saved him a spill Tuesday.

   Bicycling to work with a group of folks, Willie sailed through

Hearing Dogs for Hearing People, a British charity of
which &UR; Princess Anne &LR;  is patron, has mated a Chihuahua and a
Labrador retriever in an effort to create ``small, good-natured
dogs for deaf people,'' the group's  &UR; Lisa Wigmore &LR;  told the Times
of London. It is not known how the group hoped to avoid creating a
large nervous dog instead.
</P>
<P>
   The union of the two breeds was accomplished by boosting the
male Chihuahua on top of two large bags of dog biscuits. The six
puppies that resulted are 5 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Some human animal lovers are not pleased at this love story.
``It's just unnatural,'' said  &UR; Diana Fitt-Savage &LR;  of the British
Chihuahua Club. ``One vet who heard about it told me: `It's a
wonder they didn't lose the Chihuahua''' (presumably from taking a
fall).
</P>
<P>

Labrador and an ``oversized'' Chihuahua, belonged to staff members
of the charity, says a story forwarded to Personals by

takes to task ``dog fascists'' who believe that all mongrels are
bad. ``The very existence of a mongrel means that someone got to
choose her own mate,'' says free-love proponent Marshall. ``The
notion of racial purity is not of course confined to dogs. Yet it
is destructive wherever one finds it.'' Marshall will be at Book

   PARIS -- This month's ``love bug'' and last year's ``Melissa''
computer virus were child's play compared with the damage that
could be done with existing technologies, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A rogue state, terrorist or other malefactor could wreak havoc,
not with a nuclear or biological weapon but with a computer virus
that could cause massive disruptions or worse throughout the world,
these experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maliciousness of a virus is not limited by technical
obstructions but by the inventiveness of the perpetrator,'' said
Leonard Adleman, Henry Salvatori professor of computer science at
the University of Southern California, who has been studying
computer viruses for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would predict that we haven't seen the worst possible of
them,'' Adleman said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``I don't see
any obstructions to a really bad virus coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, ``The Internet has no perfect defense, and
it can never have a perfect defense.'' In other words, anti-virus
programs can only protect against known viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world should be very frightened,'' said Adleman, who in
the 1970s was one of the inventors of RSA cryptography, which has
become the world's leading computer encryption system.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, at least, it appears that the world's most
critical computers _ those that run electricity generators and the
banking system, for example _ are immune to e-mail-borne viruses
such as Melissa and the love bug, which was sent as an attachment
to an electronic-mail message with the subject line ``ILOVEYOU.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers that perform such key functions are almost all
based on the Unix operating system rather than on Windows, and they
have a much higher degree of security protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people being affected are the users of the systems rather
than the basic infrastructure,'' said Chris Goggans, director of
operations at Security Design International in Annandale, Va., and
London. As a result, he said, the computer virus attacks so far
have been ``annoying but not catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed, however, that they could have been a lot worse. If
the person who had released the ``love'' virus had been ``more
malicious,'' he said, ``It could have caused real problems. There
are certainly ways to cause real nastiness to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While all of the attacks to date have been ``perpetrated by
amateurs,'' Goggans said, the speed and scope of the love virus
were eye-opening. ``I don't know of a single place that that virus
didn't arrive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can write 50 lines of Visual Basic code and make
that happen _ someone with a dedicated target and lots of resources
_ what can they accomplish?'' he asked. ``Given the fact that the
vandals can do so much, it stands to reason that if you have high
motivation and a powerful tool, you can do much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Goggans said it would difficult to imagine a successful virus
attack against a basic-infrastructure computer. But in the ongoing
cat-and-mouse game between computer systems on the one hand and
hackers and vandals on the other, he said, the attackers have
consistently done things that had been considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Goggans added that, in testing the computer security of its
clients, Security Design International had broken into supposedly
secure computers of banking systems, power plants, hospitals and
major car companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the successful viruses so far have been delivered by
e-mail and required the recipient to open an attachment. The
``ILOVEYOU'' virus exploited a feature of the widely used Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program that is not available in other e-mail
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to send viruses over the Internet besides
e-mail, Goggans said. For example, it might be possible to hide a
malicious program in a Web-site link so that when someone clicked
on the link, a virus would infect the person's computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not that hard to do,'' he said. ``It would be very
conceivable to hide something in there. In terms of what's going to
happen next, that might be the next delivery mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, it had been thought that for an e-mail
virus to infect a computer, the user had to open an attachment. But
then a virus called ``Bubbleboy'' spread, and all that it required
was that the user highlight the e-mail on the computer screen. No
attachment was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of damage that viruses can inflict was demonstrated in
April 1999, when the ``Chernobyl'' virus destroyed the contents of
an infected computer's hard drive. By comparison, the love virus
only tampered with picture and music files.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the genie is out of the bottle. The world knows how
vulnerable computers are, and some people are talking about it,
even if they are not actually doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can bring the entire West to its knees,'' Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist, said recently, according
to the newspaper Kommersant. ``Let us put viruses into their secret
programs like we did recently, and they will not be able to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A global assault of this kind would not require a sophisticated
and expensive delivery system. It could take just one computer
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Given the periodic and increasingly destructive computer viruses
that the world has seen in the past decade, the question now
appears to be not whether but when this kind of attack will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reasonable terrorist organization worth its salt should be
able to do this,'' said a leading computer security expert who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the only foolproof way to protect a computer from
new viruses on the Internet was to disconnect it completely from
networks. &QL;

and expensive delivery system. It could take just one computer
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Given the periodic and increasingly destructive computer viruses
that the world has seen in the past decade, the question now
appears to be not whether but when this kind of attack will occur.

   ``Any reasonable terrorist organization worth its salt should be
able to do this,'' said a leading computer security expert who
asked not to be identified.

   He said that the only foolproof way to protect a computer from
new viruses on the Internet was to disconnect it completely from
networks. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Politicians of both main parties were confronting
the possibility of a signal change in the American political
landscape Monday, after the massive turnout at Sunday's ``Million
Mom March'' in favor of tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fiercest opponents of the gun control cause conceded
that the predominantly suburban crowd on Washington's National Mall
probably exceeded half a million, while the amazed and delighted
organizers claimed a crowd approaching 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel demonstrations by gun advocates, not just in
Washington, but across the United States attracted far fewer
people.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the success of Sunday's march, Wayne LaPierre of
the hugely influential National Rifle Association (NRA) came out
with a fighting call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   Gun registration and licensing, he said _ referring to the
measures demanded by the marchers _ would be tantamount to ``a
controlled burn of the Second Amendment... and setting fire to
freedom should never be the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, which has 3.5 million members across the U.S., and
which makes large contributions to the campaign funds of many
Republican congressmen, is expected to make a fuller response
during its national convention which opens in North Carolina on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases, the public relations executive turned
housewife behind the Million Mom March brainchild, urged the
marchers to continue their involvement with the gun control
movement by supporting existing lobby groups and forming, or
joining, new Million Mom March action committees to lobby
state-level and national legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Morella, a Maryland Republican congresswoman sympathetic
to gun control, reiterated the importance of political follow-up if
the movement was to become a political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot rely on yesterday's (Sunday's) event alone to make
their point,'' he said. They will need to lobby in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather more pithily, the New York Times said in an editorial:
``The hands that rock the nation's cradles have the potential to
rock its political institutions _ but only if they keep rocking
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A point repeatedly emphasized by speakers at Sunday's rally was
the potential voting power of the suburban women who felt strongly
enough about gun violence to travel many hundreds of miles to make
their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
   This overwhelmingly white, middle-class constituency includes
many of the ``soccer moms'' who were seen by analysts as key to the
election of Bill Clinton. With their votes again in contention in
the coming presidential election, no presidential candidate can
afford to take their loyalty for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The voting strength of the ``moms'' goes some way towards
explaining why the Republican Governor of Texas, George W. Bush,
announced on the eve of the march that the state would offer free
child-proofing trigger locks to anyone who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is no friend of the gun control movement, said that he
would also subsidize a similar measure nationwide, should he become
president.
</P>
<P>
   The voting capacity of suburban women was also a point heavily
stressed by the well-briefed speakers on Sunday, who called on
mothers to cast or withhold their vote on the single issue of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   This opened the prospect of gun control being used by the
political left and center much as the conservative right has used
abortion as the single issue determining which candidate they will
support.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the public support for gun control as shown in
Sunday's march, President Clinton Monday renewed his call for
Congress to pass the gun control legislation that has been stalled
since its defeat in the House last year.
</P>
<P>
   One notable absentee, both Monday and from the march itself,
however, was Vice President Al Gore, whose much-publicized casting
vote had ensured passage of the legislation through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for his low profile on the issue could be a poll
last week that suggested he was unexpectedly losing support among
male voters, who by and large support gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   By a coincidence of timing, Monday also saw the release of the
official police report on one of the major catalysts for the
weekend march _ the April 1999 shootings at Columbine High School
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   While adding little new to what has already been leaked into the
public domain, the report confirms that police failed to act on
information that the two teenage gunmen planned some violent act at
the school, and criticizes the delay in ordering the emergency SWAT
team _ the elite rapid-reaction police unit _ into the school. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ To all intents and purposes, Brigadier David
Richards is now the military overlord of Sierra Leone, albeit
possibly a reluctant one.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sierra Leone Army in a state of disarray, forces loyal
to the government an exotic circus, and the United Nations
peacekeepers ill-equipped and demoralized, the Brigadier with his
British task force is the man who matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, has sought a
daily meeting with Brigadier Richards and British officers are said
to be directing operations against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force, the Indian General
Vijay Jetley, desperately needs the logistical help Richards can
provide. Also invaluable has been the intelligence provided by SAS
units operating away from Freetown, behind rebel lines.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier Richards has been a soldier for 29 years, and has
served in Northern Ireland, the Far East and the Rhine Army. He
came to the attention of the senior hierarchy in East Timor where
his diplomatic as well as military skills were noted.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues describe Richards, married with two daughters aged 14
and 16, as affable but also someone who does not suffer fools
gladly.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to have a talent for improvisation but also has a
streak of independence which could put him ``off message'' to the
line back at headquarters. This was when ministers were lining up
in London to say the role of the force was purely to extricate
civilians. Brigadier Richards in Freetown said the mandate of the
British forces could be liberally interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, say colleagues, particularly phased by the fuss. A
colleague said : ``He is a keen student of military history and has
a broad vision. He has already shown he is in top of the situation
out there.'' &QL;

<P>
   According to the most comprehensive research ever done on
tobacco on screen, leading characters are lighting up in more than
nine out of 10 films, while a fifth of movies aimed at children
feature smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the result of work by a team of American
researchers at Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at the 250 highest-grossing U.S. films over 10 years
and discovered that in 95 percent of them the characters are
continuing to smoke. In the worst cases, the stars are seen puffing
away for a third of the films' duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``JFK,'' Oliver Stone's Oscar-winner starring Kevin Costner,
came out as the worst offender of the 1990s and was branded the
smokiest film. It was closely followed by ``Dick Tracy'' and
``Bugsy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocktail'' and ``Pulp Fiction'' featured smoking on screen for
almost a third of their entire length, while ``Schindler's List,''
``Forrest Gump,'' ``Titanic,'' and ``Get Shorty'' also featured
tobacco prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers analyzed the top 25 box-office hits from each
year from 1988 to 1997. They counted the number of times a major or
minor character smoked a cigarette or cigar and recorded how long
smoking was shown on screen.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 3,346 occurrences of tobacco use or imagery were
identified in the 250 films. One-fifth of these involved use by
ancillary characters, and almost a third involved background
tobacco imagery. In more than half of the movies analyzed, the
major character smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hollywood has now formally renounced fees for placing
tobacco brands prominently in view, it still uses cigarettes as a
cinematic shorthand denoting ruggedness in men, or vampishness in
female characters.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco use by major characters was also associated with other
high-risk behavior and was portrayed differently for men and women.
Among female characters who smoked on screen, smoking was
associated with sexual affairs, illegal activities and reckless
driving.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, smoking was used by male characters to show violent
behavior and dangerous acts.
</P>
<P>
   The interaction between tobacco use, gender and the portrayal of
specific behavior suggests that tobacco may be used to characterize
``tough'' men and ``bad'' women, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   James Sargent, professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical
School, said: ``Adolescents respond to role models and persons of
star status by emulating them. By allowing stars to depict smoking
behavior on screen, the movie industry may be contributing to the
current epidemic of adolescent tobacco use.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and anti-smoking campaigners have jumped on the
findings, condemning the widespread smoking as irresponsible. The
high level of smoking on screen runs counter to the realities of
smoking in western society, where adult smoking is generally in
decline, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the number of smokers has fallen to 27 percent of
the adult population, although the latest figures show that smoking
among teenage girls is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent, who presented the research Sunday at the annual meeting
of the Pediatric Academic Societies in Boston, said that although
the film industry had said in 1990 it would not to take money from
tobacco companies to show their products on screen, the prevalence
of smoking in movies was still very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children viewing movies will frequently be exposed to tobacco
use as normative and even glamorized behaviors. Parents cannot rely
on movie ratings to screen movies for tobacco use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author Dr. Madeline Dalton said: ``We are especially
concerned about tobacco use by popular stars because we believe
this is likely to have the greatest impact on adolescent
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Sandford of Ash, the anti-smoking group, said: ``Smoking
tends to be portrayed in a glamorous way which makes it more
attractive to people. If films portrayed the reality of smoking
they would have people choking, wheezing and dying of lung
cancer.'' &QL;

<P>
   Until now, electronic books were an idea whose time might have
never come. But thanks to Stephen King, publishing houses and
electronics manufacturers are taking a second look at a market they
have long been content to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Prompting the reassessment is the March publication of King's
66-page novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' which was initially
available only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Offered for free by both Amazon.com and, briefly,
barnesandnoble.com, and for a mere $2.50 on other sites, King's
story flew off servers as fast as Web surfers could log on to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two days the book was available, more than a
half-million copies were downloaded. (In the print world, King's
books typically sell about 75,000 hardcover copies on the first day
of sale, which is a huge amount.)
</P>
<P>
   The online furor proved that ``content is what people want and
will read,'' says Tom Morrow, a spokesman for SoftBook Press, a
unit of Gemstar International, which owns the technology behind the
SoftBook electronic books. ``The medium isn't that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. It's important that the medium be affordable
and easy to use. Today's electronic book-reader technology isn't.
But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gemstar has a virtual monopoly on E-readers. The
SoftBank costs $600 by itself, or one can purchase it for $299,
plus a commitment to buy $20 worth of E-books a month for 24
months. The lower-end Rocket eBook retails for $199.
</P>
<P>
   An E-reader isn't needed to download ``Riding the Bullet'' _
it's readable on an ordinary personal computer _ but SoftBook sales
did increase around the time of the novella's release.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar is convinced that there's a viable market for a
popularly priced electronic reader. To bring down costs, the
company has allied itself with Thomson Multimedia, the French
electronics manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Thomson will license Gemstar's
technology and produce an electronic reader under the RCA brand.
Thomson declines to give a price range, but it plans to have an
``affordable'' product on the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Price alone won't persuade consumers to buy an E-reader. A good
selection of choices is also important, and tradition-bound book
publishers have been slow to digitize their wares, says John
Corcoran, an analyst with CIBC Worldmarkets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But by 2004, International Data Corp. predicts there will be 4
million users of electronic books. That's incentive enough for
publishers to start digitizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most major publishers realize that electronic publishing is an
important market,'' says SoftBook's Morrow, ``and they're making
more content available.'' Much of the first wave will be
educational and business titles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the economics of E-books may be irresistible. ``If
the Web is about nothing else,'' says Corcoran, ``it's about
reducing the cost of distributing content to something close to
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Since distribution, not paper or printing, is a publisher's
biggest cost, Stephen King may soon have some company on the
electronic bookshelf. &QL;

   Until now, electronic books were an idea whose time might have
never come. But thanks to Stephen King, publishing houses and
electronics manufacturers are taking a second look at a market they
have long been content to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Prompting the reassessment is the March publication of King's
66-page novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' which was initially
available only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Offered for free by both Amazon.com and, briefly,
barnesandnoble.com, and for a mere $2.50 on other sites, King's
story flew off servers as fast as Web surfers could log on to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two days the book was available, more than a
half-million copies were downloaded. (In the print world, King's
books typically sell about 75,000 hardcover copies on the first day
of sale, which is a huge amount.)

<P>
   Sweden is beautiful. The land is beautiful. The people are
beautiful. The economy is beautiful. And yes, the stock market is
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Sweden is winning the race among major
countries for the strongest stock market. Its Stockholm (``OMX'')
index was up some 20 percent, as of mid-March, and has soared 74
percent since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kind of outsized gains investors have come to
expect from blazing tech stocks. It's no wonder: Sweden is among
the most tech-savvy countries in the world. If you visit Stockholm,
you'll hear more cell phones beeping on a street corner than most
any other place in the world. And fully one-third of Swedes are
plugged into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Sweden's infamous welfare state still stands, its
government was forced to cut spending in the mid-1990s to combat a
12 percent budget deficit and is actually now running a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's 28 percent corporate tax rate is far below the European
Union average of 40 percent. Even labor policies are less rigid
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's difficult for firms to fire full-time workers, the
market for temporary workers is fairly fluid. No surprise, then,
that a company like Poolia, which provides temporary help, is
thriving. Its stock price has climbed 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when many high-tech stocks around the world
experienced a major fall as investors shifted assets back into
old-economy industries, Swedish tech companies escaped with less
damage than most.
</P>
<P>
   ProAct IT, which provides data storage, is up 123 percent this
year, and Digital Vision, which specializes in digital processing
for movies and television, has jumped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ericsson, locked in a tough battle with telecom giants
Nokia and Motorola, has climbed 50 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish economy is galloping along at a healthy 3.5 to 4
percent clip, much like it did in 1999. Most impressive is that
economic growth hasn't kicked up inflation, which remains below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the central bank, led by trusted bureaucrat Urban
Baeckstroem, has been slowly raising interest rates, following the
successful example of U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, just to make sure that inflation doesn't re-ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The market's faith in Baeckstroem shows up in the solid trading
of the Swedish krona, which has gained over 6 percent in the past
year against the flabby Euro currency. And Swedish ten-year-bond
rates, at 5.38 percent, were nearly a full percentage point below
U.S. rates in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   For a country of only 8.5 million people, Sweden is also an
export powerhouse, racking up a current-account surplus of $4.5
billion in 1999. By selling so much to the rest of the world,
Sweden helps keep the krona strong.
</P>
<P>
   Any worries? The government looks a little shaky. The ruling
Social Democrat Party (SDP) holds only a minority of the seats in
the Riksdag, Sweden's parliament, and it depends on the leftist
Green Party and Left Party to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance could crumble before the next election, which
isn't scheduled until September 2002. Prime Minister Goran Persson
would like Sweden to join the European Monetary Union, but that
would have to be approved in a general referendum, which would
likely be held in 2000 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses would welcome the currency stability and reduced
transaction costs that come with EMU membership. Labor unions,
however, would like to see unemployment, currently at 5 percent,
drop a percentage point beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   As for the voters, many are undecided, but a plurality feel
that, for now, Sweden's currency and economy are doing fine without
Europe. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bill Clinton campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 1992, he
applauded the ``German model,'' highlighting the intimate links
between banks, unions, corporations, and government.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Clinton moved into the White House, he soon learned
that the German economic model was falling apart, and that the U.S.
economy was in fact far healthier and sturdier than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, America's robust economy has created millions of new
jobs, while Germans have sat around in their lederhosen waiting for
their own economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton travels the globe bragging about the ``American
model'' of open markets, aggressive competition, and tight fiscal
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany may be getting its economic house in order. After
years of painfully high unemployment, the country is creating jobs.
The jobless rate has been falling the past two years, down to 10.1
percent recently from a peak of 11.8 percent in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is still ridiculously high when compared with the
4 percent jobless rate in the U.S. and U.K., it's still progress.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the German stock market has caught more than a
whiff of optimism. Its benchmark DAX index leaped 39 percent in
1999 and was up 10.1 percent during the first seven weeks of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will point out that the euro has skidded during the
past year, losing some 16 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar. Clearly, European leaders and central bankers haven't quite
earned the respect of world financial markets, but a cheaper euro
has been great for German exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The big electronics firm Siemens can compete much better against
Motorola and IBM if it is charging lower prices. And those swank
new Mercedes-Benz cars look less expensive to Americans when
they're being built by German workers paid in euros.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the German rebound than its cheap currency.
Ironically, what's driving the recovery is the breakdown of the
German model of cozy relations among the country's industrial
giants, banks, and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, every major company seemed to own a piece of each
other, in a ``you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'' system,
with the same 60-year-old men sitting on every important board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   While this world of complex cross-holdings kept matters
peaceful, it hindered the intense competition that drives
innovation. Mergers, takeovers, and shareholder rebellions were far
too rare.
</P>
<P>
   If a company needed money to build a new factory, it would just
go to its affiliate bank for a loan. No need to borrow from the
bond market or issue public stock; heaven forbid _ that would
require justifying its finances to the public. And shareholders
came last. More important were executive perks and union support.
</P>
<P>
   In a millennial twist, it is the left-wing government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder that is now dragging German businesses
into the Western world of heated competition.
</P>
<P>
   His Social Democrat Party, in a coalition with the
pro-environment Green Party, is slashing corporate capital-gains
taxes to encourage firms to spin off their cross-holdings without
having to pay punitive taxes. In addition, Schroder's government
proposes to slash individual income taxes, even for the wealthiest
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   With a cheap currency and a bonanza of tax cuts, the German
economy should grow at least 3 percent in 2000. This is
Reaganomics, twenty years after Reagan, albeit with a leftist tilt.
</P>
<P>
   For Germans, the 21st century is getting off to a strange but
promising start. &QL;

<P>
   When Bill Clinton campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 1992, he
applauded the ``German model,'' highlighting the intimate links
between banks, unions, corporations, and government.
</P>
<P>
   But, after Clinton moved into the White House, he soon learned
that the German economic model was falling apart, and that the U.S.
economy was in fact far healthier and sturdier than Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, America's robust economy has created millions of new
jobs, while Germans have sat around in their lederhosen waiting for
their own economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton travels the globe bragging about the ``American
model'' of open markets, aggressive competition, and tight fiscal
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany may be getting its economic house in order. After
years of painfully high unemployment, the country is creating jobs.
The jobless rate has been falling the past two years, down to 10.1
percent recently from a peak of 11.8 percent in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is still ridiculously high when compared with the
4 percent jobless rate in the U.S. and U.K., it's still progress.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the German stock market has caught more than a
whiff of optimism. Its benchmark DAX index leaped 39 percent in
1999 and was up 10.1 percent during the first seven weeks of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will point out that the euro has skidded during the
past year, losing some 16 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar. Clearly, European leaders and central bankers haven't quite
earned the respect of world financial markets, but a cheaper euro
has been great for German exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The big electronics firm Siemens can compete much better against
Motorola and IBM if it is charging lower prices. And those swank
new Mercedes-Benz cars look less expensive to Americans when
they're being built by German workers paid in euros.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the German rebound than its cheap currency.
Ironically, what's driving the recovery is the breakdown of the
German model of cozy relations among the country's industrial
giants, banks, and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, every major company seemed to own a piece of each
other, in a ``you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'' system,
with the same 60-year-old men sitting on every important board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   While this world of complex cross-holdings kept matters
peaceful, it hindered the intense competition that drives
innovation. Mergers, takeovers, and shareholder rebellions were far
too rare.
</P>
<P>
   If a company needed money to build a new factory, it would just
go to its affiliate bank for a loan. No need to borrow from the
bond market or issue public stock; heaven forbid _ that would
require justifying its finances to the public. And shareholders
came last. More important were executive perks and union support.
</P>
<P>
   In a millennial twist, it is the left-wing government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder that is now dragging German businesses
into the Western world of heated competition.
</P>
<P>
   His Social Democrat Party, in a coalition with the
pro-environment Green Party, is slashing corporate capital-gains
taxes to encourage firms to spin off their cross-holdings without
having to pay punitive taxes. In addition, Schroder's government
proposes to slash individual income taxes, even for the wealthiest
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   With a cheap currency and a bonanza of tax cuts, the German
economy should grow at least 3 percent in 2000. This is
Reaganomics, twenty years after Reagan, albeit with a leftist tilt.
</P>
<P>
   For Germans, the 21st century is getting off to a strange but
promising start. &QL;

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ Win or lose, nothing seems to come easy for the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What began Tuesday night finally concluded in the wee hours this
morning as the Brewers ended a 16-inning tug of war with a 6-5
victory at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A sparse crowd of 9,239 was on hand when the game began, and
only a handful of fans remained as the Astros and Brewers completed
the 5-hour, 39-minute game. Astros manager Larry Dierker was
ejected in the 13th inning for arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 1-3 in extra-inning games this season. They have
lost seven of their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Grissom led off the Milwaukee 16th with an infield
single off Chris Holt (1-6) and advanced to third on a single to
right field by Lyle Mouton. With one out, Henry Blanco drove in the
winning run with a fly ball to right field that was dropped by
Roger Cedeno. Blanco was credited with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Horacio Estrada (2-0) earned the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti accounted for a career-high five hits for the
Astros. Moises Alou drove in three runs, which included his fifth
homer of the season in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a three-run lead only to blow it, the Astros
rallied to tie the game at 5 in the eighth inning. Jeff Bagwell and
Caminiti hit consecutive singles to lead off the inning, and Alou
followed with an RBI single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   From there, both teams engaged in an inning-by-inning exercise
in frustration. The Astros used every position player on the roster
and every member of the bullpen, although Jay Powell did not pitch
but was used only as a pinch hitter for fellow reliever Jose
Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers stranded 19 runners in the game; the Astros left 11
on base.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had a chance to push across the potential winning
run in the eighth inning off Mike Maddux, loading the bases on a
pair of singles and a walk. Doug Henry retired Mark Loretta on a
weak pop-up to second base to leave the bases full.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee threatened in the 12th inning only to be denied again.
This time Billy Wagner worked out of a jam with runners at second
and third base by coaxing Grissom into an inning-ending pop-up to
first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had a runner at third base in the top of the 13th but
came away empty-handed when Juan Acevedo struck out the side.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the 13th, catcher Tony Eusebio made a
game-extending catch when he took a throw from second baseman Craig
Biggio and held on to the ball in a collision at home plate with
Ron Belliard.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez led off the Brewers' 14th inning with a single to
right field off Cabrera, who then hit Mouton with a pitch. But
Cabrera struck out Blanco, Luis Lopez grounded into a fielder's
choice, and Belliard flied out to center field to strand two
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Shane Reynolds allowed five runs and five
hits in six innings. He had five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros jumped on Brewers righthander Jason Bere for three
runs in the second inning, all courtesy of home runs. After a
leadoff double by Caminiti, Alou hit his fifth homer of the season,
a two-run shot to left-center field. Later in the inning, Tim
Bogar, making only his second start in the past eight games, hit a
solo shot to left to give the Astros a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead didn't last long. Mouton hit a solo homer off Reynolds
in the bottom of the second. The Brewers added two more runs in the
third as Reynolds walked two batters in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard walked with one out and scored from first after Cedeno
slipped along the grass in front of the warning track on a double
by Mark Loretta. After a walk to Jeromy Burnitz and a flyout by
Kevin Barker, Grissom hit a two-out RBI single to right field to
tie the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros regained the lead in the fourth with a walk to
Richard Hidalgo and an RBI double by Mitch Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, which dropped three of four games to the Astros at
County Stadium in late April, regained the lead in the fourth
inning. Mouton singled to center field to lead off the inning, and
Blanco sent a 2-2 pitch from Reynolds into the half-empty bleachers
in left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stranded a pair of runners in the third and fifth
innings. With runners at first and second in the fifth, Alou
drilled a deep drive off Bere that was caught by Grissom against
the center-field wall. And in the seventh, representing the
potential tying run, Cedeno was thrown out attempting to steal
second base.

PHOENIX HAS FIRST-HALF PHIASCO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On what turned out to be their final night of the
1999-2000 season, Phoenix wondered what if.
</P>
<P>
   What if Tom Gugliotta had been healthy for the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   That was a valid question before Tuesday's Game 5. Afterward,
there were more what ifs.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Suns had decided to show up? What if they had
responded to Ron Harper's winning prediction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it was one of those nights,'' Luc Longley said,
``but when you try to explain it, we can't think of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some low moments are best left unexplained, except to
say the Suns couldn't shoot in the one game they needed to most.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix scored an NBA record-low nine points in the second
period and a franchise-low 23 points in the first half. That's a
far cry from 71 in Game 4 Sunday. The 65 total points also is a
franchise low.
</P>
<P>
   No Phoenix starter scored in double figures. Only Todd Day (10)
did.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns shot 11.8 percent in the second period and 29 percent
(23 of 80) for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the looks,'' said Anfernee Hardaway, whose eight points
tied him for top-starter-scoring honors. ``We didn't capitalize on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd called Gugliotta, with an average of nearly eight
rebounds a game, Phoenix's best rebounder, best post player, a good
perimeter shooter and ``that's six more fouls we'd have. Gugs is
missed tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the Suns knew, they had to play with the personnel
they had (San Antonio had to make do without Tim Duncan, and the
Suns took advantage). The key was to duplicate Sunday's Game 4
success (a 117-98 victory) at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple game,'' Rodney Rogers said. ``We make it
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And to make it tough on the Lakers, the Suns had to come out and
establish a high energy level and stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come out hard, and whatever team makes their
impression felt at the end of the first quarter will be in
control,'' Kidd said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the first to get to the second,'' Rogers said, ``then
we play the second to get to the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the second half was rendered meaningless by virtue of
L.A.'s 49-23 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost confidence in the second quarter and started playing
too fast,'' Phoenix coach Scott Skiles said. ``They got a big lead
and we thought we had to get it all back at once.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all bad. Phoenix held the Lakers to 36-percent
shooting. Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were a combined 13 of
35.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me, we'd hold Shaq to 7 of 19 and Kobe to 6 of 16,
I'd have felt pretty good,'' Skiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Suns set futility records and made Harper's
prediction come true.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bright spot for Phoenix, however: Harper said his
Bulls teams would have beaten Phoenix by 200 points. The Suns lost
by only 22 and now can spend the entire summer wondering what if.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to have your worst game of the season be your last
game,''Skiles said.
</P>

DODGERS WRANGLE WITH WRIGLEY FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Mayhem and madness broke out with one out in the
bottom of the ninth inning at Wrigley Field when several fans and
members of the Los Angeles Dodgers bullpen became engaged in an
altercation that spilled into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The melee lasted nine minutes and was triggered when catcher
Chad Kreuter was allegedly punched in the head and had his hat
taken from him in a game the Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-5
Tuesday on Todd Hundley's three-run homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody hauled off and hit one of my guys in the back of the
head and went after his hat,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``When they run down and whack one of your guys on the field and
run and take off, other guys saw it and went after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was sitting in the Dodgers bullpen, situated down the
right-field line and against the stands. A fan allegedly came down
and hit Kreuter and took his hat. Kreuter went into the stands in
an attempt to retrieve it, several players said. Several more
players and bullpen coach Rick Dempsey then went into the stands to
try to help Kreuter before the rest of the Dodgers noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Once aware of the trouble, the Dodgers players on the field and
in the dugout raced to the bullpen to try to restore order to a
chaotic scene. Fans were punching and pulling at Dodgers players in
the stands while teammates were standing at the edge of the bullpen
and stands trying to pull people back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chaos down there,'' said Hundley, a Chicago native.
``It just got out of hand. There were so many fans involved, it was
out of control. Some of the guys were so deep in the stands, I was
just watching to make sure no one got hurt. Security had it calmed
down and then a fan threw another sucker punch and it got out of
hand again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter declined to talk about the situation, instead saying he
wanted to focus on Hundley's home run and Jeff Shaw's save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that when players go into the stands, you're
taking a big risk,'' Cubs manager Don Baylor said. ``The next thing
you know, you have their general manager standing next to me on the
field. He shouldn't be there, either. You can't go into the stands,
no matter what they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said when order was being restored, numerous fans
continued to throw beer and push and shove. Johnson said so much
beer was being thrown that it was burning his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, who along with Kreuter, went to identify a fan in the
Wrigley Field holding area, said he grabbed the arm of a fan who
was about to punch Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I fell back and was pinned against the seats,'' Dempsey
said. ``I couldn't get up. We were trying to get the players back
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Several fans in the area said a few of the Dodgers players were
as many as eight rows deep in the stands. Several of the Dodgers,
including left fielder Gary Sheffield, were trying to pull the
players from the stands to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around and I saw a bunch of stuff by the bullpen and
I ran over there as soon as fast as I could,'' Sheffield said. ``I
was trying to get everyone back on the field. My first instinct is
to go and pull them out of the stands. I was just trying to protect
your players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked more than anything. I've never seen it in my
12-year career. Not in highlights or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Security had numerous people in custody. A Chicago police
department spokesman said three fans were cited for disorderly
conduct and fined $100.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he didn't anticipate any action being taken against
any of the Dodgers, either by Major League Baseball or Chicago
police, but it's likely the commissioner's office will investigate
the situation. Malone said the Dodgers wouldn't take any
disciplinary action against the players. He added no players were
injured except for a few bumps and bruises were suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept going on and no security was showing up,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``They were late. It was
self-protection. It could have been worse and it was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rathje, director of stadium operations who's been with the
Cubs for 18 years, said he remembered one other incident in which
players went into the stands but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he was told by Wrigley Field personnel that more
security would be added to the bullpen area for the final two games
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in my hometown fans,,'' Hundley said.
``It's not the Chicago I know. Not at a professional baseball game.
That's disgusting.''

ONE BAD PITCH COSTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Hill is hurt. Ramon Ortiz is in the
minors. Scott Schoeneweis, Jason Dickson and Jarrod Washburn are
going through growing pains typical of young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Kent Bottenfield, Angels ace.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield pitched into the eighth inning and kept the Anaheim
Angels in the game, but it wasn't good enough as the Baltimore
Orioles ended a seven- game losing streak with a 4-3 victory
Tuesday night before 15,881 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Angels into last place in the AL West, even
though they are only two games under .500 (19-21) and 2 games
behind first-place Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Conine's sacrifice fly in the eighth inning off Angels
reliever Mark Petkovsek scored Delino DeShields to snap a 3-3 tie.
Angels left fielder Darin Erstad robbed Conine of a three-run homer
on the play, but one run was plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson (1-1) pitched seven innings to get the win, and
Mike Timlin earned the save. It didn't seem to matter to the Angels
hitters that Erickson was making only third start of the season
after having arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from his
elbow March 3, or that he was 0-1 with a 12.46 ERA going into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Erickson has pitched better against the
Angels than any other team, improving to 16-4 with Tuesday's win.
Erickson gave up three runs and nine hits in a season-high seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bottenfield has pitched into the seventh inning or
longer in five consecutive starts during which time his ERA is
2.83. In fact, the four runs Bottenfield allowed Tuesday marked
only the second time he has yielded more than three runs in a game
in his nine starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out his one bad start - nine runs in 3 innings against
Toronto on April 20 - and Bottenfield's ERA is 2.68 (16 earned runs
in 53 innings).
</P>
<P>
   The reason Bottenfield has only three wins has to do with run
support. In his nine starts, the Angels are averaging 4.3 runs per
game. With all other starters, the Angels average 5.6 runs per
game. The 1.3-run difference would have made a difference Tuesday,
but Bottenfield won't blame the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me a two-run lead, that's all I could ask for,'' he
said. ``Sure, it's frustrating, but the thing I have to do is
control the game better. I've got to make a better pitch to him,
more like I did two innings later when he grounded out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Him'' in this case is Mike Bordick, whose two-run homer in the
sixth tied the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitcher can't control when a team scores runs for you,''
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``The fact he's pitched deep
into games so often is really what it's all about. The wins will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is leading the starting staff, Bottenfield says he
is doing what he can to help the younger pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk on the bench, about what I might do in certain
situations,'' Bottenfield said. ''That's my job. I need to do a
better job of leading by example. I've got to do better out there
or they won't trust what I say sitting on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle's leadoff homer in the second inning gave the
Orioles a 1-0 lead, but it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the Angels' third with a walk, stole second and
went to third on a sacrifice bunt by Adam Kennedy, who was safe at
first on Erickson's error. Mo Vaughn followed with a sacrifice fly
to left to tie the game at 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, singles from Bengie Molina, Benji Gil,
Erstad and Vaughn resulted in two runs and a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bottenfield was cruising. He needed only four pitches
to retire the side in the fifth, but things didn't go quite so
smoothly in the sixth. Brady Anderson led off with a single and
scored on Bordick's two-run homer, tying the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield left with two on and one out in the eighth and the
game tied at 3, but Conine hit the first pitch thrown by Petkovsek
to left-center, where Erstad made a leaping catch at the fence.
DeShields tagged from third to score the game-winner.

NEXT UP: BEST-IN-WEST CONTEST
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here it comes, just as advertised. Just as
predicted since before the season started. The Big Showdown is now
at hand, high noon in the NBA West.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers and Trail Blazers, deemed the league's
best since Phil Jackson showed up in L.A. and Scottie Pippen in
Portland, now officially get to determine who's best in the West,
if not all the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams completed their Western Conference anticipated
semifinal victories Tuesday night - the Lakers with a convincing
87-65 win over the Suns - to set up their Western Conference Final.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Saturday at Staples Center, answers to seven months
worth of questions will finally arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of fitting,'' said Lakers forward Glen Rice.
``That's how it should be. We have the two best teams on the West
Coast. What better way to have the final battle?
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to come down to these two teams, and now
that it's here, it's going to be a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams split the four games played in the regular season,
each winning once on the other's court. But it was the Lakers'
90-87 victory in Portland on Feb. 29 that set the tone for the rest
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went onto finish with the best record in the NBA,
earn the homecourt advantage and became nearly everyone's popular
pick in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers were forced to a decisive fifth game by
Sacramento in the first round and embarrassed in a Game 4 loss at
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were rolling through the playoffs, until losing a
close Game 4 at Utah. Plenty started jumping off the Lakers'
bandwagon and carrying Portland's colors.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is claiming how they got here matters much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything,'' Rice said. ``What's going to mean
something is when the time comes at tipoff, to see who's playing at
their top then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget everything you've seen,'' said Lakers forward Robert
Horry. ``Just wait and see what happens the next couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are considered to have a major bench advantage.
Theirs is one of the best and deepest in the league. The Lakers'
bench is usually strong at home but inconsistent on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, of course, have a one-two of Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant that no team can match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland has big bodies to throw in there at Shaq,'' said Suns
coach Scott Skiles. ``A very deep team. You could say on paper,
Portland has more weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd never bet against Shaq and Kobe. I think the way to
build a championship team is to have two or three great players,
four or five good players, and four or five role players. And
that's how the Lakers are built.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might figure the Lakers will have to play better than they
did against Phoenix to defeat Portland in their best-of-seven
series, but not Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Jackson said. ``Did you see Portland play? They played
two games that weren't so pretty themselves. But that's what
happens when you're slugging it out in the playoffs and playing the
same team over and over again. Pretty soon it becomes a real
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series has been predicted all year long and it's here.
This is the one that everyone has been talking about almost from
day one in the Western Conference. It's fitting it should be like
this.''

LAKERS ELIMINATE SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here they come again, the stubborn survivors of
both small tremors and big-time temblors, the guys who keep
slipping and tripping, offering pratfalls at inopportune times but
always regaining balance just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Here come the Los Angeles Lakers, dancing elegantly back into
championship form, all prior bumbling nothwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after plummeting to their worst loss of the
postseason, the Lakers rose once more Tuesday night and put
everything right with an 87-65 rout of the Phoenix Suns at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Series clinched. Bid to Western Conference finals received. Date
with Portland Trail Blazers awaiting. (The series opens Saturday
afternoon at Staples Center.)
</P>
<P>
   And with it all, a message to the Lakers faithful, or anyone
else shaken by that 117-98 setback two days prior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a statement to the city of Los Angeles, just to
relax,'' Kobe Bryant said with a laugh. ``If you lose one game,
it's not Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismantling Phoenix to finish off the series, 4 to 1, the
Lakers erased every poor image cast in Game 4. They went back to
winning with defense, holding the Suns to an all-time low for a
Laker playoff opponent and to five points fewer than Phoenix scored
in the first half alone on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's !ital!that!off! for killer instinct?'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   That trait had been called into question after the Lakers failed
to complete the sweep, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   They contested every shot from the outset, challenged every
drive into the lane. Active, aggressive, intolerant of any sort of
Phoenix offensive. The Suns scored just nine points in the second
quarter, tied an NBA playoff low with 23 points at halftime and
managed just 17 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix went more than 11 minutes without a field goal from the
second to third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aggressive ... it's real defeating when you smother a
team like that,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet even he seemed a little stunned by the two-day
turnaround. The Suns' shooting plummeted to 28.8 percent after a
50-plus effort in Game 4. Only reserve Todd Day (10 points) scored
in double figures for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game's a mystery to me,'' said Jackson, `` that the Suns
can get 71 points in Sunday's ballgame in a half and can't score 70
in a game. It's just the difference in a day sometimes, the way a
team approaches a basketball game, what happens out there, the luck
of the bounce sometimes, this is one of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Steady defense allowed the Lakers to rest easy on offense.
Bryant led the way with a mere 17 points, and Shaquille O'Neal
needed just 15 points 20 below his series average
</P>
<P>
   to get the victory. Glen Rice added 14 points, and the role
players did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange way to end a series characterized by offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very ironic,'' Jackson said. ``Is it a full moon tonight?
It is, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   A sore right knee and shin, bruised from Sunday's collision with
Suns guard Penny Hardaway, limited O'Neal's offense, and he played
just 33 minutes, sitting the entire fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little off tonight,'' O'Neal said. ``However, my
teammates stepped up for me, and that's what being a good team is
all about ... I had to convert my game into the Big Token again. I
just had to rebound, block shots and do everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 21 rebounds 13 in the first half and three
blocks, plus untold numbers of misdirected shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was real dominant in the game,'' Jackson said.
``I thought he changed shots, I thought his presence down there was
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's own final shot was sent to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to do that (win). You guys probably
didn't think we were going to do that. You probably thought it was
going to be like the Sacramento series. We didn't want to have two
efforts like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than enjoy their Sunday rout, the Suns spent two days
simmering over Ron Harper's postgame comment that the Lakers would
``beat the (bleep)'' out of the Suns in Game 5. But come game time,
the Suns showed more ire than fire, falling behind 21-14 after one
quarter, then scoring nine points in the second to trail 49-23 at
halftime. The game was never close.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the Lakers found that missing mean streak Harper was
talking about. And maybe Harper, who correctly predicted a victory
just as he did before Game 5 against Sacramento
</P>
<P>
   is some kind of prophet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't a prophet, I just felt that way,'' Harper said. ``I
just felt my team is a good team. I knew we were playing at home, I
knew we were going to be good at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and I told the guys, `Let's go out and beat the
(bleep) out of them. Point blank. Lets go out and do the job we
have to do.' ''

SHAW WON FIGHT AFTER BIG BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lost in the fight between the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the fans at Wrigley Field was another homer by Todd Hundley and an
incredible escape by closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had runners on second and third and one out with the
top of their lineup coming to the plate in the ninth inning, but
Shaw got former Dodger Eric Young to pop out to third and Ricky
Gutierrez to fly out to right to give the Dodgers a 6-5 win over
the Cubs at Wrigley Field on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, E.Y. was hot and talking in the Chicago papers
about (not liking Dodgers manager Davey Johnson). I know he was
jacked and ready to get the job done, so I knew he'd be anxious,''
said Hundley, whose three-run homer in the eighth was his seventh
homer in eight starts. ``That's what was so huge. I think it was
probably Shaw's toughest save all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was more than overshadowed when a fight started
down the right field line that eventually had some of the Dodgers
players and bullpen coach Rick Dempsey fighting in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   It started with two outs in the ninth, after an RBI double by
Julio Zoleta pulled the Cubs within 6-5. Johnson said a fan punched
backup catcher Chad Kreuter in the back of the head, took his hat
and several players went after the fan.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting lasting nine minutes, and Shaw said he never made
it further than the right-field foul line to see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything going on, I was trying to think how to get out
of the inning,'' Shaw said. ``I just tried to focus on what I
wanted to do to get out of the jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's day: Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez, or at least his
representative, has his day in a Indian River County (Fla.) court
today to answer charges stemming from his March 11 arrest for
allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol during spring
training in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Perez won't be present at the proceedings, but he said he knows
what to expect. Perez, represented by Vero Beach-base attorney
Norman Green, said he's anticipating a fine, a suspended driver's
license for six months, community service and to have to take a
class on the perils of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready for anything,'' Perez said. ``What happened to
me down there can happen to anybody. I talked to my agent (Adam
Katz) Monday and he said it's only hurting me and to stay out of
trouble. I don't want any new problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he just wants to concentrate on pitching, and until
he was shelled for seven runs in 1 innings Sunday in St. Louis, he
was throwing fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Perez's poor showing wasn't enough to classify the
lefty's status in the starting rotation as being start-to-start,
though a few more starts like that could make it time to dust off
right-hander Orel Hershiser in the bullpen and return him to the
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, one start isn't the end of the world, especially for a
guy who has to be good in the strike zone,'' Johnson said.
``Sometimes when you get into a jam, it's hard to go to plan B.
(Everything is status quo) as long as his confidence is not shaken
and I don't think that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling better: Right-hander Mike Fetters played catch in the
outfield and if he experiences no swelling in his right elbow, he
will do the same today and throw in the bullpen Friday. Johnson
said he wants Fetters to throw at least two bullpen sessions before
being activated from the disabled list. He's eligible Friday but
probably won't be back until after the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be slow with that,'' Johnson said. ``I told
him, `Once you throw a couple of pens, you don't need to go out on
a rehab.' `'
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could send lefty Onan Masaoka back to Triple-A
Albuquerque when Fetters is activated. Masaoka has appeared in one
game since returning to the Dodgers last Wednesday, but his
velocity remained in the mid 80s. Masaoka is the only lefty in the
Dodgers bullpen, but Fetters is particularly strong against
left-handers, who are 1 for 16 against him.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Shortstop Kevin Elster continued to take ground
balls and batting practice and he said he'll be ready to come off
the disabled list Friday in Florida. The expected move is to send
Alex Cora back to Albuquerque despite how well he's played in
Elster's place. ... Cubs left fielder Henry Rodriguez left the game
in the bottom of the third inning after fouling a ball off his
right knee. He's listed as day-to-day.

QUIETLY, LAKERS LET ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Accountability is a keyword in Phil Jackson's
world. So the two days between Games 4 and 5 of the Western
Conference semifinals figured to be a regular Phil-ibuster for the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows their somnolent performance Sunday against Phoenix
begged more questions than are on a week's worth of Regis Philbin
cue cards. In no particular order: How could a team with a
first-team All-Defensive player (Kobe Bryant) and the runner-up in
the Defensive Player of the Year voting (Shaquille O'Neal) give up
71 points in the first 24 minutes?
</P>
<P>
   How could a team in a position to make a sweeping statement lose
by 19?
</P>
<P>
   And what possessed Rick Fox to earn a fourth-quarter ejection?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, when it came to answering for their poor performance, the
Lakers came down with a collective case of laryngitis. Their
silence was unprecedented, like a quiet interlude during an NBA
game.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about guys who usually are as gregarious as the
gals from ``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal fills notebooks the way he does the low post. Bryant's
sound bytes are as smooth as his shooting stroke. Fox is a
part-time actor who doesn't need a script to be articulate. John
Salley breathes, therefore he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher attacks questions the way he does loose balls; he
holds nothing back. Ron Harper is in everybody's ear like wax.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we were wondering whether maybe the Lakers' collars
weren't getting a tad tight, thus restricting the flow of air to
their larynxes, they came out Tuesday and returned the thrashing,
dispatching the Suns 87-65 to close out the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Guess they decided to let their play do their talking. A superb
strategy, that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can talk a little too much,'' Fox said, ``and
not put the right actions behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox put his best foot forward, falling into step behind O'Neal
(who had 13 of his 21 rebounds in the first half) and Kobe Bryant
(13 first-half points on his way to 17). The frustrated reserve
forward, who came into the game averaging a paltry two points and
11 minutes for the series, played 10 minutes in the first half and
was 2 of 3 from behind the three-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Lakers led 49-23 after 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-point turnaround in the Suns' fortunes in the first
halves of Games 4 and 5 was easy to break down if not believe: In
Game 4, they converted 58.3 percent of their shots and coughed up
the ball only four times.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 24 minutes Tuesday, the Suns shot 21.6 percent from
the field and committed 11 turnovers, which begat eight Lakers
points. Starting point guard Jason Kidd and sixth man Rodney Rogers
each had as many turnovers (three) as the entire Laker team.
</P>
<P>
   If Phoenix looked like an entirely different team than the one
that had embarrassed the Lakers on Sunday, well, Fox's
metamorphosis was nearly as remarkable, considering he had two
three-point baskets to show for the four previous games.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, isn't it, how powerful a motivator shame can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an embarrassment factor,'' Fox said, in the silence
before the imperfect storm that wiped out the Suns (the Lakers did,
after all, shoot 36.3 percent). ``You don't want to talk about how
unprofessionally you conducted yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was speaking for himself and of Sunday's lackadaisical
Lakers, in general.
</P>
<P>
   It was good the Lakers saved their breath, unleashing all their
energy on the poor Suns. The finish line is now very near.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are four victories from the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we know whichever team advances will have Miami or New York
or Philadelphia or Indiana standing between it and a champagne
shower.
</P>
<P>
   But it says here the Finals will be a mere formality for
whichever team emerges from the West. The 2000 NBA Finals will be
like the 1980 Winter Olympics when the U.S. hockey team defeated
the Soviet Union in the semifinals and then iced the gold medal
with a win over Finland.
</P>
<P>
   But that's us talking, not the Lakers, who Tuesday were content
to let their total eclipse of the Suns be their brashest statement.
The only prediction we could pry out of anybody was this, from
Harper:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever emerges,'' in the Western Conference final, he said,
``will know they have earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Lakers played Tuesday, they gave themselves a
chance.

HORRY NOT GREEN WITH ENVY AS A SUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One is a hammer, the other scissors. One is a
record-setting iron man, the other frequently held together with
gauze and tape. One is a starter who plays as little as a quarter
of the game, the other a sub who gets the meaningful minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They're an odd couple, A.C. Green and Robert Horry. ``Two
totally different players,'' Horry says.
</P>
<P>
   Though their power-forward partnership isn't as noisy as the
superstar combination of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, it says
as much about why the Los Angeles Lakers have advanced to the NBA
Western Conference final for only the second time since Magic
Johnson's 1991 retirement announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Those who ask why Horry is never in the starting lineup were
handed more reasons to wonder Tuesday night at Staples Center when
he made a series of big plays to send the Lakers on their way to an
87-65 victory over the Phoenix Suns and a 4-1 series victory.
</P>
<P>
   But to those inhabiting the world of coach Phil Jackson, it
makes perfect sense that Green started all 82 games in the regular
season and has started all 10 in the playoffs, and will continue to
start until the Lakers win the championship or are knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was asked Monday - not for the first time this season -
whether he'd considered starting Horry, the more productive of his
power forwards. No, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stubborn that way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That tongue-in-cheek answer doesn't give the coach credit,
though.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, under Del Harris and Kurt Rambis, the Lakers
were models of instability, with a more jumbled lineup than a
Double-A baseball club. Eight different Lakers appeared in the
starting lineup in 1997, O'Neal's first season with the team. Seven
players started in 1998 on the way to a Western Conference final
sweep by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, amid the comings and goings of Dennis Rodman, Glen
Rice and Eddie Jones, 10 Lakers took turns in the lineup. That
doesn't count occasional lineup changes forced by injuries and
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has restored stability to the court. Six Lakers have
started in 1999-2000, and Derek Fisher wouldn't have made it if
Bryant hadn't opened the season on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Another coach might have switched Horry and Green at some point.
Maybe in January, when Horry played more than Green in six straight
games, or in February and March, when Horry got more minutes in 12
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But that would have made it a battle, inflamed an issue, raised
doubts. So Jackson sticks with his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives everybody a comfort zone to work from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From his comfort zone, on the bench to begin game 5, Horry
replaced Green with 2:18 to play in the first quarter and the
Lakers ahead by three. He immediately grabbed an offensive rebound
that led to two Rice free throws. He drew a foul chasing a loose
ball and made a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   And in one sequence early in the second quarter, Horry sank a
3-pointer, stole a pass and went in for a breakaway dunk, putting
the Lakers up by 12 on their way to 26 up at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Green, playing in his 1,120th consecutive NBA game,
went scoreless in 10 first-half minutes, giving him three points in
a span of 3 games.
</P>
<P>
   How does a 6-foot-9 man with a green bear on his head fade from
view? Green turned invisible in the Phoenix series, seeing his
minutes, points and rebounding decline night by night, and doing
too little to stop the Suns' Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Horry doesn't mind picking up more than his share of the load.
Coming off the bench ``is fine with me,'' he said. ``A.C. does a
great job. He's more physical and I'm more of a slasher. It gives
(opponents) two totally different players to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, it gives the Lakers one familiar lineup and one
well-practiced set of roles to look at. That's symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has a gift for not overreacting. He doesn't overreact
when Green is outplayed by Horry. He doesn't overreact when the
Lakers are embarrassed by the Suns, as they were Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He sends out the same lineup and watches it restore order. Green
starting, Horry off the bench, everything in its place.

MERCKER GRATEFUL FOR SUPPORT OF FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Kent Mercker, undergoing evaluation
and tests at UC Irvine Medical Center after suffering a cerebral
hemorrhage Thursday, issued a statement Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife Julie and I would like to express our deepest
gratitude for all the supportive responses we've received in the
past week. The thoughts, messages and prayers have meant a great
deal to our family. We also want to say thanks to the staff at UCI
Medical Center, my teammates and the Angels organization for being
there every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a frustrating and confusing period of time in
trying to secure all the answers. I feel pretty good now, but
believe me I intend to continue following my doctor's instructions.
I look forward to seeing all of you soon, either in the clubhouse
or on the mound. Again, words can't convey our appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who was transferred from intensive care to a private
room Monday, was visited Tuesday by Troy Percival and Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   Luuloa called up: The Angels called up shortstop Keith Luuloa
from Triple-A Edmonton Tuesday, optioning Trent Durrington to
Edmonton. The Angels were in need of a backup shortstop with Gary
DiSarcina on the disabled list and Benji Gil moving to the starting
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also moved shortstop Justin Baughman from Double-A
Erie to Edmonton, as they try to brace themselves for what seems
inevitable losing DiSarcina for a significant amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   Results from Monday's angiogram performed on the right shoulder
of DiSarcina were negative, meaning no aneurysm was found. He was
examined Tuesday by the Chicago Bears team physician, who will go
over the results with Angels team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum today.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina has grown frustrated by the lack of a diagnosis but
knows that he isn't capable of playing in his current state. ``I've
been poked, prodded, zapped, zipped and nuclear-tested,'' DiSarcina
said last week. ``They can run all the tests they want, but when I
walk out of the doctor's office, I still have a sore shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   How long for Hill?: Pitcher Ken Hill is out with a torn muscle
in his rib cage and there is no timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't told me anything because they don't know,'' Hill
said. ``They can't say three months because I could be back in two
weeks. And they can't say two weeks because it might be three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says the pain has lessened, but there are times it is bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sneeze, that's the biggest thing now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is guaranteed $6 million for 2001 if he makes 33 starts or
pitches at least 190 innings. Those seem out of reach, but Hill
says it doesn't concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have plenty of money,'' said Hill, who is making $5.6
million this season. ``It's about showing these guys I can pitch.
I'm tired of being hurt. I've been playing for 12 years, I have
nothing to prove to anybody. But I've been banged up. I want to
give these guys something.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Levine: Because of off-days, the Angels don't need a fifth
starter until May 27, and not again after that until June 6. Among
those being considered is Al Levine, who has been a lifesaver out
of the bullpen so far.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has been big when the starter has been knocked out of the
game early. He threw 3 hitless innings Sunday after Jason Dickson
lasted only 1 innings, allowing the Angels to rally from a 4-0
deficit to win 7-6. His 3.03 ERA is the lowest on the staff and of
his 11 inherited baserunners, only one has scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role Al provides is vital to a championship-caliber
pitching staff,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He's not scared off
by any situation. He has the confidence to execute his pitches and
he understands his game plan as it relates to the hitters and the
situation.''

FACTOR IN FOX FOULS: LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yes, Rick Fox was frustrated and irritable when he
got himself ejected from the fourth quarter of Sunday's Los Angeles
Lakers disaster in Phoenix. But no, he said, it wasn't about
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was frustrated because we were losing so bad,'' Fox
said Tuesday, addressing the incident for the first time. ``I mean,
here we were 3-0 in a series and it didn't seem like we came to
play, really. I've seen this before with us, and it's not anything
we should be proud of. It's fight - how much fight do you have in
you? How much pride do you have in you to actually do whatever it
takes to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``And obviously at that point, it was way beyond control, with
three minutes to go. You always want to be in the game. If you want
to say I'm upset because I'm not in the game, I'd like to play 40
minutes. That hasn't been the case all year. Wanting to be out
there was definitely something on my mind, and then once I got out
there, wanting it to be more than just being out there running up
and down the court for the last three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of standing there, Fox wrapped up Clifford Robinson
twice, each time drawing a technical foul from referee Joey
Crawford, and thus an automatic ejection. But Fox disagreed with
Crawford's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The fouls) were given intentionally, but that doesn't warrant
being kicked out of the game,'' he said. ``I didn't try to disrupt
or instigate anything. You just sit and watch Cliff Robinson and
Jason Kidd and the rest of those guys for 48 minutes run through
you, and it gets kind of tiresome watching. There comes a point
where you have to do something about it. If they're going to just
score as easy as they've been scoring all day, I'd rather let them
feel it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive: Coach Phil Jackson was pleased to see both Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant garner votes in the Defensive Player of the
Year balloting, released Tuesday. O'Neal (21 votes) finished a
distant second to Miami's Alonzo Mourning (62), and Bryant got four
votes to tie Seattle's Gary Payton for fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Jackson said of O'Neal's second-place finish.
``I think it registers ... his improvement this year as basketball
player, a complete basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seemed to disagree with Mourning as the top vote-getter.
``Alonzo blocks shots, I guess that's what counts. (Atlanta's
Dikembe) Mutombo blocks a lot of shots, he used to be the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bryant receiving as many votes as Payton - regarded as the
best backcourt defender in the league - Jackson said, ``That
surprised me a little bit. This is a very active player whose
disruptive ability is quite noticeable on the floor, and his
attention has grown so much this year, his focus and concentration
are much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant previously was named to the All-Defensive first team.
O'Neal made the second team.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The almighty 'mute'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The National Organization for Women is urging
letters and calls to ABC to squelch any temptation it might have of
putting the spore monster of radio, Rush Limbaugh, on ``Monday
Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh is hot for the TV job. ABC is silent, maybe because
this trial balloon has proved so leaden.
</P>
<P>
   I'm solidly on NOW's side in this taste test. But I can deal
with Rush in this and any manifestation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, worst case, Rush gets the job. Do I do a write-in?
No, I do a mute-on. One jab of my remote and Rush becomes a
pointless mime. TV sound off, I then turn the radio dial to the
nearest CBS Radio affiliate for the play-by-play to go with ABC's
pictures. Ta-ta, Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the job of zeroing out three hours of self-inflated
blowhard isn't what the mute was invented for. For that, a walk
from recliner to the TV is a trip well-invested.
</P>
<P>
   We know the essential mission of the mute: to zero-out incessant
sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sales pitches, the remote control looms as a major
force in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   We may have seen the mute at work in the New Hampshire
Republican primary. George W. Bush spent millions to program his
way into TV viewers' hearts as (a) the real conservative; (b) the
real reformer; or (c) Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters, including cross-over Democrats, and
independents, chose (d) John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts wondered how someone like Bush, with so much money to
spend on focus-group-crafted TV commercials, could fail to click
with broad-based voters/viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit was their clickers.
</P>
<P>
   The remote. Can it render political commercials moot? All that
well-crafted imagery? All those French horns and violins? All that
enlightening, life-changing information jammed into 30 seconds? All
those nasty attacks? All for naught? Nice thought.
</P>
<P>
   A mute is a wonderful thing. A mute is a powerful thing. And,
though once a novelty, the mute has become a pervasive thing.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Remote Central, a clearinghouse on remote
controls of all kinds, confirmed that remotes and mutes are a
novelty no more. Virtually all new TVs have them. Bad news for
candidates. Good news for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe campaign commercials can help a candidate, but they look
more and more like a dubious investment.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain profited from getting in front of lots
and lots of real audiences. Bush quickly figured he had better do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the months ahead we will see candidates try to manipulate
opinion with TV spots and attack ads, but the result of it all _
the lion's share of all that campaign money for which so many
favors are pledged _ will be barely neglible. Credit the mute.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign winds down, what will sway the undecided won't
be stuff pasteurized by a TV guru. What will count will be
presidential debates, issues coverage in print and on the air _ you
know, what voters choose to supplement what they know.
</P>
<P>
   The mute is a button of choice. The mute is democracy in action.
It is how discriminating viewers screen out ways to program their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So, candidates: Stick to issues. Debate freely and often. Choose
real audiences over studios.
</P>
<P>
   If you expect to get your message out to America by wedging it
between ``Friends'' and ``Frazier,'' we have bad news for you.
</P>
<P>
   As for Limbaugh's chances for a Monday Night Football slot, one
could say that ``remote'' is a most apt characterization.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hate is an equal-opportunity killer
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an ages-old lottery going on. Don't despair that you
haven't bought a ticket. You already have one. You were born with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, your chances of winning the big jackpot are
astronomical. Be assured, however, that there will be winners. The
lottery that I refer to is the chance that someone consumed by
intense hatred of your kind could target you for violence _ for no
reason other than your racial or ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened April 28 in Mount Lebanon, Pa., an upscale
suburb of Pittsburgh. Around noon, Richard Baumhammers, the son of
Latvian immigrants, went next-door and shot a 63-year-old Jewish
woman, Anita Gordon, who had been a lifelong neighbor and close
friend of his parents'. He then went to her nearby synagogue, shot
out the front windows and painted red swastikas on the building.
</P>
<P>
   With that act, the 34-year-old immigration attorney began a
shooting spree that spanned two counties. Within about two hours,
he had killed five people and critically wounded one.
</P>
<P>
   At a grocery, two Indian immigrants, 31 and 24, were shot, one
fatally. Next, Baumhammers gunned down two Asian men who worked at
a restaurant. About a half-hour later, he killed a 22-year-old
black man at a karate school.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Ms. Gordon, Baumhammers didn't know his
victims. He seems to have chosen targets based on their ethnic
minority identities. Witnesses to the slaughter in the restaurant
say the gunman took aim, fired and calmly walked away.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday for his arraignment, he smiled and remained
tranquil. Dr. Christine Martone, the court-ordered psychiatrist who
had spent 83 minutes with him over two days, diagnosed him as a
paranoid schizophrenic who is unfit to stand trial. ``Auditory
delusions,'' she said, cause him to hear voices. Common Pleas Court
Judge Lawrence O'Toole withheld his ruling on motions to
institutionalize Baumhammers until he receives the results of
another psychological evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers has a history of mental illness. At one point, he
had been prescribed psychotropic drugs. In this regard, he has a
lot in common with fellow Allegheny County resident Ronald Taylor,
39, a black man who in March went on a shooting spree during which
he killed three white men and wounded two others. If we still need
proof that hatred is an equal-opportunity killer, these gunmen
provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also has since been diagnosed as schizophrenic with a
history of mental illness. In other words, these men _ one white,
one black _ are ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   To salve our consciences, I fear we all too conveniently apply
this term to crimes motivated by race hatred. Or, when a single
victim is involved, we dismiss such crimes as an inevitable
byproduct of the times we live in, in which violence is
commonplace, predictable and inevitable. But killing sprees with
multiple, random victims violate our tenuous hold on a sense of
public safety.
</P>
<P>
   When hatred of ``the other'' is so virulent as to become the
singular focus of the sick mind, we should ask ourselves what
perverted logic built the ticking hate-bomb. Is it possible that
the ingredients were tiny expressions of hate, each in itself
relatively harmless? Was it an ethnic slur delivered in jest? A
negative stereotype casually dismissing others' humanity? Or _ most
potent of all _ daily consideration of color above all other human
attributes in all matters and decisions?
</P>
<P>
   Consciously or subconsciously, we all buy into these acts from
time to time. We continue to claim sanity because we stop short of
physically assaulting each other. We understand that in American
society, polite ethnic and racial hatred is standard civil
protocol, tacitly encouraged and usually tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we say Baumhammers and Taylor are sick. They didn't
have enough sense to know this lottery has rules.

 &HT;    UPI RIP
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A cynical wordsmith once compared workers on daily
newspapers to cowboys on a dinosaur ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of dinosaurs is long gone, of course. Sometimes I
feel print journalism is headed in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a little bummed after reading that the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church has acquired the United Press International wire
service.
</P>
<P>
   A right-wing Korean cult, according to many observers, now owns
the once-venerated wire service that regularly out-wrote and
out-hustled all competitors, including the stodgy Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   My father Charles Nethaway lived and died, literally, a United
Press man.
</P>
<P>
   He hooked up with the UP bureau in Dallas after he returned from
World War II. Getting the news, getting it first, ensuring that it
was accurate, making it sing and punching it out to UP clients
ahead of the competition was more than a job for my father. It was
his passion.
</P>
<P>
   I used to go to the bureau to watch them work. The place was
filled with cigarette smoke, quips and a constant sense of urgency
due to the machine-gun rattle of Underwoods, Royals and teletypes
pounding out the news.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids rooted for Cardinals or Dodgers. I rooted for UP to
whip AP, the International News Service and all the minor-league
pretenders to wire service supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United Press signed up newspapers and broadcasters as
clients. The Associated Press signed up newspapers and broadcasters
as members. The broadcasters back then were radio stations.
Television was on the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   AP had a greater reach since each member agreed to put its copy
on the AP wire. A lot of the AP copy, considering its scattered
sources, was full of holes and errors and was poorly written,
according to my father and other UP word warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, my father was promoted to the New Orleans UP
bureau, which was a culture shock for Texas natives. My father met
my mother when they both worked on a Texas newspaper. My
grandfather and uncle worked on Texas newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But we left for New Orleans to kick some AP butt, which, I was
told, the UP bureau did with both regularity and alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   The next promotion sent us to Kansas City, where the AP needed
to be taken down a notch or two. I was happy to get out of New
Orleans. The town was sinking under the weight of sadistic
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, my father had the opportunity to take on the AP in
New York City. As a family, we decided to pass on the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   My hard-charging father died on the job due to a cerebral
hemorrhage. I've since watched UP, then UPI when it purchased INS,
go downhill.
</P>
<P>
   AP's membership formula proved superior to UPI's client approach
as newspapers around the country began to fold.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon newspapers gave in to morning newspapers. Competing
newspapers were either bought out or closed their doors. Few
American cities now have competing dailies.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers also have been hard hit by an explosion of niche
media outlets competing for advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine, one of the last general-interest,
mass-circulation magazines, announced its demise the day before the
Rev. Moon took control of UPI.
</P>
<P>
   Now traditional news operations struggle to keep up with what
passes for news-gathering on the Internet. There's no way to
determine if what appears on the Internet is accurate, or even if
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional ink-on-newsprint newspapers remain the most credible
source for news. We hope the public understands this.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day in American journalism when UPI was taken over
by the Moonies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As in the 1980s boom, signs of economic excess are
spreading across Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The job market is stretched as tight as piano wire. Office rents
in prime locations in Cambridge have leapfrogged over Manhattan
rents. Housing prices, even in Central Massachusetts, have risen
beyond the grasp of middle-class families.
</P>
<P>
   And all eyes are on the teetering stock market, which has begun
to hit star companies like CMGI Inc., the Andover-based dot-com
giant that announced more layoffs last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists are worrying aloud that these might be
harbingers of unsustainable growth in Massachusetts, growth that
would dramatically reverse itself if the stock market were to
plummet or the high-flying technology industry were to crash to
earth. Is the state economy again ``overheated'' and at risk of
collapsing as it did in the late 1980s, when minicomputers, real
estate, and defense folded like a three-cheese souffle?
</P>
<P>
   This time the excesses are being driven by different industries
than in the 1980s, but the comeuppance, warns David Birch, a
business economist in Cambridge, could be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this falls apart, we're going to be right back where we
were in 1990 and 1991,'' he said last week. ``We're destined to be
wiped out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists around the state are hunkered in front of their
computers, poring over charts and statistics. The question everyone
_ corporate executives, state government officials, union leaders,
workers, consumers _ most want answered is whether the
platinum-lined economy of Massachusetts' boom contains a big gray
cloud.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Cassandras, with their pessimistic prophesies,
cannot ignore how much has changed since the crash of the late
1980s, when a few giant companies _ Digital Equipment Corp., Data
General Corp., and Wang Laboratories Inc. _ had accounted for much
of the economic activity of the state. Their technology became
outmoded, and Massachusetts at its depths sustained 100,000 layoffs
in a single month, January 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Winer, the state government's chief economist who has
tracked Massachusetts for 30 years, is among those who argue that
the rebuilding that occurred during the 1990s, as the nation
experienced an unprecedented expansion, has made the state's
economy far more resilient and immune to collapse than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference nowadays, compared to when we had a strong
economy in the 1980s, is the diversity. We're not as dependent on
any one sector,'' Winer said. ``If we had problems in the stock
market and the financial sector, it wouldn't have that dramatic an
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is pervasive. The state's technology industry,
which once revolved around minicomputers, is now a rainbow of small
firms, writing software, transporting data over the Internet, and
developing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   While much has been made of tiny dot-com firms with Fortune
500-level stock prices but no profits, most of the state's
technology firms are profitable and are adapting quickly to
breathtaking change brought by the Internet and other technological
breakthroughs. Cisco Systems Inc., Sun Microsystems and Amgen Inc.
are based in California, and all are establishing beachheads in
Massachusetts that employ thousands. Taunton-based Kopin Corp.,
which makes components used in cell phones, announced last week
that it would open a new plant and double its payroll, to 500, by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a world of difference between today's economy and that
of the 1980s,'' said Sara Johnson, economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, a consulting firm. ``Today, we have an economy that's driven
by small innovative companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth of the mutual fund and brokerage industries, which now
employ 63,600 in Massachusetts, has been a powerful force
propelling the economy during the great bull market of the 1990s.
But the services industry since 1984 has added 407,300 jobs and
employs more than 1 million in the state _ one-third of all
workers. Boston has always been a hub for ``knowledge-based''
firms, ranging from law, advertising, and accounting firms to
medical, engineering, and architectural firms. But business
services also include corner dry cleaners and copy shops. Services,
economists said, tend to be less sensitive to economic cycles than
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic underpinnings of the economy,'' said Karl Case, an
economics professor at Wellesley College, ``are more diversified
and are healthier than they were in '89.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A textile mill straddling the Assabet River in Maynard is a
microcosm of Massachusetts' economy. Some of the tenants are
dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   The mill was once headquarters for Digital, which moved out amid
a 1998 acquisition by Compaq Computer Corp. The sprawling mill was
purchased 2 1/2 years ago by developers who quickly leased most of
its 1 million square feet of office space to some 80 tenants.
</P>
<P>
   One is Peanutpress.com. Founders Jeff Strobel and Mark Reichelt
devised encryption software so publishers could sell rights to
download books or newspapers into Palm Pilots. In four months,
Peanutpress.com has hired eight employees and moved into one of the
tiny brick-and-beam offices lining the mill's maze-like walkways.
Regardless of where the Nasdaq tech-stock index may be headed,
Strobel said he believes the potential audience of Palm Pilot
readers is enormous. ``If we can get somebody to try one of our
books, customers get hooked really quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The mill's tenants include a flute maker, Verne Q. Powell Flutes
Inc., consultants such as Wilson Group, which helps clients develop
compensation programs for employees, and Payright Payroll Services
Inc., which handles payrolls for small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Philip O'Brien started Payright in 1989, just as the state
economy went into a slump. His timing was bad, but he persisted. He
now has eight employees serving 450 clients, from Dunkin' Donuts
franchises to the American Textile Museum. He has attracted dot-com
clients in the mill and set up a Web site to serve them,
Payrightpayroll .com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me six months ago, I would have said this won't
happen for a few years,'' said O'Brien, 51, who has begun to wear
the khaki pants that are the uniform in the dot-com world. ``Things
are happening that quick here.''

 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``It's been a quiet life,'' Jonathan Kozol says,
sitting on a bench in the South End, a block away from the site of
what was once the Storefront Learning Center, an alternative ``free
school'' he helped found and run three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``quiet'' is a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a quiet life for the Kozol who lives alone in a small
18th-century house in Byfield, 30 miles north of Boston, with his
golden retriever, Sweetie Pie.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol, who has been known to spend up to 14 hours a day writing,
jokes that, ``My research assistant, if she hasn't heard from me
for a few days, will sometimes call the post office to ask them to
make sure I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also been quiet for the Kozol who, over the past seven
years, has visited Mott Haven, the poorest part of the poorest
section of New York, the South Bronx, more than 200 times. He has
written a pair of books about the neighborhood and its children,
``Amazing Grace'' (1995) and the just-published ``Ordinary
Resurrections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the children look on him as an auxiliary father,''
says Mother Martha Overall, who as pastor of St. Ann's Episcopal
Church figures prominently in ``Ordinary Resurrections.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been anything but quiet for the Kozol who for almost 40
years has worked tirelessly as an education reformer and advocate
for the disadvantaged. Such books as ``Illiterate America'' (1985),
``Rachel and Her Children'' (1988), about homelessness, ``Savage
Inequalities'' (1991), about school funding, and the two books
about Mott Haven have maintained his reputation as one of America's
foremost social critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot read him without feeling a call to action,'' says
Robert R. Spillane, superintendent of Boston schools from 1981-1985
and now a regional officer with the US Department of State's Office
of Overseas Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol's best-known work, ``Death at an Early Age'' (1967), an
account of his year teaching fourth grade at a public school in
Dorchester, won a National Book Award and stirred more controversy
in this city than perhaps any title published since Boston stopped
banning books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncompromising,'' not ``quiet,'' would be a better word to
describe such a life. Paul Parks, former state secretary of
education and a founder of the Metropolitan Council for Educational
Opportunity, knows that Kozol well. ``Jonathan has never been a
politician _ not even close!'' Parks says with a laugh. ``We knew
that, and we wouldn't let him negotiate. He wasn't going to yield
any point.''
</P>
<P>
   That unwillingness to yield has won Kozol both admirers and
detractors, but not many victories. ``Where do you put an idealist
who doesn't have practical ideas?'' asks Douglas J. Besharov,
director of the American Enterprise Institute's Social and
Individual Responsibility Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more people were like Jonathan Kozol, it would be a better
world. But are his ideas about what causes poverty and disadvantage
correct? . . . The weight of authority is against him. . . . I
don't think he has a large voice in liberal-left policymaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol, 63, remains undimmed in his idealism. Energetic and
medium-sized, he hunches his shoulders and leans forward when he
walks. It's the posture of a man on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   He has a sad, slightly hang-dog face _ but one capable of
breaking into a surprisingly impish smile. There's something almost
boyish about Kozol: the way he combines enthusiasm and openness,
his delight in small details of everyday life. Ordering coffee, he
sees a display of glazed doughnuts. They look so good, he asks for
two. Or there's the way his face lights up as he walks through the
South End, pointing out landmarks from the 20 years he spent living
in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol gives his complete attention to whatever he's saying. The
subject can be charter schools (about which he has misgivings) or
an all-night drugstore on Columbus Avenue, Braddock Pharmacy (for
which he has nothing but praise); Kozol gets equally caught up in
each. When it's pointed out that he's neglected to drink any of his
coffee, he shakes his head and grins. ``Oh, I do that all the
time.'' He never does get around to the doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol grew up in just outside of Boston, in Newton. His parents
are in their 90s. Dr. Harry L. Kozol, a founder of the field of
forensic psychiatry (he testified as a government witness in the
Patty Hearst trial), suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Ruth Kozol
devotes her time to rooting for the Red Sox (as Kozol points out,
she can actually remember when they last won the World Series) and
looking out for her son. ``She's still trying to match me up,'' he
laughs. ``She has some lovely nurses taking care of her, and every
so often she'll say to me, `It's not too late!' '' Kozol, who was
married for five years during the 1970s, is childless.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the Noble and Greenough School and then
flourished at Harvard. An English major, he studied with the poet
Archibald MacLeish, the novelist John Hawkes, and the literary
critics Harry Levin and Richard Poirier. (Kozol had equally starry
friends: Joseph Lelyveld, now executive editor of The New York
Times, was a freshman roommate; a future US senator, Jay
Rockefeller, lived across the hall.) He graduated summa cum laude
in 1958 and won a Rhodes Scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol stayed less than a year at Oxford. ``I'd had such an
intense education at Nobles and Harvard I found the atmosphere at
Oxford immature, less serious. I went to Paris. I've never
regretted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Literature, not activism, first attracted Kozol. He had already
published a novel, ``The Fume of Poppies'' (1958), about an
undergraduate romance _ he later dismissed it as ``my toy novel'' _
and in Paris the expatriate novelist James Jones adopted him. Kozol
became friends with William Styron and James Baldwin and one
evening literally bumped into Richard Wright in a Left Bank
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he abandoned the novel he'd been writing about his
grandparents, Jewish immigrants from Russia, and returned to
Cambridge. Uncertain about his future, Kozol spent the next 18
months at loose ends. One day, during the Freedom Summer of 1964,
he saw a Congress of Racial Equality flier in Harvard Square.
Kozol, who was so apolitical he'd never heard of CORE, took the
subway to Roxbury to volunteer. ``That was the hardest thing I ever
did in my life,'' he says. Within a week, he'd led a successful
rent strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the former Rhodes Scholar was a ``permanent
substitute'' in the Boston public schools earning the princely sum
of $3,600 a year. He was assigned to the predominantly black
Christopher Gibson School. Kozol's ``classroom'' was the school
auditorium, which his class had to share with three others. The
cellar smelled of urine. One day a large window fell, nearly
hitting several children. Students were sometimes beaten with a
rattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before the end of the school year, Kozol _ who by all
accounts had proven himself a gifted and dedicated teacher _ was
fired for ``curriculum deviation'': He'd read his class a Langston
Hughes poem. Outraged parents picketed and held sit-ins to protest
his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing compared to what happened when ``Death at an
Early Age'' was published two years later. Released at the height
of the Kevin White-Louise Day Hicks mayoral race, it sold a
thousand copies a day in the city and was serialized in the Globe.
The book ``really caused some aggravation in Boston,'' Spillane
says with a dry chuckle. ``It was a bombshell, definitely,'' adds
Parks. A city that prided itself on Horace Mann and the Boston
Latin School suddenly found its school system portrayed as racist,
decrepit, and incompetent. The fury ``Death at an Early Age''
inspired was some small foretaste of the response that would greet
court-ordered desegregation seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol had found his calling. The teacher who wasn't good enough
for the Boston public schools was hired as a consultant by the US
Office of Education. He also helped develop an alternative school
in Roxbury and spent two years teaching fifth grade in Newton. By
then, he'd moved to the South End. ``Making the reverse commute,''
he notes, ``I felt like a METCO kid myself!''

 LONGON: ... what I did.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Possibilities in a food career were practically nonexistent for
a woman when I attended the Cordon Bleu. No one understood why I
was going. My sharp-tongued college roommate told a mutual friend
that I was moving to Europe to train as a maid.
</P>
<P>
   I had never heard of the school before I met English-born Anne
Willan (see related story), who had gone there. She was food editor
of the Washington Star newspaper, and I was a dictationist in the
newsroom. When Anne left the Star to freelance, she took me with
her.
</P>
<P>
   She had a contract to Americanize The Cordon Bleu Cookery
Course, a popular British cooking partwork (a slim magazine sold
weekly on newsstands _ this one had 100,000 readers). It became
``The Grand Diplome Cooking Course.'' I learned cooking, writing,
and food styling. For what, I wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   When the ``Grand Diplome'' project was nearing an end, Anne
said, ``If you want to write about cookery, you'll have to become a
cook. No one will ever ask a sportswriter whether he can play his
sport, but someday someone will ask you whether you can cook.'' She
called London and insisted that my name move to the top of their
waiting list. She also told me that as a bonus for three years'
work, she and her husband, Mark Cherniavsky, an economist at the
World Bank, were paying the tuition for cooking school and giving
me enough extra cash to cover the airfare and initial expenses. I
was stunned by their generosity.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day, we received soft nylon caps to go with our
white smocks and blue oilcloth aprons (you couldn't wipe your hands
on them). We were paired up and shown the kitchens. A community
refrigerator sat at one end of the room, and one sink served many
students. It cured me forever of the American habit of chopping
near the sink.
</P>
<P>
   That first lunch was pretty silly. I was sure that this
cooking-school thing was a big mistake. We made ``jacket potatoes''
(read: baked).
</P>
<P>
   It got better quickly. We cooked lunch and ate at the little
stations. We dipped our fingers into the whipped cream bowl and all
gained weight together. The girls taught each other the Sabrina
egg. They managed to convince me that all the leftover food _ main
courses, breads, and desserts _ were delivered to the neighboring
convent, where the nuns combined everything (even the sweets) in
one pot and reheated it for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gray says all the food did go to the convent until
English health and hygiene laws prevented them from doing that. I
don't have the courage to ask her about the desserts being mixed
with the meat. The convent benefited from the school's renovation,
however. Even though the nuns would no longer receive leftover
lunch from the girls, they were given the school's freezer packed
with food.

</P>
<P>
   We cooked mainly from the ``Penguin Cordon Bleu Cookery,'' by
the school's co-principals Rosemary Hume and Muriel Downes. I
stayed longer than I had planned, moving from the ``certificate''
course to the advanced class. Years later, I learned that Lydia
Shire, who owns Biba and Pignoli, had done the certificate course a
few years earlier (she took the name Biba from an avant-garde
London store of the time whose clothes she loved).
</P>
<P>
   Shire remembers making English steamed puddings and wondering
when she would ever make them again. ``Now steamed puddings are
very fashionable,'' she says. ``I loved my time there. I thought it
was great.'' Returning a few years ago, she thought the place
seemed cold.
</P>
<P>
   Besides puddings and other English specialties, we learned
classic French cooking and Indian dishes. So deep-dish meat pies
topped with lard crusts were on the curriculum, as well as homemade
curry powder. Then we did things like kedgeree, crazy but charming
British corruptions of Indian food. We made sautes, aspics, pates,
all the important sauces like hollandaise and demi-glace, puff
pastry, and ice cream. We boned our own fish, poultry, and meat.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced course was hard, but we worked together in a large
kitchen down the street from the school. There was a beautiful old
Aga, the coal-fed Swedish cooker. Victoria Proctor, a no-nonsense
woman who had lived through the war and reminded us about it,
taught the course. During lean times, she said, her family ate
pastry made with the solidified fat from the surface of chicken
broth. She had a thing about waste. She would run her fingers
through our scrap bowl and reprimand anyone who trimmed her
vegetables more than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One day, I heard my name cracking through the air of the large
kitchen. ``Miss Julian!'' she screeched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wrong,'' she hissed. ``Your custard is wrong. I
don't like the way you're holding the spoon. That's not the way to
hold the pan. And it's the wrong pan!
</P>
<P>
   ``And one more thing, Miss Julian.'' By this time Mrs. Proctor's
very pronounced nose was leaning precariously close to my skunk
eyes. ``Never address anyone in England as `ma'am,' '' she said.
``Unless you're talking to the queen.''
</P>
<P>
   I made it to the end. Mrs. Proctor even managed a compliment
before she sent me off.
</P>
<P>
   Paris was next, again at Anne Willan's encouragement.
Surprisingly, I didn't like the classes at the Cordon Bleu there as
much as I had in London. Except for a fabulous pastry chef, the
others didn't seem to love teaching.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I returned home to America, I had been away a year.
I had adopted the Paris uniform: navy skirt and navy cardigan. My
hair was in a topknot, and I was thin. No more skunk eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One day while I was visiting friends, the college roommate who
never had a nice thing to say stopped by. ``Are you Sabrina yet?''
she asked. I pulled out a bowl, took an egg in my right hand,
tapped it against the edge of the bowl, then used the thumb and
ring finger of the same hand to open the bottom of the shell.
</P>
<P>
   The egg tumbled into the bowl. And I could hear the girls in
London giggling.
</P>

GIVING KIDS A SAFE PLACE ONLINE AMONG NEW WORK BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so many kids hooked on computers, some employers are
looking to offer a new benefit to employees whose children are
connected to the Net: secure Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of all parents with children in grades K
through 8 have computers, and 62 percent are linked to the
Internet, according to a recent Newsweek/Kaplan Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, national daycare chain Bright Horizons of
Cambridge, Mass. and Bell Atlantic Corp., are exploring ways to
ease employees' concerns about their children's online exploration.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Bright Horizons has been reviewing a product
called KOLA, or Kids on Line America. Developed by a California
start-up with the same name, the KOLA Web site offers programming
and live, monitored chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Employers offering the service must register the names,
addresses, and telephone numbers of employees who join through the
company. Once they are enrolled, employees are given access to
``closed'' chat rooms available only to other employees at a
particular firm, school, or daycare center. Programs and chats for
children and teens are scheduled weekly and are monitored regularly
by the service.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is expected to launch a test of the same service
in June, according Fred Jenkins, director of human resource
communications and work/life strategies. Employees will be offered
KOLA free of charge, on a first-come, first-served basis. In all,
800 employees in New England, New York, and the mid-Atlantic states
will test the service next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to offer it to employees for two months before
deciding whether the service will actually benefit our employees,''
said Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 130,000 in 13 states and the District
of Columbia, decided to try the program on an experimental basis
after its human resource managers received calls from workers
worried about their children's safety.
</P>
<P>
   How does the service work? Companies can either purchase it for
employees or pay a portion of the costs. If a company won't pay, a
group of employees can sign up directly through KOLA and pay the
monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Horizons, a limited investor, says it plans to offer the
benefit to employees at its centers and to its corporate clients in
June for $3.95 per month per employee, excluding Internet access.
In September, families with children enrolled at Bright Horizons'
centers will be offered the same service for the same fee. The
total cost of the service, plus Internet access: $19.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the dangers of having children involved in chat is that
you really do not know who they're speaking to,'' said David Lissy,
chief development officer at Bright Horizons. ``But knowing that
the company that offers the service has also prequalified the
parents or members gave us some confidence, because participants
can find out who's in the chat room with their kids. And parents
can make some editorial decisions about the kind of access they
want their children to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no fool-proof way of guaranteeing something
bad won't happen while your kids are logged on. Hiring a service to
provide closed chat sites and monitoring is one approach, but it
can't replace parental guidelines or rules. Blocks or screens such
as Cyber Patrol and Net Nanny can also help by steering kids away
from inappropriate information and adult-only sites.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still too early to tell whether large numbers of
employees will take advantage of Internet monitoring services,
statistics from a May 2000 survey by Hewitt Associates, the
international benefits consulting firm, show that companies have
significantly increased their use of other soft benefits in an
ongoing push to retain _ and attract _ top staff.
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois-based Hewitt Associates surveyed 1,020 US firms,
it found 74 percent now offer flexible work schedules, up from 66
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely used benefit? Child care assistance. Of the
firms polled, 90 percent provide some type of assistance to workers
with young children, ranging from dependent care spending accounts
(88 percent) to help employees pay for daycare with pre-tax
dollars, onsite daycare, or child-care slots at nearby community
centers.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing service? Elder care. In all, 47 percent of
employers now provide the benefit, up from 24 percent in 1994.
Approximately 32 percent offer dependent spending accounts, 40
percent have contracted with research and referral firms, 17
percent provide long-term care insurance, and 4 percent provide
individual counseling to workers struggling with the emotional
strain of caring for a sick or frail parent.
</P>
<P>
   And demand for elder care is expected to rise, according to The
Conference Board, a New York research group, which reports that the
need for such benefits will outstrip the demand for child care by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 25 percent of US workers were caring for an ailing or
frail parent four years ago, says the Families and Work Institute.
Next year, 42 percent of an estimted 9 million employees will be
engaged in some form of elder care, ranging from essential tasks
such as meals and personal care to assisting aging parents with
bills or driving them to medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the first wave of baby boomers is over 50, the number
of workers requiring elder care benefits will grow to one in three
adults over the next two decades and the majority of the caregivers
will be women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent of the graduate students enrolled at US business
schools are women, says Catalyst, the New York women's research
group. By contrast, 44 percent of the students at medical and law
schools are now women.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to shed more light on why fewer women are seeking MBAs,
Catalyst polled some 850 female graduates from a dozen of the
nation's top business schools. The poll had a margin of error of
2.4. Among the results: 56 percent of the participants said women
were more apt to shy away from business school because of a lack of
female faculty role models; 47 percent mentioned that women are
still struggling to fully balance work-life demands; 45 percent
said women have less confidence in their math skills; and 42
percent said working women interested in pursuing business degrees
are less likely to receive encouragement from employers.

 BOSTON: ... kid myself!''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These were heady times for Kozol. Young, articulate, and
increasingly radical, he was now something of a '60s icon. He
helped run the Storefront Learning Center for three years, an
experience that inspired a how-to guide for educational reformers,
``Free Schools'' (1972). His writing became more polemical, as
evinced by his next two books, ``The Night Is Dark and I Am Far
From Home'' (1975), an indictment of American society and
schooling, and ``Children of the Revolution'' (1978), a paean to
literacy programs in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Times were changing, though _ and so was the South End. ``I'd
look out the window,'' he says, ``and see a Volkswagen van pull up
and someone who looked alarmingly like me moving in.'' He sold his
house in the mid-'80s and moved to Essex County. First he lived in
Newburyport (``I liked living in a town where William Lloyd
Garrison started out''), then Byfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest time for me was the Reagan years,'' he says. ``My
dad said to me, in a moment of stentorian disapproval, `You think
you're an intellectual guerrilla commandante, but your soldiers in
blue jeans have gone back to business school.' Around that time I
was offered a position teaching religion and ethics at Exeter, and
some of my books were going out of print. A little later on, in the
late '80s, I found that the public policy debate was no longer
between the left and the right but between the center and the
right. I felt marginalized and was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what firmed up my will not to go to Exeter. One
day I just said to myself, `I don't want to spend the rest of my
life telling rich kids what it was like to work with poor kids when
I was young and brave.' So I said no to that and went to New York .
. . and started to write `Rachel and Her Children.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That book marked a turning point for Kozol. He started to focus
more on people and less on positions. For him, the political has
always been the personal; but in all his recent books, and
``Ordinary Resurrections'' above all, it's the personal that
predominates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a day in the South Bronx that I don't at some
point get angry at the terrible injustice that wastes so much of
the promise of these marvelous kids,'' Kozol says. And the
injustice is terrible: Mott Haven has 75 percent unemployment; the
highest rate of maternal AIDS in the United States; and almost
total segregation in its public schools (the student population is
99.8 percent minority). The facts are so appalling, they speak for
themselves _ and free Kozol to concentrate on Pineapple, Elio,
Otto, and the other children whose story ``Ordinary Resurrections''
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted this book to be a very gentle book,'' Kozol explains.
``I got sick of angry polemic. I don't like the literary furies
that rip people's guts apart in New York City. So I tried to subdue
my voice. I thought it would be unworthy of the children's
sweetness if I wrote in a strident tone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked gentle rebels,'' he explains, citing as
examples St. Francis of Assisi; Dorothy Day, of the Catholic Worker
movement; the Trappist monk Thomas Merton; and Cesar Chavez, the
farmworker organizer, with whom Kozol worked briefly in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like rebels who don't lose their sense of humor, who still
take delight in the small details of life, who don't get so caught
up in their own rhetoric they forget about things like licorice
sticks and Crayola crayons. Some of my political friends might
wonder why I'm so interested in those details. But life is not made
up of abstract concepts. . . . The political and spiritual heroes
that I find most invigorating and refreshing are those like Merton
who had a genuinely transcendent vision of a just society but also
took delight in squirrels outside the window.''
</P>
<P>
   All the heroes Kozol names were either clerics or religiously
devout. Again and again, in his conversation as well as in
``Ordinary Resurrections,'' references to the sacred appear. Mother
Overall, the Mott Haven pastor, likens him to the Old Testament
prophet Nathan and, noting Kozol's ``gentle, Biblical way,'' points
out that ``Most people here think he's a member of the clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol remains resolutely secular, but there is a certain logic
at work here. He has followed a path of almost-clerical vocation
and austerity _ and, his critics would add, unworldliness.
Spirituality is the highest form of idealism, after all; and past a
certain point, the political becomes as much a matter of faith as
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The French poet Charles Peguy said, ``Everything begins in
mysticism and ends in politics.'' Has Kozol reversed that
formulation? It's a question taken seriously by this ``recovering
agnostic,'' as a nun friend likes to call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children have drawn me back to the religious feelings I
had as a child,'' he says. ``One of my friends in Manhattan once
said something like, `It's nice the way you play along with them
when they're talking about religion.' It doesn't seem that way to
me at all. When the children talk about things unseen, I want to
see them. I find their playfulness contagious. I find the intricate
details of their theology so beautiful that I want to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could believe in God with the literal certitude most
of these children have. I wish I could believe in the resurrection
_ any resurrection _ as deeply as they do. I wish I could believe
in immortality; with my parents nearing the end of their journey, I
very much want to believe. But I don't believe in all those things
the way the children do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the children go up to kneel at the altar railing at St.
Ann's on Sunday morning to take communion, I'm often the only one
left in the church sitting at a pew. My Judaism is terribly
important to me, so I will never take communion. But some Sundays,
if I haven't had breakfast, when the priest holds up the wafer and
says `the bread of heaven,' it sounds pretty good! Then there's
this little boy who teases me, he whispers, `Try it, you'll like
it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's one kind of communion I'll never have. But the
openness, the trustingness of the children, the sweetness of their
affection, that's the bread and wine for me. That's the only kind
this 63-year-old Jewish man is going to know. That's my version of
communion.''

<P>
   As services have grown in importance, manufacturing has
contracted by 234,300 jobs since its heyday in 1984, when the
economy grew a sizzling 9.8 percent. For the average worker,
factory jobs are prized for their good pay and health benefits.
But, as Massachusetts workers learned in the late 1980s and Indiana
steelworkers learned in the 1970s, if technology or business
conditions no longer favor a major employer, heavy layoffs can
precipitate a regional downturn.
</P>
<P>
   As Digital was letting workers go, less visible forces began
reshaping the state's manufacturing industry in important ways.
What remains of manufacturing is smaller but less subject to
dramatic swings, economists point out, because once dominant
computer-hardware makers have been supplanted by a variety of
companies with growing markets for their products.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's economic expansion of the past decade has enabled
companies such as Hopkinton-based EMC Corp. to sell more
computer-storage systems, the Lucent Technologies Inc. plant in
North Andover to sell more telecommunications equipment,
Cambridge-based Genzyme Corp. to sell or research more drugs, and
Bedford-based Hologic Inc. to make more medical diagnostics
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   There is a shift going on, and the question is, ``Are the
industries we're shifting to more or less vulnerable?'' said Ed
Moscovitch, a consultant with Cape Ann Economics in Gloucester. ``I
think the answer is less.''
</P>
<P>
   By expanding into more world markets, manufacturers such as
Nypro Inc. have protected themselves against swings in domestic
sales, economists said. In Central Massachusetts, Nypro uses
refined processes to make small plastic parts. On a walk through
the spotless plant in Clinton with Brian Jones, president of North
American operations, row upon row of injection-molding machines
could be seen spitting out aqua razor holders for Gillette, black
computer keypads for Dell, green printer cartridges for
Hewlett-Packard Co., champagne-colored cell phone cases for
Ericcson, and dozens more products. Plastics, Jones said, ``is one
of the vital industries in Massachusetts, which people in Boston
don't really know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nypro's sales are soaring 30 percent a year as worldwide demand
for plastics has grown. Jones joined Nypro in 1987, when it had 320
employees in Clinton. Today there are 1,100. Globally, the company
employs 6,000, with plants opening in China, Mexico, the Dominican
Republic, and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, exports of Massachusetts-made goods have almost
doubled, to $18.2 billion last year, according to the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. After financial turmoil in Asia cut state
exports sharply in 1998, new buyers from Mexico and Latin America
are restoring trade nearly to levels prior to Asia's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Goods being exported are changing, said Andre Mayer of the
Alliance for the Commonwealth, a business organization: In 1987,
computer equipment was the state's leading export. Last year, the
top exports were electronic and electrical equipment used in
telecommunications, computer data storage, stereos, and computer
modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more diversified in terms of the products we export and
in terms of the markets we're exporting to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite major restructuring of Massachusetts' economy, it can
never be immune.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic economists acknowledge that the state _
like the nation _ is exhibiting signs of unsustainable growth,
because of a tight job market that is pushing up wages. An economy
cannot really grow ``too fast'' when that growth translates to job
creation and better pay. But, unusually fast growth results in
unhealthy imbalances that lead to a hard landing rather than a soft
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to puncture US consumer confidence and curtail
inflation, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has boosted
interest rates five times since last summer. Another increase is
expected at the Fed's meeting Tuesday as the economy charges ahead
unabated.
</P>
<P>
   During the boom of the past nine years, Massachusetts has not
seen the galloping growth of the miracle years. The question for
economists is whether the state has a solid foundation to withstand
a sudden shock.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to boom-bust theories, pessimists such as Birch,
president of Cognetics Inc., an economics consulting firm, argue
that Massachusetts is more at risk of collapse than the country as
a whole because of its too-heavy reliance on the securities
business _ Fidelity Investments, for example, is approaching $1
trillion in managed assets _ and a proliferation of dot-coms funded
by stock-market gains.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up activity reached a frenzy in 1999 as the Nasadaq
climbed 86 percent and 36 companies in Massachusetts went public.
Employment by the software and technology services is 156,600, or
two-thirds bigger than it was in the mid-1980s, according to RFA
Dismal Sciences, a West Chester, Pa., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think is driving all the job growth and business
spending and advertising and the money flowing into retail and the
homes being bought?'' asked RFA's chief economist, Mark Zandi.
``Initial public offerings and exercise of stock options and
venture capital money coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Case, of Wellesley College, sees a key difference between
the current boom and the 1980s boom: Although real estate prices
have risen sharply recently, there has not been the speculation
that occurred statewide in the 1980s when there was an ``overhang''
in excess commercial space and ``everything that breathed'' had
been converted to condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, bad loans brought Boston's banks to their knees,
deepening Massachusetts' slump, which was its worst recession since
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Case said, he can detect some ``speculative euphoria in
markets like Cambridge and the western suburbs.'' But he added that
he is ``pretty convinced'' there is not a speculative bubble in the
Massachusetts real estate market _ not yet, anyway.

 LAS VEGAS: ... greatest truth.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ghost seems to float over Binion's Horseshoe poker room, the
ghost of Stu Ungar, the 1997 World Series champion. Player after
player tells stories of Ungar, and many concur that he was the best
no-limit Texas Hold'em player ever.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not that Ungar won $1.1 million in the 1997 World
Series and two months later was broke, for those
rags-to-riches-to-rags stories are common in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not even that Ungar was a crack cocaine addict, for
that also is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   It is just the combination of them all, just the odds of it all
happening to this 5-foot-6-inch man who weighed 135 pounds in his
good times and 95 pounds in his bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ungar's father was a bookmaker and bar owner on the Lower East
Side of Manhattan. By the age of 14, Ungar had quit school and won
$10,000 off some of New York City's better gin rummy players. In a
matter of days, Ungar had lost the $10,000 betting on the horses at
Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling or no schooling, Ungar had the gift that all great
poker players must have, either by nature or by training, the
ability to compute instantly the odds of a given card up.
</P>
<P>
   Ungar won the World Series of Poker in 1980, when he was 27, and
again in 1981, truly the best in the world. He once tried to take
up golf. A friend brought him to a course for the first time,
stopping off at the putting green for some instruction. Ungar never
made it to the first tee. With a putter in hand for the first time
in his life, he began betting his friend $200 a putt, then it was
up to $400 a putt, and soon $800. By the time he had walked off the
first putting green he had ever been on, Ungar had lost $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and gambling brought him to the depths, so much so that
when the 1997 World Series began, Ungar was broke and had to be
staked the $10,000 buy-in. But with hundreds of opponents gone by
tournament's end, the gaunt Ungar, wearing jeans, a pair of $25
shoes, and blue granny sunglasses, raised his opponent twice,
$800,000 on the final raise on the final hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ungar's style, betting aggressively to tremble the knees
of opponents. His favorite saying was, ``Always remember this: Lots
of guys will fire one shell, but not very many will fire two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two remaining cards in the deck could give him victory. A
deuce turned up, Ungar drawing to an inside straight and winning
$1,066,000. ``This was the best I ever played,'' said Ungar then.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1998 tourney came around, Ungar could not defend his
title. He was in an upstairs hotel room at Binion's, trembling in
the dark, unable to come downstairs to the poker room when the
tournament director intoned, ``Shuffle up and deal.'' The drugs had
done their deed.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Stu Ungar was found dead in his bed in a motel
room on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest,'' said Jim Boyd, another of the better
poker pros. ``Maybe not the greatest all-around poker player, but
absolutely the best at No-Limit Hold'Em (a game that allows any
amount of money to be bet, often huge amounts). Stu Ungar was
fearless _ but he had so many dark sides to him.''

   The attorney and business manager for the Grateful Dead slips
into a seat in the Binion's restaurant now taken over by poker
players nourishing themselves for the rigors of the day's deals,
now only minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Kant, Harvard Law School '58, relates a fascinating
curriculum vitae, growing up in the Bronx, graduating from City
College of New York, getting a Ph.D in psychology at Penn State,
``becoming chief psychologist in the Army'' and finally getting his
law degree from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   And here Kant was, sitting in Binion's Horseshoe. The odyssey
from the Bronx to Binion's began early, ``when I cut 40 percent of
my classes at DeWitt Clinton High School (in the Bronx) to play
poker, and I'd go to a clubhouse in a cellar of a tenement house.
It was penny poker, you know, playing against kids. You'd get half
the pot for the highest spade and half the pot for the winning
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   With Harvard degree in hand, Kant headed to San Francisco, where
he was a clerk for the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Once in law
practice, he noticed, ``The only attorneys in the music business
were the attorneys for the record companies and their job was to
get as much money as they could for their company and leave as
little as possible for the artists,'' he said. ``I decided, maybe
the other guys should have an attorney, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kant saw the opportunity, the Grateful Dead saw the
possibilities, and Kant, Jerry Garcia, and friends were united. In
business as well as in friendship, Kant making millions for the
Dead and the Dead ``coming to my poker tournaments and rooting me
on. They were always behind me. That meant a lot to me, that they
were there to see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kant ``started playing casino poker in 1984 and I started
winning small tournaments.'' He then won a bigger tournament and
took the winnings to Las Vegas and the World Series in 1986. Kant
did well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a shock _ it was unreal,'' said Kant. ``If I win
it now, it would be more impressive than winning it then, because
now I know what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   He has come close in various events, winning once, finishing
second twice and also third, once winning $98,000, and, as all of
the poker players do, he instantly goes into replay mode, repeating
exactly from years ago the play of the hands that finished him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a function of my personality,'' said Kant of his
grim ``beats,'' losing when winning seemed so sure. ``But I can't
forget the beats. The winners? I can't remember them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His lifelong love of poker, though, may be waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament is long and I'm getting old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Kant was saying this came the announcement that the
games were to begin. Cards were about to be shuffled. Kant leaped
from his restaurant seat. His eyes were sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   Another two-day poker game was about to begin, this game Texas
Hold'Em with the size of the bets limited to the money in the pot.
More than 100 men and women paid $3,000; Kant did not make it to
the final table.

<P>
   ``Oklahoma Johnny'' Hale was off to the side in the big room,
autographing copies of his book, ``Gentleman Gambler,'' signing
each the same way: ``Stay Lucky'' and then his signature, ``Ok
Johnny Hale,'' and laughing when reminded that Hale often would
have a stack of books under the green felt table when he'd be
playing, instantly willing to oblige any who might want to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Johnny Hale is from that wilder frontier age of poker,
when huge sums of money would be wagered in ``private'' games, the
law to be reckoned with during the game and the lawless after the
game, when the fear of a big winner being hijacked at a dark
crossroads was real.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hale, 72, was into his tale of how he was snowed in at
Stapleton International Airport in Denver 32 years ago and marooned
with him was Benny Binion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benny wanted to have a game at his casino but Mrs. Binion
wouldn't let him have a poker game regularly,'' Hale said. ``She
didn't believe in poker. Obviously she had waited up too many
nights for Benny to come home, but she wouldn't allow him to have a
poker room in the Horseshoe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Binion had the idea of one big game, bringing together the
country's best. He invited Hale to Las Vegas to play in the first
World Series 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benny was such a promoter,'' said Hale, ``and he started off
with the original crowd: Nick `The Greek' Dandalos, `Amarillo Slim'
Preston, Johnny Moss, Puggy Pearson, Titanic Thompson, and several
others. And it grew and grew from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The best player he ever locked chips with, said Hale, was Doyle
``Texas Dolly'' Brunson. Why? ``Doyle has courage. He'd make two
bets without looking at his hands, then he'd look at his hand and
see if he'd bet you a third time or not. You see, 96 or 97 percent
of the time, the bet wins the pot. Doyle had immense courage. He
won the World Series once with a 10-deuce off-suit.'' In other
words, a horrible hand.
</P>
<P>
   But, Oklahoma Johnny went on, ``Amarillo Slim is the best
psychologist. Slim's nonstop chatter all has a purpose and he could
interview you and know whether you've got (expletive) on your boots
or not. If you nod to him, he knows what that means, if you shake
your head he knows that that means. He has an immense read on your
poise and your inclinations, how you sit, the way you move. Slim is
the best reader of emotions and the voice.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Hale put it, ``If Slim gets you to talk, you can't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nearly 200 players paid $2,500 to play in a game of
Omaha with the bets set at pot limit. The total prize pool was
$487,500, and Preston made it to the final table. In 30 years of
playing in the World Series, no player had ever beaten him at a
final table, not ``Texas Dolly'' Brunson, not Johnny Chan, not
Johnny Moss, not Phil Hellmuth, not even Dave ``The Devilfish''
Ulliott, poker's bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting at that final table was Phillip Ivey, a 23-year-old
African-American from New York City, ``the Tiger Woods of poker,''
as Burgio described the phenom. It seemed a mismatch, the
71-year-old legend with four of Benny Binion's gold World Series
bracelets against a new kid.
</P>
<P>
   For six hours, Amarillo Slim chatted and chatted, but the
youngster barely talked. When the final table was down to a final
handful, one of the players suggested splitting the pot, but Ivey
would have none of it. Eventually, the poker gods smiled and Ivey
drew a flush and then drew a straight, taking top prize of
$195,000, leaving Preston with $97,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very wise young man,'' Hale said of Ivey, ``not
talking to Slim. I used to think Slim could get anybody to talkin'.
I reckon I was wrong.''

AFTER FAILED DEAL, DAVIS PERSEVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A career salesman, Lycos chief executive Bob Davis is still
dogged by the one that got away.
</P>
<P>
   In the highest profile moment of his high-profile career, Davis
couldn't persuade shareholders last year to go along with a merger
between new-fangled Lycos and old-school USA Networks. Instead, he
took a heap of abuse when Wall Street turned its back on his vision
of the Internet's future.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Lycos lost a third of their value in the week after
the deal was announced last February. Before the merger was
scrapped two months later, at least 18 shareholder lawsuits were
filed and Davis was pilloried both online and in the financial
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was assailed from every corner when that deal was
announced,'' said Pat Marshall, president of GTE New Media
Services, a Lycos business partner. ``He knew through it all that
he was right and the critics were wrong, but he still agonized over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Boston-born dealmaker is finding the reaction more to
his liking after unveiling the Lycos merger with Terra Networks SA.
This time, Wall Street is cheering.
</P>
<P>
   After word leaked out about the impending merger, Lycos shares
jumped more than 34 percent over the first two days of trading this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Davis is a great CEO,'' said Andrea Williams Rice, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. ``He's got a bit of a street
fighter mentality in him, which serves him particularly well during
tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis comes by his resolve naturally, if not his role as an
e-commerce visionary.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in Boston's Dorchester section, the son of a
lawyer and a homemaker. One parent passed away while Davis attended
Boston College High School, and the other while he was at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he graduated summa cum laude from Northeastern
University, and went on to earn an MBA from Babson College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob grew up in a very difficult environment, and it taught him
how to survive and win and grow and compete,'' said Dan Nova, a
Lycos board member and former Davis colleague at Wang Labratories.
``Looking back, I think it shaped him in some positive ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was attracted to high-tech companies from his early days
at Northeastern, when he spent three months as an intern at an IBM
sales office in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM refused to hire him as a salesman after he graduated in
1979, Davis took a sales job at General Electric. Before long, he
landed a job at Wang, where he hawked computers for the next 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he outmaneuvered his former bosses at IBM to get Wang's
first contract with the Stop &AMP; Shop supermarket chain. When Wang
executives tried to back out of the deal, Davis went back and
convinced them it was the right move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tends to fight the hardest when the odds are against him,''
Nova said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who became Lycos's first employee in 1995, appears to
have the odds with him in the latest deal. Though it still has to
clear regulatory and shareholder hurdles, the announcement met with
generally positive reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on both sides of the Atlantic want this deal to
happen,'' said Bear Stearns analyst Jeffrey Fieler. ``The numbers
are better than a year ago (for Lycos shareholders), and the timing
is indubitably better.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger between Lycos and USA Networks came at a
time when Internet stocks were soaring, and investors couldn't
imagine why Davis would want to weigh down the high-tech venture
with an old-line media company.
</P>
<P>
   The mood had changed by this January, though, when America
Online and Time Warner combined forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis saw the value in that kind of link-up before the rest of
Wall Street,'' said Rice, of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown. ``Sometimes
when you're a leader, you end up with a few arrows in your back.''

BACK TO THE CORDON BLEU 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The first time I was here it was 1972, a bleak,
drizzly, chilly winter. I was on my way to cooking school. Like any
23-year-old, I wasn't thinking about the curriculum or what I would
learn. What was on my mind was how I looked. I'd been studying
British fashion magazines. The photographs from the airport
send-off show a long black skirt and high brown suede lace-up
boots, curly hair pretty much standing straight up, and huge
circles of white makeup around my eyes. In short, rather than a
Carnaby Street hopeful, I looked like a young woman trying to
imitate a skunk.
</P>
<P>
   There were other girls at the Cordon Bleu School of Cookery who
worked as hard on their look, but mostly what I remember about them
was how much they laughed. The girls were fun, robust, giddy
(picture Fergie before Weight Watchers), well educated, and biding
their time between secondary school and university or marriage.
When I learned British accents, I realized theirs were mostly upper
crust. There were hardly any outsiders, only a couple of other
Americans and a few Australians and South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm place, even with a stern all-female staff who were
addressed _ and in turn addressed us _ as ``Miss.'' The directors,
or principals, were two formidable women who had been honored by
the queen. Aspects of the Cordon Bleu gave it the air of a serious
finishing school. A brilliant film director couldn't have come up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure why I was expecting to find those girls when I
recently returned to the Cordon Bleu. Not only were they gone, but
so were the jolly English voices. In fact, except for the staff's,
there were hardly any British accents. Certainly, the passage of 30
years has brought all kinds of changes to the food industry.
Celebrity chefs are making small fortunes on restaurant empires,
and as the industry grows, there isn't enough talent to go around.
</P>
<P>
   So the serious young men and women who populate the school
today, some who paid $27,000 for the nine-month grand diplome
degree, are virtually guaranteed jobs when they return home _ to
more than 50 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Cordon Bleu School of Cookery changed hands in 1990, when it
was purchased by Andre Cointreau, of the Cointreau and Remy Martin
families, and renamed Le Cordon Bleu. Six years earlier, Cointreau
had bought Le Cordon Bleu de Paris, at a moment when it had so
deteriorated it hardly resembled the place where Julia Child had
learned to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the purchase, the London school underwent a massive
renovation, in which the dozens of tiny cooking stations and
partitions _ essentially miniature home kitchens _ were replaced
with big, airy rooms filled with shiny stainless equipment. The
students call the teacher ``chef,'' follow a classic French
curriculum, and learn complicated sugar work.
</P>
<P>
   Cointreau's wife, Hedwige Cointreau de Bouteville, owns Pierre
Deux, the expensive Provencal home furnishings company. ``A lovely
link for us,'' says Lesley Gray, who was principal at the time of
the sale and stayed on with the new regime. She had been a teacher
when I was there. She seems old-school (even though we are about
the same age, she is so proper that I have to keep myself from
calling her ``Miss Gray''). But she talks new-school.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cointreau, Le Cordon Bleu is ruthlessly entrepreneurial.
The staid 67-year-old institution whose girls catered the
coronation lunch for Queen Elizabeth II _ and invented ``Coronation
Chicken,'' made with curried mayonnaise _ now capitalizes on its
name. Le Cordon Bleu participates in advertising endorsements and
commercial promotions. It seems to churn out cookbooks. Besides
Paris and London, other schools are located in Ottawa, Tokyo, and
Sydney. There are also partnerships at some American culinary
schools in California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culinary institutes are expensive to run,'' says Gray, by way
of explaining the publishing ventures and ``co-branding,'' the word
she uses for the school's collaboration with food and equipment
companies. ``At the end of the day, you want to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tokyo Cordon Bleu, there is a ``Sabrina'' course, named
for the popular 1954 movie in which Audrey Hepburn comes home from
cooking school in Paris having learned to crack open an egg with
one hand. Five Sabrina books published by the Cordon Bleu (in
Japanese) sell briskly.
</P>
<P>
   The London school used to require an interview, though
exceptions were made for the few foreigners. Now all the students
are foreigners. ``Today it's all done by letter,'' says Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Students come from everywhere. A dozen foreign languages are
spoken into cell phones on the front curb. Students have to cram
their conversations in before class, since a sign inside reads:
``Attention Everybody. Please note that before entering this
demonstration room, all mobile telephones must be switched off.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones were a problem, Gray tells me. Even after the sign
went up, someone's phone rang one day during a cooking
demonstration. The ringing was coming from the front of the class.
</P>
<P>
   It was the chef's. He was the only person who hadn't seen the
notice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth R. and Philip
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Poole-Gleed, a hip 36-year-old Londoner who worked for
several years for the Roux brothers, famous French-born English
restaurateurs, is typical of today's Cordon Bleu chefs. He's a good
teacher, at ease with all sorts of techniques, including pastry and
elaborate garnishes. On the day of my visit, he makes warm oysters
with a sherry cream glaze, sea bass fillets with crispy potato
scales and an orange butter sauce, and tartlets filled with red
currants, praline, and meringue. The students take copious notes
because they are about to go into the kitchens and repeat the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The room is decorated with huge cutout photos of beautifully
garnished dinner plates. We can watch Poole-Gleed on one of two
television monitors or simply look up into a 7-foot overhead mirror
that reflects the cooktops beneath it. When he finishes cooking, an
office assistant swoops in and takes the food to a corner, where a
photography table is already set up. She snaps a picture of each
plate before giving it back to the students to sample.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall in the conference room on the top floor of the Cordon
Bleu hangs founder Rosemary Hume's Member of the British Empire
citation, signed ``Elizabeth R.'' and ``Philip.'' Gray and I have
stopped here to look at the school's many books. I'm interested in
what the school used to be like, but she keeps emphasizing that
it's important to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She talks about the awards her chefs receive, how they come from
all the top restaurants and hotels, including the Dorchester and
Claridge's. Keeping abreast of trends is one of her concerns.
``You've got to be aware of what's going on in the food world,''
she tells me.
</P>
<P>
   When I ask how she likes Morro, the young, packed restaurant I'd
been to the night before, she doesn't know it. Gray seems to keep
track of certain distinguished dining rooms and prides herself on
sending students there. ``They're desperate to find good staff,''
she says. A student who went to Claridge's did so well that the
chef asked Gray, ``Can you get me 20 more like that?''
</P>
<P>
   She can, she says, but few students have working visas, and
restaurants aren't willing to process papers for them. Gray has
just learned about a job opening at Kensington Palace, one of the
royal households, and she wonders if she has anyone to offer it to.
</P>
<P>
   Because the London curriculum is tied to the other Cordon Bleu
schools, students can take courses at any of the locations. So they
can begin, say, in London, and then head for Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I did.

ENVISION STOCK VALUED HIGHLY, BUT WORTH IS LESS CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What exactly is Envision Development Corp. and why is it worth a
half-billion dollars?
</P>
<P>
   These are no simple questions. Envision, based in Marlborough,
Mass., has lived through a striking number of strange twists and
turns in its eight-month life as a public company. We'll describe
them, then you decide what the stock is worth.
</P>
<P>
   Envision hit the public market just last September under a
different name and headquarters city, then called perfumania.com
and based in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, the renamed company had been transformed
into a self-described emerging leader in new Internet technologies
with a thinly traded stock. But if you would expect shares like
that to get clobbered in the spring technology stock plunge, think
again: Envision shares gained 24.4 percent while the Nasdaq index
plummeted 34.2 percent between March 10 and April 14.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Envision was a ten-bagger for IPO investors, rising
from its initial price of $7 per share to $74.50 seven months
later, in late April. Even with a signficant price slide over the
last week, Envision still ranks as the fifth best-performing public
stock in Massachusetts so far this year, according to Bloomberg
News. Total market value: $496 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ``breakthrough technology'' promotion, Envision has
never publicly reported a dime of revenue from anything other than
the sale of discounted, brand-name perfume over the Internet. And
just this week, Envision said it sold the perfume business back to
its creators in a deal whose terms the company declined to
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Envision has revealed its relationship with only two
technology customers: M/A-Com Inc., the Lowell, Mass. subsidiary of
Tyco International Ltd. and Complete Wellness Centers Inc. of
Winter Park, Fla., a struggling operator of medical centers with a
total public stock market value of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Envision chief executive William Patch said the company was
working for multiple financial service clients but declined to
identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Envision executives said they are working on several
Internet-related technologies, emphasizing products that improve
access to corporate Web sites via wireless devices,
voice-over-Internet services, and secure document and information
exchange over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have aggregated and continue to develop significant
breakthrough technologies,'' Patch said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most newly public companies, Envision received some support
from stock analysts employed by the investment banking firms that
underwrote its IPO: Cruttenden Roth, Pennyslvania Merchant Group
Ltd., and Boston's H.C. Wainwright.
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright analyst Georgia Kounadis stood head and shoulders
above anyone else when it came to her enthusiasm for Envision,
reiterating her ``buy'' recommendation seven times so far this
year. But she cut her rating of Envision to ``accumulate'' on
Monday, just three trading days after her most recent ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   When we reached Kounadis on Monday and said we were interested
in her Envision recommendations, she told us she had to take
another call and would phone us back. We haven't heard from her
since.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Cruttenden Roth that led the IPO of perfumania.com
last Sept. 29, raising $16 million by selling 2.5 million shares.
Perfumania Inc., the Miami-based bricks-and-mortar fragrance
retailer that created the online business, sold 1 million shares of
its Web company for cash at the same time but continued to own
about half the newly public company.
</P>
<P>
   Who owned what became more complicated after that.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, a firm called Dominion Income Management Corp. of
Mill Creek, Wash., surfaced as the owner of 1.55 million
perfumania.com shares. It owned nearly half of all the publicly
traded stock and appeared to have acquired it all on the day of the
IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger ownership changes took place by Jaunary. Alta Ltd.,
a trust with a mailing address in the Jersey islands, had exercised
an option to buy 2 million shares of the Internet company from
Perfumania Inc. for $6 each. It still held options to buy an
additional 500,000 shares for $8.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more: Dominion Income Management and Alta Ltd.
soon turned over all their stock to Zero.net, a San Francisco
venture capital firm that has invested in a series of young
technology companies. Just like that, Zero.net emerged as the owner
of a 35.6 percent interest in perfumania.com.
</P>
<P>
   Who are all these people? Jake Weinstock, the 28-year-old chief
executive of Zero.net, describes Dominion as a low-key private
money manager that had owned his venture firm and Alta as a
European private investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was plenty of other action at perfumania.com,
which has been buying privately technology companies it describes
as building blocks for its new corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It agreed to buy Envision Development, a professional services
business in Marlborough and renamed the entire company after its
acquisition. Envision bought QVtech and its Interosa e-mail
security product in a stock swap that appeared to be worth
something north of $100 million. This month, Envision bought LiQ
Inc. and its voice-over-Internet products.

   This week, Envision announced the sale of its perfume business
back to Perfumania Inc. Where's the revenue going to come from now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Other revenue streams are in line as soon as our acquisitions
are completed, then we can begin reporting those revenues,'' Patch
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Envision's remarkable stock resilience this year, at
least before it shed 25 percent of its value in the last week,
Patch credited investors who understood plans to roll out all the
company's new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being bought and held by people who understand where
we're going, not so much where we've been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We'll just wait and watch.

INTERNET FIRMS, TRADITIONAL COMPANIES THRIVNG SIDE BY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The old economy and new economy are thriving, side by
side, in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The old-new distinction, though cliched, continues to be used by
the news media and analysts as shorthand for the myriad ways in
which selling a tangible product to consumers differs from luring
eyeballs to a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay State, ``We have both worlds coexisting,'' said Joyce
Plotkin, president of the Massachusetts Software and Internet
Council. And both are driving the state's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that she is not an economist, Plotkin said technology
has brought ``fundamental change'' to the US economy. ``The good
news is Massachusetts is one of the places leading the change.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, new-economy stars are sprinkled
among the Fortune 500 companies in The Boston Globe's annual
ranking of Massachusetts' publicly traded companies, based on
various performance measures.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-market value of start-up Internet companies _ some
public for a year or less _ rocketed to heights that rival those of
Massachusetts' stalwarts. For instance, CMGI Inc.'s value had
soared to $31.7 billion as of March 31 _ fourth behind EMC Corp.,
Gillette Co., and FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Created by entrepreneur David Wetherell as a way to market to
college students, Andover-based CMGI was transformed into an
Internet investment firm, and Wetherell's name became synonymous
with the new economy. While its stock leaped, Wetherell's company
earned far less last year than did EMC, Gillette, or FleetBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Standard-bearers of the old economy such as Eaton Vance Corp.,
DeWolfe Cos., Staples Inc., and Talbots Inc. were prominent names
in the main Globe 100 ranking of companies, those which
demonstrated the best financial performance last year. These
old-fashioned companies sell or make things _ mutual funds and real
estate, paper clips, and smart, conservative clothing _ and earn
hearty profits doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But even the line separating old from new is beginning to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Brick-and-mortar companies, under pressure from online retailers
with aggressive advertising strategies, turned to the Internet last
year. Framingham-based Staples, for example, offers a Web site,
Staples.com, to boost sales. EatonVance.com provides investors with
quick access to their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And many old-line companies are increasingly doing business over
the Internet with their suppliers. While invisible to customers and
clients, these activities are helping to bring the two economies
together.
</P>
<P>
   Change has been quickest in the technology industry, though.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts last year, 36 mostly high-tech companies went
public in an initial public offering market that had achieved
record volume before Thanksgiving. According to CNet News.com, 370
initial public offerings by US technology companies raised about
$39.6 billion last year _ $10 billion more than was raised by
nontech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after going public, some high-flying, money-losing
companies in Massachusetts had grown to outsized proportions: Five
months after selling its first stock in October 1999,
Chelmsford-based Sycamore Networks Inc.'s market value had soared
to $30.5 billion on March 31. Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge
went public around the same time, its value leaping to $14.9
billion by March 31. Both companies provide Internet software, and
neither is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Another money-loser that rode the technology boom last year was
Andover-based Engage Technologies Inc., an online marketing firm
that offered its stock in July. Its worth on March 31: $4.1
billion. Allaire Corp., a Cambridge Web company, eked out a $1
million profit in the fourth quarter of last year. Its worth in the
stock market 15 months after selling shares to investors: $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Nasdaq Composite index has dropped into
bear-market territory, causing the stock of fragile start-ups to
sink 30 percent or more from their March highs. Fred Breimyer,
chief economist at State Street Corp., said such risks to investors
are a cost of innovation, which has fueled economic change
throughout Massachusetts' history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pitfalls we've seen in other times is that
investors infuse (new technology) with great valuations, only to
find out they can't earn the returns implicit in those
valuations,'' Breimyer said. ``That was true of the railroads in
the 1840s _ people got carried away and were impacted negatively.
That could happen here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dazzle of Internet stocks, hundreds of Massachusetts
technology companies are making profits. Technology, investment,
and consumer businesses _ all three played a role in an economic
expansion that has driven the state's unemployment rate down, to
2.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented increases in the stock market last year helped a
low-profile mutual fund manager in Boston ascend to number one
among Globe 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   (Globe 100 companies are ranked by a composite score based on
sales volume in 1999, return on average equity, and one-year change
in revenue and profit margin.)
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance, which has $44 billion in assets under management,
is smaller than Boston mutual fund behemoths such as Fidelity
Investments and Putnam Investments. But Eaton Vance proved agile in
a strong market, and avid investor interest boosted its 1999
revenue almost 40 percent, to nearly $360 million. It posted a 47
percent return on equity _ the second-highest for any public
company in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Other top performers were Massachusetts retailers and consumer
products companies. Numerous retailers improved their position in
The Globe 100 rankings over the previous year, at a time when US
consumer confidence had reached all-time highs: BJ's Wholesale Club
Inc., Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, athletic shoe maker Saucony
Inc., Talbots, Neiman-Marcus Group Inc., and Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Technology names dominated The Globe 100's top five _ names that
would be unfamiliar to many consumers. Two of those companies,
Analog Devices and RSA Security Inc. (ranked second and third,
respectively) saw large increases in their profit margins last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood-based Analog Devices improved its profit picture amid an
explosion in sales of its computer chips used in wireless
communication systems. Bedford-based RSA Security altered its
mission to keep pace with the demands of the Internet age,
expanding its security services to e-commerce applications.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, a standout for several years, ranked fourth in The Globe
100. The Hopkinton maker of computer-storage systems continued to
deliver strong profits in 1999; net income has tripled in four
years. Revenue last year grew 23 percent, no small feat for a
Fortune 500 company that sold $6.7 billion worth of its
refrigerator-sized boxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth behind EMC was Needham-based Brooktrout Inc., which
provides hardware and software used in transmitting data and voice.
The company boosted its profit margin amid a 40 percent increase in
revenue. Brooktrout and RSA Security are two examples of existing
technology companies that are adapting to breathtaking change in
their industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay State has ``spawned a lot of new companies with
innovations and new ideas,'' Plotkin said. ``That's the strength of
Massachusetts.''

BOSTON, SOUTH AFRICA FIGURE IN IRISH ROAD TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Three months ago, after the British government pulled
the plug on the power-sharing local government in Northern Ireland,
the mood in Belfast was gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting thousands of miles away in Johannesburg, Sathyandranath
``Mac'' Maharaj did not share that gloom. Maharaj had been in
Belfast in the days leading up to the suspension of the elected
assembly, trying to persuade Irish republicans and pro-British
unionists to compromise. But they couldn't, and the most hopeful
attempt yet to transform Northern Ireland into a peaceful,
democratic society was put in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   While almost everyone wondered whether the peace process could
survive the political inertia and personal recrimination that
followed, Maharaj sat across from Cyril Ramaphosa, his old friend
and comrade in the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he told Ramaphosa, ``is soluble.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Africans have always had more faith in Northern
Ireland's politicians than the politicians had in themselves, and
for nearly a decade South Africans have been trying to help bring
about peace. Just Monday, Ramaphosa arrived in Belfast after
agreeing to serve as one of the two inspectors who will certify the
Irish Republican Army's weapons are ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between the two countries traces to a 1992 conference
at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, which for the first
time brought together the leading politicians of both nations. That
conference, along with later gatherings in Boston, Belfast, and
South Africa were organized by Padraig O'Malley, the Dublin-born
senior fellow at the John W. McCormack Institute of Public Affairs
at UMass.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley spent much of the 1970s and 1980s immersed in the
Troubles of his native land. His books, ``Uncivil Wars'' and
``Biting at the Grave,'' a study of the 1981 Irish republican
hunger strike, are highly regarded examinations of the conflict in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, he turned his attention to South Africa.
Nelson Mandela had been released from prison, F.W. de Klerk's
National Party was ready to deal, and the apartheid system was
about to collapse. As O'Malley saw it, if the South Africans could
bring apartheid to an end and install the black majority in a
relatively peaceful transfer of power, they could teach the Irish
and British something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I asked them if they would help. It took me a
while. I nagged them. But once the South Africans agreed to help,
there was no stopping them. They put enormous time and energy into
Northern Ireland,'' said O'Malley, who is in Belfast this week to
reassure all sides that Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari, the former
president of Finland, will be impartial inspectors of IRA weapons
dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after a brief stop in London to consult with Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Ramaphosa and Ahtisaari came to Belfast and
began meeting privately with the various parties.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC had considerable credibility with the IRA and Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing. A mural of Mandela had for years
decorated a wall across from the Falls Road office of Sinn Fein in
West Belfast. The IRA often compared its ``armed struggle'' to that
of the ANC's.
</P>
<P>
   The white Afrikaners, meanwhile, seemed to have empathy with
Protestant unionists who want to maintain the union with Britain,
sharing a siege mentality and the sense that the whole world was
biased in favor of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Roelf Meyer, the National Party's chief negotiator who
negotiated the end of apartheid with Ramaphosa, said those views
gave way over time. He said he and Ramaphosa, who traveled to
Belfast together and then hosted the Northern Ireland politicians
in South Africa in 1997, were able to impart their experiences to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are people,'' said Meyer. ``There is little
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, many people in Northern Ireland, especially the
unionists, had rejected the notion that outsiders had anything to
teach them about resolving their differences. When the South
Africans heard such talk, they nodded and smiled knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Africans kept telling the Irish, `You're not that
special.' I think it is a message they all needed to hear. If the
South Africans can get beyond their history, why can't they?''
O'Malley said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days ago, the IRA made a stunning offer aimed at pushing
along the stalled peace process. In exchange for restoring the
power-sharing government and full implementation of the Good Friday
Agreement, including reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and
scaling back British forces, the IRA said it would allow
international arms inspectors to verify that its arms dumps were
secure.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA said it intended to ``initiate a process that will
completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers were stunned by the IRA's language, which was
far more conciliatory and flexible than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that statement would not have been issued
if not for the influence of Maharaj and Ramaphosa, and if Ramaphosa
had not been chosen by the British and Irish governments as one of
the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, both Ramaphosa and Maharaj have met
with senior IRA leaders, including Brian Keenan, the Belfast IRA
commander who is considered the most influential of the
seven-member Army Council that rules the IRA. As former
revolutionaries, the South Africans command respect in the IRA.
They speak the same revolutionary jargon and harbor the same
distrust of the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Africa, Ramaphosa and Maharaj have become part of
the establishment. If the two men wielded power by holding guns
during the apartheid era, today they do so by holding seats on
various company boards of directors. Maharaj, a one-time communist,
is now a bank director. When Nelson Mandela decided that Thabo
Mbeki would succeed him as president, he told Ramaphosa to go out
and be a role model in the private sector for young blacks.
Ramaphosa did just that. He is now a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   And in Maharaj, the IRA leaders could talk to someone who once
shared their ambivalence about shutting down a paramilitary
organization and entrusting its goals to democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj served time with Mandela in the Robben Island prison,
and the two are extremely close. But even after Mandela began
negotiations with de Klerk, Maharaj continued to mount attacks
against the South African security forces. After Mandela convinced
Maharaj that continuing the violence only postponed reconciliation
with whites, Maharaj put down his weapons and became transporation
minister in Mandela's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Ramaphosa and Maharaj urged IRAleaders to be more generous with
its language. But the South Africans accepted the IRA leadership's
insistence that, given the risk of provoking a split in the IRA,
they could not make even a token gesture of turning in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's May 6 statement, crafted under the tutelage of the
ANC, was as close as IRA leaders feel they can come to saying the
war is over. And they must have taken some comfort knowing the ANC
was standing in the wings, nodding approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   While the ANC men feel more of a connection with the
republicans, it is also true that the South Africans respect the
Ulster Unionists, particularly their leader, David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   More than one ANC leader has compared Trimble to de Klerk. And
as Mandela's prickly relationship with de Klerk proved, you don't
have to like someone to respect him and do business.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago in South Africa, Mandela gave separate lectures
to the visitors from Northern Ireland because unionists refused to
sit in the same room as the republicans. He laid into the
unionists, telling them you don't make peace with your friends but
with your enemies. But he gave no comfort to the republicans,
telling them the IRA had to restore its cease-fire immediately, and
that it could not retain a private army if democracy was to take
root.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ulster Unionist Council votes Saturday to accept the IRA
offer, it would seem that Mandela's words have finally been heeded.

BEING TOO CONSERVATIVE CAN BE DANGEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I both work part time but do not rely on the
income for financial planning purposes. Our main goal is to have
enough money to live comfortably, travel a bit, and, most
important, to be able to pay for assisted living as we age. Our
annual expenses, including the various insurance payments, were
$80,000 last year, some of which represented discretionary spending
such as furniture, vacations, eating out, and so forth. We
recognize that we have become conservative. Assuming that as time
goes on our only income will be from my pension and investments,
what should we be doing differently?
</P>
<P>
   A.E., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When it comes to the matter of growing conservative as we age
_ most people do. But I like to think that some of it is a function
of our growing smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the combination of having only a little more than 14
percent of your assets in stocks, retiring quite early, and having
a pension that ends at the time of your death, whether or not your
wife remains alive, is a dangerous one. Just to give you an idea
what I am talking about, if inflation runs at an average 3.5
percent for 30 years, it will cost $224,543 to support the life
style that $80,000 buys today.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my suggestion. My calculation is that you have been using
roughly half of the yield from your various investments to augment
your pension income. What I would do is invest the remaining yield
from your various investments either in stock funds or at the
minimum in balanced funds, which hold both stocks and fixed income
investments. I would put all of your yield except what you are
using to meet your expenses in Vanguard Index Value, making the
deposits on a monthly basis so that the investment will basically
be a dollar-cost-averaging program.
</P>
<P>
   If you are leery of this program and unwilling to take the risk
of the all-stock fund, I suggest that you at least follow the same
suggestion using a proven balanced fund, such as Vanguard Balanced
Index fund or Fidelity Puritan fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Until now I have not had any savings, but now I can put away
$300 a week. I need to save for retirement but am financially
ignorant and don't know where to begin. I'm wondering if I should
have $5,000 in a savings account, put $2,000 a year in an IRA, and
put the rest in mutual funds? Should the IRA be a Roth or not?
Should I put any money in CDs? I plan on educating myself in this,
but I need to know how to get started.
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Waltham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the $5,000, which you apparently have
decided to keep in liquid savings as protection against
emergencies. That's a solid plan, but I would not leave it in bank
savings. Current savings bank rates are very low, typically around
2.5 percent, whereas you can command about twice as much interest
if you move it to a mutual fund company's money market fund. This
will not significantly reduce the liquidity, since with such
accounts you can obtain check-writing privileges that allow you
immediate access to the money. Since I'm going to suggest the
Vanguard fund family for other investments, I would take a look at
Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund for this.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that establishing an IRA would be the next move. As you
probably already know, the difference between a Roth IRA and a
traditional IRA is that the contributions to a Roth are made with
after-tax money, and when withdrawals are taken, all of the
withdrawals are tax-free _ including any investment gains you have
realized. With a traditional IRA, you get a tax deduction for the
$2,000 per year maximum contribution, but will owe taxes on the
full amount of withdrawals when they are taken. I am guessing that
since you are now able to save at a rate of $15,600 a year that you
are in a fairly high tax bracket. I am also guessing that since
your total accumulation in the fund portfolio is likely to be
$543,124 at age 65, that you will be in a lower tax bracket in
retirement. Therefore, the traditional IRA would be more
advantageous to you _ and particularly so if the up-front tax break
would allow you to save more.
</P>
<P>
   As for an investment for the IRA, I would begin with the
Vanguard Index 500 fund, which simply seeks to duplicate the
results of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. I would continue
investing there _ opening a taxable account as soon as you have
maxed out on the allowed contributions to your IRA _ until the
account reaches $10,000. At that point, I would look to gain access
to three other market segments, through the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index,
Vanguard Small-Cap Index and the Vanguard Health Care. I suggest
you eventually seek a portfolio balance that shows 50 percent in
Index 500 and 16.66 percent each in the other three funds. I'd
continue in that vein until about five years before your
anticipated retirement, then gradually reduce the risk level with
more conservative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, invest in an excellent paperback book, ``How To Buy
Stocks'' by Louis Engel and Brendan Boyd.

TWO VIEWS OF PEACE, PROSPECTS DIVIDE A GENERATION IN MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM _ Three nights a week, a disc jockey, Johnny Serani,
strips down to a tight black T-shirt and makes the floor at this
tiny dance bar come alive. He's into hip-hop and rap, and so is the
crowd, a mix of spiked heels and sneakers, tight halter tops and
button-down shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It's like any night in any bar where the crowd wants to dance
and where the lights are low, except this is a Palestinian bar and
there's an Israeli watchtower up the street, with soldiers in green
fatigues lounging against barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian youth come here to have a good time, and to forget
daily frustrations. Besides, there's the matter of an Israeli
checkpoint that stops them from trying the nightlife 15 minutes
away, in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   This is a generation that hasn't known war but that hasn't
really known peace, either, and it feels stuck in uncertainty and
the vagaries of the frequently stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is a joke; everyone knows it because you
can't have real peace while Israel still controls our land, our
economy. I feel like I live in a big prison,'' said Serani, 20,
during a break outside Memories bar in Bethlehem, an Israeli flag
fluttering just at the bend in the road.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of his, with black sunglasses pushed up over black
spiked hair, nodded. ``I just hope the peace process moves quickly
so we can get our own state and have a better life,'' said Khalid
Bahnan, a 24-year-old factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes' drive away in Jerusalem, past the Israeli
checkpoint that keeps out Palestinians who do not have the
hard-to-get permit to enter Israel, there's a bar with the same
type of pounding music and sweaty couples smoking cigarettes while
they dance.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the bar named Underground, an Israeli soldier is
dancing on a table, M-16 in hand. And that's not the only
difference: Here, there's little sense of the frustration young
Palestinians feel about the stop-and-go peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Talks now underway for a final peace agreement may be moving
slowly, but it does not make a big difference to what sort of jobs
young Israelis can find or how they will live their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something will come out of the peace talks, I am sure,
but no one will get exactly what they want. We will all have to
compromise and it won't happen tomorrow,'' said Noam Zuckerman, a
26-year-old who has his own high-tech company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the whole process does not really affect my life so
I'm not following it 100 percent,'' he added with an apologetic
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Two peoples, many views, and a stagnating peace process; this,
for the members of this region's young generation, is all that's
known. They grew up after the intifadah, or Palestinian uprising of
the late 1980s, when Israeli soldiers and Palestinians clashed
violently every day.
</P>
<P>
   They barely remember what life was like when Israel occupied the
whole of the West Bank and Gaza, and they might not even recall the
first handshake between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated two years later by
an Israeli Jew opposed to the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   For many in this generation of Israelis, the conflict with the
Palestinians often seems so muted and far away that it is hard for
them to understand why a few months, or even years, of delay in a
final settlement should concern their Palestinian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   They hardly ever come into contact with residents of the West
Bank and Gaza, who usually do not get permission to enter Israel
unless they are among the tens of thousands of workers who enter
each day as truck drivers, street sweepers, construction workers,
and manual laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers stationed in the West Bank or Gaza may
occasionally face rock-throwing demonstrators, but violence has
ebbed now that the Palestinian Authority has jurisdiction over 40
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians as well, daily life is more stable, but their
dreams of an independent state are dimming.
</P>
<P>
   The nation that Arafat had promised by last year is delayed
because of breakdowns in peace talks. Negotiations that resumed
last week to work out a frameworkfor a final agreement by Sept. 13
have been plagued by disagreements over issues such as how much
land the Palestinians will control and what to do about Jewish
settlements there.
</P>
<P>
   Economic opportunities for Palestinians are limited, and
Arafat's promises of development have been stymied by corruption in
his self-rule administration and Israeli restrictions on goods and
people entering and exiting the self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel still occupies most of the West Bank, parts of Gaza and
East Jerusalem, all of which Palestinians want for an independent
state. Jewish settlements on occupied land are still confiscating
land that Palestinians say is theirs, and are building more housing
units.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian youth, brought up amid a peace process and taught
that this would soon free them from Israeli occupation and
domination, are waiting impatiently. For many of them, each day
that goes by without a final peace deal is another day of
uncertainty about the future.

TELEFONICA CHIEF REACHES ACROSS NEW NATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To folks in its home state of Massachusetts, Lycos
Inc. is one of the jewels of the Internet industry, a symbol of the
state's claim on the electronic frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But to Madrid-based Telefonica, the Lycos buyout is one more
move on a global gameboard, another step toward turning a stodgy,
government-run telephone company into a worldwide master of many
media.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica is hardly a household name in the United States, but
the Spanish company has made waves in Europe and South America both
for its aggressive acquisition spree and the swashbuckling behavior
of its chairman, Juan Villalonga, a former member of the elite
Trilateral Commission known for rewarding himself richly and dating
a one-time Miss Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While the newly privatized phone giants of Germany and France
have focused on their home markets, Villalonga has pushed his far
smaller company to look beyond Spain to conquer new technologies
and new markets.
</P>
<P>
   He has made Telefonica a major provider of communications
services in Chile, Argentina, Peru and other nations. Most of its
markets have two characteristics in common: a government that has
opened state-run industries to new competition, and a Spanish- or
Portuguese-speaking culture that is familiar to Telefonica
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've pursued a very aggressive strategy of expanding not
only across different regions but across services _ fixed line
(local phone service), wireless, Internet. In some countries, they
have cable TV operations,'' said Jamila Xible, who follows the
Brazilian communications market for the Yankee Group, a Boston
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is not Telefonica's first Internet acquisition. The
Internet service provider it bought in Brazil has become that
country's second largest as well as a major Internet portal, Xible
said. Telefonica even reached into television production recently,
buying a Dutch maker of ``reality-based'' TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, the fact that the Spanish economy is not as
strong as Germany's or France's created a need to go international
faster than some companies from those other countries did,'' said
Robert Norcross of Mercer Management Consulting in Washington.
``Telefonica has been more successful than a lot of the larger,
potentially more advanced companies in creating an international
presence for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga, a childhood friend of the Spanish prime minister,
was picked by the government in 1996 to run Telefonica as it was
privatized. He initially won raves. The company's share price has
soared, and Telefonica was listed at 193d on last year's Fortune
Global 500 list of the world's largest companies, ahead of American
Express, Coca-Cola and MCI-Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   But Villalonga, a former McKinsey &AMP; Co. consultant, also has
stepped on some toes as he brought American-style capitalism to
Spain. He was criticized strongly for offering multimillion-dollar
stock options to himself and other Telefonica managers, a rarity in
Spain. An attempted merger with a bank sparked complaints that too
much business power would be held in too few hands.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica also created an outcry when it tried to hire the
European Union's outgoing telecommunications commissioner. The move
might have helped Telefonica expand in Europe, but rival companies
protested that the revolving door from government had spun too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga, who seldom gives interviews, was reported last year
to have left his wife and to have begun dating Mexican beauty queen
Adriana Abascal. He now spends much of his time in Miami. For
several years, he was a member of the Trilateral Commission, the
325-member, high-level foreign policy group that is a favorite
focus of conspiracy theorists. A spokesman for the commission said
he left the group last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Villalonga is sure to continue trying to buy
his way into the top ranks of telecommunications and content
companies, using the hefty cash flow that most incumbent phone
giants enjoy. The Lycos acquisition should be seen in this light,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the next deal,'' said Norcross. ``It's not that
this one is the be all and end all, but how does it make Telefonica
look for the next deal with Worldcom or AT&AMP;T or Deutsche Telekom? .
. . The idea is that if you get a good first deal, it makes you
more attractive for the second deal, and even more attractive for
the third.''

 LEARNING TO COOK: Add a Spark With Blue Cheese Crumble  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Every home cook worth his or her salt has a couple
of favorite concoctions, either in the refrigerator or cupboard,
waiting to be used in case of unexpected guests, or just to improve
a rather spartan lunch or supper.
<P>
   In days gone by, relishes, pickles and olives added sparkle to
dull fare. The Pennsylvania Dutch, for example, were masterful at
filling their tables with what was called ``sweets and sours.''
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe, Blue Cheese Crumble, is a good example of
a modern sweet-and-sour. It has won recipe contests, and is most
popular served as an hors d'oeuvre with crackers or Melba toasts.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe can play different roles, however, depending on your
need. It's delicious spooned onto grilled or pan-fried steaks or
hamburgers. The nuggets of blue cheese gradually soften and melt
over the sizzling-hot meat. There's something about beef and blue
cheese . . . they really do go together.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cheese Crumble also is brilliant as a topping for salads.
Given the ingredients _ onions, garlic, olive oil, vinegar and
lemon juice _ no wonder it's a natural with lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try serving it with sliced Granny Smith apples and your
favorite crackers as the fruit-and-cheese course to enhance a meal.
The tiny bit of garlic won't hurt the apple one bit.
</P>
<P>
   This is a perfect example of home cooking at its best. This
simple recipe can turn a so-so dish into a favorite family meal.
One word of warning, however, be sure to try just a little sample
of Blue Cheese Crumble on whatever dish you wish to improve to see
if it blends well.

   &QL; 
BLUE CHEESE CRUMBLE
</P>
<P>
   This is from Sharon Kramis, a great Seattle cook.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped red onion, or chopped green onions (also called
scallions)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground pepper (start by adding 1/2 teaspoon
and taste to see if this is enough for you)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the cheese, garlic and onion:  &LR; If you buy a solid
block of blue cheese instead of the crumbled style, it is very easy
to crumble. Use the large holes on a box grater; the bits of cheese
should come out about the size of corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the papery skin from the garlic cloves and slice each
clove in half lengthwise, then slice each half lengthwise into
little strips. Hold the strips together and cut into small pieces
crosswise. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the papery outer skin from a red onion. Cut the onion
into little pieces in the same way you cut up the garlic cloves.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the blue cheese crumble: &LR;  Sprinkle the crumbled
cheese in an even layer into a shallow 8- or 9-inch dish. Mix
together the garlic and olive oil and sprinkle over the cheese. Put
the vinegar and lemon juice into a small bowl and stir to mix. Stir
in the red onion, parsley and pepper; spread all over the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.
</P>
<P>
   This keeps well for at least 1 week, stored in a covered jar in
the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Yields a generous 21/2 cups.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics. 
 
 WINE POTPOURRI: England, Australia Can Teach the U.S. Some Wine 
 Sense   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the late 1960s, when my interest in wine was
beginning to develop, I became a collector before taking up
writing. Later, writing became a way for me to share my passion for
wine with others.
<TEXT>
<P>
   My goal then and now was to educate and inform readers about
wine, not to sell wine. It's an iffy position because some people
dismiss wine writers as merely publicists for the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I bristle when I read edicts from political hacks
who worry more about politics than any purported health threat
posed by consuming alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher threw up
another wall against efforts to convince Americans that an
occasional drink will not lead to ill health and ruin. Satcher
worries that the new labels on wine bottles proposed by the wine
industry, which urge consumers to learn more about the health
effects of wine, will instead encourage ``irresponsible drinking.''
And he adds weight to his argument by citing statistics about
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol abuse is a serious problem and should not be taken
lightly. But anybody who wants to get blitzed doesn't do it with
wine. This is especially true for underage drinkers. Few of the
teens who believe that drunkenness is cool are forking out $15 to
$35 for a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, when the interest in wine exploded, industry
prognosticators predicted that annual per capita wine consumption
would hit 10 gallons by 1990 or, at the latest, by 2000. But
American wine drinkers never broke the three-gallon-per-year mark.
And if politicians continue to inflict their personal agendas on
everyone else, interested consumers will never be able to reap the
benefits of a fully-supported industry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why Not in California? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While I'm grousing, two other items about public and government
support of wine came to my attention. A recent travel story about
what to see in London mentioned the new Vinopolis, an
``edutainment'' site on the banks of Thames devoted to the world's
wine regions, including Napa and Sonoma. Vinopolis offers lectures
about wine, and visitors can also taste and purchase wine.
Congratulations to the forward-thinking Londoners who came up with
the idea, an admirable achievement especially since England, unlike
California, doesn't have a large commercial wine industry to
promote. Also, it would seem that the Vinopolis organizers didn't
have to worry about neo-prohibitionists fretting that such a public
display of wine as a beverage to be enjoyed in moderation with food
would somehow undermine all that is good about English society.
</P>
<P>
   The other item, from Australia, heralds the opening of The
National Wine Centre in Adelaide's Botanic Gardens. Visitors can
sample wines from more than 50 Australian growing areas, visit a
wine tourism information center and purchase wine. The centre is
funded jointly by the state and national government and the
Australian wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture between government and private industry to
promote wine can demonstrate to an unwilling California wine
industry, too busy flogging their own brands, that it's beneficial
to join together, with or without government help, to promote the
idea of enjoying wine in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Looking into the Future &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Monterey County vintners have had their ups and downs over the
years, but grape growers and winemakers are very excited over the
future of the county's Syrah and Pinot Noir. Paraiso Springs, for
one, has made major changes on its 400-acre Santa Lucia Highlands
estate, removing Gewurztraminer and Pinot Blanc and planting more
Syrah and Pinot Noir. When finished the estate vineyard will
comprise 65 acres of Chardonnay, 75 acres of Pinot Noir, 20 acres
of Syrah and a little Riesling and Souzao, a Portuguese variety
used for Port.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Montage's Sprightly Salad   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Pairing fruit and savory ingredients is a
difficult challenge and, frankly, not many chefs are good at it.
Without the proper balance, the flavors clash and the dish becomes
one-dimensional.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fortunately Jennifer Cox, chef of Montage in the Sony Metreon,
has the gift. There are several examples on her seasonal menu, but
my favorite is a salad of juicy strawberries and peppery
watercress. The pairing is accented by toasted almonds and creamy
 &LR; fromage blanc &LR; , a mild soft white cheese with a slightly tangy
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Montage looks kind of like a 1990s supper club. There's not a
straight wall in the entire restaurant. Three rows of booths
separated by 5-foot-high partitions appear to stair-step up, thanks
to the soffit ceiling. The artwork on the curved walls consists of
gold-framed video screens that project moving abstract images, as
well as artwork on loan from the Museum of Modern Art, located
close to the Metreon.
</P>
<P>
   The huge shopping complex with a host of restaurants, video
games, virtual bowling and high-tech shop, such as Microsoft's
first retail store, is Sony's answer to our digital society.
Fortunately, this cool countenance doesn't translate to Cox's food.
You could grab a vitamin shake or pop a pill, but Cox has a
refreshing, soulful California style that is soothing after a
grueling day of virtual games.

&HT;     AS SUMMER BECKONS, SO DOES HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer, in case the long, cold winter left forgetfulness in its
wake, means two things. One is barbecuing. The other is movies.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar tells us it isn't summer yet, of course. For that,
we have to wait until June 21, a disheartening four weeks off. But
Hollywood has different ideas about the tilt of Earth and the
passage of time, and for its purposes (not to mention ours), the
hot season has already arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It came with ``Gladiator.'' It comes again with ``Mission:
Impossible 2,'' due for release May 24. It comes with every
mega-mondo tub of popcorn doused with extra butter _ or whatever
that stuff is _ and it comes with the seasonal opening of drive-in
theaters. It comes with _ dare we say it _ hope.
</P>
<P>
   It's with hope that the summer movies below are listed. As ever,
this isn't a complete list; it isn't a projection of box-office
potential; it isn't a prediction of who or what's going to win
which Oscar next March. It is, however, a sample of just a few
movies that this lone critic is looking forward to seeing in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (Please note the following list does not include ``The
Patriot,'' Mel Gibson's rah-rah Revolutionary War epic, due for
release June 30. This omission is neither accidental nor meant to
slight Monsieur Gibson, whose output, be it good or bad, always
merits critical and box-office attention. Mel is fine. War movies
are fine. Less fine: Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the
directing-producing duo that brought ``Independence Day'' and
``Godzilla'' unto the masses.)
</P>
<P>
   _ M:I-2 (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, May 24). Cool trailer. Cool
sunglasses. Cool rock-climbing stunt. Cool director (John Woo).
Cool Cruise. Cool Rhames. Cool Hopkins. Cool music. (Bum. Bum.
BUH-DUH. Bum. Bum. BUH-DUH.) And anyway, it's gotta be better than
the first one, right?
</P>
<P>
   _ CHICKEN RUN (June 23). From Nick Park, the Oscar-winning
animator who blessed the world with the Wallace and Gromit shorts
(``The Wrong Trousers,'' ``A Close Shave''), comes his claymation
debut feature _ about hens on a Yorkshire farm who revolt against
Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, their murderous farmers. Mel Gibson provides
the voice of a cocky rooster. And you wondered why we didn't
include ``The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ THE PERFECT STORM (June 30). Three reasons to see this movie:
(1.) It's based on Sebastian Junger's devastatingly good nonfiction
account of the wreck of the fishing boat Andrea Gail. (2.) It's
directed by Wolfgang Petersen (``Das Boot''), who knows a thing or
two about seaborne vessels. And (3.) The trailer. Check out that
wave, mon.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE HOLLOW MAN (July 28). Call it morbid curiosity, but the
prospect of seeing James Whale's (and H.G. Wells') classic
``Invisible Man'' remade by yeccch-merchant Paul Verhoeven
(``Showgirls,'' ``Starship Troopers'') gives some of us goosebumps.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Certainly Kevin Bacon isn't
a bad thing, though it remains to be seen whether his take on the
mad scientist is as sympathetically human, or as enduring, as
Claude Rains'.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE (Aug. 4). Notwithstanding Robert
Redford's penchant for hiring ethereal blond actors who look like
cryogenically preserved mini-Bobs, there's every reason to be
hopeful about this mystical golf drama. Matt Damon (who got cast
after Redford decided he was too old) plays a World War I hero who
tackles a golf tournament; the ever-genial Will Smith plays his
wise and eerie caddy. Who knows how it'll do at the box office, and
who cares? We're intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   _ CECIL B. DEMENTED (Aug. 11). Bad-taste virtuoso John Waters
makes ... an action movie? So says he; are you convinced? Melanie
Griffith and Stephen Dorff join Waters regulars Ricki Lake and
Patricia Hearst in some kind of sick-boy variation on a Hollywood
blockbuster. Dorff plays the titular independent filmmaker who
kidnaps Griffith in the name of art. Plus, great title _ a spoof on
Waters' nickname, bestowed upon him by some crank of a critic.

&HT;     ABC BANKS ON `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDs: Note optional trim.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that should surprise no one following the desperate
and lucky adventures of ABC, the network has announced that it will
spray ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' around the schedule on four
nights instead of three, thus using the most powerful weapon in its
arsenal to get ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Regis Philbin-hosted game show was the major story of the
1999-2000 television season as ABC pointed it at _ and destroyed _
virtually everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The show's success masked poor performances elsewhere on the
schedule and this latest move by ABC, which will add only four new
series next fall, proves it intends to ride its workhorse until the
fad wears thin, if it ever does.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is canceling ``Sports Night,'' the acclaimed half-hour
comedy (which is expected to get picked up by HBO), and dismantling
its youth-themed ``TGIF'' line-up on Fridays. In addition, ABC will
follow the lead of NBC and fill fewer slots with newsmagazines,
taking an hour back from the schedule. The popularity of
newsmagazines has waned because of overexposure and the impact of
game shows and other reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   ABC presented its fall schedule Tuesday at the so-called
``up-fronts'' in New York, where networks showcase new shows to
advertisers who then allot ad money based on how well (or not) they
believe the shows will perform. ABC will finish this season as the
No. 1 ranked network, thanks almost exclusively to ``Who Wants To
Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings champ customarily gains an increase in advertising
revenue with the win and ABC's decision to stick with Regis and the
``Millionaire'' sensation didn't raise any eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves, ABC will make Fridays a kind of guy-themed
comedy night instead of its long-running and once-successful
attempt to attract teens and families. ``Norm'' will move to
Fridays from Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Also, continuing last season's slot-sharing, ABC will air ``Once
and Again'' in the Tuesday night ``NYPD Blue'' time, then shift
that burgeoning hit to Mondays when ``Monday Night Football'' ends.
``NYPD Blue'' will then be launched in its familiar position, but
not until January. After complaining about the time-sharing last
year, ``NYPD Blue'' series creator Steven Bochco took to the idea
primarily because ABC devoted a lot of advertising to the series
and it didn't have to air many reruns. It was a blunder that turned
golden when both shows got solid numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new fiction series ABC will bring out in the fall, three
of them have serious star-power behind them. Geena Davis, Gabriel
Byrne and Andre Braugher will each appear in shows made for them.
Three of the new shows are comedies and ABC will bring out an
additional three sitcoms as midseason replacements, continuing what
appears to be a network trend back to comedies after two seasons
dominated by hour-long dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The three midseason comedies are:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Joan Cusack Show,'' starring the comic actress as a
confused romantic on the verge of getting married. The series is
produced by James L. Brooks (``The Simpsons,'' ``Jerry Maguire,''
``As Good as It Gets'') and has a fine pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Leary,'' the working title of a new show geared around comic
Denis Leary, who plays _ surprise _ a bitter, acerbic and
semi-crazed New York cop who thinks the world has gone mad,
prompting him to rant about it a lot and believe he's the only sane
one left. Nobody else agrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My Wife and Kids,'' starring Damon Wayans (``In Living
Color'') as a father who thought he had a normal, ``Leave It To
Beaver'' type family, but finds that his stay-at-home wife (Tisha
Campbell-Martin) has become a day trading pro and his kids are
either rebelling or making fun of him. A family comedy that, on
paper, seems about as predictable as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   While ABC has some big names on its roster, TV has proven
regularly that stars don't necessarily translate into instant hits.
The network is gambling strongly, then, that the country still has
millions of viewers who want to be a millionaire.

   TUESDAY: ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' begins its onslaught
here, followed by ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' then the new series ``Geena.''
That series stars Davis as a power woman in New York who meets the
man of her dreams (Peter Horton from ``thirtysomething'') who just
happens to have two kids. Trying to balance kids while keeping her
independence and love of the city and her friends is the gist of
this modern day take on motherhood and having a career. Mimi Rogers
also stars. Why the show is called ``Geena'' and her character is
called ``Teddie'' is something we can't figure. ``Once and
Again''/``NYPD Blue'' fill out the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' opens the night,
followed by ``Drew Carey'' and the revamped ``Spin City,'' which
finds Charlie Sheen joining the cast. Then, ABC's new drama is
``Gideon's Crossing'' starring Braugher, last seen on network
television as the riveting Detective Pembleton on ``Homicide: Life
on the Street.'' In this new drama, Braugher plays Ben Gideon, an
icon of a doctor and teacher who is both compassionate and
demanding. Ruben Blades co-stars. It sounds like a perfect
larger-than-life vehicle for Braugher, but the question will be
whether viewers will take to another hospital drama.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: Whether ABC is throwing in the towel against NBC's
revamped ``must-see'' line-up on Thursday remains to be seen. But
the network is putting on back-to-back episodes of ``Whose Line Is
It Anyway?'' _ a decent performer, but not worth a double-dose _
before rolling out another ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' ABC's
newsmagazine, ``Primetime Thursday,'' finishes the night.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: This is ABC's biggest shake-up as it tries to target
guys staying home with a little comedy. The endlessly bad ``Two
Guys and a Girl'' kicks off the night, followed by the new sitcom,
``People Who Fear People.'' The series stars David Krumholtz (``The
Ice Storm'' ``The Santa Clause'') and Brad Raider (nobody you know)
as two buddies who fear the world is out to get them. Their friend
(Paget Brewster) just happens to be a therapist and she spends her
time telling them not to be so paranoid. But they believe that a
new next door neighbor (Jon Cryer) is a spy keeping track of them.
In fact, he is. ``Norm'' follows on this new night. The Norm
MacDonald show had been on the bubble, but survived. It's followed
by ``Madigan Men,'' a sitcom starring Irish actor Byrne (``The
Usual Suspects'') as a recently divorced architect in New York who
is clueless about the dating world and hasn't figured out that
women adore him. Hmmm. He gets tips from his 16-year-old son, who
is juggling girlfriends, and his recently widowed and very
opinionated father, who moves in with them. This series comes from
Cindy Chupak, who was a writer on ``Sex and the City.'' The night
is closed out by ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: ABC keeps its ``Big Picture Show'' theme, airing
theatrical films.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: This is a potential blockbuster night for ABC as ``The
Wonderful World of Disney'' leads into ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' (which scores well with families) and ends with ``The
Practice.''

&HT;     AFFORDABLE WINES THAT STILL PLEASE THE PALATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL LONSFORD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I met a fellow who said something nice about the wine column,
then followed up with, ``But I sure wish you wouldn't write about
such obscure wines. They can be hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   And he had a point _ up to a point. I didn't bother to go into a
long spiel about how interesting wine is to me, how I love to
discover little-known but flavorful wines, that I'm not one to
settle for drinking the same wine, day after boring day.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about wine is its diversity: of flavors,
of origins, of quality. But a lot of people who also like wine
aren't interested in all those aspects; all they want is a
good-tasting glass of wine with their meal that doesn't cost an arm
and a leg.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you do like a glass of wine with dinner, but you really
don't care so much about where it comes from as you do how much it
costs and will it go with tonight's meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I dislike ``shopping lists'' of wines, there comes a
time when they can be useful. So here's one of available wines that
may not set the world on fire but that are consistently well-made.
And not expensive, either. All of them may not constitute what
Shakespeare called ``a world-without-end bargain,'' but they're in
just about every wine-lover's financial reach. Almost all of the
wines today will be less than $15 a bottle; sometimes a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   And while vintages matter a great deal with First Growth
Bordeaux and grand cru white burgundies, they're less important
with these wines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the main thing to consider with these wines is to get
the latest vintage.

   Leftovers normally aren't a problem around the hunting or
fishing camps I have been fortunate enough to visit.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are times when a little bit of this and a little
bit of that seems to be overlooked by the ravenous horde after they
have laid waste to an evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   On one of these occasions, I managed to salvage some of my
homemade barbecue sauce and a little bit of cheese, which I used in
the following dish.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good way to prepare your stew meat and is tasty served
over boiled potatoes or noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Store-bought barbecue sauce can be substituted if you don't want
to go to the trouble of making your own.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BETTER BARBECUED VENISON
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds venison stew meat
</P>
<P>
   seasoned flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons bacon grease
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon each red and black pepper
</P>
<P>
   salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beef broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup barbecue sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Cut the stew meat into 1-inch cubes. Place in plastic bag with
seasoned flour and shake well to coat. Heat bacon grease in a deep
cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brown floured meat on all
sides, then add onion and garlic. Continue browning until onion is
transparent. Add remaining ingredients, except for the mushrooms,
stir well and reduce heat to simmer for about one hour. Add
mushrooms and simmer for another 15 minutes.

REBEL LEADER CAPTURED IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who vanished
nine days ago during a violent confrontation outside his Freetown
home, was captured Wednesday by pro-government soldiers who
stripped him of his clothes before locking him up.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his capture triggered spontaneous celebrations in the
streets of Freetown, where residents have lived in fear of an
assault on the capital by the Revolutionary United Front, Sankoh's
insurgent fighters. The rebels have gained notoriety for committing
atrocities like mutilating and dismembering civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone government, whose forces have been battling the
rebels since a peace accord achieved last July broke down this
month, asked the British troops deployed in the capital to protect
British nationals to transport Sankoh to safety after a mob
gathered outside the police barracks where he was being held. A
British helicopter flew Sankoh to Lungi Airport, which is held by
British paratroopers, where he was transferred to safer police
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been taken to a secure location,'' a spokesman for the
British force, Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp, told news agencies. ``He is in
the custody of the Sierra Leone police. He's been taken to that
place in a British helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramp was quoted as saying that the rebel leader's captors had
taken away his clothes to humiliate him.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh disappeared on May 8 after his bodyguards shot into a
crowd of several thousand people who were protesting in front of
his Freetown residence, killing several demonstrators. There had
been speculation that he was dead, had escaped to a rebel-held area
or was being held by the government.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen next to Sankoh, who still holds
ministerial rank in the coalition government that was cobbled
together as part of the peace agreement. Authorities in Freetown
have accused him of plotting another coup but have not formally
charged him with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a matter for the Sierra Leone government and the U.N.
to decide what should happen,'' Cramp said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone,
David Wimhurst, said the United Nations had played no part in
capturing Sankoh. ``The U.N. is in no way involved in this
apprehension,'' Wimhurst said at a news conference in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are expected to urge Sankoh to facilitate the
release of an estimated 347 peacekeeping troops and military
observers who have been detained by rebel fighters since the
beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Another 157 detained U.N. peacekeepers were released after the
intervention of Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, who has been
close to Sankoh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, welcomed Sankoh's
arrest, saying that it has deprived the rebellion in Sierra Leone
of its leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we may be able to stabilize Sierra Leone and
reverse rebel advances,'' Cook told reporters during a visit to
Moscow. ``To do that, we need to have a strong and effective U.N.
mission on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at 12:45 a.m., 25 British paratroopers clashed for the
first time with rebels, killing at least three attackers in a
firefight that lasted 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has maintained that its troops have been sent to
evacuate British nationals and will not assume a combat role, but
they are permitted to shoot back if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Other fighting was reported between the rebels and Sierra
Leone's army and pro-government militia at Port Loko, about 40
miles northeast of the airport.

&HT;     MOUNTAIN COURSE OFFERS FOUR-WHEELING LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ Where the pavement ends, the fun
begins.
</P>
<P>
   That's the creed of most four-wheel-drive enthusiasts, who think
nothing of driving on the highway for hours or even days just to
get to a great spot where they can leave the hard surface behind
and venture into paradise: an off-road trail that embodies the
concept of ``the road less traveled.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern off-roaders know some of the best places to go: the
San Juan Mountains around Ouray, Colo.; the Arches National Park
near Moab, Utah; the Rubicon Trail across Northern California's
Sierra Nevada range; and the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park near
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the best four-wheeling is found in the West. The
professionals who operate the Land Rover Driving School at the
Greenbrier resort here are sold on the off-road trails of the
Appalachian Mountains, particularly those on the resort's own 6,500
acres in Greenbrier County, in the southeast corner of the Mountain
State.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in the Allegheny range of the Appalachians, along
Interstate 64 about 75 minutes from Roanoke, Va., the Land Rover
Driving School offers visitors a chance to learn the basics of
off-road driving on trails carved out of hardwood forests among
some of the most scenic mountain vistas on the North American
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'm a bit prejudiced in favor of these storied mountains.
I grew up about 100 miles from here, in Charleston, W.Va., and
spent much of my free time on weekends and summer vacations
exploring the mountain trails of the Southern Appalachians in
Greenbrier and surrounding counties.
</P>
<P>
   Here, miles of unpaved fire roads and logging trails go up and
down while simultaneously making sharp turns, and it's not unusual
to top a steep hill _ with no view ahead but the sky or the tops of
trees _ and then have to make a quick turn to drop down the next
hill to cross a swift-running mountain stream.
</P>
<P>
   There is a stark contrast between the Western mountains, such as
those around Ouray and Telluride, Colo., and those of the
Appalachian chain, which stretches from northern New England to
northeastern Alabama. The Eastern mountains are green, the Western
brown. And when the foliage is at its peak, the Eastern mountains
are hard to see through.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this contrast more noticeable than the mountains
around the Greenbrier, where Land Rover North America, the
distributor of the British-built Land Rover and Range Rover
sport-utility vehicles, last year set up its second permanent
off-road driving school. (The first, at The Equinox in Manchester,
Vt., has been open since 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, a few hours or even a day or two, people who want
to learn how to drive their four-wheel-drive vehicles off road can
take lessons from one of Land Rover's professional drivers and
explore some of the most scenic trails around.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction is offered in either a Land Rover Discovery II or a
Range Rover, and both are capable of negotiating just about
anything the rugged Appalachians have to offer. The cost is $150
for the first hour, then $100 per hour after that, which includes
the vehicle and the instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely fun and some of the most gorgeous scenery I've
ever encountered,'' Ken Sutton, an insurance agent from Clinton,
N.C., said as he drove one of the Greenbrier's trails last week
during his first off-road lesson, in a Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was staying at the Greenbrier for a business conference and
saw the signs about the driving school,'' he said. ``I got all
excited and went to check it out. I own a four-wheel-drive pickup,
but I've never done any off-roading like this, and I would have
been afraid to do it on my own. Until you have someone like these
instructors show you how to do this, you just don't realize how
capable these vehicles can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 40 percent of the people who take lessons at the
school are Land Rover or Range Rover owners, said Bob Burns,
manager of off-road programs for Land Rover North America or, as he
likes to put it, ``Land Rover's vice president of mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest are people who may or may not own an off-road-capable
vehicle, but who want the experience of driving on some truly
challenging and beautiful terrain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main role here is to educate people on the proper use of
four-wheel drive,'' Burns said. ``Most Range Rovers aren't usually
taken off road, except by some wealthy ranchers in Texas who
occasionally use theirs to haul hay.''
</P>
<P>
   With the prices of Range Rovers beginning in the upper $50,000s
and Land Rovers starting in the low $30,000s, owners often are
reluctant to take them off road for fear of damaging them. But
that's true of most of today's family sport-utilities, whose prices
average in the low- to mid-$30,000s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach people how to drive them off road safely, without
damaging them, so they can truly enjoy what their vehicles are
capable of,'' Burns said. ``This is not the high-speed,
wheels-in-the-air experience like some of the TV ads; if we hit 5
mph, that's the land speed record for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sane and sensible off-road exploring is much different from the
jump-and-splash driving that teen-age boys enjoy with mud puddles
and their four-wheel-drive pickups. This experience is for seeing
new and different terrain that isn't accessible by the average car;
and slow-and-easy is the theme of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that you should drive as slow as you possibly can, but
as fast as you need to,'' said instructor Fred Monsees, a veteran
of the annual Land Rover Camel Trophy worldwide off-road driving
championship competition. ``The gentler you are with your right
foot, the better your off-road experience will be.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the driving school's headquarters at the Greenbrier's
Hunt Club, the vehicles head down a dirt road and then across
Howard's Creek to reach the off-road trails that wind through the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: ``When we say `Stop,' we mean stop,'' Monsees says.
``Not in a few seconds, but now. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing Howard's Creek is the first cool move in the day's
drive. It's more than a foot deep and about 300 feet wide, with a
rocky bottom. Before starting across, the vehicle is shifted into
four-wheel-drive low range, where it will remain for most of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``These vehicles have a maximum wading depth of 20 inches, so
we're fine here,'' Monsees says as the Range Rover starts into the
water. The driver is a bit tentative, however, so Monsees urges him
along. ``You've got to keep up a bit of momentum in the water so
you don't bog down,'' he says. ``You need to be going fast enough
to generate a bow wave.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle comes out of the water and up a bank, then makes a
sharp right turn down a steep, muddy hill. Before descending, the
vehicle's automatic transmission is put into low gear, which,
combined with the low-range mode of the Range Rover's two-speed
transfer case, allows engine braking to hold the speed to about 5
mph without having to use the foot brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the vehicle moves through the creekbed at the bottom of
the hill, with the driver using gentle left-foot braking before
dropping into the streambed to prevent the rear of the vehicle from
bottoming out. Then, he shifts into third gear for the climb up the
next hill, with enough momentum _ but not too much _ to negotiate a
bit of mud on the slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to go slow enough to figure out what you need to do
as you come to each challenge, whether it is a steep hill, sharp
curve or stream crossing,'' Monsees says. ``Before you make that
move, there are four steps to work through: identify the problem,
predict the vehicle's reaction, decide on the best course and
execute the move.''
</P>
<P>
   It's as simple as that, but you don't go charging into anything
without due consideration first, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots of time for stopping to enjoy the landscape and
even the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   We crane our necks when a passenger in the rear yells, ``Look at
that huge snake!''
</P>
<P>
   Instructor Jim Swett yells, ``Stop,'' and the driver complies.
Right now.
</P>
<P>
   Swett, a Connecticut native, jumps out and turns to me, a
born-and-bred West Virginian, and asks, ``What kind of snake is it?
It is poisonous?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not dangerous,'' I say. ``It's just a blacksnake. Its
bite will hurt a little, but it's not poisonous and it won't kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's enough for Swett, who takes a long stick and holds down
the snake's head, then reaches behind the head and picks it up. Six
feet of sinewy snake body wind around his arm, and the snake's
yellow eyes look with contempt at its tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a constrictor,'' he says, looking again for
reassurance that he is going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   The group of vehicles following has stopped, and the people from
them have gathered around for a look. Then, with a huge laugh,
Swett drops the snake on the hood of a Range Rover surrounded by
the gawkers. It dives for the ground, the people scatter, and it
slithers into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Hunt Club later, the day's ``student'' drivers get
to exchange stories and pat each other on the back for their
successful off-road maneuvers. Some made the climb up some of the
muddy hills on the first try, others took four or five attempts.
Some didn't make it at all, and they get some good-natured ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, the insurance agent from North Carolina, sums up his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it,'' he said. ``I'd recommend it to anyone.
And I will be back.''

&HT;     DEMOCRATS BACK FIRST LADY IN HISTORIC NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Democrats nominated Hillary Rodham
Clinton as their U.S. Senate candidate in a historic convention
filled with presidential pomp, speeches from a star-studded cast of
politicians and a few glancing blows at a GOP opponent who may not
even wind up in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The only first lady ever to run for office overshadowed even the
president as she gained the unanimous backing of the delegates amid
the cheers of a heady crowd that packed the Pepsi Arena Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake _ this election is not about me or any
Republican opponent,'' Clinton said during her 38-minute acceptance
speech. ``It's about the people of New York and our common
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Boasting of a party for once unified behind one candidate,
officials assiduously avoided any mention of New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani or the personal woes that threaten to sideline him from
the race. But the first lady drew a subtle comparison between
herself and Giuliani in an uncharacteristically public display of
devotion to her spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted that the president is here,'' said candidate
Clinton, looking to the side of the stage at her husband, who had
abruptly decided Tuesday morning to accompany his wife at her
political coronation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so grateful for his support,'' she added. ``I would not
be standing here tonight were it not for Bill and were it not for
all he has done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The president sat silently behind his wife throughout the
speech, then joined her at the podium for the tumultuous ovation
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clintons' relationship has been under public scrutiny
for years, it was Giuliani's marriage that became the focus of the
Senate race this week after he revealed a relationship with another
woman and announced he was separating from his wife of 16 years. In
the aftermath of his recent prostate cancer diagnosis, Giuliani was
still deliberating whether he will compete in a race that had
rivaled this year's presidential contest in terms of national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were careful to not directly lash out at
Giuliani, they opted instead to criticize all things Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defined the party's mission as improving schools,
providing affordable health care, strengthening families, creating
more jobs and a slew of other themes she has sounded from the stump
since she first began campaigning 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said before, it's not about candidates. It's about
children; it's about families; it's about our future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial convention drew 11,500 supporters and other party
faithful _ 10 times the number of attendees at the last Democratic
convention in 1998. Despite threatened challenges from two
virtually unknown hopefuls, Clinton was unanimously selected as the
party's official designee by the 352 delegates on the convention
floor. Hers was the only name offered for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The night, however, grew long on hundreds of convention-goers
who grew impatient with the litany of speeches by virtually every
top Democratic official in New York. By 8 p.m. _ a full 90 minutes
before Clinton took the stage _ the rowdy crowd began chanting ``We
want Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a relief to convention organizers who initially feared
the president's appearance would overshadow the spotlight of the
first sitting first lady to run for elected office. But pandemonium
reigned in the arena when both Clintons took the stage to the
strains of ``The Natural.'' They exited to a balloon and confetti
drop and ``Chariots of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very effective to have so many people here,''
said delegate Betty Momrow, secretary of Albany County's Democratic
Committee. ``It shows there's support for her, I hope. I know I've
been getting so many calls from people wanting to volunteer and
help out. ... Daniel Patrick (Moynihan) has been a wonderful
senator; he's done a wonderful job. And I think she can continue to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the retiring Moynihan delivered a relatively
sedate yet classy farewell after 24 years in the Senate. Moynihan's
wife, Liz, as she has been throughout his tenure, was at his side
in saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When they first began, he reminisced, it was ``Liz running the
campaign; me doing as told,'' he quipped. ``For now, we say
goodbye. We thank our party for a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be senior senator from New York, Charles Schumer,
took a different tack in his speech nominating Clinton. In a
melodramatic deadpan toward the end of his speech, Schumer asked
for a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what that sound you just heard is?'' he asked. ``It's
the sound of Republican headquarters on election eve when Hillary
Clinton is elected United States senator from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also took a veiled swipe at the unapologetically
confrontational mayor in his speech, describing New York as a
``melting pot'' in need of culturally sensitive leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this, the most complicated and diverse place on Earth to
really work, people need and want to get along,'' the senator said.
``It is all to easy to pit one group against another, to find a
scapegoat for the problems in New York City, but divisiveness won't
solve a single problem.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans are scheduled to hold their nominating
convention May 30 in Buffalo, but even top party leaders remain in
the dark over who will get the official GOP nod. If Giuliani drops
out of the running, Rep. Rick Lazio, a more conservative Republican
from Long Island, will be his likely replacement. He would start a
six-month countdown to Election Day with a relatively meager $3.5
million in his campaign treasury. Clinton has amassed $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani's camp received a small but much-needed morale
boost Tuesday in the form of a Quinnipiac College poll indicating
that relatively few voters would hold Giuliani's personal life
against him at the ballot box. The survey showed Clinton and
Giuliani still locked in a statistical dead heat _ unchanged from
their standings before the mayor's series of bombshell personal
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Clinton led Giuliani in the poll 44 percent to 43
percent, within the poll's margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of campaigning, it remains clear that what New
Yorkers truly care about are performance and record,'' said
Giuliani spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss. ``When New Yorkers
think about their futures ... they think about Rudy Giuliani.''

&HT;     SBC FINED $27 MILLION OVER INTERNET ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A national arbitration board has slapped at
$27.2 million judgment against SBC Communications, the parent
company of Pacific Bell, for not delivering equipment and space to
DSL provider Covad Communications Group in a timely manner, a
violation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara-based Covad, which provides high speed Internet
access through digital subscriber lines, or DSL, alleged that San
Antonio-based SBC Communications delayed delivering space and
equipment needed to provide service from 1997 to 1999, giving SBC
an unfair advantage in the race to offer lucrative DSL services.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, SBC had a total of 301,000 DSL customers
for its popular, heavily promoted service, up from 169,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Covad had about 100,000 customers at the end of
April. A large percentage of the customers for both companies are
in California.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty, issued by the American Arbitration Association on
Monday, covers Covad's lost revenue due to the delays, Covad
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, SBC is required to offer space in central
offices for Covad equipment within four months, but instead took
six months or longer. SBC's operable loops, required to be made
available in 10 days or less, instead took 15 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were unnecessarily hampered,'' said Covad's Dhruv Khanna,
executive vice president and general counsel. ``Instead of blanket
coverage, we had Swiss cheese coverage that was not easy to market
or sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes as SBC plans to make a bid to enter the
long-distance market in California later this year. The
telecommunications company must first demonstrate to federal
regulators that it has opened its local markets to competition.
That includes giving access to competitors such as Covad on utility
poles, cables, equipment and other network elements.
</P>
<P>
   SBC plans to appeal the decision, asserting that it had already
resolved the delivery issues through the terms of its
interconnection agreement with Covad. ``They're trying to use the
Telecom Act to compensate their inability to meet their revenue
forecasts,'' said Pacific Bell spokesman John Britton. ``There's no
legal basis.''

WAR ON GUNS HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It boils down to fear. The core of the dispute about guns is
this: Who's afraid of what? Some owners of some of the 250 million
guns in America _ that's one for every American over the age of
about 5, and if you don't have one, someone else has two _ are
afraid of losing their piece. While the rest of us worry about
losing our peace _ of mind, and of body.
</P>
<P>
   Not all gun owners are afraid of sensible gun control. Probably
only a relative few. By roughly 2-1, the public favors stricter gun
laws. But those who fear stronger gun laws respond like frightened
puppies to every snarl from the National Rifle Association,
arguably the best-oiled lobby in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is like a spark in the gas tank _ all it takes is a little,
and BOOM! The NRA is very good at sparking BOOM! in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of gun owners, as polls reveal, support sensible
gun control measures. But the NRA bosses, like the diehard
segregationists who shouted ``Segregation today, segregation
tomorrow, segregation FOREVER!'' in the '60s, have cast their lot
with the never-surrender-nothing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   So the NRA is afraid of gun control, regulation, maybe losing
those cushy lobbying jobs in D.C.; and the antigun folks who
marched, maybe a million strong Sunday, if you add in all 70
cities, are afraid their kids are going to get plugged.
</P>
<P>
   And the politicians? They're afraid of whichever side turns out
the most voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only industrial country in the world where the gun
industry, the fear industry (that's us media folk, in case you
haven't figured that out), and the political industry (sad but
true, there's money given to politicians to buy votes on gun
availability) have conspired to legalize a scale of slaughter that
every two years kills more Americans than died in the 10-plus years
of Vietnam War combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control counted every single gun death
in 1997. Incredibly, 32,436 died, all shot, in accidents, suicides,
and homicides. That's just under 89 people a day. That's like a big
jet plane crash, every single day. Fly NRA Airlines! That's one
death every 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You spend an average amount of time reading this paper today,
and by the time you put it aside, someone else just got shot dead
in America. Bang.
</P>
<P>
   Every day 12 kids are shot, on average, from infancy through the
teenage years. That's a Columbine every day. Two kids a day are not
even 14. In the three years ending in 1995, about once a year there
was a multiple-death school shooting. But from midsummer '95 to
'98, there was an average of five per year.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not even counting the Columbine massacre in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   So influential is the gun lobby in the Republican-controlled
Congress and many of the Western and Southern states that Congress
refused to pass any post-Columbine gun measure.
</P>
<P>
   That's what spurred the Million Mom March Sunday in Washington
and 70 other cities, a phenomenal roar from the grass roots. But
the roar came too late for an 18-month-old Holyoke toddler; she was
shot Saturday and critically wounded; her father said he was
cleaning a handgun when it went off inside the family's western
Massachusetts apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, according to the Million Mom March organizers,
has the lowest crime rate of any industrial state, and that may
partly be due to the fact this is the only state that requires gun
licensing and registration.
</P>
<P>
   But across the variegated electoral college terrain, the progun
policies of Texas Governor George W. Bush enjoy a slim advantage
that is probably illusory. Bush signed a Texas right-to-carry law
that could be the subject of a wickedly effective negative ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is portrayed as a lurking menance ready to move into the
Oval Office, thanks to a videotaped commercial by Handgun Control
showing the No. 2 man in the NRA boasting in a closed meeting how
if Bush wins ``we'll have . . . a president where we work out of
their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope his aim is as true as his grammar. NRA first vice
president Kayne Robinson, next in line behind Gunner-in-chief
Charlton Heston, is taped saying that if Bush wins, ``We'll have a
Supreme Court that will back us to the hilt.''
</P>
<P>
   I think he meant the scabard, or the holster. Robinson is a GOP
operative; his NRA forked over $537,000 in soft money to the
Republican Party and none for the Democrats this year and last. The
irony is that while Robinson tells the NRA that Bush is their guy,
that the gun lobby enjoys ``unbelievably friendly relations'' with
Bush, a recent Gallup Poll finds that by 43 percent to 37, the
public thinks Bush would do a better job on the gun issue than
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC, Gore tops Bush on the gun handling by 46-38. On CBS, the
gun issue finds Bush leads by 10 among men, trails by 5 among
women. The presidency and winning the US House may hinge on who
rules: men who love their guns, or moms who value kids over
weaponry.

SAN FRANCISCO'S NEWSPAPER FIASCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In 1885, while he was flunking out of Harvard,
William Randolph Hearst wrote to his father about a newspaper the
elder Hearst had bought in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have begun to have a strange fondness for our little
paper,'' Will wrote, ``a tenderness like unto that which a mother
feels for a puny or deformed offspring, and I should hate to see it
die now after it had battled so long and so nobly for existence; in
fact, to tell the truth, I am possessed of the weakness which at
some time or other in their lives pervades most men; I am convinced
that I could run a newspaper successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 4, 1887, George Hearst, who made millions in the Gold
Rush, took the oath of office as US senator. On the same day, his
son became proprietor of the San Francisco Examiner, which he
christened ``The Monarch of the Dailies.'' He quickly boosted its
circulation tenfold with the splashy, free-spending Hearst formula.
Politics and journalism helped build the Hearst monarchy, but in a
San Francisco court these days, the Hearst legend is once again
puny and deformed, a sad court jester.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner has been kept alive by a joint
operating agreement with the San Francisco Chronicle. A JOA exempts
partners from antitrust laws. The Ex, publishing in the afternoon,
has lost so many readers that the morning Chron now outsells its
rival, 4-1. Profits are divided 50-50. The Chron's owners decided
to sell last year, and the winning bid was Hearst's at $660
million. Whether the paper would be the Chron-Ex or the Ex-Chron,
Hearst would be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But a former mayoral candidate, Clint Reilly, sued to prevent
Hearst from buying the Chron and ditching the Ex. The testimony
thus far is not memorable for antitrust precedent, but for one
simple concept, ``horse-trading.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what you were doing when you had lunch last August with
Mayor Willie Brown, right? Reilly's lawyer asked the Hearst honcho
for the monarchical merger, Timothy White, that question. The
Examiner publisher answered ``yes,'' confirming the suspicions of
readers and the fears of reporters and editors that credibility is
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The next day White said he was ``tired and confused'' on the
stand. He was also fired, or ``suspended indefinitely.'' A shower
of assurances from Hearstlings about integrity and code-of-ethics
blather has not washed away a single cubit of the contempt of
readers nor the grief of writers on both newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Francisco Examiner is dying, and it can't even die
with dignity,'' Rob Morse, its lead columnist, wrote in Sunday's
Examiner. ``We're a failing newspaper,'' he added. ``We're even
failing at going out of business.'' In the Chron, Ken Garcia wrote:
``The real tragedy in this play is that it was set into motion
because a majority of the family owners of my newspaper, rife with
jealousy and greed, decided to unload it after 135 years of arduous
editorial battles rather than wait a few more and finally win the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   The JOA is scheduled to expire in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In The New Yorker 40 years ago this week, A. J. Liebling defined
a central truth: ``Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those
who own one.'' Liebling, like Hearst, is dead, and today's press
criticism is instant and conspiratorial. ``Did Tim White Act
Alone?'' asks a Lee Harvey Oswald-evoking headline in one Web site,
which alleges that the Ex went easy on the mayor after the famous
lunch at the North Beach Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. enjoys a good reputation among people in the
news business, many of whom hope and expect that any hint of
dissent in the judge's ruling will make it pause. ``If the judge
sneezes, Hearst should spend its $660 million elsewhere,'' one
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 5 New York Times, a Hearst ad quotes the founder:
``We must be alarmingly enterprising, and we must be startlingly
original.'' Today's San Francisco fiasco is probably not what he
had in mind.

CRUISE CAN'T `SHUT' UP; BRAVING THE `STORM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' didn't succeed at the box office, and most
movie critics were bored by it. But Stanley Kubrick's final film
has done remarkably well at the box-of-sour-grapes-office, as
Kubrick fans and supporters continue to blame the movie's failure
on viewer preconceptions about Kubrick, and hype that led audiences
to expect more sex. And so the Vanity Fair cover interview with Tom
Cruise opens the ``Shut'' case once again, with Cruise continuing
to analyze what happened and why even those who know Kubrick's work
``missed it.'' The article is timed to promote Cruise's forthcoming
``Mission: Impossible 2,'' but it seems to spend more time looing
into ``Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise also reflects in depth on his career arc, recalling the
defining moment when he learned that, despite a critical drubbing,
``Cocktail'' had made a killing at the box office during its
opening weekend. The interview is conducted by Cameron Crowe, the
writer-director who worked with Cruise on ``Jerry Maguire,'' and
Cruise seems less defensive and controlled than he generally is
with the press. But still, he is one doggedly sincere fellow, and
it appears to be hard for anyone to get him to say anything much
racier than ``it is a privilege for me to be able to do something
that I love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair also picks over the bones of the beats, Jack Kerouac
to be specific. Around the time of the publication of ``On the
Road'' in the late 1950s, Kerouac had an on-again-off-again affair
with a younger writer named Joyce Glassman, now Joyce Johnson.
Allen Ginsberg fixed them up, and Kerouac was smitten, despite the
fact that he wasn't inclined to like blondes. The piece, an excerpt
from a forthcoming book, features Johnson's correspondence with
Kerouac (they spent more time apart than together), and the letters
are interwoven with her narrative chronology of their story. They
were ``together'' for a year and 10 months, during which time
Johnson fell in love with the fast-typing writer, despite his
unwillingness to commit. His letters are all about dodging
rendezvous with her (``I'm a confirmed bachelor &AMP; hermit''), trying
to write in the midst of compulsive travel and beat hype, and
railing against those barriers to creativity such as ``liverish
pale fag editors.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, here's the latest product from Beat Generation
Inc.

<P>
   It was fun to see George Clooney return to ``ER'' last week,
even if that night's ads spoiled the surprise. (Alas, surprise is a
june bug in the hurricane of today's maniacal hype machine.) But
Clooney's movie-star magnitude increases with each picture he
makes, not including, of course, ``Batman &AMP; Robin.'' He doesn't
project the kind of product control and box office macho of Cruise;
just an un-Nautilized manliness and a game approach to acting in
semirisky ventures.
</P>
<P>
   His next movie is an adaptation of Sebastian Junger's ``The
Perfect Storm,'' in which he reunites with his ``Three Kings''
costar, Mark Wahlberg, for the tragic story of Gloucester's Andrea
Gail. Premiere for June talks to Clooney and Wahlberg, who are
described as sharing more of a mutual admiration society than a
friendship. ``These men seem to admire each other so much that they
can't quite relax in each other's presence,'' writes Trish Deitch
Rohrer.
</P>
<P>
   The article goes into the time the production spent in
Gloucester, where bonds were reportedly made between the filmmakers
and the locals. ``I was just imagining producers on cell phones,''
Junger says, ``striding around the Crow's Nest.'' But the ``West
Coast attitude'' never reared its head. The actors mixed with the
families of the people they portray, and the townspeople and
families participated in the memorial-service scene, which sounds
like it was a catharsis of sorts. ``I'm telling you,'' one producer
says, ``the whole town, they were weeping.''
</P>
<P>
   It also sounds like the movie doesn't tack on the kind of
feelgood ending usually associated with adventure hits. Now that's
a bit of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be her only moment, so she is working like there's no
tomorrow.'' That's the gist of Chris Mundy's look at Britney
Spears, who appears on the cover of Rolling Stone for May 24. He
portrays her as being bored as an ordinary teen, but feeling a
little guilty for having left home and family behind. She doesn't
like being viewed as a sexual object, despite her revealing
costuming; she thinks Justin from 'N Sync is ``the cutest boy in
the world'' and admits to kissing him; and she is hoping to be a
movie star. She also tells Mundy, ``I wish stories were more about
my music, instead of the personal questions.'' Somehow I think she
would get a lot less press if that particular dream came true.

WOMEN GRADUATES GET THE WRONG IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just once, for a change of pace, wouldn't it be something to
hear a commencement speaker caution an audience of bright young men
against expecting to ``have it all'' in life?
</P>
<P>
   It's that season again and, across the land, college graduates
are being urged to follow their dreams, to aim high, to reach for
the stars. Well, not all college graduates. It is only at elite
women's colleges that graduates are told to choose their path
carefully, to beware the compromises ahead, to avoid the minefield
of motherhood lest their careers be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it was Joyce Purnick, an editor at The New York
Times, telling Barnard College graduates it was impossible to be
both a mother and a high-achieving journalist. She must never have
bumped into Anna Quindlen _ Barnard '74, Pulitizer Prize winner,
mother of three _ in the ladies room.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes modern artist Judy Chicago to warn Smith College
graduates of the ``pernicious lie'' that they can be mothers and
accomplished professionals of any sort. ``I looked to history and
discovered that those women who had achieved at the level at which
I had set my sights had been childless and those that were not had
suffered constant guilt at not being able to meet the demands of
both their work and their children,'' she told the Class of 2000,
on Mother's Day no less.
</P>
<P>
   Some choice: childlessness or professional mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Both Purnick and Chicago are women of no small achievement.
Purnick is the first woman to run the metropolitan section of the
Times. Chicago is a feminist icon for ``The Dinner Party,'' her
1979 tribute to historically significant but unheralded women. By
choice or happenstance, neither woman had children. Chicago once
told an interviewer that she ``felt fortunate that my own
biological needs were entirely drowned out by an overpowering
creative drive.'' It is wonderful that, at 60, she has lived the
life she wanted. But isn't it a tad presumptuous to tell young
women that her path is the only path to success? Why shouldn't
Smith grads demand, instead, a workplace and a culture that gives
them the same shot at parenthood and accomplishment as their
brothers?
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to deny the obvious. In a world of inadequate
child care and inflexible work schedules, of course it is more
difficult for women than men to juggle baby and briefcase. Of
course there is guilt. But struggle and guilt are the price of
admission to the human condition. If you don't have kids to feel
guilty about, chances are you have a mother.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, trade-offs are required to balance children and a
career, but they aren't nearly as Draconian as Chicago would have
Smith women believe. Have children and a career; just don't count
on clean floors or folded laundry. Have children and a career; just
don't expect to sleep in on Saturdays. Have children and a career;
just don't expect to recognize any title on any bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   Your life won't be all work and school plays, though. You'll
entertain, but forget ``Cooking with Julia''; you'll discover
Gourmet-to-Go. You'll learn that dim lighting does more than set
the mood for a dinner party; it hides the peanut butter stains on
the upholstered chairs. You'll even find time for a hobby, but
forget that neat, perennial border Martha Stewart is hawking;
you'll want to cultivate the messy cottage garden look. In a pinch,
when confronted by an irate neighbor, you'll pass off your
overgrown lawn as a natural meadow.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing graduates of women's colleges need to be told at
their commencements is to work harder. Greater numbers of them
already pursue studies in mathematics and the natural sciences.
More of them already go on to earn advanced degrees and higher
levels of achievement in the professions, government, business, and
the arts than do their co-ed counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate for you to discover that choices must be made
after you had already made those whose consequences will shape your
life for years to come,'' Chicago said on Sunday in Northampton,
warning of the dangers lurking in the Pampers aisle. ``I believe
that it is important to be clear about your goals and to be willing
to shape your life in a way that makes them possible to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what's even more important, ladies? To realize that no
one can totally shape her life. How boring if we could. Don't set
out on your path looking down for minefields. Look up, follow your
dreams, aim high, and reach for the stars, instead.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Check the facts before you smirk
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Yesterday, there at the post office, I was going
through my mail, separating the bills from the junk mail, throwing
away the junk mail and wishing I could throw away the bills ...
</P>
<P>
   I came to a letter from the National Organization for Women.
Without thinking twice, I tossed it into the waste basket. Then I
stopped, and I thought twice.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I guess I thought three times. That's how many stories
came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 1: I was a young man attending Sunday school. The
controversial issue of abortion was much in the news. I asked my
Sunday school teacher what the Bible had to say about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Old Testament law, my Sunday school teacher said,
if a pregnant woman is injured by someone in a fight and the injury
results in her miscarriage, then the person who injured her is
guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   That settled it for me. If you're going to believe in the Bible,
best you believe what it says. No telling how many people I told
that to.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until some time later that I happened to come across
the scripture for myself and found out differently.
</P>
<P>
   According to Old Testament law, if a pregnant woman is injured
by someone in a fight, and the injury results in her miscarriage,
then the person who injured her is subject to a fine. Only if the
woman dies is he guilty of murder. (Exodus 2l: 22-23.)
</P>
<P>
   No telling how many people I had told wrong. I felt like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 2: I was a cub reporter. The controversial issue of a
federally funded regional council of governments was much in the
news, part of JFK's New Frontier programs to ensure good housing
standards.
</P>
<P>
   My little hometown of Lufkin, its leadership fearing creeping
socialism, refused to join. The regulations, I was told, were
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' an elected official said, ``it would be
mandatory that all houses have screen doors. Some of Lufkin's
finest homes don't have screen doors. It would be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think to ask to see it in writing. But I told no
telling how many people how ridiculous it would be.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until some time later that I happened to ask a
proponent of the council of governments how he could justify
requiring screen doors on all houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the regulations actually say,'' he told me, ``is that all
houses are required to have a screen door where the door is used
for ventilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he showed it to me in writing. I felt like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 3: I was a young editor. The controversial Equal
Rights Amendment, supported by the National Organization for Women,
was much in the news.
</P>
<P>
   It was common knowledge, widely repeated, that such an amendment
could result in uni-sex restrooms. I had used that argument myself,
no telling how many times.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, a woman reporter who worked on a big-city
newspaper, was trying to convince me the ERA would advance women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what you women really want?'' I said, smirking.
``Uni-sex restrooms?''
</P>

   ``We already have uni-sex restrooms,'' she said. ``It's what all
of us have in our homes. It's not a problem, because there's a lock
on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   I had never taken the time to think it through. Boy, did I feel
like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   That was a long time ago and the ERA was never ratified by
enough states to become law.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, there at the post office, I fished the letter
from the National Organization for Women out of the waste basket,
opened it and read it. It was asking for contributions to advance
women's rights. I wrote a check and mailed it back. I felt better.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS _ TAKE 1
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot in the media about Sen. John McCain
finally endorsing Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president, but I
don't recall seeing anything about Bill Bradley doing so for Vice
President Al Gore. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: When Bradley quit the Democratic presidential race in early
March, he said he would ``support'' Gore and would campaign for
him. However, the former New Jersey senator pointedly did not use
the word ``endorse.'' Asked why, he told reporters: ``It's your
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also didn't release his delegates to Gore. Bradley had
412 delegates, compared to Gore's 1,424. ``They've been loyal
supporters and deserve to have their voices heard (at the
Democratic National Convention),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today, meanwhile, reports that a joint appearance between
Gore and Bradley may be in the works. Although Bradley hasn't
spoken to Gore since March 9 and the two sides have had a
``non-relationship,'' according to Bradley's staff, a Gore
spokesman said the campaigns are in ``close contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's a government Web site with safety tips
for foreign travel. Where can I can find it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department posts information online at
http://travel.state.gov/travelwarnings.html; or you can call
202-647-5225.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been interested in the Lewis &AMP; Clark Expedition for
several years, and have visited many sites along the trail. Where
are their original diaries stored?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are kept in temperature- and humidity-controlled
conditions at the American Philosophical Society Museum in
Philadelphia, according to a spokeswoman for the Lewis &AMP; Clark
Center in St. Charles, Mo. They aren't available for public
viewing. Scholarly researchers may be able to see them, but only
under strict conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She added that a traveling Lewis &AMP; Clark exhibition is planned
``in a couple of years.'' It will have many artifacts, but details
aren't yet available. She didn't know its schedule, itinerary, or
even what it might contain. If you haven't seen anything about it
by the end of 2001, call the Lewis &AMP; Clark Center for information:
636-947-3199.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the water that comes as a gel and can be
used in gardening? Where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of Soil Moist, although it isn't exactly
what you're describing. It sounds like it would serve the purpose,
however. It's a granular product that can be added to pots. When
you water the pots, the granules form a clear gel that gradually
releases water into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   It's available in two sizes at gardening centers: 3 ounces for
$3.97 and one pound for $18.97. In summer, most container gardens
require daily watering, so the gels are ideal for when people are
away from home on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about tickets to the NCAA men's
basketball Final Four tournament in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ticket application information for the 2002 Final Four, March
30 and April 1 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, won't be available
until March 2001. NCAA spokeswoman Megan Wallace advises checking
online at www.ncaachampionships.com in late March 2001for further
information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the U.S. Mint issued any state commemorative quarters so
far in 2000? It seems like I have seen two new ones.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right you are. The first issue of the Mint's 50 state
quarters program this year is for Massachusetts. It features a
design of the minuteman, the famous statue at The Minuteman
National Historical Park in Concord. The year's second quarter, for
Maryland, highlights the dome of the Maryland Statehouse. Next is
South Carolina, to be followed by New Hampshire and Virginia. The
Mint is issuing five new quarters a year over a 10-year period.
This is the second year of the program.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, you can keep up with all the state quarters as
they're issued at www.usmint.gov/50states/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who or what is Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico
named for? It hasn't been mentioned in all the reporting about the
disastrous fire around Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   A: The name comes from Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier
(1840-1914), a Swiss-American explorer, anthropologist and
archaeologist whose main interest was the Indians of the American
Southwest. He was an early advocate of ``participant observation,''
learning about the Indians not only by living with them and
studying their culture, but also by studying their artifacts and
the ruins on their land.
</P>
<P>
   One of his primary goals was to dispel white Americans' myths
about the Indians. The best way to do that, he concluded, was by
living with the Indians and then writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his research was published as ``Final Report of
Investigations Among the Indians of the Southwestern Portion of the
United States'' (1890 and 1892). In 1903, he joined the staff of
the American Museum of Natural History and later he lectured on
Spanish-American literature at Columbia University. In 1911 he went
to Spain, where he worked until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson officially designated the area
encompassing Frijoles Canyon as Bandelier National Monument. Many
archaeological sites, such as Shohakka Pueblo, Tsankawi and San
Miguel, are within its 50 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any multi-state lotteries other than Big Game and
Powerball?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, one other: the Tri-State Lottery (Maine, New Hampshire
and Vermont).
</P>
<P>
   Q: President and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President and Mrs. Gore
all attended the funeral in New York for Cardinal John O'Connor.
When both the president and vice president leave Washington for an
occasion such as this, do they travel together on the same
aircraft? Or, for security reasons, do they travel separately?
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House declined to answer specifically whether they
would or would not have been aboard the same aircraft, or what the
policy might be. A spokesman who said he was speaking on
background, and not for attribution, said only that the two had
traveled together on some past campaign trips, but because each now
has a busy schedule, they travel separately more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are any free or inexpensive special events planned in
connection with the baseball All-Star Game, similar to the NFL
Experience during the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The ``blockbuster'' event for the public, as promoters
call it, is the John Hancock All-Star FanFest, scheduled July 7-11
at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta. It will include
interactive games, Major League clinics and seminars, autograph
sessions with players, displays of memorabilia, and other
baseball-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th annual FanFest, leading up to the 71st All-Star Game
July 11 at Turner Field, is described as ``the biggest single
baseball event in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any details about a class-action suit against
Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses?
</P>
<P>
   A: A federal judge in New York has granted class-action status
to about 60 lawsuits that charge the two auction houses with
colluding to fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The Wall Street Journal, it's a blow to Sotheby's
and Christie's because the ruling, issued late last month by U.S.
District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, allows plaintiffs seeking
millions of dollars in damages to avoid the expense and trouble of
separate trials.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan defined the class broadly as anyone who bought or sold
articles through the defendant auction houses from Jan. 1, 1993,
through Feb. 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses are under investigation by the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division. At issue is whether the two
concerns colluded when, within weeks of each other, they changed
fees charged to buyers and sellers at auction. Together, the two
houses control about 95 percent of a $4 billion worldwide auction
market.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan has set a tentative trial date of February 2001 in the
event no settlement is reached earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We will be visiting D.C. in June and wonder about the status
of the restoration project at the Washington Monument. Will the
monument be reopened by then?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, no. Initially it was scheduled to reopen by July 4,
but that won't happen, according to Donna Desormeaux of the
Washington, DC Convention and Visitors Association. The restoration
and refurbishment project is nearly complete, but the best estimate
for reopening is ``sometime later this summer.'' Until then, the
National Park Service recommends that visitors check out the
interpretive center on the monument's grounds.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS _ TAKE 2
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ... or online at www.washington.org/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the scoring system in baseball? What numbers
correspond to which positions?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the numbers assigned to each defensive player's
position: 1, pitcher; 2, catcher; 3, first baseman; 4, second
baseman; 5, third baseman; 6, shortstop; 7, left fielder; 8, center
fielder; 9, right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   An out is noted by listing the numbers of the players who touch
the ball. For example, a ground ball that is hit to the shortstop
who throws it to first base for an out is noted as 6-3. A
short-to-second-to-first double play: 6-4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of other symbols are used in recording the events of a
game, and people may have their own variations. A strikeout is a K,
but if it's on a called strike, the K is reversed. Base hits are 1B
(single), 2B (double), 3B (triple) and HR (home run).
</P>
<P>
   Other common abbreviations include BB (base on balls), E
(error), FC (fielder's choice, meaning a fielder catches a ground
ball and tries to get a runner out instead of the batter; or the
batter does reach first base safely, but isn't given credit for a
base hit); HBP (hit by pitch); PB (passed ball); WP (wild pitch); S
(sacrifice bunt); SF (sacrifice fly); L (lined out); F (flied out);
and CS (caught stealing).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever happened to actor Paul Reubens, who played the
character Pee-wee Herman? He had some personal problems a few years
ago, but I haven't seen anything about him since. Is he still in
show business?
</P>
<P>
   A: He appears to be finished with the ``sabbatical,'' as he
termed it, that followed in the wake of his 1991 arrest and
conviction for indecent exposure in a Florida adult theater.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, CBS pulled his ``Pee-wee's Playhouse''
series off the air, and stores yanked Pee-wee toys off the shelves.
He was the punchline in countless jokes, and even he made a joke
about himself on an MTV video music awards program a few weeks
after his arrest. He stepped out of the public eye, building up his
``ET'' memorabilia collection, gardening, and spending time with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Now he appears to be moving to regain his ruined career,
although taking it slowly. In 1995, he appeared in a recurring role
as a TV executive on ``Murphy Brown.'' He also had parts in the
films ``Dunston Checks In,'' ``Matilda'' and ``Mystery Men,'' and
finished a Dwight Yoakam-directed Western, ``South of Heaven, West
of Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   As he told an interviewer last year, he also plans to resurrect
Pee-wee in what he termed ``a semi-autobiographical movie . . .
about fame in our times. Pee-wee becomes famous and turns into a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the five most-populated countries in the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of population, the world's largest country is China,
with an estimated 1.25 billion inhabitants in mid-1999 (one-fifth
of the world's total population). India, which recently topped 1
billion, ranks No. 2. The next three, as listed in World Almanac
and Book of Facts 2000: United States, with about 273 million
people in 1999; Indonesia, 216 million; and Brazil, 172 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Reports about the funeral for Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York stated that there are eight remaining U.S. cardinals. Who are
they? Also, can you explain the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic
Church?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there are seven active cardinals in the United
States, not eight, said David Early of the U.S. Catholic Conference
in Washington. They are Cardinals Anthony Bevilacqua, Archdiocese
of Philadelphia; Francis George, Chicago; James Hickey, Washington,
D.C.; William Keeler, Baltimore; Bernard Law, Boston; Roger Mahony,
Los Angeles; and Adam Maida, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other American cardinals, but they are working
in the Vatican, Early added.
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchy (organization of the clergy by rank) starts with
the pope, or Holy Father, who is head of the Roman Catholic Church
and the highest member of its clergy. Below the pope, in decreasing
order, are cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons.
The pope and bishops are responsible for the pastoral governance of
the Church.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, between the two sacramental orders of bishop and
priest, you sometimes find monsignor, a purely honorary title
granted to certain priests in recognition of exceptional service to
the Church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused about the Catholic practice for cardinals, such
as the late John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, to have the first
name before the title. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's simply Catholic tradition, explained Bill Ryan of the
U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington, but it isn't universally
followed. ``Sometimes it's Cardinal followed by the first and last
names,'' Ryan added. General newspaper style, however, is to put
the title before the name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on the title of cardinal in the Roman Catholic
Church, which sometimes appears before a first name, and sometimes
between the first and last names. Can you explain the origin of its
use in the latter way?
</P>
<P>
   A: It derives from an 18th century English custom, said Bill
Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington. Various nobles
_ such as Alfred Lord Tennyson _ rearranged their names and titles
for their own purposes. The practice was imitated by many courts in
Europe at the time, Ryan added, and survives to the present day,
although it's not common. As he explained earlier, it's not always
followed by the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what exactly is a balk?
</P>
<P>
   A: The purpose of the balk rule _ which was adopted in 1899 _ is
to limit what the pitcher is allowed to do in an attempt to pick
off a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it's pretty simple: When the pitcher is on the mound
and his foot is in contact with the rubber, he cannot fake one
thing and then do another. He cannot fake a pitch and then throw to
a base, or fake a throw to a base and then pitch. If he starts
either action, he must finish that action without hesitation or
alteration.
</P>
<P>
   The rule specifies many specific actions, but it is a judgment
of the umpire as to whether or not one action was started (and not
completed).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently printed a poem that starts off ``Monday's child
is fair of face,'' and so on through the days of the week. This has
started a controversy in my family, because we can't find out what
day of the week we all were born on. Is there any such thing as a
perpetual calendar? Calendar companies used to distribute them free
years ago, but I can't find any now, and I've been told that
they're no longer available.
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the World Book Encyclopedia, Volume C, and under
Calendar you'll find three tables showing the day of the week for
any year desired, 1753 to 2030. The letters in the Table of Years
refer to the first column of the Table of Months. The figures in
the Table of Months refer to one of seven columns in the Table of
Days.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, to find what day of the week Christmas fell on in
1900, you'd look for 1900 in the Table of Years. It's followed by
the letter a. Look for a in the Table of Months, and under
December, you'll find the number 6. In the Table of Days, column 6
tells you that the 25th day, Christmas, fell on a Tuesday in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat easier if you're online. Go to
http://dmarie.com/asp/history.asp?action &QC; process. Enter the date
you're interested in, press Go, and information pops up showing
which day of the week it was, the top news stories of the day, most
popular songs of the times, average house and car prices, and more.
Another good eternal calendar site is www.aia-and.com/eternal.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Coca-Cola's million-dollar prize offer at Turner Field
in Atlanta be in effect during this summer's All-Star Game Home Run
Derby? What about during the All-Star Game itself?
</P>
<P>
   A: Atlanta Braves spokesman Glen Serra says Coke ended its $1
million reward in April for hitters who reached the Sky Field, in
the third deck in left field. No one ever did it, although on April
20 Andres Galarraga hit a towering shot that struck one foot from
the top of the foul pole, threatening to reach the ``unreachable''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter soon will achieve the Gold Award from the Girl
Scouts. It's the highest honor Scouts can get. Who are some of
better-known recipients of this award? I'm having trouble locating
a listing of previous notable recipients.
</P>
<P>
   A: The reason you're having trouble is because there is no such
list. While many former Girl Scouts have gone on to become famous
in later life, records have not been kept showing which ones
received Gold Awards, said Ellen Christie-Ach of the organization's
New York office. It would be safe to conclude, however, that at
least some famous former Scouts achieved the Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you print the words to the Molson beer commercial, ``I
am Canadian Joe''?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the transcript of the commercial, ``Joe's Rant,'' as
performed by actor Jeff Douglas:
</P>
<P>
   I am not a lumberjack, or a fur trader.
</P>
<P>
   I don't live in an igloo,
</P>
<P>
   or eat blubber, or own a dogsled,
</P>
<P>
   and I don't know Jimmy, Suzie, or Sally from Canada,
</P>
<P>
   although I am certain they are really, really nice.
</P>
<P>
   I have a prime minister, not a president
</P>
<P>
   I speak English and French, not American
</P>
<P>
   I pronounce it ``about,'' not ``a boot''
</P>
<P>
   I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack
</P>
<P>
   I believe in peacekeeping, not policing
</P>
<P>
   Diversity, not assimilation
</P>
<P>
   and that the beaver is a proud and noble animal.
</P>
<P>
   The tuque is a hat,
</P>
<P>
   A chesterfield is a couch,
</P>
<P>
   And ``Z'' is pronounced zed, not zee, ZED
</P>
<P>
   Canada is the second-largest land mass,
</P>
<P>
   The first nation of hockey, and
</P>
<P>
   the best part of North America!
</P>
<P>
   My name is Joe, and
</P>
<P>
   I am Canadian!

AUTHORS DETAIL THE RANGE OF VISIONS OF HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven, it seems, is a place, and a state of mind. It is ancient
and it is eternal. It is bliss and it is peace.
</P>
<P>
   To the ancient Icelanders, heaven was an extraordinary land of
ice bridges and flaming mountains.
</P>
<P>
   To the ancient Greeks, it was Mount Olympus, home to a whole
family of gods.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish mystic described the exact measurements of God, with
his heart of 70 names and his neck measuring 130,000,000 parasangs.
</P>
<P>
   And Dante envisioned the classical heaven, with angels gathered
around a divine throne, singing the praises of God.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, humanity has conjured up endless visions of life
after death, and now a husband-and-wife team of religion scholars
at Smith College has compiled an anthology of writings about heaven
that span the spectrum of time and genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are comic ways, satiric ways, approaches that find
heaven to be beautiful or amusing, people finding heaven to be
solemn or serious or a garden of delights,'' said Philip Zaleski,
who edited ``The Book of Heaven'' ($30, Oxford University Press),
with his wife Carol. ``Colorful material existed in equal measure
in literary fiction and in religious writings meant to be taken
literally. Both approaches produced wildly imaginative and colorful
heavenly creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern theologians sometimes shy away from literal images of
heaven, preferring to think of heaven as simply a state of being in
God's presence. And Sigmund Freud famously denounced heaven as a
``compensatory fantasy,'' saying that the human ego could not
accept the notion of its own death.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle Ages people were not so much worried about
whether there was an afterlife, but how they would fare at
judgment, and they needed to be assured that their sins were
forgiven,'' Carol Zaleski said. ``Today people are worried that
there may be nothing at all after death. The interest in heaven is
not just an interest in a nice afterlife, but in having one at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zaleskis had both been thinking about heaven for years
before embarking on this project at the suggestion of an editor.
Philip Zaleski says his Catholic childhood left him with a strong
notion of heaven as a place where saints and dead relatives live
on; Carol Zaleski said her academic research on near-death
experiences left her wondering about concepts of the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first idea was that heaven is a place where good people go
when they die, but it's actually a lot more than that,'' Carol
Zaleski said. ``In some cultures, especially ancient, it's the
place where the gods live, and there may be three heavens, or seven
heavens, associated with the planetary spheres.''
</P>
<P>
   Some early cultures merged the physical heavens _ the sky and
the stars and the weather systems _ with the spiritual heavens.
Astrology, Carol Zaleski said, most clearly reflects the concept
that life on earth can be understood in terms of changes in the
physical heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The book features poetry and prose, songs and spells, literature
and liturgy. It offers satire by Mark Twain, imagining Captain
Stormfield in heaven, struggling with his wings, and by Julian
Barnes, imagining heaven as a place where there is endless
breakfast and golf and sex but, ultimately, it's boring.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Carol Zaleski said, some of her students seem to envision
heaven as something like Disney's Magic Kingdom, while others fear
that it is akin to an endless church service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever heaven is, as the place that is the reward of the
blessed, it's got to be the best place you can imagine, and people
who write about it use their imagination to its fullest extent to
depict something that would meet our deepest longings,'' Carol
Zaleski said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, as they promote the book, the Zaleskis find
themselves asked if they will compile a second anthology, ``The
Book of Hell.'' Each says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to live with all that torment material,''
Carol Zaleski said.

<P>
   Holiday of the week
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is Buddha Day, a holiday called Vesak or Visakha Puja
day, which is the most important celebration in the Buddhist year.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday, sometimes celebrated on alternate dates by some
Buddhists, marks the birth, enlightenment and death of Siddhartha
Gautama of southern Nepal, who came to be known as the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   Gautama, whose life is generally dated to the sixth century BC,
was the son of a royal family who achieved enlightenment _
realizing his ability to overcome suffering _ and then taught for
45 years.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday is generally celebrated at temples, where religious
texts are chanted, and in the home, where pictures of the Buddha's
life are hung and candles are lit, according to Christopher Queen,
an expert on Buddhism at Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   The most distinctive ritual of the day, Queen said, is the
pouring of water of the head of a statue of the baby Buddha. Some
celebrants also release caged birds and perform charitable acts,
such as distributing cash to the underprivileged or visiting
orphanages.

&HT;     EXECUTIVE GOES FROM COMPUTERS TO WINE ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The siren song of business-to-business (B2B)
Internet commerce is wafting through even the biggest, most
established corporations, luring top-drawer talent away from
blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
   One case in point: Mei-ling Cheng, the former chief information
officer at Hewlett-Packard Co., has jumped to Net newcomer
WineExchange.com to become its chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Founded just last year and set to launch at www.wineexchange.com
in late June, WineExchange.com is an on-line broker and source of
information for growers, suppliers, retailers and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng said she believes her new employer will be well-positioned
to compete in the small but growing on-line wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors for WineExchange.com include winebuyer.com and
eVine. Moreover, consumer sites such as Wine.com target general
wine drinkers in search of that perfect $10 bottle of California
Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is ready to grow more pervasively,'' Cheng said
in a telephone interview. ``I felt if I was able to get outside a
singular company and do more with more companies, it would be a
great challenge. What excites me is changing how things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. wine trade, 90 percent of which is centered in
California, Cheng said the Internet can prove especially useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole supply chain process can be more and more
streamlined on line,'' she said. ``And the Internet can drive the
availability of information itself, making it more timely and more
widely available.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing that wine is a relationship-based business, Cheng said
she does not think the Internet ``will ever replace
person-to-person business. We're people, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she said, she has found the wine business open to new
ideas from the new world of technology to the old world of vines
and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine producers have been very receptive. I think I had
that fear: What is the acceptance going to be like?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fear has been unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng is not the first executive to decamp from pure high-tech
companies and move into the world of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Lew Platt, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, also has
made the move, recently leaving Silicon Valley for Sonoma County
where he is chief executive of Kendall-Jackson wines.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng herself worked for Hewlett-Packard for 25 years, rising to
vice president in the company's LaserJet Imaging Systems and
Computer Products business.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Palo Alto company, Cheng managed the re-engineering
of the corporation's supply chain for order fulfillment. Prior to
that, the Stanford graduate was worldwide administrative systems
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have wine in my blood,'' she said, ``but I think the
wine business is the next vertical business for the Internet.''

THERE'S FAMOUS, AND THEN THERE'S WHATEVER I AM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A comedy writer named Bruce Vilanch is staging what sounds like
a very amusing one-man show in New York. It is called ``Almost
Famous.'' Granted, no one has ever heard of him, but he is almost
famous. He has written for ``The Brady Bunch Variety Hour'' and
concocted shticks for the Oscar broadcast. He also appears on
``Hollywood Squares.'' ``Squares'' is to fame as that patch of sky
over Providence is to Logan Airport. You're holding; you're almost
there.
</P>
<P>
   Demifame is a subject of no small interest to me. I have been
there. ``60 Minutes'' taped an interview with me (defending Boston
University president John Silber) and then never ran it. (Of
course.) I often appear on talk shows in late summer, when the real
opinionators are on vacation. You've never heard me, because you're
on vacation, too.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I write columns for the Boston Globe, but that yields a
mediated form of notoriety. Inevitably, a ``fan'' approaches me at
a party and fulsomely praises ``that piece you wrote on (insert
pressing societal concern here.)'' A few quick questions reveal
that the actual author of the column was Ellen Goodman. I feel like
Ernest Hemingway, who supposedly woke up on a Moscow park bench
after a bracing drunk, and woozily begged a policeman for special
treatment. ``I am a famous American writer,'' Hemingway pleaded.
``Ah, John Steinbeck!'' the cop exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not half as semifamous as the singer-songwriter
Christine Lavin, whose work I adore. ``You've heard of me. Maybe,''
Lavin wrote in a hilarious Washington Post article called ``Who is
That Woman?'' ``I might be that actress who worked at Mel's Diner.
Or the screenwriter whom Mark Fuhrman used the N-word with.'' It's
true that her name is easily confused. I once bought a ticket to a
Patty Larkin concert, thinking she was Christine Lavin. Larkin has
her allure, but she's no Christine Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's first brush with semifame came in 1981, when she sang
her song ``Prince Charles'' on the ``Today'' show. Presciently, she
urged Charles not to marry Diana:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, I know she's pretty
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know she's rich
</P>
<P>
   But I read in the National Enquirer
</P>
<P>
   Lady Diana is a . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has recorded 13 solo albums, performed everywhere, and
authored perhaps the funniest song ever written, ``Sensitive New
Age Guys.'' (Check out the verse that rhymes ``premenstrual
syndrome'' with ``Seattle Kingdome.'' For that matter, check out
the cabaret version, sung entirely in German, at
christinelavin.com.) At a private benefit concert a few years ago,
the man who hired her suggested she should cut a record. At that
time, she had done six.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I received a unexpected fan letter from Lavin,
who lives in Manhattan. (She didn't like ``American Beauty,''
either.) I paraded around the paper's ``arts'' section, boasting
that I had received a fan letter from Christine Lavin. No one had
any idea who I was talking about. Sic transit Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite five-seconds-of-fame story concerns my wife. Eight
hundred years ago, she and I were correspondents in Moscow. At a
glittering embassy reception, we bumped into the musicians Chick
Corea and Gary Burton, who, even then, were genuinely famous. I
introduced myself, and they nodded politely. My wife gave her name
and Burton effused:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you (itals)the(unitals) Kirsten Lundberg?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was. At the time, National Public Radio couldn't
afford foreign bureaus and used United Press International
reporters like my wife to file dispatches from faraway lands.
Burton was an avid listener. So for him, my wife was as famous as
Sylvia what's-her-name, who reports out of Rome. The one with the
trilly voice; I'll remember her name in a second.

   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Two red signs on either side of a giant cross
at the Espousal Retreat House here shout ``MORE'' and ``DEEPER,''
amplifying what the Rev. Tom DiLorenzo and the adherents who flock
to his twice-weekly worship services want most out of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday night about 150 people danced to the
strains of a guitar, chanting rhythmically. Some lifted their arms
toward heaven, others shook tambourines.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later most lay on the ground, ``slain in the spirit.''
Some spoke in tongues. A few cackled or giggled uncontrollably.
Others saw visions.
</P>
<P>
   This style of worship, with its extreme emotions and
supernatural elements, is part and parcel of the pentecostal
movement that has swept the globe in the past century.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo, however, is a Catholic priest. Most of his adherents
are Catholics who travel from all across New England for what they
call a life-changing spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   While charismatic worship, as it is known, is far from the
mainstream of the Roman Catholic Church, it's popularity has been
snowballing worldwide. In Latin American, it offers hope of
competition against the explosion of pentecostalism. In the United
States, it speaks to individuals who find traditional Catholic
liturgies dry and passive.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country between 250,000 to 500,000 Catholics call
themselves active charismatics, according to Walter Matthews,
director of the national service committee of the Catholic
Charismatic Renewal in Locust Grove, Va. Thirty years ago, almost
no one did.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo is convinced it is the beginning of a movement that
will transform modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we are at the foothills of revival,'' said
DiLorenzo, administrator of Holy Rosary Church in Winthrop.
``Something's happening that's never happened before. There's
greater ease, greater joy, greater healing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Archdiocese of Boston, about 55 English-speaking
charismatic groups meet regularly, according to David Thorp of the
archdiocese's office of charismatic renewal services.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some three dozen Spanish-speaking groups, a
handful of Haitian groups, and at least one Portuguese, he said.
(Unlike DiLorenzo's groups, most are organized by lay people rather
than priests.)
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Kent, the mother of a four-year-old who does public
relations at a local university, spends all week looking forward to
DiLorenzo's Wednesday night services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of healing comes from being in the presence of the
Lord,'' Kent said. ``I feel it. It's not an intellectual thing. And
it's changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic worship ``may be very helpful to people who need to
be more expressive,'' said the Rev. Joseph Nolan, a Boston College
theology professor who teaches Catholicism. ``We need more of that
in our parishes. We could use a little more expressive joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic ``charismatic renewal'' officially began in
the United States in 1967 with retreats and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   While such practices as speaking in tongues and ``baptism in the
spirit,'' still strike many Catholics as odd, they are derived from
the New Testament and enjoy a stamp of approval from church
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Every United States archdiocese has a liaison to charismatic
groups. In 1997, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued
a report stating that charismatic renewal has brought alienated
Catholics back to the church, inspired men to become priests and
encouraged religious commitment among young people.
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo said his twice-weekly charismatic services are just
another form of Catholic worship, no better than Sunday Mass or
Bible study. What they add to more traditional prayer, he said, is
inspiration to people seeking participatory religion or those moved
by what they believe are supernatural experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Past midnight at one recent service, after five hours of
exuberant prayer, worshipers gathered under a reading light to
exclaim over the gold-colored dust they believe God sprinkled on
the hands of a few worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   They told of smelling roses when there were no roses, of hearing
flutes when there were no flutes. And, DiLorenzo said, he sensed
that a worshiper's injured knee had been healed. (He believes his
services have also cured broken bones and even cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the gold, it's not even about healing,''
DiLorenzo said. ``God casts out a net. People might come to see the
gold, and the Lord touches their heart and changes their whole
life.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, skeptics. Even as Nolan says singing and
dancing can be powerful forms of prayer, he scoffs at the notion of
gold dust. He adds that the physical healing of ailments has been
extremely rare in Catholic history.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Nolan does not believe it is God who causes worshipers
to buckle and fall to the ground, ``slain in the spirit,'' when
DiLorenzo lays his hands on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that an emotional overload,'' Nolan said. ``You do
strange things when you're in an emotional state.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying charismatic worship is a belief that God has a
physical presence that lay people can experience directly.
DiLorenzo's adherents say that presence has transformed them.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, 32, says she has spent years grieving over a difficult
childhood and an absent father. Neither faith nor conventional
therapy helped her the way DiLorenzo's style of prayer did. When
she started attending two years ago, she often cried through the
service. Now she dances joyfully for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feeling of just immense love,'' Kent said.
``Catholics don't realize what they have. They don't realize that
there's more.''
</P>
<P>
   DiLorenzo has been leading charismatic prayer for about four
years, since his ``lifeless'' Bible study group began
experimenting, hoping for divine inspiration. It's grown from just
a few people to a few hundred who go to Holy Rosary on Sunday
nights or the Espousal Retreat House on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud to have attracted worshipers of all ages, saying the
Church especially needs young men. One is Craig Johnson, 23.
Johnson, a fan of bands Phish and the Grateful Dead before he
became religious, is now considering the priesthood. For him,
``crying out and speaking in tongues is a way of expression,
pouring out my heart in a way that goes beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic worship has cured Ellen O'Leary of her addiction to
soap operas, she says, and inspired her to give up alcohol. She
believes these self-improvements comes from an openness to God not
found in most church pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most church people are very rigid. They're not happy, They're
closed up,'' said O'Leary, 58. And that, DiLorenzo says, is a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are passionate. We have a passionate God,'' DiLorenzo said.
``You go to a basketball or hockey game and people are passionate.
But if we're passionate in church they think we're out of our
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the priest, added: ``Spare me from being lukewarm!''

SEQUESTERED JURIES BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a day of testimony, Massachusetts jurors, even those in
the highest-profile cases such as the Reggie Lewis medical
malpractice case or the 1998 murder trial of British au pair Louise
Woodward, do something that 15 years ago would have been
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   They go home.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly because of cost and partly in consideration of the
emotional well-being of jurors, judges routinely send them home
each evening on nothing more than a pledge to avoid television,
radio, and newspaper coverage of their case.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the days when jurors in major cases were
locked away in hotel rooms under the watchful eye of court officers
who controlled every aspect of their lives, from censoring their
news diet to eavesdropping on their telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequestering a jury, is, except for the brutality, like
imprisoning them in a medium-security prison,'' said Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel, who presided over the Woodward
case. ``They wake up when they are told. They eat when they are
told. They go to sleep when they are told. Their freedom is
restricted. One does not sequester a jury lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zobel did order the Woodward jurors sequestered during
deliberations, even that limited practice is becoming increasingly
rare, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the wide-open approach comes at a time when jurors
face a confluence of influences, from Court TV to nonstop legal
commentary on 24-hour cable channels, making it far more likely
that deliberations could be infected. And some wonder whether it's
wise to put jurors on the honor system, given the widely held
belief among veteran prosecutors and defense attorneys that jurors
routinely peek at television news and the newspaper when they go
home _ and then fib about it the next day when judges ask whether
they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, with any rule, there are people who are going to
bend or break it,'' said Andrew Good, one of Woodward's lawyers who
failed to persuade Zobel to sequester the jury for the length of
the case. ``Of course, there are a million faults in the system and
that's just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that the near-total shift away from sequestering
juries represents one of the biggest changes in the Massachusetts
trial system in the last 20 years. Yet the manner in which it was
adopted may be even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In an area of law where change is either glacial or imposed by
higher courts, state judges say the move away from locking up
juries was relatively quick and spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Legislature passed a statute or the SJC
decided a case,'' said state Jury Commissioner Frank Davis. ``It
was more of a groundswell in the court where judges decided that
the hardship it imposed didn't seem necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jasper Bing, who served as foreman during the 1981
trial of notorious art thief Myles J. Connor in the murder of a
Boston police officer. He recalls his Dorchester neighbors watching
as a uniformed court officer in a cruiser with its lights flashing
escorted him home so he could pack a toothbrush and some clothes
for what turned out to be 28 days of sequestration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in their yards saying, `Ooh, what did Bing do?' ''
recalled the 56-year-old Green Line trolley driver.
</P>
<P>
   He and his fellow jurors weren't allowed to go home for
Thanksgiving. Instead, their families were invited to join them for
a turkey-and-trimmings dinner in their East Boston hotel _ as a
uniformed court officer stood at each table to make sure no one
talked about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a downer, but there wasn't really much we could do
about it,'' Bing said.
</P>
<P>
   Group bowling trips and touch-football games behind the hotel
weren't enough to keep the group from going a bit stir-crazy at the
end, Bing said, and there were times he stepped in to head off
flare-ups between some of his frazzled fellow jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Such stresses are a key reason that the practice has been
largely abandoned here and elsewhere, according to G. Thomas
Munsterman, director of the Center for Jury Studies at the National
Center for State Courts in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the center found that ``sequestration for the
length of trial'' was rated as the number-two source of juror
stress, trumped only by ``deciding whether to give the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sequestering costs _ room and board for 12 people, plus
court-officer salaries _ were also a major issue, even during the
state's first sequestering of a jury _ the group of men who in 1770
decided the fate of Captain Thomas Preston, the British commander
involved in the Boston Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Records still exist showing that ``punch, bisquit and cheese''
were served to the Preston jurors for breakfast. Pipes and tobacco
were offered after dinner, which also featured ``punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Good meals were always considered part of the bargain for
jurors' services, but the filet mignons and twin lobsters added up.
Expenses for a single sequestered jury in a murder case _ hotel
rooms, meals, and overtime for court officers _ often ran as high
as $50,000 or more. By contrast, last year the state spent just
$337,000 on all jury-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   One turning point away from automatic sequestration was the
decision by federal judge David Nelson not to lock up the jury for
the duration of the racketeering case against Boston Mafia
underboss Gennaro Angiulo in 1986. The trial went relatively
smoothly, to the surprise of some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Angiulo was tried, it was almost as if we said, `Why are
we wasting all of this money?' '' said Superior Court Judge Robert
A. Barton, who once sequestered a jury on which his boss, the late
chief justice for the Superior Court, Thomas Morse, was serving.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said he believes the new honor system is better.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said trial attorneys who are in court all the time
probably have a more jaded view of jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that the great majority of jurors are
conscientious about their duties,'' Barton said. ``To most of them,
this is the only time they will sit on a significant case. I really
do believe that they rise to the occasion.''

PREAKNESS HERD IS THINNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Actions speak louder than words, and Fusaichi
Pegasus was so impressive winning the Kentucky Derby that most of
the trainers who ran a horse in that race will shut up rather than
show up at Pimlico for Saturday's Preakness, the second leg of the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby field numbered 19; the Preakness field will number no
more than eight. Trainer Todd Pletcher confirmed Tuesday that
Impeachment, who closed for third in the Derby without threatening
the winner, would try the Preakness after working a half-mile in
:48 at Belmont Park. That brings to four the number of Derby
contestants who will give Fusaichi Pegasus another go. The others
are Captain Steve (eighth in the Derby), High Yield (15th), and
Hal's Hope (16th).
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers to the Triple Crown trail are Red Bullet, who ran
second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct April
15; Snuck In, second in the Arkansas Derby on the same date; and
Hugh Hefner, a California-bred who ran second in the Snow Chief for
state-breds at Hollywood Park April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve is trained by Bob Baffert, and High Yield is
trained by D. Wayne Lukas. Both men are in the Preakness because
they believe it is impossible to hold a classic race without
benefit of their participation. Hal's Hope is trained by
88-year-old Harold Rose, and he is running because Rose is enjoying
the banquet circuit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Impeachment is legitimate, though Pimlico does not suit
his late-closing style with its tight turns. Impeachment came from
dead last in the Derby to grab the show in a fine effort, but he
was more than 5 lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus, who never even
knew Impeachment was in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went great, then galloped out (5 furlongs) in 1:00 1/5,''
said Pletcher, who started four horses in the Derby (More Than
Ready, fourth; Trippi, 11th; and Graeme Hall, who was eased) but is
down to one hope. ``Craig Perret will ride him, and he'll van down
Thursday. His style won't be any different for the Preakness. You
couldn't change it if you wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fusaichi Pegasus is due to arrive at Pimlico
Wednesday after zipping 5 furlongs at Churchill Downs in :59
Monday. He will be on the same plane from Louisville that is
bringing Captain Steve and Snuck In. High Yield, Red Bullet, and
Hal's Hope are on the grounds, and Hugh Hefner is expected
Wednesday, following an overnight flight from California.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work (Monday) was a little faster than I wanted, but he's
bright and clear,'' said Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi
Pegasus. ``He went well within himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, who can be high-strung but was a perfect
gentleman in the Derby, is scheduled to arrive around noon, and he
will be stabled on the backstretch rather than in the special
stakes barn Pimlico features behind the grandstand. Drysdale fears
a media circus if the big bay is kept out front.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fusaichi Pegasus will be tested Saturday is what remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here trying to beat one horse,'' said Lukas, who
never gives up. ``We're here because we want to win. We don't pick
out horses to beat in some kind of obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In makes strides
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In breezed a half in :48 at Churchill Tuesday. ``He went
very well, and we're all set,'' said trainer Steve Asmussen. ``He
was a little flat when he ran in the Arkansas Derby, but he's been
training much better. I think he's moved forward consistently since
then. He'll have to improve for this race.'' . . . Captain Steve
really sizzled Monday at Churchill, going 5 furlongs in :58 1/5.
``The horse is doing excellent,'' said Baffert. ``He came out of
the work in great shape.'' . . . High Yield worked at Pimlico
Monday, covering 5 panels in :59. ``It was exactly what we wanted
for him,'' said Lukas. ``He couldn't be doing any better as far as
we can tell.'' . . . Hugh Hefner, who is trained by Martin Jones,
has been ridden by Corey Nakatani in his last three starts, but
Victor Espinoza will ride him in the Preakness . . . Wheelaway,
fifth in the Derby, was the last of those who made the Rose Run to
be declared out of the Preakness. Trainer John Kimmel made the
announcement Monday. ``After conferring with the owners,'' he said,
``it was decided to skip the Preakness, and get the horse ready for
the Belmont Stakes (June 10).''

   NEW YORK _ Picked up pieces from the land of Rudy, Rocket, and
Latrell . . .
</P>
<P>
   --Darn. All this time I was hoping that the Red Sox winning the
World Series was going to be the Third Secret of Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   --Double Secret Probation. That's what Bob Knight got. Indiana
University President Myles Brand, a/k/a Dean Wormer, embarrasses
his school and his state.
</P>
<P>
   --If I'm doing the math correctly, Pedro Martinez will make his
return to the Yankee Stadium mound on Sunday night, May 28, on
ESPN. It'll be Pedro's first New York appearance since his
17-strikeout epic last Sept. 10. His opponent should be Orlando
Hernandez. Have you noticed that the Red Sox make both of their
trips to Yankee Stadium between next Friday and June 14? That's
right. They don't go back to New York after mid-June . . . until
the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   --Jose Canseco has launched his own financial services firm.
Calling Jose to protect your investments sounds about as smart as
assigning Mark Chmura to chaperone your high school prom. Jose must
have learned it all from Jack Clark. Let's have a name-the-company
contest for Jose. How about ``Yahoo on Yahoo''?
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-two points, 16 assists, 10 rebounds, great hair. Kidd
Jason had a pretty good game against the Lakers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   --With the Yankees trailing, 2-0, in the ninth in Detroit
Sunday, Paul O'Neill tried to bunt his way on. That's as bad as it
gets for the New Yorkers. When the Yankees went 0 for 3 at Comerica
Park, it was noted that they went 0 for 6 at Fenway in the
inaugural year (1912) of our little bandbox.
</P>
<P>
   --It'll be the Avalanche over the Devils in the Stanley Cup
Finals. Ray gets his name on the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   --Enough of the ``way-back'' jokes. John Wasdin quietly has
lowered his ERA to 3.38.
</P>
<P>
   --Next time some wiseguy figures out how much Pedro is getting
paid per pitch, per inning, per strikeout, per win, etc., remember
that Courteney Cox Arquette and Friends are each getting $750,000
per half-hour episode for the next two seasons. Makes Jeff Frye
sound like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   --Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was courtside
for Game 4 in New York. Why can't the Celtics get fans like that?
</P>
<P>
   --Wonder if Larry Bird will tell his Pacers what it was like to
be on the other side when the Celtics came back from a 3-1 deficit
to beat the 76ers in the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals?
</P>
<P>
   --Brand just hired Steve Howe, Darryl Strawberry, and Dennis
Rodman as faculty members. Brand said they're all getting a second
chance and no misbehavior will be tolerated. Zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   --Into their fourth generation of car racing, bad luck caught up
with the Petty family. It's like when on-the-job death visits the
Wallendas. Nothing changes. Risk-taking is a livelihood and a way
of life for these folks.
</P>
<P>
   --Two guys who always will love Knight: Red Auerbach and Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   --The buzz in the Apple is that Michael Jordan is going to hire
former Cambridge Rindge &AMP; Latin and Boston University coach Mike
Jarvis to guide the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   --Lookalikes _ Scribes on the beat have noticed that Pete
Schourek and Cosmo Kramer look a lot alike.
</P>
<P>
   --Wonder if choking a math student gets you fired if you are a
professor at Indiana University?
</P>
<P>
   --Anthony Carter says Charlie Ward scored his 9 straight Game 4
points during garbage time and the Heated rivalry gets better. Who
remembers that the Knick-Heat wars really got going when P.J. Brown
flipped Ward back in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   --Hockey players Travis Roy and John Gilpatrick graduate from
their respective universities, BU and Suffolk, Sunday. Both young
men are the personification of courage and perseverance. Roy was
paralyzed 11 seconds into his first shift at BU. Gilpatrick was
similarly injured just a few weeks later while playing for Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   --How's Knight going to stay well-behaved? Everyone can bait him
now, without fear. I will beg the boss to let me go to Indiana and
open a press conference with, ``Excuse me, Bob, why are you such a
bully and what's with the sweater?''
</P>
<P>
   --George Steinbrenner says he's noticed the Yankees are
struggling and he's unhappy with some players and they know who
they are. Can't wait to see how the Boss reacts if the Sox stuff
the Pinstripes in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   --Prayers go out to Kent Mercker, who's been hospitalized in
California with bleeding in his brain. Not too long ago, he was a
vital part of the Red Sox. The 32-year-old pitched the wild-card
cliching game for Boston in Chicago last year, and also started
three postseason games, including the first and last games of the
ALCS against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   --Coming soon to a store near you: the Red Sox Monopoly Game.
Wonder if the Yawkey Trust is represented near Park Place and
Boardwalk?
</P>
<P>
   --Myles Brand is George McFly. Bobby Knight is Biff.

VIVID CHARACTERS UP THE ANTE AT THE POKER WORLD SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It is near noon, and hundreds of the world's best
poker players are gathered upstairs in the poker room of Binion's
Horseshoe Casino, only minutes away from the latest game in a
three-week marathon that is the World Series of Poker. The best of
the best are here, and the meek, if they are wise, should check
their wallets downstairs at the cashier's window.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe over there by the giant safe near the entrance from
Fremont Street, the safe once owned by Wyatt Earp, the cowboy, and
Tex Rickard, the boxing and sports promoter from the early 1900s,
but later owned by Benny Binion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benny was a marketing genius,'' said ``Oklahoma Johnny'' Hale,
one of the giants of the poker world. ``Benny had the idea to put a
million dollars in a display by the door and people'd come from all
over the world to get their pictures taken by those million
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Real gamblers came here to bet real money; the atmosphere on the
Strip may range from kitsch to tacky to Disney, but here the
atmosphere is Old West.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Binion made a reputation because he'd accept any wager.
``Once a cowboy from Texas showed up with a suitcase and wanted to
bet $1 million on one roll of the dice at craps,'' said Boyd, a
poker player from Harpers Ferry, W.Va. ``Benny took the bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The bettor won his million on that craps game, but, of course,
later came back to lose it all.
</P>
<P>
   And the money went into the safe.
</P>
<P>
   The safe standing there just inside the entrance on Fremont
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The safe with the sign over it.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that explains ``it is presumed'' the safe was looted by
``that person or persons responsible for the murder of Ted Binion
in Sept. 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Clark County Courthouse, just around the corner from
Benny Binion's, a topless dancer and her boyfriend stand accused of
murdering Benny's son as the most notorious trial in the notorious
history of Las Vegas is winding up.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the jury is poked over, Las Vegas style, the with
the ``over/under'' for its deliberations given at 3 1/2 days.
</P>
<P>
   If Benny Binion were alive, he'd take a wager on that. A wager
of any size. But if Benny Binion were still alive, it would have
been 50-50 that the two accused of his son's murder would have
lived long enough to face a jury. The .357 Magnum and the
pearl-handled revolver and the rest of Benny's prized guns hanging
in a display near Wyatt Earp's safe still seem capable of firing
out justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but inside Binion's, upstairs from that safe, there is no
talk about who murdered Benny Binion's son. Oh, there is talk about
how the Horseshoe has slipped since Benny Binion died on Christmas
Day, 1989, about the family feuds that erupted after Benny's death,
about how Becky, his daughter, was a fool for selling off the
million-dollar display once she gained control of the casino, a
fool because tourists used to come from around the world merely for
a snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no . . . the business is too serious upstairs for any
talk about a murder trial. There is poker to be played. For high
stakes. By the best players in the world. The 31st annual World
Series of Poker.
</P>
<P>
   Millions and millions of dollars are to be won. Some 22 events,
each a two-day game involving a different version of poker, all
culminating when The Big One begins, some 450 or so players putting
up $10,000 each to play four days for the ultimate bragging rights
to one of the most competitive games on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare blend of human talent is needed just to get here,
just to push forward $400,000 in chips on the turn of a card. A
near-photographic memory, the ability to instantly calculate the
odds of a certain card turning up, the most exquisite reading of
human nature _ the so-called ``tells'' _ that a poker player exudes
by tone of voice, eyes blinking, body language, and on and on. Many
of these players can ``tell'' if the man or woman pushing forward
that $400,000 in chips is bluffing or has the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   And, courage, most of all.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel did a documentary on last year's World
Series. ``Invincible Vince'' Burgio, a Hall of Fame poker player,
said, ``It was the highest-rated show the Discovery Channel ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Buss, the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, will be
here, whether or not his team is playing in the playoffs. So will
Hollywood types such as Gabe Kaplan, because this is where all
poker players must be if they fancy themselves the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amarillo Slim'' Preston, poker's greatest celebrity and still
slim and still wearing his cowboy hat after 71 years, will take a
break from the tables and talk about how he won the 1972 World
Series of Poker or why he just played his last hand a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   And over there will be Noel Furlong, the carpet millionaire from
Dublin and the winner of the 1999 World Series, who uttered that
memorable line when the final table was down to its final drama
last year and two of the players left were Irishmen, Furlong and
Dubliner Padraig Parkinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the Irish against the world,'' a wag shouted
from the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always is,'' replied Furlong, who won $1 million and a
14-carat gold bracelet when his full house flushed out the last of
his rivals. For some of these men and women, it is that gold
bracelet that means the most.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It may be only in poker that an unknown can go against the
world's best, as long as he puts up his $10,000 buy-in. The games
have been going on for weeks now, hours at a time, and tales waft
through the air in that upstairs room like cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Gowdy, the former Red Sox announcer, used to come here, as
did Telly Savalas, the movie actor, and two years ago, Matt Damon
and Ed Norton, to get a feel to their poker movie, ``Rounders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No royal flushes here,'' said Burgio. ``It's not like `The
Cincinnati Kid.' If they ever did a true movie about what it's
like, there'd be hours and hours of not much happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's precisely it, hours and hours of tension building
until that make-or-break hand, when hundreds of thousands of
dollars in chips are pushed forward and breaths are held as the
cards turn.
</P>
<P>
   The tales are endless, and the players are so different, from
billionaires to hotel owners to professional gamblers scruffing, to
doctors and lawyers to cowboys and foreigners. And this year poker
will have its first Ryder Cup, the best of Europe against the best
of America.
</P>
<P>
   And they are all here, tales and characters, each worth a
telling.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Duke, eight months pregnant, was in the midst of detailing
her winding road from Concord, N.H., prep school at St. Paul's,
undergraduate degree from Columbia University, and master's degree
from the University of Pennsylvania ``in psycholinguistics'' to
this huge poker room at Binion's.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, John Bonetti arrived and this 71-year-old man, the
stereotype of Brooklyn gruffness, put his arm around Duke, 34, and
began his spellbinding tale, even if it was spoken in Brooklynese.
Poker once might have been the world of Texas cowboys and New York
sharpies, men all of them, but no more. Clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuggedabowdit,'' began Bonetti, once a maitre'd in a New York
restaurant, lately of Houston and now one of the best poker players
in the world. ``Fuggedabowdit. I may be from the old school, but
Annie's one of the best poker players in the world _ man, woman, or
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the speaker. Bonetti is such a gambler that when he'd
been playing two nights earlier at the final table off in the
corner with bleachers full of fans for the $160,000 first prize in
an Omaha Hi-Lo Split game, his eyes had been turned more to the TV
off to the side than the cards in front of him. Bonetti, it turned
out, had a substantial bet on the NBA playoff game being shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sayin' she's jus' the best of the women, that she can
beat all the women players,'' said Bonetti. ``I'm sayin' she can
beat the best men here. And I'm tellin' ya, that comes from
Bonetti, that comes right from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Duke piped up. ``Coming from an incredible male chauvinist
pig,'' said Duke, ``it's an amazing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Duke such a great poker player, said Bonetti and
others, is that she has a photographic memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows the basic fundamentals of poker, she knows more
about it than most poker players, and then she has that recall,''
said Bonetti. ``I sat down with her just before and she recalled
every card of everybody for about 24 or 25 hands, card for card,
the way the cards fell. It takes a mind to do that. What a mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Duke then went through a game from a year ago when
she won $150,000 in a World Series event, and, as Bonetti said, she
went through it, hand by hand, card by card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' he said, ``she has an incredible memory.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a women's championship tournament Sunday, but Duke,
belly bulging and already the mother of two children, 5-year-old
Maud and 2-year-old Leo, would have no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Duke lowered her voice when asked about playing against the
women. ``I don't play it,'' she nearly growled. It's only competing
against the best that challenges her. ``No ladies' tees for me,''
said Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said when she first stepped up into high-stakes games, she
had to rush to the ladies' room to vomit. But now, ``Even when I'm
playing $1,000-$2,000 games, and you can win $100,000, it's just
competition. Obviously I like the money, but it doesn't make me
nervous anymore because I don't think, `Wow, that can be
life-changing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a girl in New Hampshire, she had played gin and bridge, ``and
solitaire and Oh How and War'' but it was not until she was well on
her way to a much different career that she began playing poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in graduate school at Penn,'' she said, detailing how
her brother, Howard Lederer, invited her to tag along to the World
Series in Las Vegas where he competed. She began playing for small
stakes in Las Vegas, then perfected her game in card rooms in
Montana, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every other month, she comes to Las Vegas for two weeks to
play poker. Once she wanted to be a professor of psycholinguistics
``but sort of at the last minute I decided it wasn't what I wanted
to do,'' she said. ``So I ended up moving to Montana and, for lack
of anything better to do and for money, I started playing poker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonetti heard all this and said, ``Psycholinguistics, Annie?
That's a-why you can read the cards in everybody's hand?''
</P>
<P>
   Her amazingly quick mind, her competitiveness, her innate sense
of what cards the other players are holding, her recall, her
aggressiveness, all of it, have brought Annie Duke to the very top
of the poker world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end,'' she said, ``you have to have the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Poker's greatest truth.

<P>
   DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ Confirming a long-standing trend
in crime and society, a new Justice Department report shows a
continuing, steep drop in killings attributed to domestic violence,
particularly among blacks. Among blacks, the biggest drop is for
men killed by women, which has actually gone down about 71 percent
since the 1970s. (The number for women and men used to be about
even.) But there is one disturbing trend to emerge from the
department's annual report _ the numbers for white women have gone
up slightly. The face of domestice violence in America is now
largely a problem of attacks on white women, a major shift that
sociologists and law enforcement officials are just starting to

great bewteen rich and poor districts as to violate the state
constitution's guarantee of a free and equal public education for
all, and demanding that the state guarantee that all schools have
the ``bare necessities'' of textbooks, teachers, classrooms,
toilets and so on. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the suit as

conditions. By Todd S. Purdum.

</P>
<P>
   DO-IT-YOURSELF-FUND (Undated) _ Most mutual funds are not worth
owning, says Steven Wallman, a former federal securities regulator,
because they cost too much, repeatedly fail to beat the market and
frequently produce big tax bills. He contends that he has found a
better and, in many cases, cheaper way for investors to create
their own, customized baskets of stocks, which he calls folios. For
a fee of $295 a year, his company, Folio, will let investors buy
three of these do-it-yourself mutual funds and fill each one with
as much money as they choose spread among as many as 50 stocks. For
no additional charge, they can make changes in their holdings as
often as twice a day through what Wallman hopes will become an
efficient, internal trading system. Whether the world will beat a
path to Wallman's portal is far from certain. He is not the first
to try to tap into investors' growing discomfort with the
limitations of traditional mutual funds, a restlessness that has
spawned several variations on the theme. By Patrick McGeehan.

its proposed breakup of Microsoft, filing a counterresponse by the
end of the day. The next step is a hearing on May 24 at which both

Brinkley.

&HT;     ANALYSTS SAY FUTURE OF `B2B' IS BRIGHT DESPITE SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mere months after the business-to-business, or
B2B, sector was anointed as the latest successor to the cyberspace
throne, analysts and investors alike are stepping back and taking a
more tempered view of it.
</P>
<P>
   B2B stocks, much like other technology issues, have been
hammered in recent weeks. The same investment houses that post
outrageous estimates on the potential size of the industry are now
saying that most B2B companies will not survive. In short, the
party's over. The hard work is set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   It is a route similar to that taken by the business-to-consumer,
or B2C, sector of Internet commerce, which was also strongly hyped
before the experts stepped in to spoil the party.
</P>
<P>
   For those unschooled in the intricacies of the Internet
alphabet, here's the deal: B2C companies sell products directly to
consumers over the Internet. B2B companies use the Internet to set
up business transactions between existing, real-world businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While B2C was the first real darling of the e-commerce sector,
punctuated by huge stock run-ups by companies like Amazon.com, eBay
and eToys, Wall Street began questioning the long-term viability of
on-line consumer shopping. Stocks suffered, and venture capital to
fund new B2C firms dried up.
</P>
<P>
   The focus turned to B2B, and it all made so much sense. Over 90
percent of all business in the real-world is B2B, the supporters
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot to take into account human nature. Fierce
competitors have been less than eager to cooperate in the name of
B2B e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys hate each others guts. Now, they're trying to get
together and work together?'' said an incredulous Tim Clark, senior
analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``We're estimating half of the
announced marketplaces will simply collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   A report from AMR Research, another of the research firms that
follow e-commerce, predicts most of the 600-plus B2B Net markets it
tracks will fail, with only 50 to 100 surviving by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking has Wall Street scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's the empire strikes back, with some big
companies striking back against some of the first-generation market
makers, like Ariba and such,'' Rick Villers, an analyst with the
research firm IDC Corp, said in reference to Ariba Inc. of Mountain
View, Calif. ``What's emerging as a problem in these exchanges is
it's not as simple as they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the three big auto retailers getting together, they found
their business partners don't want to play,'' said Villers,
referring to a proposed online B2B marketplace headed by General
Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler. ``It's too closed. It's too
focused on their supply chain needs. (Vendors) don't believe these
companies can be an impartial decision-maker when it comes these
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The automakers are not the only big-industry players trying to
get together on the B2B playground. Similar alliances have been
announced in the aerospace, energy, retail, chemical, petroleum and
banking industries. Huge players like Boeing, Lockheed Martin,
Chevron, Sears and Citigroup have put a lot money on the table,
betting the on-line trade can save them money.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, B2B stalwarts are not throwing in the towel
by any means. If anything, a shakeout was expected, and the fight
is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's huge momentum. Huge pipeline. Huge interest,'' said
Kit Robinson, a spokesman for Commerce One. ``There's no end in
sight because this is a new market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I have become accustomed to the fact that we can find
stuff on Yahoo and participate in an auction on eBay. All you need
is a credit card and a modem,'' Robinson said. ``But you have to
remember that there will be $10 spent on B2B for every $1 on B2C.
Regardless of Wall Street's perceptions, there's no let-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the potential market estimates are staggering. The same
research firms that are now wavering on the B2B space are
simultaneously playing the other side of the fence with monstrous
predictions on how big B2B will become:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gartner Group Inc. says B2B e-commerce will generate business
valued at $3.95 trillion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   _ AMR Research Inc. says $5.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   _ International Data Corp. says $2.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe B2B is not overhyped, but the reality is that we
have to step back and look at the existing business models, looking
for industries where there is inefficiency today and there are some
opportunities,'' Villers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industries that can most benefit from on-line marketplaces
are those that haven't been able to improve their supply chains,''
he said, ``either because they're too diverse a community or there
hasn't emerged a dominant company or it's just not an industry
where a supply chain exists, like professional services.''

   LEBANON, Kansas _ As the clock strikes 3, the old ladies of this
depressed farm town shuffle past the boarded-up red brick
storefronts on Main Street and into LaDow's general store for a
daily dose of coffee and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Every afternoon, Monday through Friday, a dozen of them gather
around two kitchen tables by the window to discuss the world's
problems, and their own.
</P>
<P>
   Their small town is withering away. And these genteel women,
many of them farm widows, are a living testament to this unhappy
trend.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of local life are evident around the table at LaDow's:
Men die earlier than women. The children leave forever, lured away
by city jobs that pay more and demand less toil than growing wheat
on the Great Plains of north-central Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to hang on,'' said Gladys Kennedy, who for half a
century has served as the town's unofficial historian. In 1911, her
father founded a garage that would become the local Ford
dealership. It was boarded up a few years back as the population of
Lebanon plummeted from 1,500 a century ago to just 350 today.
</P>
<P>
   Across Smith County, Kansas, and indeed throughout rural
America, a generational time bomb is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Older farmers have no one to take over the family property, and
are not sure they'd encourage them even if their children were
inclined to farm. The phenomenon is the same throughout much of the
farm belt in the Midwest and parts of the South. More than 650
non-metropolitan counties in America lost population in the 1990s,
more than at any time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Economy of the Internet fuels unprecedented national
prosperity, the oldest economy, the family farm, is again facing
hard times. The graying of America's farmers _ average age, 54.3 _
has coincided with low commodity prices to make it difficult, even
with federal subsidies, for some to remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   Life is slowly bleeding from America's heartland, leaving an
increasingly empty landscape full of graceful widows, white-haired
farmers and century-old family homesteads destined for the auction
block.
</P>
<P>
   In Formoso in neighboring Jewell County, Dennis Appleby raises
cattle and crops on a farm founded by his great-grandfather in
1885. He suffered a heart attack in April and, while he remains
robust at 59, has begun to seriously doubt how much longer he'll be
able to work the land.
</P>
<P>
   Formoso was a lively farm town of 500 when Appleby was growing
up. Its Mayberry-like downtown had a general store, a family doctor
and a schoolhouse. Now, it has none of them to serve a population
that has dwindled to 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, an accountant in Wichita, said, 'I'd love to be a
farmer, but I need to make a living,' `` said Appleby. ``Everybody
wishes they could pass their farm along. But my greatest wish is
for my children to be happy. So, I have mixed emotions about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new story. Out-migration from counties like Smith
and Jewell began during World War I (reflecting the truth in the
popular song lyric of the time: ``How you gonna keep 'em down of
the farm after they've seen Paris?''). The flow continued through
the Great Depression and Dust Bowl years, right up to the farm
crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kansas farmers fear that the last chapter of the family
farm is now being written. The average age of a farmer here is near
60. Across 2,000 square miles of rich acreage in these two
counties, farmers in their 20s and 30s number no more than a dozen.
Jewell and Smith lost more more than two-thirds of their population
between 1930 and 1990. In 1900, the two counties boasted 40,000
residents. Today, the population is only about 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers here face the prospects of selling out or leasing
their land when retirement finally comes, usually ending a century
or more of family farming on land homesteaded in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The waves ripple through farm society. In some parts of the
Midwest, the one-room schoolhouse has made a return as school
districts consolidate due to declining enrollments. Medical care
has become scarce, with the nearest full-service hospitals hours
away by car. The people of Formoso must drive 20 miles to the
nearest grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the economy is reflected in the classified ads of
the Jewell County newspaper. For less than the price of most new
cars, it is possible to buy a three-bedroom house with central heat
and air and a one-car garage. ``Asking price $19,500, but it is
negotiable,'' the ad states.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades in Lebanon, the elementary school and
high school closed, along with most of the retail shops. The only
new building in town is a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-drenched spring day, the rolling farmland is verdant,
with lush green wheat reaching waist-high. But looks are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   With wheat prices depressed, Dennis Duntz, 60, a Smith County
farmer all his life, made less last year than his wife, Jackie,
earned working part-time cleaning rooms at a local nursing home for
minimum wage. To survive, most small farms now depend on a wage
earner who works off the farm. Nationally, about three of every
four women who live on a farm work away from the farm in a
non-agriculture job.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for government subsidies, Duntz would have made
only about a $965 profit in 1999 due to deflated wheat crop prices
and the mounting interest payments on his farm machinery, which
totals about $14,000 a year. He was forced to sell off about half
of his 100-head cattle herd to satisfy his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   He worries now that a drought forecast for this summer will
reduce his wheat yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've got in the world is what you see around you and a
note at the bank,'' Duntz said, surveying the farm founded by his
grandfather. ``All I'm doing now is riding it down. I don't have
anyone to take it over. All I can do in five or six years is call
in the auctioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, 50 percent of all Americans lived and worked on a farm.
A century later, it's less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a WalMart-ization of farms. With no one to take
over, small farms consolidate into bigger ones, or are bought out
or leased by large agri-business corporations, whose economies of
scale put a further squeeze on the remaining small family farms.
</P>
<P>
   Will urban and suburban Americans notice a difference at the
supermarket if their food comes from giant corporations instead of
small farms? Probably not. The cost of raw ingredients and animal
feed accounts for a relatively small share of consumer food prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the fiercely independent farmers in north-central Kansas
argue that no corporation will care for the land like a proud,
multi-generational family will. And, they contend, a concentration
of agriculture in the hands of a few major corporations can
suppress competition and place the power of food in the hands of
relatively few.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they feel helpless and victimized by factors beyond
their control _ the complex, regulated economy of food prices and
controls, international competition and an American public that
pays little attention to their plight. Wheat farmers earn only
about five cents on the sale of a $1.39 loaf of bread, and ranchers
make about 68 cents from a $4.39 pound of sirloin sold in a retail
store, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers don't have a voice. We take our product to market,
but we have no power,'' complained Dale Lyon, 69, who faces
retirement and hopes his daughter and son-in-law may take over the
land to raise horses and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, agriculture in the United States is in good
shape,'' Lyon said. ``It's the farmers that are hurting. (Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan is supposed to be some kind of
hero. Well, all he's doing is cutting off the little guy with every
increase he makes in the interest rate.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The current low price of wheat and other commodities resulted in
part from the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which depressed world
markets and forced Congress to extend billions more dollars in aid
to U.S. farmers _ assistance they need to survive but would rather
do without.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance on government aid is further fueled by the aging
population.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith Center, the county seat with a population of 2,000,
there are two group homes for the elderly and a nursing home. It
has the fifth highest per-capita population over age 80 of any
county in the nation, and one in three residents is over 65. Jewell
County is close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some farm families dream about the Internet as their economic
salvation, luring telecommuting yuppies to the green, and
inexpensive, pastures of Kansas. Others believe tourism is the
future, with hunters and anglers coming to enjoy
farmland-turned-grasslands under an ongoing federal conservation
program.
</P>
<P>
   But some local rural economies simply cannot be transformed,
said Kenneth Johnson, a demographer and sociologist at Loyola
University in Chicago who studies rural population trends. Counties
close to major cities have benefited from what he has dubbed the
``rural rebound,'' due largely to the influx of people and money as
suburbs expand.
</P>
<P>
   But in counties like Smith and Jewell, at least four hours by
car from from Kansas City, Mo., and Lincoln, Neb., there is only
one economic engine, and revival seems distant, if not impossible.
Kansas state estimates predict that Smith, Jewell and 37 other
counties in the state will continue to lose population at least
through the year 2040.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are producing the basic sustenance of our lives,
and yet the farms fade,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think there is
any magic. These places live and die by farming.''

taxes for retirement and like 32 million other American workers,

black and white street, like the rotations of a wand. Urban
solutions can be this simple _ so simple in fact that a child can
discover them. Through an innovative plan called the ``City of

&HT;     SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TOO COMPLEX FOR LIBERALS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DONALD G. SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIAI, Calif. _ One of the more significant differences
between conservatives and liberals is established long before they
lock their philosophies into political positions. It is the running
battle between simplicity (conservatives) and complexity
(liberals).
</P>
<P>
   When I am accused of being ``simplistic,'' I know that I am
talking with someone who walks down the left side of the street.
With liberals, ``simplistic'' ranks right up there with
``judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   The bedrock foundation of conservative thinking is found in the
search for simple solutions. Such thinking is abhorrent to the
liberal who worships at the shrine of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The flat tax, for example, is something that is popular with
conservatives. They aren't trying to get out of paying taxes but
want to simplify the process: no deductions, no writeoffs and no
sliding scale. Above all, there would be no forms that require an
accountant to complete. Liberals want no part of this because they
are suspicious of simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our social problems have simple solutions. The answer to
alcoholism, for example, is to quit drinking. But this, say the
liberals, isn't that easy. No, it isn't, but it is still the only
solution to a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   It is irrelevant if the problem drinker turns to a support
group, a trained counselor or the church because they all lead to
the same place. The only solution is to quit drinking, and the
methods used are only different routes to the predetermined
destination.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Nancy Reagan was ridiculed maliciously when she
offered ``just say no'' as a solution to the drug problem. Liberals
got a good laugh out of it but they failed to grasp the rather
obvious fact that the lady was right. The problem will never be
solved until people say no.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals seem to have a problem comprehending the difference
between ``simple'' and ``easy.'' They assume that the person who
presents a simple solution is saying that it is going to be easy,
which isn't true at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely difficult to kick a drug or alcohol habit, but
it is still simple. The heroin addict goes through hell on Earth in
the withdrawal process, but there is nothing complex about it.
Doing what has to be done is often difficult, but it is not always
complex. In the Old West, they called it ``biting the bullet.``
</P>
<P>
   It is the same with sexual promiscuity, habitual lying, eating
disorders and kleptomania. No matter how one goes about solving
these problems, the trail always leads to the same place. Stop
doing it! Hard? Yes. Complex? No.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that all problems have simple solutions. It
does mean that simplicity is the place to start looking. If an
obvious solution presents itself, there is no need to form
committees, prepare bar charts and demand 1,000-page reports. It is

first and add complexity only if there is no other way.

   The honors thesis that Brooke Ellison presented earlier this
spring at Harvard University, ``The Element of Hope in Resilient
Adolescents,'' was a scientific analysis steeped in data. But her
own story would have made a good case study.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by a car on her first day in the seventh grade and given
little chance of survival, Ellison awoke after 36 hours in a coma
as a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Though she would regain no sensation below her neck, Ellison
never missed a grade, and early next month she will cap her
improbable educational odyssey by graduating from Harvard with an
A- average and a bachelor's degree in psychology and biology.

EARNINGS SOAR FOR TD WATERHOUSE

<P>
   TD Waterhouse(TWE:NYSE), a leading discount and online brokerage
firm, reported Wednesday that its net income rose 156 percent,
easily beating analysts' expectations, but volatility in the market
through April kept traders on the sidelines and tripped the
brokerage's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are pointing to a seasonal slowdown as summer
approaches and a lack of enthusiasm among investors after the hasty
retreat of the Nasdaq Composite Index since March.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, David Pottruck, president and co-chief executive of
Charles Schwab(SCH:NYSE), attributed a slowdown in his firm's
trading activity to a ``seasonal pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   While almost all other TD Waterhouse financial data were in
excess of Wall Street estimates, a closer look at the revenue
trades per day numbers in April show a significantly slower rate of
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue trades per day, or the amount of money the company takes
in from fees on trades, increased 65 percent from January to March,
but that number for the three months ended April grew at about half
that rate, at 34 percent, as the total number of trades dropped
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $76.6 million, or 20 cents a diluted share,
in Waterhouse's second fiscal quarter, from $30 million, or 9 cents
a share, a year earlier. The results represented a 34 percent gain
over the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been
expecting earnings of 16 cents a share in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the impact of goodwill, earnings per share were 23
cents in the second quarter, compared with 11 cents a share a year
earlier and 17 cents a share in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenues for the quarter jumped 96 percent, to $489
million, from $249 million in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth sets the stage for continued expansion in the
second half of the year, with our investment in marketing and
technology keeping pace with revenue gains,'' Stephen McDonald,
chief executive, said in a statement. ``We will continue to focus
on our growth strategies, and remain on track to exceed our
aggressive targets for fiscal 2000: 1 million new customers
(exclusive of acquisitions), a $60 billion increase in customer
assets and improved operating margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New York-based TD Waterhouse rose 1/16, or 0.3
percent, to 18 3/4 in late-morning trading.
</P>
<P>
   Shares its parent company, Canada's Toronto-Dominion
Bank(TD:NYSE), were down 3/16, or 0.8 percent, to 24 9/16 in
late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

TOYOTA PROFITS BOOSTED BY STRONG SALES  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Toyota Motor Corp., the largest car manufacturer in
Japan and the fourth-largest in the world, on Wednesday reported
surprisingly strong financial results for the second half of its
fiscal year, aided by robust sales in its North American and
Japanese markets and cost-cutting that helped offset the effects of
a strong yen on profits made overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's earnings climbed 25 percent to 205.1 billion yen, or
$1.9 billion at current exchange rates, in the last six months of
the fiscal year that ended March 31, compared with earnings of
163.5 billion yen in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The increase illustrated the effectiveness of the company's
vaunted cost-cutting programs, which contributed a total of $1.4
billion in operating profits to Toyota during the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of the best-selling Camry sedan and Lexus line of
luxury vehicles also benefited from new models and the redesign of
several old ones in its Japanese market, like the new Estima
minivan and its luxury model, the Crown. Two derivatives of its
popular small car model, Vitz, also sold briskly, and next week the
company plans to unveil a new version of its popular Rav4 sports
utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at several subsidiaries helped, too. Daihatsu Motor Co.,
51.1 percent owned by Toyota, said Tuesday that its net income
quadrupled in the last fiscal year and profits at smaller
affiliates also soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, the outlook for Toyota is pretty positive,'' said
Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in
Tokyo. ``They have strong volumes in the U.S. and in Japan, and
with significantly more new products, both for Japan and outside,
costs will continue to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Japan's weak economy, Toyota predicted domestic sales
would climb 6.9 percent to 1.83 million cars in the current fiscal
year. The Japanese auto market is enjoying a small rebound; Goldman
Sachs estimates that domestic car registrations will rise at an
annual rate of 6.4 percent for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   With its new models and strong brand presence here _ Toyota's
share of the Japanese market climbed above 42 percent in fiscal
1999 _ the company is well positioned for rising demand.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's sales abroad helped compensate for the strong yen,
which reduced earnings from sales made in foreign currencies. The
yen's strength dealt a vicious blow to Toyota's competitor, Honda
Motor Co., which is heavily reliant on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's shares ended 2.6 percent lower at 4,930 yen, or about
$45, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Last month, the ``Bullet Lasagna'' sailing star
left his heart on San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In a grueling eight-day, 16-race regatta, Mattia D'Errico
confronted choppy seas, tricky currents and the best of America's
one-man, small-craft skippers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he finished 18th out of 32 in the Laser class of the
U.S. Olympic Trials for sailing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in D'Errico's 11-year career that he has
entered the Trials and fallen short of his Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements we had to deal with were really hard,'' said
D'Errico, 22, a native of San Antonio. ``I thought I sailed very
well. The chips just didn't fall into place for me. Really, it's a
tough thing for me to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Errico, who earned the ``Bullet Lasagna'' moniker several
years ago on a family sailing expedition, roared into San Francisco
with substantial momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He entered last fall at No. 4 in the North American Grand Prix
rankings, which includes Laser sailors from the United States,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In October, D'Errico earned his berth in the Trials when he won
the U.S. Single-Handed Nationals at Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the West Coast earlier this year, he added a
grand prix victory in the Mid-Winters West Regatta at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first race of the Trials, disaster struck, as
officials disqualified D'Errico for an improper start.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, he made a sharp turn in the third race
and flipped the 14-foot fiberglass craft into the 50-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a really hard venue, extremely tough,'' recalled
D'Errico, who rallied for a 10th-place finish in the eighth race.
``Out there, you didn't even have to make a mistake and a boat
would pass you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make one (mistake), and the whole fleet passes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, D'Errico said he intends to try again in the summer
of 2004, and the experts have said he could be a top-five contender
if he can maintain what has become a $55,000 annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad jokingly told me to go get a job,'' D'Errico said. ``I
do have plans to do this again. I haven't finalized anything, but
the guy who won at the Trials was 29. I think I'm still in this.
I'm so close.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner in the Trials was John Myrdal of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, D'Errico's campaign for sailing supremacy
became known as team ``Bullet Lasagna'' during a campfire dinner at
Eagle Mountain Lake, near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Joking about a wayward racer known as ``Bullet'' Marinelli,
family members tweaked the name, tied it to a favorite food and
bestowed it upon a sailing-crazy teen-age duo _ Mattia D'Errico and
his younger sister, Lacy.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet, in sailing parlance, is a first-place finish. So
``Bullet Lasagna'' seemed fitting for the D'Errico family, which
had started to stack up a few victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw Mattia, he was so small,'' said
Houston-based sailing instructor John Kolius. ``It was at a clinic
I was giving. He really had trouble staying up with the older kids.
I called him `The Worm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, D'Errico has inched his way toward stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Building himself up physically in the weight room, he also has
honed his skills on the water, and has maintained a top 10 grand
prix ranking in North America for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy D'Errico, 18, recalled fond memories of the family's
weekend outings to Galveston, Austin and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great way for us to bond,'' said Lacy D'Errico, who
has cut back substantially on her competitions lately. ``Mattia and
I were always pretty close. But with the sailing, we were able to
become best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattia D'Errico made his first major splash in the sport four
years ago when he won the U.S. Open and qualified for the 1996
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 18, he emerged as the youngest sailor in the Laser
class at Savannah, Ga. Overmatched, D'Errico placed 46th and
withdrew from the event early.
</P>
<P>
   Kolius said D'Errico's career should be viewed with the
perspective that very few racers qualify for the Trials as a high
school senior.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kolius said, most prominent sailors grow up on either the
East or West coasts with greater access to open water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a tough place to come out of and be successful,''
said Kolius, a skipper in three America's Cup races. ``We have some
very beautiful and very good places to race, but it's not a
mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Errico is considering relocating to Rhode Island to race in a
professional circuit, sailing larger craft with nine-or 10-man
crews.
</P>
<P>
   After about 18 months, D'Errico said he likely will return to
his one-man Laser boat in an effort to prepare for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a contender this time, and I just came up short,''
D'Errico said. ``Next time I'll have all my guns blazing.''

TALBOTS MEETS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, prices in last two grafs do not reflect the market close)  
 By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the continuing release of retailer earnings, Talbots
(TLB:NYSE) met Wall Street's heightened earnings expectations and
reported a 68 percent increase in earnings per share on Wednesday,
ascribing the strong number to its ability to sell much of its
inventory without having to mark down products.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter ended April 29, net income rose to $32.7
million, or $1.04 a diluted share, from $19.4 million, or 62 cents
a share, a year earlier, matching the consensus estimate of
analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales rose to $357.8 million from $293.0 million a year ago,
with retail store sales rising 21 percent to $295.4 million and
catalog sales up 26 percent to $62.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Talbots said it would beat the consensus
estimate of 90 cents by 12 cents to 14 cents because of healthy
same-store sales growth in April. The analyst community
subsequently raised its expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Zetcher, president and chief executive of Talbots, said
in a statement Wednesday that ``significantly better-than-expected
sales trends'' would boost May growth in same-store sales to at
least the mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that his company, based in Hingham, Mass.,
will open three more Talbots Woman stores than originally planned,
with nine instead of six openings for fiscal 2000. Talbots Woman
specializes in clothing for women who wear sizes 12 through 24.
</P>
<P>
   Two other retailers also reported first-quarter results, Bon-Ton
Stores (BONT:Nasdaq) and Consolidated Stores (CNS:NYSE), which
operates a range of stores including toy store KB Toys.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 29, Bon-Ton reported a net loss of
$5.1 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, compared to a loss of
$2.9 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. That loss was a
penny less than expected by analysts. Excluding the effect of a
$400,000 extraordinary after-tax charge, the loss per share for the
first quarter of last year came in at 17 cents a share. Revenue at
the York, Pa.-based company rose to $152.1 million from $142.4
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gleim, vice chairman and chief operating officer of
Bon-Ton, blamed the poor results on unseasonably cool weather and
higher costs for the clearing of seasonal merchandise.
``Consequently, we were unable to achieve the planned operating
leverage that contributed to the loss of 34 cents per share,'' he
said in a statement. ``We continue to review our merchandise
assortments, marketing strategies and expense control opportunities
to better position the company going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 29, Consolidated Stores reported a
net loss of $13.2 million, or 12 cents a diluted share, compared to
a loss of $3.7 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. The
loss was 3 cents less than expected. Revenue rose to $1.0 billion
from $923.7 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Columbus, Ohio, said it is ``comfortable''
with earnings estimates of 90 cents a share to 95 cents a share for
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Talbots rose 1 5/16, or 2 percent, to 54 1/16 in
Wednesday morning trading.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bon-Ton were unchanged at 2 3/16 in Wednesday morning
trading, while shares of Consolidated fell 3/16, or 2 percent, to
12 1/8.

KRAFT EXECUTIVE NAMED MATTEL CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beleaguered toymaker Mattel (MAT:NYSE) said on Wednesday that
its board of directors had unanimously elected Robert A. Eckert as
chairman and chief executive, ending a three-month external search
following the forced departure of Jill Barad.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert, 45, resigned on Tuesday as president and chief executive
of Kraft Foods, the food division of Philip Morris (MO:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   Eckert's appointment takes effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive step for Mattel. They are putting an end to
the uncertainty and bringing in a well-respected manager,'' said
Rick Fradin, an analyst with William Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Fradin, who rates the company a hold and has not done any
underwriting for it, added, however, that Eckert is stepping into a
tough position.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Mattel, Eckert, who had been with Kraft Foods since
1977, will face the challenge of getting the maker of such classics
as Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys back on its feet. In
February Mattel's directors forced Barad to resign after three
rocky years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barad's direction, Mattel had posted several quarters of
losses, stemming in part from the much-criticized acquisition of
the Learning Co. software company. The company also suffered from a
host of defections in top management.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McGowan, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, said he was
encouraged by Eckert's appointment, noting his positive reputation
as well as his track record in turning around Kraft's Oscar Mayer
lunch meats division.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't market bologna the same way you market Barbie,''
said McGowan. ``But food and toys are both competitive and they are
both driven by marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan, who raised his recommendation for Mattel to a buy from
a hold following the announcement, noted that a previous Mattel
head, John Amerman, who ran the company from 1987 to 1997, came
from Warner Lambert's (WLA:NYSE) Chiclets chewing gum division.
</P>
<P>
   William Rollnick, who will now step down as Mattel's chairman,
said: ``At Kraft, he (Eckert) clearly demonstrated his leadership,
successfully managing a business with $17.5 billion in revenues for
1999, while increasing its sales and profits through leveraging the
growth of existing brands and by introducing and building popular
and profitable new products that have become branded staples.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Eckert's first tasks will likely include shoring up top
management ranks following a slew of departures as well as
overseeing the sale of the Learning Co. In April, Mattel of El
Segundo, Calif., said it wanted to sell the Learning Co., and might
be willing to settle for less than a third of the $3.5 billion
Mattel paid to acquire the company.
</P>
<P>
   The software industry has been abuzz with rumors of an imminent
sale. Havas Interactive, a division of France's Vivendi SA;
Internet incubator Knowledge Universe LLC; Microsoft (MSFT:NYSE);
Time Warner (TWX:NYSE); and Infogames Entertainment SA have all
been mentioned as possible buyers.

CYBERSLEUTHS AT WORK IN PURSUIT OF INTERNET CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within hours after a destructive computer program began
circulating this month, borne by an e-mail message marked ``I Love
You,'' a handful of high-tech detectives around the globe leaped
into action.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutinizing clues left in the programming code, and pursuing
evidence accumulated in hidden corners of cyberspace, the
detectives homed in on several suspects in the Philippines. And
within days, Onel A. de Guzman, whose name the investigators had
turned up, came forward and said it was possible he had unleashed
the rogue program.
</P>
<P>
   But the detectives are unlikely to testify at trial, or receive
official commendation. That is because they are not police
officers, but ordinary citizens, like a retired software
entrepreneur in Cambridge, Mass., and two Swedish computer security
experts.
</P>
<P>
   They are among a growing number of Net habitues turned
cybersleuths whose work has become vital to the pursuit of Internet
criminals. In the spirit of members of a neighborhood watch
program, they protect their turf on the Internet and point law
enforcement officials to leads. And some have escalated their role
from tipster to sleuth, accumulating evidence to identify actual
suspects, including malicious hackers, virus writers and online
child pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with home computers and technical expertise, the
cybersleuths themselves say there are only a few hundred of them.
But these amateur detectives have pursued suspects in some of the
most highly publicized cybercrimes, assisting in an area where law
enforcement officials say they lack resources and sometimes
expertise. Police agencies have even deputized cybersleuths and
worked with them in the most critical parts of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As private citizens, however, the cyberdetectives can also be
hard to control and monitor. And law enforcement officials say that
sometimes they act less like members of a neighborhood watch than
like vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a computer game,'' said Paul Coggins, U.S. attorney
in Dallas. ``They're playing catch-the-crook.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have relied on citizens with technical expertise
for some time. But Coggins said he now sees a higher proportion of
citizens seeking to pitch in on cyberspace-related crime fighting
than he does in the physical world, perhaps because cyberdetectives
never have to leave home. ``Some people who have come to our
attention are spending an inordinate amount of time doing this,
then calling law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as federal and state law enforcement agencies are
beefing up the personnel and technical resources devoted to
investigating computer crime, many say they still welcome the
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement is more and more reaching out to the private
sector for knowledge, for training,'' said Michael McCartney,
special investigator for the high-technology crime unit of the New
York State attorney general's office, who said he keeps several
high-tech experts on his informant payroll. ``We all have to work
together in fighting this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sleuths say that what drives them is not an urge to
play police officer, but rather a simple desire to protect
cyberspace. ``As computer geeks, we felt the Internet belonged to
us,'' said Kevin Patterson, founder of Ethical Hackers Against
Pedophilia, a group that works with law enforcement to track down
online child pornographers. ``Just like saying, `You're not going
to sell crack on our corner,' we don't want you to distribute child
pornography on our Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a 33-year-old computer network administrator in
Knoxville, Tenn., founded Ethical Hackers in 1997 when he came
across a lurid picture of a 4-year-old girl in an unrelated
discussion forum. ``It reminded me of my niece,'' he said, and he
vowed to hunt down online purveyors of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Impassioned foes of child pornography are common in the physical
world too, but what is remarkable in cyberspace is the interaction
between citizens and the police, as Patterson's case illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the state of New York started Operation
Sabbatical, an investigation of a group suspected of circulating
child pornography online. Strapped for resources and expertise, the
state turned to Ethical Hackers, a group whose members identified
themselves online with names like Chalk, Sgt. Rock, Merc, Tattoo
Man and Conjure.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, from New York's high-tech crime unit, said he did
background checks on the men first. ``We traveled to some of their
homes and inspected their computers,'' he said, making sure none of
them were child pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1998, law enforcement officials obtained 21 search
warrants in 14 states and 4 countries, while the members of Ethical
Hackers played central roles from their home computers. While
warrant-bearing police knocked on doors of suspected members of the
ring, the members of Ethical Hackers effectively barred access to a
discussion area in cyberspace where child pornographers were known
to congregate, flooding it with meaningless data to render it
unusable. The idea was that if the members could not communicate,
they would not be able to warn one another about the raids.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney said the idea of using private citizens in this way
was so unusual that the FBI declined to participate. But he said
his team decided it needed to employ the technical expertise of the
Ethical Hackers. ``I didn't wake up one day and know everything
there is to know about high-tech investigations,'' he said. Still,
he said the situation was unusual. ``We don't want other vigilantes
thinking they can do the same thing,'' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Often, the arrangements between citizens and the police appear
to be less formal. Richard Smith, a software entrepreneur in
Cambridge, Mass., who made a name for himself as a private citizen
sleuth who helped track down the author of the Melissa virus in
February 1999, said he had periodic discussions with law
enforcement officials about cybercrimes, some discussions started
by the authorities and others by him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refused to comment on whether he was contacted by the FBI
after the I Love You program began spreading, but he did say he
started working on the case minutes after he learned about it on
May 4. Smith looked at the source code _ the instructions and text
_ buried inside the rogue program and discovered an e-mail address,
ispyder(at)mail.com. He then got in touch with the president of the
company that operates that e-mail service and urged him to contact
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, Smith said he searched Internet news
groups and Web sites for key words that he had found in the source
code of the program and pieced together evidence suggesting that
the program originated in the Philippines. He then publicized his
findings in conversations with reporters. Smith said he had time to
devote to these tasks because he was on sabbatical. ``It's fun,''
he said of his motivation. ``It's a game.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, Smith joined forces with two Swedes, Jonathan James,
19, and Fredrik Bjorck, 27, with whom he had collaborated in the
Melissa case. They pursued what Smith said was a crucial discovery
by James, namely that the name of the hacker group GrammerSoft,
which was embedded in the source code, was also embedded in the
source code of a virus called Myckl.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Myckl virus included the name of students at Amable
Mendoza Aguiluz Computer College in Manila, including de Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he did not know whether he and his cohorts were
responsible for directing the FBI and Philippine authorities to de
Guzman, who surfaced last Thursday. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for
the FBI's New York office, which is leading the bureau's
investigation, said the agency had consulted with the three men and
had done so in the past. ``I can't characterize the value of the
information or how instrumental it's been in this case,'' he said.
``We've found their information to be useful in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But however grateful law enforcement officials may be, the
cyber-sleuths often leave them uneasy. Some law enforcement
officials worry that amateur detectives may break the law
themselves when hunting down cybercriminals. Police officers say
the concern is particularly acute with child pornography foes, who
have been known to shut down pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Della-Colli, director of the Cybersmuggling Center, the
online investigative arm of the U.S. Customs Service, said Customs
often receives e-mail messages from people who forward child
pornography they have downloaded from the Internet. It is illegal
to download child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you observe criminal activity, we instruct you to take down
the license plate,'' Della-Colli said. ``We don't want you crawling
in the back window of the house to give a detailed accounting of
what they're stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coggins, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, said private citizens
could also interfere with an actual undercover investigation, or
gather evidence in an illegal way that undermines a conviction.
``Any mistakes they make really come back to haunt us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Joel de la Garza, a recent Stanford University
graduate who now works for a computer security firm, illustrates
the potential pitfalls for amateur cybersleuths, no matter how well
meaning or skilled. He was working part time in Stanford's computer
security office when he started tracking activities of hackers who
were breaking into university computers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other tactics, de la Garza created programs to record
conversations in chat rooms where hackers were believed to
congregate. Then in February, after a spate of attacks that blocked
or impeded access to major commercial Web sites, de la Garza got a
tip that someone using the name Mafiaboy, thought by some private
sleuths to have been involved in the attacks, was hanging out in a
chat room in a forum called Internet Relay Chat. Once again, de la
Garza logged onto the chat room using an alias, and recorded a
discussion. In this one, Mafiaboy took credit for crippling the CNN
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza said he turned the transcript over to the FBI,
though he cannot be sure if it contributed to the arrest last month
of a Montreal teen-ager in the case. But while potentially valuable
evidence, the material that de la Garza gathered is ``arguably
violating your state's two-party consent'' laws that prohibit
recording conversations without the other party's assent, said
McCartney of the New York State attorney general's office.
``There's no clear-cut answer,'' he said. ``There are a lot of laws
you have to watch out for.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, de la Garza says he never set out to be a crime
fighter. ``I don't want to be a cop,'' he said. ``I just want these
guys to stop messing with the Stanford computers.''

 &HT;    FAST PACE OF TECHNOLOGY LEADS G8 NATIONS, INDUSTRY TO WORK
TOGETHER TO FIGHT INTERNET CRIME
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

<P>
   PARIS _ While offering few concrete proposals to deal with the
rising tide of computer crime, law-enforcement officials from the
major industrialized powers pledged Wednesday to forge a campaign
to secure the Internet from fraud and virtual vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the dizzying speed of technological change
law-enforcement agencies will have to rely on the expertise of the
Internet industry to keep up, delegates to the G8 Cyber-crime
Conference said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit was the first high-level meeting between
industry and government leaders of the world's major economic
powers, the Group of Eight countries _ the seven industrialized
democracies of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the United States, plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While many issues remain to be resolved _ indeed, the conference
helped determine what the important questions are _ both sides said
that cooperation is vital.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Attorney General James Robinson said governments
are incapable of policing cyberspace alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way for effective law-enforcement to occur is by
creating dialogue with industry experts that can help law
enforcement to track down cyber-criminals,'' Robinson told
reporters as the summit wrapped up Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the Internet has rendered borders ``meaningless,''
he also said that governments will also have to find innovative
ways to work together to scale cumbersome legal and logistical
obstacles that can slow the pursuit of computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work at 'cyber speed' with regard to investigation
and prosecution of cyber-crime,'' said Robinson, who heads the U.S.
Justice Department's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``24-7'' system that provides a virtual hotline among
law-enforcement and technical experts in 15 countries _ the G8,
plus others such as Sweden, Australia and Brazil _ represents a
major advance in assisting police in pursuing cyber-criminals
across borders, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, the chief scientist at Intel Corp., urged
industry leaders to cooperate with governments, particularly in
training ``cyber-police'' and keeping law-enforcement agencies up
to speed on technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments should not be the last to know about technology,''
said Aucsmith, who emerged as perhaps the top industry spokesman
during the conference. ``It is probably of use to industry to make
sure that the government understands what the technology can be out
there so governments can pursue hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the most important thing that came out of the meeting
is that cyber-crime is a worldwide thing, and it is every country's
problem and every company's problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference identified six basic principals that should be
taken into account in pursuing anti-cyber-crime policies:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ensuring the protection of individual freedoms and private
life;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Preserving governments' ability to fight high-tech crime;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Facilitating appropriate training for all involved;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Defining a clear and transparent framework for addressing
cyber-criminality;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ensuring free and fair activities, the sound development of
industry and supporting effective industry-initiated voluntary
codes of conduct and standards;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And assessing effectiveness and consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else was accomplished, the conference provided a rare
opportunity for industry and law-enforcement officials to meet _
albeit behind closed doors _ and get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the convention has agreed to exchange E-mail
addressees,'' said Toshinori Kanemoto, a Japanese police agency
official and conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the air of cooperation, divisions remain between
governments and the private sector over how to fight cyber-crime.
The world's leading Internet players say they expect to work with
governments, but have expressed concerns that excessive state
intervention could stifle the enormous growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. and British officials leaned toward industry
self-regulation, other officials, particularly those in Europe
favored more state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Selivanov, the Russian interior minister, used a
metaphor to explain that individual rights and commercial freedom
may at times have to be tempered to help crimefighters. ``When you
enter a church, you take off your hat, not your head,'' he said
when asked about his country's attitude about keeping a balance
between the rights of the state and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac left no one in any doubt that
his country wanted a bigger state role. ``To prevent and fight
crime, our democratic societies have only one legitimate actor _
the state _ and a single method _ applying the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy also advocated for more state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   All players at the conference excluded, for the moment, creating
an international ``cyber police'' body.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users worldwide are expected to reach more than a
half-billion by 2003, industry representatives said. The value of
Internet retailing is expected to rise from $20 billion to $185
billion by 2004. At the business-to-business level, it is expected
to jump from $100 billion to more than $2.7 trillion over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 meeting is the first international gathering of law
enforcers, business representatives and government officials to
address the burgeoning problem of cyber-crime. It will report its
conclusions to the G8 summit in Okinawa in July.

CYBERSEX LEADS TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex is the hottest topic among adult users of the Internet, with
studies showing fully a third of all visits directed to sexually
oriented Web sites, chat rooms and news groups.
</P>
<P>
   For most people these forays into cybersex are relatively
harmless pursuits, but experts in the field say that the
affordability, accessibility and anonymity of the Internet are
fueling a brand new psychological disorder _ cybersex addiction _
that appears to be spreading with astonishing rapidity and bringing
turmoil to the lives of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers writing in the current issue of the journal Sexual
Addiction and Compulsivity report that many of the men and women
who now spend dozens of hours each week seeking sexual stimulation
from their computers deny that they have a problem and refuse to
seek help until their marriages, their jobs, or both, are in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the route to compulsive use of the Internet for
sexual satisfaction is fast and short, said Dr. Mark Schwartz of
the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis. ``Sex on the Net is
like heroin,'' he said. ``It grabs them and takes over their lives.
And it's very difficult to treat because the people affected don't
want to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most strongly hooked on Internet sex are likely to spend
hours each day masturbating to pornographic images or having
``mutual'' online sex with someone contacted through a chat room.
Occasionally, they progress to off-line affairs with sex partners
they meet online.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Al Cooper, a counseling coordinator at Stanford who has
conducted the largest and most detailed survey of online sex, calls
the Net ``the crack cocaine of sexual compulsivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted online among 9,265 men and women who
admitted surfing the Net for sexually oriented sites, indicated
that at least 1 percent were already seriously hooked on online
sex. The survey found that as many as a third of Internet users
visited some type of sexual site.
</P>
<P>
   Projected to the country as a whole, this would mean that a
minimum of 200,000 men and women have become cybersex addicts in
the last few years, Cooper said. And, he added, because the
respondents were self-selected and because denial of the symptoms
of sexual compulsivity is commonplace, there are likely to be many
more cybersex addicts than the survey indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hidden public health hazard exploding, in part,
because very few are recognizing it as such or taking it
seriously,'' Cooper wrote in his Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity
report.
</P>
<P>
   Another author, Dr. Jennifer Schneider, a physician in Tucson,
Ariz., who is associate editor of the journal, said in an interview
that even when cybersex addicts and their partners sought
treatment, they often concealed their real problem, and therapists
often failed to ask questions that would disclose it. As a result,
the diagnosis of cybersex addiction is often missed, Dr. Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kimberly S. Young of the Center for Online Addiction in
Bradford, Pa., wrote that ``partially as a result of the general
population and health care professionals not being attuned to the
risks, seemingly harmless cyberromps can result in serious
difficulties way beyond what was expected or intended.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cooper, who works at the San Jose Marital and
Sexuality Center in Santa Clara, Calif., cybersex compulsives are
just like drug addicts; they ``use the Internet as an important
part of their sexual acting out, much like a drug addict who has a
`drug of choice,''' and often with serious harm to their home lives
and livelihood. Especially vulnerable to becoming hooked on
Internet sex, he wrote, are ``those users whose sexuality may have
been suppressed and limited all their lives [who) suddenly find an
infinite supply of sexual opportunities'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dana Putnam, a psychologist in San Luis Obispo, Calif., said
other factors that could increase a person's vulnerability to
cybersex compulsion were depression and other forms of emotional
distress, relationship problems and a failure to get one's sexual
needs met.
</P>
<P>
   However, a second survey conducted by Schneider among 94 family
members affected by cybersex addiction revealed that the problem
could arise even among those in loving marriages with ample sexual
opportunities. ``Sex on the Net is just so seductive and it's so
easy to stumble upon it,'' she said. ``People who are vulnerable
can get hooked before they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who say a behavioral compulsion is not a true
addiction, Schneider responded with a definition of addiction that
would clearly apply to cybersex abusers: ``Loss of control,
continuation of the behavior despite significant adverse
consequences and preoccupation or obsession with obtaining the drug
or pursuing the behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Although behavioral addictions involve no external drugs,
preliminary research has suggested that they cause changes in brain
chemicals, like the release of endorphins, that help to perpetuate
the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual stimulation and release obtained through cybersex
also contribute importantly to the continued pursuit of the
activity, Schwartz said. He wrote: ``Intense orgasms from the
minimal investment of a few keystrokes are powerfully
reinforcing.'' He added, ``Cybersex affords easy, inexpensive
access to a myriad of ritualized encounters with idealized
partners. Many cybersex abusers are re-enacting aspects of past
losses, conflicts or traumas in order to foster illusions of power
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cybersex addicts develop a conditioned response to the
computer and become sexually aroused even before turning it on,
Putnam said. This can exacerbate the problem for people whose jobs
involve work on a computer. ``Simply sitting down to work at the
computer can start a sexual response that may facilitate online
sexual activities,'' he wrote in the journal.
</P>
<P>
   As with other addictions, tolerance to cybersex stimulation can
develop, prompting the addict to take more and more risks to
recapture the initial high, Schneider said. Online viewing that
began as a harmless recreation can become an all-consuming activity
and even lead to real sexual encounters with people met online.
</P>
<P>
   Cybersex compulsives can become so involved with their online
activities that they ignore their partners and children and risk
their jobs. In Cooper's survey, 20 percent of the men and 12
percent of the women reported they had used computers at work for
some sexual pursuits. Many companies now monitor employees' online
activities, and repeated visits to sexually oriented sites have
cost people their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including two physicians, have landed in federal
prison for two years because they downloaded child pornography when
authorities were watching, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most who pursue cybersex consider it harmless and safe to
do so. While social and safety concerns and fear of discovery may
prevent someone from visiting an adult bookstore or prostitute,
there are no such constraints when pornography and sexual partners
can be called up at any time of the day or night on a computer
screen in one's home or office, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say ``What's the harm? They're not risking disease
or death,'' Schneider, who has written extensively on sexual
addiction, responds that the damage can be as devastating as that
caused by compulsive gambling or addiction to alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In her survey, 91 women and 3 men in committed relationships
said they had experienced serious adverse consequences, including
broken relationships, from their partners' cybersex addictions.
Partners commonly reported feeling betrayed, devalued, deceived,
ignored and abandoned and unable to compete with a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a 34-year-old woman married 14 years to a
minister who she discovered was compulsively seeking sexual
satisfaction by visiting pornographic sites on the Internet. ``How
can I compete with hundreds of anonymous others who are now in our
bed, in his head?'' the woman wrote. ``Our bed is crowded with
countless faceless strangers, where once we were intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   A 38-year-old woman married 18 years to a man who compulsively
masturbates to images on the computer wrote that her husband had
once had an extramarital affair and that ``the online `safe'
cheating has just as dirty, filthy a feel to it as does the
`real-life' cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cooper's survey indicates that most female cybersex
addicts are single, married women also become cybersex addicts and
their husbands suffer the consequences. A 44-year-old man married
26 years to a woman who became hooked on cybersex wrote: ``At first
we had sex more than ever as I desperately tried to prove myself.
Then sex with her made me sick. I get strong pictures of what she
did and lusted after, and I get repelled and feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who become cybersex addicts may face even greater risks
than their male counterparts. Women, who tend to pursue
relationships, are inclined to visit sexually oriented chat rooms
rather than the pornographic Web sites that men prefer, Cooper
said. As women become increasingly hooked on online sex, they are
more likely to progress to off-line meetings, which can prove
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Children, too, often become victimized by cybersex addiction in
a parent. As Schneider noted, children can stumble upon the
pornographic material left on or near the computer or walk in on a
parent masturbating at the computer. Several mothers in her survey
were worried because their husbands surfed the Net while supposedly
watching their children, who got to view the pornography and
sometimes the masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   Children may also suffer as a result of increasing conflict
between the parents or breakup of the marriage. Even if the
marriage survives, children may lack adequate parental attention
when one parent is preoccupied with sex on the computer and the
other is preoccupied with the cybersex addict.
</P>
<P>
   Once unleashed, the power of a cyberaffair, cybersex, or both,
can cause a formerly loving man to become evasive and to demand his
privacy online, according to Young and her co-authors. ``This `new
frontier' in relationship dynamics can lead a once warm and
compassionate wife and mother to turn to the computer and its
cyberworld lovers and/or sex partners and away from caring for her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   As Putnam put it, ``Once people get hooked on cybersex, they
tend to put themselves at risk and do things they wouldn't
ordinarily do.''

major advance in assisting police in pursuing cyber-criminals
across borders, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, the chief scientist at Intel Corp., urged
industry leaders to cooperate with governments, particularly in
training ``cyber-police'' and keeping law-enforcement agencies up
to speed on technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments should not be the last to know about technology,''
said Aucsmith, who emerged as perhaps the top industry spokesman
during the conference. ``It is probably of use to industry to make
sure that the government understands what the technology can be out
there so governments can pursue hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the most important thing that came out of the meeting
is that cyber-crime is a worldwide thing, and it is every country's
problem and every company's problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference identified six basic principals that should be
taken into account in pursuing anti-cyber-crime policies:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ensuring the protection of individual freedoms and private
life;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Preserving governments' ability to fight high-tech crime;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Facilitating appropriate training for all involved;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Defining a clear and transparent framework for addressing
cyber-criminality;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ensuring free and fair activities, the sound development of
industry and supporting effective industry-initiated voluntary
codes of conduct and standards;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And assessing effectiveness and consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else was accomplished, the conference provided a rare
opportunity for industry and law-enforcement officials to meet _
albeit behind closed doors _ and get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the convention has agreed to exchange E-mail
addressees,'' said Toshinori Kanemoto, a Japanese police agency
official and conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the air of cooperation, divisions remain between
governments and the private sector over how to fight cyber-crime.
The world's leading Internet players say they expect to work with
governments, but have expressed concerns that excessive state
intervention could stifle the enormous growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. and British officials leaned toward industry
self-regulation, other officials, particularly those in Europe
favored more state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Selivanov, the Russian interior minister, used a
metaphor to explain that individual rights and commercial freedom
may at times have to be tempered to help crimefighters. ``When you
enter a church, you take off your hat, not your head,'' he said
when asked about his country's attitude about keeping a balance
between the rights of the state and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac left no one in any doubt that
his country wanted a bigger state role. ``To prevent and fight
crime, our democratic societies have only one legitimate actor _
the state _ and a single method _ applying the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy also advocated for more state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   All players at the conference excluded, for the moment, creating
an international ``cyber police'' body.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users worldwide are expected to reach more than a
half-billion by 2003, industry representatives said. The value of
Internet retailing is expected to rise from $20 billion to $185
billion by 2004. At the business-to-business level, it is expected
to jump from $100 billion to more than $2.7 trillion over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 meeting is the first international gathering of law
enforcers, business representatives and government officials to
address the burgeoning problem of cyber-crime. It will report its
conclusions to the G8 summit in Okinawa in July.

YOUR MISSION: TO ELIMINATE SPY PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My ex-wife downloaded a spy-type program. I
knew something was wrong when the hard drive ran every time I
pressed a key. Yes, this is my home PC. With a lot of effort, I
eventually found ``KeyLogger.'' I was able to delete it using Safe
Mode. Something is still in there, I think. The hard-drive light
continues to blink every few seconds. Is there any way other than
wiping the hard-drive to find these spy programs?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bugged in California
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUGGED: Well, I understand why you divorced her. These
weaselly keystroke recorders are abominable evidence of just how
endangered the concept of trust has become.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology that gives us instant access to a world of
information also gives your boss, your spouse, your neighbor and
even your government an easy way to spy on you. And this isn't the
usual paranoid rant: I'm not even going to mention the black
helicopters that have been following my every move.
</P>
<P>
   Just be aware that anything you do on a computer potentially can
be seen by somebody else. It may be a $30 shareware program that
somebody slips onto your hard drive or a multimillion-dollar
radio-frequency sniffer that the CIA uses to track your keystrokes
from a block away, but you should always act as if something is
watching and recording. I don't think I was supposed to mention the
CIA thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of types of recorders. The one you disabled
was fairly easy to get to and not much of a challenge to kill. When
it runs, it sits between your application programs, like
word-processors or browsers, and the part of the Windows system
that interprets keystrokes. It gathers what you type and saves them
to an encrypted log file. These kinds of loggers generally show up
when you hit Control-Alt-Delete to get the list of everything
running in Windows. You can kill it there temporarily if you know
what it's called, but it'll restart when you reboot.
</P>
<P>
   You were able to permanently delete it while you were in Safe
Mode since most background programs don't load when you start
Windows like that. If your ex-wife is as devious as I imagine,
there's more going on, though.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of recorder is a stealth logger. It loads at such
an elemental level of the Windows system that it's invisible. It
works in much the same way, though. Generally, it will store around
50 keystrokes, then dump them to a log file. That may be why your
drive light is blinking.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that unless you know for sure which file to look
for, you've pretty much got a needle-and-haystack scenario. To find
out if something really is recording, you might try using the Find
utility in the Start menu to look for all recently modified files.
There's a chance you'll spot a continually growing log file to
verify your suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   If it was me, I'd nuke the drive.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like to emphasize, for my editors', uh, reassurance,
that, in my purely professional opinion, the use of any such
software at the office would negatively affect computer performance
and endanger productivity, and that I was checking those
airline-ticket prices for an upcoming travel story.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: A little humility would be refreshing!
</P>
<P>
   _ Harrrummmph!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAR: You want humility? Go read Ann Landers. She's got a
lot to be humble about.

CAREERPATH'S WRONG TURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, I've acquired a reputation as a soft
touch. The word has gone forth to a host of embattled Internet
companies: Let's get that guy in Boston to write nice things about
us. That'll do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's why I got a call Wednesday from CareerPath.com,
a California job-hunting Web site that's facing a likely lawsuit
from Monster.com. It's another of those intellectual property cases
that'll continue to roil the Internet until nobody owns his own
name any more.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about such cases from time to time, and I've tended
to favor the free flow of online data _ just the attitude that
CareerPath is hoping for. Besides, The New York Times Co., owner of
The Boston Globe, is an investor in CareerPath, and while such
grubby concerns aren't supposed to motivate an honest journalist,
one can always hope.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. CareerPath offers a service called Resume Scout
that lets an employer check out multiple Internet resume listings
with a single search. Need to hire an expert in Visual Basic
programming to fend off the Love Bug virus? Type in ``visual
basic'' and you'll get lots of relevant resumes.
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath doesn't just search the various free resume services
on the Web. The service also works on commercial job-search sites
such as Monster.com. A company can pay $9,400 a year for access to
the Monster resume database. But if the Monster subscriber pays an
additional $200 a month to CareerPath, he can search the Monster
listings and dozens of others, all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Good for CareerPath and its customers, perhaps. But the people
at Monster are furious. They never gave permission for their
resumes to be listed by CareerPath, and they don't receive a dime
of compensation. Monster's lawyers have fired off a
cease-and-desist letter, demanding that CareerPath cut it out.
CareerPath vows to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're actually helping Monster,'' says Rob Feinstein,
CareerPath's vice president of marketing. ``We're making it easier
for recruiters to utilize their multiple subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein notes that his service will only provide Monster.com
resumes to users who've paid their Monster membership fee, so
they're not stealing any business. What right does Monster have to
complain?
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath compares its plight to that of Bidder's Edge. This
outfit is being sued by Internet auction house eBay, because
Bidder's Edge runs a Web site that lists auction information from
eBay, without eBay's permission. A federal judge has publicly
hinted that he's going to rule in favor of eBay, but he hasn't made
it official yet.
</P>
<P>
   He never should. I believe Bidder's Edge has every right to do
what it's doing, for two reasons. First, Bidder's Edge doesn't
charge a penny for its service, so it's not directly piggybacking
on eBay's hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Second and more important, Bidder's Edge is merely displaying
publicly available Internet data. eBay publishes its auction
listings right on the Web for all to see. Such openly published
Internet files are routinely indexed by all kinds of search
engines, which are vital to the smooth functioning of the Web. If
sites can demand payment from search services that list them, the
Web will become even more unmanageable than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   The CareerPath case is different. Monster.com's resume list is a
private database, stored on a password-protected server. The
company is surely entitled to set limits on its use, just as this
newspaper can decide who gets to reprint its articles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, CareerPath charges $200 a month, or $2,400 a year.
Those CareerPath customers who also subscribe to Monster.com may
well have joined so they can use CareerPath's handy search feature.
Some part of the $2,400 fee is due to the availability of
Monster.com listings. These customers might want to pay less, or
might not subscribe at all, if they couldn't get access to the
Monster.com resumes. That means CareerPath is deriving some of its
revenue by tapping unbidden into someone else's database.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, guys. This won't do. CareerPath's Resume Scout is a great
idea, but it's one that piggybacks on somebody else's great idea.
And it doesn't suddenly become all right, just because it's
happening on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath should either drop Monster from its service, or drag
out its checkbook and start paying royalties. No doubt this isn't
what the folks at CareerPath were hoping to read over their morning
corn flakes. But I can't have people thinking I've gone soft.

&HT;     GOVERNOR SEEKS STATE AID TO PROTECT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ As activists around the country secure
lawyers and plan for massive demonstrations at the Democratic
National Convention, Gov. Gray Davis is asking the Legislature for
$4.1 million so the Los Angeles police and the California Highway
Patrol can pay overtime and buy equipment in preparation for
potential riots, vandalism or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the money should not be
taken as a sign the governor is worried about anarchy at the August
convention in downtown Los Angeles. The state, he said, simply
should shoulder a portion of the burden being put on the LAPD and
other law enforcement agencies because of the weeklong convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police, the Secret Service, the FBI and the CHP,
which protects California dignitaries, are preparing for a huge
show of force in Los Angeles, if needed, after the wild
demonstrations in Seattle and Washington, D.C., over global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD said it has been working for more than a year with
about 30 police agencies planning for the convention. They sent
agents to Seattle and Washington to observe the police and
protesters there. They also plan to send a team to the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia in late July to get pointers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, groups of demonstrators have become equally
organized. The National Lawyers Guild hopes to engage up to 60
volunteer attorneys to represent arrested protesters. It has
scheduled two training sessions so its observers can learn how to
monitor the police and get names and badge numbers, and so
volunteer civil attorneys can learn how to represent criminally
accused clients for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we preparing for?'' said Cynthia Anderson-Barker, an
attorney with the Lawyers Guild in Los Angeles. ``We're preparing
for large numbers of demonstrators, there is no question about
that. But our goal is to inform people of their legal right to
protest and make sure their rights are respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson-Barker said the recruited attorneys will be trained in
dealing with protesters who refuse to give their names and
addresses to police officers. They also should be prepared to
``have many clients who range in charges from petty unlawful
assembly to felonies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police said they will set up a public
demonstration area near Staples Center, the convention site, and
will close streets to the public, diverting traffic away from the
convention. The police hope demonstrators will stay in the
so-called ``protest pit,'' but they know that is unrealistic for
some protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have a lot of people who are going to want to
slow down traffic and disrupt operations of the convention,'' said
LAPD Lt. Horace Frank. ``Our No. 1 priority is to ensure the
community is not disrupted. Second, that the convention goes as
planned. And third, that people get to exercise their
constitutional right to demonstrate, but do so peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Without elaborating on the department's plans, Frank said the
LAPD wants to make sure it has all the tactical resources it needs
to respond to any situation. At the beginning of the convention,
that probably means uniformed officers patrolling the convention
center, not a hugely visible show of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be standing 24 hours a day in front of the
convention in riot gear,'' Frank said. ``Our hope is this is going
to be a peaceful convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar plans are being worked out in Philadelphia for the GOP
convention that begins in late July. Demonstrators there have won a
critical legal battle with the police over Philadelphia's planned
protest pit. Protesters were given the right to march down a main
thoroughfare as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt that the whole concept of having one spot in the
city where you could express your First Amendment rights was
outrageous,'' said Michael Morrill, an organizer with Unity 2000,
the umbrella group for Philadelphia organizers. ``When we found out
about the police plan, we encouraged people not to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, announced the $4.1 million for the LAPD this
week in his budget address. The administration wants $730,000 for
the CHP to ``fund dignitary protection for elected state officials
and 21 (Democratic) governors from other states'' attending the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $3.4 million will buy equipment that will be
loaned to the LAPD for ``additional security as well as terrorism
preparedness and prevention,'' the governor's Department of Finance
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of overtime. There are a lot of costs that are
going to happen,'' Bustamante said, ``and a lot of economic good
because of the convention. This is just some assistance.''

THE ODD MASTERMIND BEHIND WEB SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great things about the Internet is that it channels
the energy of some quirky folks who might otherwise spend their
time firing off letters to the editor, hunting down space aliens,
or walking down Main Street au naturel.
</P>
<P>
   Take HC, the solitary force behind www.c3f.com, a labyrinthine
site that includes ``the Net's only sorta daily satire column.''
For five years now, this esoteric individual has created twisted
commentaries that are either drop-dead funny or simply defy
explanation. The most recent offering is an animated image of Bill
Gates's head being split in two, revealing less-than cerebral
matter. On Tax Day, the site featured a California tax form with a
scrolling stock ticker tape and instructions that were, like,
totally la-la.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your typical text-only satire, like The Onion. HC is
one of the only people out there using the technology of the
Internet to satirize news, pop culture, or whatever happens to be
bugging him. Click on the item slugged ``Earthquake Hallucinating
Rampant,'' and the screen shakes. Dig into the archives and watch
the ``1997 Year in Review Generator'' spew out wacko headlines
mixing references to Mother Theresa, Frank Gifford, and Dolly the
Sheep. The sensibility is best described as postmodern geek, like
Don DeLillo meets Max Headroom meets Mad magazine. Admittedly, it's
an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   So who is the mastermind of this maze? His real name is Howard
Cohen, a 39-year-old former programmer in Del Mar, Calif. He
started the site back in 1995 to sell his novel online. ``It's not
a standard novel,'' Cohen says. ``It doesn't have character and
stories and sex and violence and blah, blah, blah.'' It also
doesn't have a name that can be printed in a family newspaper; for
short, it's known as ``MFU.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first novels online, it hasn't exactly taken off,
although Cohen did get the thing published by an obscure small
press and has sold ``hundreds'' of copies. Most of the novel is
still posted on the massive site, tucked away in an elaborate
parody of the online magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   The satire section uses a name that is a takeoff on The
Washington Post. In the early days, Cohen called the parody The New
Times York _ until he heard from the lawyers. The cease and desist
letter from the Times is still posted on the site: It seems the
powers that be objected to the use of the slogan, ``All the news
that's fit to sell Toyotas.'' Cohen changed the name to The Street
Wall Journal, which didn't last long either. He has heard from the
Post's lawyers, but he took his chances; so far, they've let him
be. His next target would have been a local paper called The Austin
Lobe. That would have been fun.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cohen has plenty of time on his hands. Years ago, he
made a bunch of money as a programmer, and he hasn't had to work
ever since. Instead, he spends all his time pushing the boundaries
of Web satire. ``I'm not addicted to the Web; I'm addicted to
writing and producing stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there sure is a lot of it. The site is an endless series of
links, complete with the ``sorta daily'' stuff as well as parodies
of ancient Web sites, including the old Microsoft Network and
Time-Warner's defunct Pathfinder site. In its own bizarre way, this
self-contained universe chronicles a five-year history of pop
culture, politics, and the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen seems happily immersed in this world: He doesn't get out
much. In fact, he can go for weeks without leaving the house. ``I'm
a total recluse,'' he explains. ``I want to challenge J.D. Salinger
to a contest to see who is the better recluse. I think I have him
beat.'' Oh, and he also doesn't talk very much; there have been
weeks when the only word he said was ``plastic'' _ as in ``Paper or
plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now he orders his groceries online. What about
clothes? ``I don't have to wear clothes,'' he says. ``In fact, as I
speak to you, I am utterly, absolutely naked. It's good when
Jehovah's witnesses answer the door.'' Is he kidding? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Another Internet First!!! It's called ``Quantum Project,''
and it's being billed as the ``first Internet feature film with an
established crew and cast.'' That may or may not be true; there are
thousands of films available online. Nevertheless, the 31-minute
film was made exclusively for distribution on the Internet and
produced by the folks who made ``What Dreams May Come.'' The film
stars Fay Masterston, Stephen Dorff, and John Cleese; Dorff plays a
physicist looking for love. For $5.95, users can download this
sci-fi romance from www.sightsound.com (which financed the $3
million film) and from www.quantumprojectthemovie.com. Download
time is expected to be 10 minutes on a broadband connection or four
hours on a low-speed modem. If the technology works and the film is
worth watching, this may be the beginning of a new era of film
distribution. (And Cohen will never have to leave the house to get
a video ever again.)

SECRETS OF LOVE REVEALED, WHEN `I LOVE YOU' CAME AS A FAX 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a direct echo of Neal Stephenson's path-breaking 1992 science
fiction novel ``Snow Crash,'' the recent Love Bug computer worm had
one oddly disturbing behavior: In a few scattered cases the program
faxed itself to its victims.
</P>
<P>
   In the dystopian ``Snow Crash'' vision of the world, viruslike
software leaps across the boundary separating machines from humans.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sample passage, describing the hacker's means of
invasion: ``He messes with binary code for a living. That ability
is firm-wired into the deep structures of the brain. So he's
susceptible to that form of information. And so are you,
home-boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case of life imitating art, when the virus struck the
Thursday before last, a reporter received a copy of one of the ``I
Love You'' notes _ in this case, as a fax accidentally sent by the
Microsoft Corp.'s public relations office. (``It's an interesting
and logical conclusion to everyone's desire for
mega-connectedness,'' a Microsoft spokesman said of the incident.)
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the cover sheet, which stated ``kindly check the
attached LOVELETTER coming from me,'' were two pages of the
program's destructive code. Because the code had been attached to
the e-mail message as a standard word processing text file, the fax
machine simply printed it out.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rogue program was designed to send itself to every
address in a Microsoft Outlook e-mail address book, when it came
across a fax number in the list it simply transmitted itself via
fax.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephenson's novel, the invasive virus also carries
subliminal messages, such as ideologies and other concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The LOVELETTER fax, though, did not seem to carry any subliminal
information. And yet, since it was sent from the embattled
Microsoft Corp. to a technology writer who covers the company, who
really knows?

VIRUS BRINGS PUBLICITY TO COMPUTER SUBCULTURE IN PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ If what local investigators suspect is
true, the virus that brought some of the world's most sophisticated
computer networks to a halt this month was hatched in a noisy
inner-city neighborhood where residents live under corrugated steel
roofs and raise fighting cocks in their front yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a two-bedroom apartment on the ground floor of a
grubby concrete apartment building that an unremarkable programming
student named Onel A. de Guzman lived with his sister Irene and her
boyfriend, Reonel Ramones.
</P>
<P>
   There, de Guzman worked on his college thesis: a program
designed to help fellow Filipinos gain free access to the Internet
by harvesting passwords from paying subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   He said last week that he might have inadvertently unleashed the
program that on May 4 spread to computers around the world
disguised as an innocuous e-mail message titled ``I Love You,''
costing by some estimates $10 billion in lost data and
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   That the world's most infectious computer virus to date could
have such origins illustrates how the Internet's global sprawl has
left the network vulnerable to disruption from even its most remote
technological backwaters.
</P>
<P>
   For the Philippines, on the other hand, the ``Love Bug'' and the
hacker subculture that it exposed are an embarrassing advertisement
of the country's programming talent and infant dot-com scene. They
also raised the issue of the cost of Internet access for developing
countries struggling to close a daunting technology gap with richer
countries.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining that he meant no harm, de Guzman said that
Internet access should be free and that charging for its use was
immoral. In his thesis, which his college rejected, he introduced
his program by saying it would help many people ``spend more time
on the Internet without paying.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the grudging admiration people here have shown for
de Guzman, Internet executives say it helps to understand the
public's reverence for a more low-tech Filipino innovation, a
vehicle known as the jeepney.
</P>
<P>
   Jeepneys made their first appearance after World War II,
hand-built from liberated Japanese equipment and U.S. Army jeeps of
dubious provenance. The ungainly utility vehicles transformed
four-seat machines of war into gaudily decorated, smog-belching
conveyances for as many as 22 commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Maligned these days as unsafe and environmentally unsound, the
colorful jeepney survives on Philippine roads as cheap public
transport and a symbol of Filipino ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the jeepney,'' Zenisa Perez, an analyst at the
Manila office of the International Data Corp., a computer research
company, said of the de Guzman's program. ``He made do with what he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the gap between rich and poor is enormous,
Filipinos say, the jeepney ethos has moved beyond transportation to
inspire a kind of subculture of proletarian larceny. Poor Filipinos
commonly tap into everything from power lines to cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Software Alliance, a U.S. trade group that fights
software piracy, estimates that about 77 percent of the software
used in the Philippines is pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Like commercially written software, the Internet is considered
by many Filipinos to be unjustly expensive. While customers in the
United States and other developed countries can use it at
negligible cost, or even free, Internet services here charge nearly
$1.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Why so expensive? Limited competition for international
telecommunications links keeps Internet access more than four times
as expensive as in the United States. Making matters worse, poor
domestic telephone lines mean that the fastest connections here are
still roughly 50 times slower than the best lines available to
Internet users in the United States. Most Filipinos do not even
have a telephone, much less a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   At the school that de Guzman attended, Amable Mendoza Aguiluz
Computer College, the situation is even more challenging. The
school has 150 branches around the country, though it has yet to be
accredited. Many of its instructors are recent graduates, and de
Guzman's campus in Manila is in a former warehouse without flush
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   It is no MIT, but to its 15,000 students it holds the promise of
a lucrative career, perhaps even the chance to work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Myra Deguro, an 18-year-old junior, grew up in a
home without a phone. She hopes to turn her computer science degree
into a secretarial job if she does not land a position in a
high-tech company.
</P>
<P>
   Deguro is fortunate: her father is a driver for a wealthy Manila
family, which is paying her annual tuition and laboratory fees of
about $1,500. Other students, she says, end up taking time off so
they can save enough money to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Students say Internet access is a precious commodity. College
labs limit them to several prescribed hours among a limited number
of computers, many of which are incapacitated at any given time by
unsuccessful student programs or successful student viruses. That
leaves Internet cafes, which offer a more reliable, though
expensive, alternative.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, students say, is just part of a lively Filipino
hacker community that has sprung up to circumvent such obstacles.
In addition to selling homework projects, they say, hackers often
circulate purloined account information among the student body.
</P>
<P>
   One of several local hacker sites, the Pinoy Virus Writers Web
site, declares: ``Information will be free for everyone.
Information will be fed to those in need. Information shall never
again be sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the students applaud the hackers' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   The college administration is also not amused. It said Saturday
that it would seek disciplinary action against de Guzman and the
nine other members of a group of student programmers named
Grammersoft, whose name appeared in the ``I Love You'' virus' code.
Grammersoft's members, two of whom have reportedly already gone off
to work in the United States, deny any involvement in the case. One
group member, Michael Buen, appeared at a news conference on Sunday
to declare his innocence. De Guzman and his lawyer could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the police have not formally named any suspects in the
suspected misdeed, which so far does not appear to be an explicit
crime under Philippine law. Legislators are pushing for a new law
that would make a crime of unauthorized entry of computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The only charge pending is against de Guzman's roommate,
Ramones, contending that he violated a law against misusing
passwords.

SUPERCOMPUTER HELPING CRACK GENETIC CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM ABATE   
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ At Celera Genomics' data processing center
stood a supercomputer, 5 feet tall and nearly as wide.
</P>
<P>
   It had no lights, no monitor, no way to display the fact that
all its circuits were straining to solve a giant puzzle _ how to
put the 3 billion chemical letters of human DNA in the proper order
and thus produce the first complete copy of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one other like it in the world,'' Celera
spokesman Paul Gilman said, patting the silent machine. Its mate
was under wraps in the research laboratories at Compaq Computer,
which plans to unveil the Alpha GA160, or Wildfire, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 gigabytes of RAM _ a thousand times as much memory as a
store-bought PC _ Wildfire is one of the most powerful civilian
computers in the world. The fact that Celera got its Wildfire three
weeks before the official release date is testimony to the fact
that DNA discovery has become the hottest challenge in computing,
as high-tech gurus team up with biologists to unravel the software
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome effort is pushing every aspect of computer science,
from mathematics and database software to hardware and
networking,'' said Peter Karp, who heads a research group at SRI
International in Menlo Park that focuses on bioinformatics _ the
effort to search, study and store biological data.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist Inc. of Oakland, Calif., is a perfect example of how
those who hope to study DNA data must first build the computing
tools to make that possible. Last week, using three supercomputers
and 350 workstations from Sun Microsystems of Palo Alto, Calif.,
DoubleTwist identified 105,000 possible genes by sifting through
the mass of information stored in a public database.
</P>
<P>
   Before DoubleTwist could start its gene hunt, however, a team of
programmers including Honbo Zhou, who worked on IBM's Deep Blue
chess-playing computer, and Kyle Hart, a specialist from the
University of Pennsylvania, had to write software that treated all
those supercomputers and workstations as one giant processor.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling this virtual machine was just their first step.
Finding genes in the DNA posed an equal challenge. DNA is made up
of four chemicals, represented by the letters A, T, G and C. They
are joined in a string more than 3 billion letters long.
</P>
<P>
   But only 3 to 5 percent of those letters encode the genes, and
it is genes that are expected to lead to breakthroughs in promoting
good health or combatting disease.
</P>
<P>
   What the rest of those DNA letters do is still a mystery, but
for the gene hunters, the challenge was to sift through that
unwanted information to find the desired data. Yannick Pouliot,
director of DoubleTwist's bioinformatics group, said DNA does
provide some clues as to where genes begin and end. The letters ATG
signal a start. Stop signs can be expressed as TGA, TAG or TAA.
</P>
<P>
   But out of billions of letters, the programs are bound to
encounter many false starts and stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distinguishing the actual starts is one of the greatest
challenges,'' Pouliot said. ``They don't (all) stand out, that's
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   So the data must be sifted time and again, using a variety of
comparative software. Sylvia Spengler, director of computational
genomics at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said these programs look
to see whether possible genes resemble genes that are already
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some level, it's like the children's game of animal,
vegetable or mineral,'' Spengler said. ``You ask questions of the
data by comparing it to what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with DNA analysis is that we still know so little
about genes that it's hard to develop software that asks the right
questions. Spengler likened the current computer studies of the
genome to the maps used by early European explorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd drawn the continents as big blobs without distinct
coastlines, and when they got to unknown waters, they'd say, `There
be dragons here,''' she said. ``Well, we've got lots of dragons.''
</P>
<P>
   One subtle sign of the cross-fertilization of computing and
biology has been the spirit of playfulness that the bioinformatics
specialists bring to their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   At DoubleTwist, where the 25-person programming team worked
nonstop for nine months, games of foosball and pingpong broke the
tension, while Friday afternoon beer busts provided informal
brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a tour of the computing department at Celera showed
cubicles armed with as much Nerf firepower as an Internet startup.
About two-thirds of the firm's 400 employees are either hardware or
software engineers, with biologists rounding out the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Celera's chief computer scientist, Gene Myers, in many
ways exemplifies the cyber-biologic synergy driving the genome
effort.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief meeting in the Celera cafeteria, Myers showed up
wearing a leather jacket and scarf _ evidence that he had ridden to
work on his hog, a Shadow 1100 motorcycle. His blue sapphire
earring, he explained, is a memento of his many years as a computer
science professor at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But behind this Brandoesque exterior, Myers is redefining the
science of computerized puzzle solving. Celera's privately funded
effort to sequence the human genome is predicated on the notion
that the company could break the 3 billion letters of DNA into
blocks 500 letters long, and then put these pieces back together
again with computer software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly funded scientists who began the Human Genome
Project never believed a puzzle that huge could be solved, so they
opted to break the genome into several dozen midsize puzzles that
could be solved more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Celera bets that its more daring strategy will succeed first.
Myers has yet to prove the point by producing a 3 billion-letter
sequence of human DNA; that's the problem that has the Wildfire
supercomputer working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But even skeptics were impressed in March when Celera, in
conjunction with researchers at the University of California at
Berkeley, used Myers' puzzle-solving software to sequence the
genome of the fruit fly, the most ambitious DNA study done to date.
</P>
<P>
   True, the fruit fly project involved only one-30th as many
pieces as the human genome puzzle. But then Celera cracked that nut
using 800 smaller Compaq processors. When asked just how many
pieces of data he is asking the computers to sort this time, Myers
took off his glasses, closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one with 360 zeros after it,'' he said, looking up
again. Indeed, that data set is so huge, even Wildfire's 64
gigabytes of memory can't open the file in one chunk. ``We need
about 600 gigabytes of memory,'' Myers said at a scientific meeting
last week. Because memories that huge don't yet exist, Celera has
had to chop its puzzle up so that Wildfire _ with the help of those
smaller Compaq processors _ can comprehend the task.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the objective of all this genome research is to put
data in a form that can be easily searched over the Internet so
that it's available, not just to drug and biotech researchers, but
to doctors and patients. That distribution problem poses huge
challenges, said Spengler, the researcher at California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are people going to access it from laptops?'' she asked.
And, one might add, how far over the horizon might that be?
Spengler might love to venture a guess, but right now, on her maps,
there be dragons in the way.

E-COMMERCE: CATALOG COMPANIES EXPLOIT THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this season of comeuppance for Internet-only retailers,
catalog companies that also sell on the Web may finally be getting
their due.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the stock prices of so-called ``pure play'' electronic
retailers spiked last Christmas season, the e-tailers acknowledged
that they would still need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars
on marketing and warehouses to make their businesses viable _
investments the catalog companies had made long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Internet merchants also acknowledged their need for direct
marketing expertise _ an admission that might have seemed downright
flattering to catalog companies, if they were not too busy trying
to keep the dot-coms from luring away their best executives.
</P>
<P>
   But now that investors have turned their attention to
profitability, the old-line catalog companies that have built the
most extensive Web operations are stepping into more favorable
light. Companies like Lands' End, Hanover Direct and BMG Direct are
already generating profits from their e-commerce sites. And, thanks
to the Web, the prospects for their catalog businesses are
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their numbers are staggering,'' said Barbara Wykoff, an
analyst with the investment firm Buckingham Research. ``It's
frightening how fast they're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End, for example, generated 3 percent of sales from its
Web site (www.landsend.com) in 1998, Wykoff said. But last quarter,
that number was 12 percent. BMG Direct, a Bertelsmann unit that
sells CDs, generated 10 percent of its sales from the Web last
year, and could reach 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wykoff said that companies with a catalog pedigree _ including
J.C. Penney, Lands' End and L.L. Bean _ not only have some of the
most visited e-commerce sites on the Web, but they have proved to
be the best at converting browsers to buyers. Those three companies
each have conversion rates of 13 to 16 percent online, according to
Nielsen NetRatings, an Internet research firm, compared with an
average of about 1.8 percent among all Web retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important statistic separating catalog
companies from their Web-only competitors is customer acquisition
cost. According to a recent survey by the Boston Consulting Group
on behalf of the industry association Shop.org, catalog retailers
spent $11 on average for each new customer last year. In
comparison, e-tailers spent $82 per customer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for such a disparity, of course, is that e-tailers
are still burning through tens of millions of dollars in
advertising to attract customers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog companies, meanwhile, have a built-in marketing vehicle
that can sit around a consumer's house for weeks before it reaches
the trash. And to make sure customers remember the Internet sites,
catalog companies often print their Web addresses on every page.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog companies also report that instead of the Web
cannibalizing their catalog sales, it is creating new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover Direct, which owns several catalog operations, including
Gump's, International Male and the Company Store, said that 50
percent of its online customers last year had not previously
purchased goods from their catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that taking a print catalog and using targeted
marketing principles is the most efficient way to create online
customers,'' said Rakesh K. Kaul, Hanover's chief executive. ``It's
no contest,'' he said, when compared with ``e-tailers who go out
and buy ads on the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web has also helped build the overall profit the company can
squeeze out of each customer over repeat visits, he said. Rather
than send an existing customer a new catalog each month, Kaul said,
the company complements the catalog mailings with e-mail messages,
thereby reducing marketing costs. ``So the Web now becomes a very
efficient way to maintain customer contact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog businesses benefit from the Web in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   George McMillan, chief executive of BMG Direct, said the company
could use the Web to test and create new catalog ideas that might
not otherwise be viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't identify a market of 400,000 to 500,000 users,
you can't justify the product development costs and research
necessary to test it,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web, you don't have any paper or printing costs
associated with testing an idea,'' he continued. ``You can try more
things without getting burned, and maybe find niches of the market
that are smaller, but still make sense economically.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan declined to say if BMG would roll out new catalogs
aimed at BMG customers as a result of this testing. But he said the
company was ``experimenting with some things'' among BMG's 10
million customers _ 2.8 million of whom are online. ``There are a
lot of segments in 10 million people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy as they are with their core businesses, catalog companies
recognize that it is far more economical to close a sale over the
Web than over the phone, so they are pushing to convert more of
their customers to the Web with every passing month. According to
Wykoff of Buckingham Research, catalog companies ``won't save a
significant amount of money'' on overall customer costs ``until the
Internet gets to 20 percent of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. Bear Creek Corp., which owns Harry and
David, a food catalog and Web site (www.harryanddavid.com),
generates about 9 percent of its sales on the Internet, and saves
about $4.60 for each order placed through the Web, according to
Nancy Tait, the company's executive vice president. Given the
orders the company handled on the Web last year, that amounts to
about $1.1 million saved.
</P>
<P>
   But as Lands' End found out last year, companies cannot rely too
much on the Web to deliver profits. Lands' End mailed about 9
percent fewer catalogs last holiday season, analysts said _ a move
that might help explain its 17 percent dip in holiday sales and a
substantial decline in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an inextricable link between the catalog and the
site,'' said Bill Bass, vice president of e-commerce for Lands'
End. ``Our traffic always spikes when the catalogs arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   But that will not stop the company from an Internet-only
approach in other countries. This summer, Bass said, Lands' End
will roll out sites in several European countries where the company
does not mail catalogs. As for marketing in those countries, he
said, ``online, word-of-mouth means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   For catalog companies, one of the most satisfying aspects of the
recent slide in e-tailing stocks is that their own employees are
now less inclined to jump ship when a dot-com recruiter calls.
``That's been a real drain on our industry,'' said Tait of Bear
Creek. ``I'm hoping those days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be. Kaul of Hanover said that dot-coms were now more
interested in forming partnerships with catalog companies than in
luring away their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a number of Internet companies approach us recently
saying, `Gee, why don't you create a catalog for us and help us
understand how this works?''' he said. ``So I wouldn't be surprised
if you see more and more combinations in the catalog and Internet
world.''

   RELIGION-CHARISMATIC (Waltham, Mass.) _ Twice a week, hundreds
of people from all over New England flock to worship services led
by Father Tom DiLorenzo of Holy Rosary Church. They sing, dance,
speak in tongues, have visions and fall to the ground, ``slain in

Catholics, it is part of a ``charismatic renewal'' movement that
American bishops say will be a key to the strength of the Church in

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Thursday night, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of
Time Inc., boogied to the sounds of Barenaked Ladies, the Canadian
pop group, at a party at San Francisco's Pacific Bell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was an invitation-only party for 1,000 guests to
introduce Time Inc.'s E-Company Now, an offshoot of Fortune
magazine that will focus on the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   The party was supposed to mark the first time that executives
from Time Warner and America Online celebrated the birth of a Time
Inc. magazine together. And the gala took place far from Time
Warner's New York headquarters, in a city more closely linked with
the new-media culture that America Online so embodies.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, and Don Logan, chief
executive of Time Inc., joined Pearlstine. Stephen M. Case,
chairman of America Online, was supposed to attend but could not
get away from the East Coast. He sent remarks by videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the inevitable question: Can the current executives
of Time Warner and America Online all boogie to the same corporate
tune?
</P>
<P>
   That question was addressed, at least for the moment, last week,
when the two companies released an organization chart with a mother
lode of corporate turf under the name of Robert W. Pittman, an
America Online executive and the designated co-chief operating
officer of the new company, to whom Logan and his magazine
division, pushed further down the food chain, will now report.
</P>
<P>
   And within the last six weeks, Pearlstine has seemingly answered
questions about his own immediate future. A year ago, it was widely
believed inside Time Inc. that he would leave the job of editor in
chief at the end of 2000, a belief that led to an internal guessing
game about whether John Huey, managing editor of Fortune, or Walter
Isaacson, managing editor of Time magazine, was more likely to take
his job.
</P>
<P>
   But the 57-year-old Pearlstine has renegotiated his contract and
in an interview last week said he would stay at the company for at
least another three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the corporate tinkering may be far from over. Two senior
Time Inc. executives said last week that an editorial job might be
created above Pearlstine's, a sort of AOL Time Warner super-editor
who would oversee _ and try to create synergies between _ the
journalistic activities at Time Warner and America Online. In this
scenario, one person would supervise the journalistic work of CNN,
Time Inc. and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of an editor in chief for the integrated company
would please both Case and Levin, who have discussed the notion,
the executives said. Both men are determined to show an integrated
company to Wall Street _ and Time Warner has never been perceived
by the business community as particularly well integrated. And
Levin, the Time Inc. executives said, has not been excessively
pleased with the level of synergy within his own company,
particularly between Time Inc. and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc., said no plans had
been made for the editorial-czar position. But with Pittman now
overseeing subscription and advertising sales not only at Time Inc.
but for other Time Warner and AOL divisions as well, some believe
it might make sense to have an executive with the same breadth of
editorial responsibility reporting to him. If the position is
created, it will not be happen before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as another Time Inc. executive put it: ``Until the merger is
done, you never know how things will play out.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online has long argued that the separation of editorial
church and commercial state does not jibe with the new-media
concept that success comes from the integration of commerce and
content.
</P>
<P>
   But does it make sense to alter a magazine division that is
thriving so mightily? Time Inc. _ a division that includes both
magazines and book publishing _ took in $4.6 billion in revenue in
1999, according to the company's annual report, up from $4.4
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines that the division publishes range from the
outrageous puffery of In Style and Teen People to the authoritative
business coverage of Fortune magazine. (Only 6 percent of the
division's revenue was attributable to book publishing, according
to industry estimates.)
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine, at a conference sponsored by Industry Standard and
New York magazines two weeks ago, said he was less worried about
interference from America Online on the editorial front than about
the internal distribution of corporate resources. How does one
convince Wall Street, he asked, that investing in a new magazine is
better than say, expanding a cable system?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, there are more pressing concerns for Pearlstine. As
Time Warner is absorbed into America Online, there is a question
within the company about whether Time Inc. magazines will receive
special treatment from America Online and whether America Online
might even get preferential treatment in the pages of Time
magazines _ which have so far in fact gone out of their way to
cover Time Warner and America Online with a brusque and sometimes
biting fairness.
</P>
<P>
   (Time magazine clearly portrayed Time Warner as the loser in the
company's public relations battle with Walt Disney Co. over the
Time Warner cable blackout of ABC two weeks ago.)
</P>
<P>
   And there is some minor turbulence within the magazine division:
Real Simple, the new magazine for women from Time Inc.'s immensely
successful People division, has met with disappointment both on the
newsstand and within the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Henry Muller, Time Inc.'s editorial director for
seven years, gave up that position to become an editor at large. At
the same time, Isolde Motley _ the former managing editor of Life,
which was closed last month _ was named corporate editor. But no
replacement was named for the editorial director position that
Muller left.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Pearlstine addressed the issue of
editorial independence _ which has been assured to him from all
angles, he said _ and whether Time Inc. magazines would receive
preferential treatment on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a distance you might say, `Why do this merger if you
don't do that?''' Pearlstine asked. ``But I think it winds up being
more an issue of right of first refusal. If it makes sense, you
obviously want to cooperate. But if you try to force everything
through those filters, you will probably get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation, Pearlstine said, is not unlike that in which Time
Inc. found itself when Time magazine sought a television network as
a partner in producing a special based on Time magazine's Person of
the Century issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to CNN first and they said, `We don't have a lot of
money to put into this, and we don't have 50 years of archives,
because we haven't been around that long, and we don't have that
many customers for this kind of appointment viewing,''' he said.
``Meanwhile, CBS was there saying, `We have fifty years of
archives, and lots of eyeballs and money to put into it.' So we
wound up doing the deal with CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   All the instincts within the company, Pearlstine said, ``will be
to _ the old Wall Street cliche _ `unlock shareholder value' by
finding more synergy in the deal.'' But he added, ``Gerry, and
certainly Case, at least to date, have been saying that where it
makes sense, we will do deals, but where it does not, we will
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine insisted there were no substantial problems at Real
Simple _ although one senior staff member said the new magazine
might better be described as ``real complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has some work to do, and it is a hard concept to execute,''
he said. He added that because of the swift success of Teen People
and In Style, both of which also originated in the People division,
the introduction of Real Simple faced higher expectations from the
outset than most magazines. The first issue was also released at
the same time as the first issue of Hearst Magazine's ``O: The
Oprah Magazine,'' which Pearlstine described as ``first-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the larger corporate structure has yet to
affect Pearlstine, or his relationship with Logan. It is known
throughout Time Inc. management that Logan and Pittman get along
well. They share the ideas about using each other's companies to
get more subscriptions and about using the two companies together
as a formidable advertising platform _ and they have similar
Southern backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Mississippi, and he's from Alabama,'' Logan said.
``So we both know the difference between hush puppies and
barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   As for filling the super-editor job, candidates mentioned
include Pearlstine, Isaacson and, to a lesser degree, Huey.
</P>
<P>
   Logan would not comment on whether the new position would be
created. As for any other changes, he said: ``You will see some
movement within the management teams. But it too early to say
what.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury goods
conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, wants to get
something straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself at all as a fashion guy,'' he said in
fluent, if heavily accented English, in a conference room adjacent
to his office at LVMH's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault, who controls an A-list of luxury goods companies
including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tag Heuer and Dom
Perignon, would much prefer to be considered ``a business guy'' _
even if he happens to manage fashionable businesses. And even if he
happens to be garbed in Dior from head to toe, as he gives an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Arnault has begun to move beyond tres chic to geek chic,
personally investing hundreds of millions of dollars of his own
money into Internet ventures here in Europe and across the
Atlantic. His American investments have included $115 million in
the American online trading firm the Datek Online Holdings Corp.,
$90 million in the controversial music site MP3.com and about $10
million in the Web auctioneer eBay.
</P>
<P>
   But those are mere side bets compared with his ambitious
investment vehicle, Europ(AT)Web, which he sees as a European
version of CMGI, the U.S.-based Internet incubator and holding
company. He has invested $500 million in Europ(AT)Web (pronounced
Europe-at-Web), which plans to make a public stock offering of its
shares in July.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault's is a decidedly European approach to Internet business
_ a game so far being played by executives older and more
established than the young upstarts so common on the American Web
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be no Jerry Yang of Europe,'' said Olivier
Beauvillain, a French Internet analyst with the research firm
Jupiter Communications in London. Yang, of course, is the storied
young Silicon Valley billionaire who co-founded Yahoo while still a
student at Stanford University. ``The big Internet players here are
dominated by traditional businessmen,'' Beauvillain said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Europe's largest Internet operations are
outgrowths of traditional businesses, run by management teams with
decades of experience. Take bol.com, the European equivalent of
Amazon.com. Owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG,
bol.com is managed by Heinz B. Wermelinger, who is 53 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, at 51, Arnault, is not merely an investor in the Web.
Beneath his tailored suit, he insists, there beats the heart of
cybernaut. ``I've had broadband at home for the past year,'' he
said proudly, then added a road warrior's lament. ``Sometimes I'm
in hotel room and I use narrow band now and it's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the more than one dozen hatchlings from Europ(AT)Web's
incubator have had mixed results. One success is LibertySurf, a
French Internet service provider, that recently went public and
made Arnault's initial investment of $58 million now worth more
than $2 billion. But Europ(AT)Web's 8 percent stake in a British
clothing retailer, Boo.com, has been a disaster, as the company
bleeds losses and the management is fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Europ(AT)Web has also invested in a bevy of other Internet
sites. Arnault is excited about the prospects for Flutter.com, a
new British betting site, as well as Ze Project, a European online
bank. The group has also invested in MetaMarkets, a discussion site
for individual investors, and Aucland, a French online auction
company.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault still spends most of his working time managing LVMH's
pedigreed line of luxury products. But he says he devotes about a
quarter of his time to Europ(AT)Web, working with his younger
colleagues, of whom he observes: ``They aren't concerned with
fashion. They wear the Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnault contends that even though he has become a business
tycoon and a staple of the glossy fashion magazines, his younger
colleagues do not treat him like a celebrity. ``People are very
relaxed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not too relaxed, though. Chahram Becharat, the 33-year-old
managing director of Europ(AT)Web refers to his boss as Arnault,
not Bernard. And Arnault maintains the constancy of Internet time,
in which any time might be work time. ``He usually calls me every
weekend,'' Becharat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault, who started his career as an engineer at a French
construction company before trading in his hardhat for haute
couture, became interested in the Internet in 1997, when he
invested in Cisco Systems Inc. After further investigation, he put
a stake in eBay. When both investments came up winners, ``it became
obvious that something was happening in the world with the
Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the revolution was in full swing in the United States when
Arnault jumped in, the Internet was still a novelty in Europe.
Still, by the time he began Europ(AT)Web in June 1999, investing in
European Web sites and Internet service providers, some analysts
say he was already too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europ(AT)Web would have been a massive force if it came along
three years ago,'' said Beauvillain, the Jupiter analyst. ``A lot
of windows of opportunity have closed,'' he added, explaining that
much of the Internet in Europe has already been carved out by
American imports like Yahoo and Amazon.com and earlier European
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnault sees a benefit to his timing, even with the
so-called dot-com bubble in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the exaggeration of this `exuberance,' as the Fed says,
you could find any project funded immediately with crazy amounts of
money,'' he said, laughing. ``Today there is more common sense. Now
we look carefully at the business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some business models stand up to scrutiny better than
others. Arnault's due diligence before paying an undisclosed amount
for a stake in Boo.com last April did not anticipate the losses and
management turmoil at the British e-clothier. After spending a
fortune on advertising, sales have not gone as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Europ(AT)Web is now beginning a second round of financing for
Boo.com in the hope of keeping it afloat. Arnault declined to
discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   What he did want to talk about was the future of retailing on
the Internet. ``It will never replace the showroom,'' he said,
noting that with many products customers will continue wanting to
actually touch and view the goods. ``But it will change the way we
buy everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to buy a gift, the Web is very useful,'' he
continued. ``I have my assistant telling me next week it's my
nephew's birthday. So I have to send something. So what should we
do?'' he asked. ``A week before, the site can tell me it's his
birthday and tell me what he likes. And it will work for many other
occasions, like my assistant's birthday, too.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Through his personal investments in the Internet, via
Europ(AT)Web, Arnault is gaining experience that helps him assess
the online strategies for LVMH's brands. In a few weeks the company
is opening eluxury.com, a mini-mall peddling only LVMH's most
``fabulous'' brands, according to Arnault.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, LVMH has also started individual sites for some of
its brands, including Dior.com, moet.com, and Sephora.com among
others.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to test the shops,'' said Arnault, who often Web surfs
to keep tabs on the competition. ``When you go to Amazon it's very
well done. But there are other sites that are not as good.'' He
demurred at naming the homely.
</P>
<P>
   But he had no compunction about declaring a winner. ``The best
site for a fashion brand is Dior.com,'' he said, as if the matter
were beyond debate. ``You should look at it. You compare it to
competition. No comparison. It's fantastic. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet project he seems to be most proud of is the
Internet service provider LibertySurf, which was one of the first
companies created by Europ(AT)Web. According to Jupiter
Communications, LibertySurf grew to become one of the top four
access providers in France early this year, with 374,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Talking like an Internet guru, Arnault argued the benefits of
being local. ``So many U.S. companies have so many problems here,''
he said. ``Take AOL in France for example. It was not very good.
It's very strange. LibertySurf did in one year here what AOL
couldn't do in three years,'' referring to how LibertySurf outpaced
the growth of AOL France.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   LibertySurf is a free Internet access provider, modeled on
Freeserve in Britain, which gets its revenue from advertising,
e-commerce and a share of the local telephone charges that modem
users pay in Europe. But Beauvillain, the analyst, said LibertySurf
would face stiff competition as it tried to enter other European
markets, where Internet service providers are already ensconced.
</P>
<P>
   And not all analysts are keen to jump at shares of Europ(AT)Web
when it goes public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Internet investment companies, and Arnault's will be no
different,'' said Miles Saltiel, an analyst at the investment bank
West LB Panmure Gordon in London. ``They attract ludicrous
overvaluations and then collapse. But every stupid French investor
will buy it because it is Arnault.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the rub: With such a high profile, Arnault's
Internet projects tend to have some of the same cachet associated
with the fashionable brands of LVMH _ but without the history and
proven market of brands that have been around for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is a quandary that Arnault, smoothing his Dior pleats,
readily acknowledges. ``I can guarantee that in one century people
will drink Dom Perignon _ I am sure of it,'' he said. ``What type
of Internet will they look at in one century? I'm not so sure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, Joel Klein, chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division and perhaps Bill Gates' least favorite lawyer,
was moving into his new home in Washington. He called for cable
service and was told that the cable guy could come between 8 a.m.
and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Could they be more specific, Klein asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of saying, `Do you know who you're talking to?'''
Klein recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He told the story during a recent panel discussion about
monopolies, a forum whose unstated question for debate seemed to
be: If Bill Gates worries the government, then shouldn't the cable
guy _ in the form of a merged AOL-Time Warner _ drive the antitrust
people absolutely nuts? For Klein, the antitrust czar, at least,
the two situations are not comparable. (More on him later.)
</P>
<P>
   The discussion, part of The New Yorker's 75th anniversary
celebrations, came a few days after Time Warner blocked signals
from Disney's ABC network to millions of cable subscribers, then
restored them a day and half later.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives declined invitations from Ken Auletta,
the New Yorker writer who organized the panel, to take part. So
they weren't on hand to defend themselves from the view put forward
by some panelists that the planned merger of America Online and
Time Warner could turn the Internet from an open prairie into a
collection of fenced and gated estates.
</P>
<P>
   Disney proponents, led by the company's pugnacious Washington
lobbyist, Preston Padden, who urged confrontation with Time Warner,
have used the ABC blackout as evidence of why the merger would be
dangerous. Padden, a panel member whose boss, Michael Eisner, sat
in approving attendance in the audience, portrayed AOL-Time Warner
as ``Microsoft on speed,'' and called the blocking of ABC's signal
``a remarkable display of monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to this proved too much for another panelist, Candace
Carpenter, the founder of iVillage, a Web site for women. Having
already said that Disney was first among the media giants that had
tried to squash her and her Web site _ ``I'm representing the
mice'' in the day's discussion, she explained _ she put her head in
her hands and said, ``Disney as the underdog is such an amazing
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Although iVillage shares have fallen from a high of more than
$100 after the initial public offering last year to below $8 on
Friday, Carpenter actually remains optimistic that mice like hers
can survive by building strong brands and befriending a corporate
elephant or two. And she opposes government intervention as a means
for preserving competition. But she said, ``I do think distribution
is going to become a narrower funnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Padden's strongest support, on legal and technical grounds, came
from Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School specialist in technology
and antitrust who has managed to vex both Microsoft and Time
Warner. Lessig first drew Microsoft's objections in 1997, when the
judge presiding over the antitrust case appointed him to sort out
some issues related to the government's 1995 agreement with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his comments as a panelist, Lessig is now poised to
become AOL's and Time Warner's least favorite lawyer. ``I'm deeply,
deeply pessimistic,'' Lessig said of the pending merger. He
explained that as Internet service progressed from narrow to
broadband, it would be easier for those providing the service to
favor some forms of content _ theirs _ over others. The openness
that has made the Web so inviting to new ventures and ideas will
suffer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig reminded his audience that AOL formerly wanted the
government to guarantee neutrality in high-speed Internet
communications via cable TV systems, but changed that position once
it agreed to merge with Time Warner. All the more reason for the
government to step in, he said, adding, ``You don't want the
Internet to turn out like TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, Disney's chief executive, took in these arguments with a
benign smile. Afterward he declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig also needled the Disneyites, saying that a proposed
law to strengthen and extend copyrights would hinder public
discourse and innovation. He said the ``Mickey Mouse Protection
Act,'' as he called it, and similar measures seem to come up
whenever Mickey risks falling into the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner took the opportunity to respond to the panelists a
few days after the debate. Ed Adler, a spokesman from Time Warner,
said in an interview that AOL and Time Warner had committed
themselves to offering diverse content. And he said any
discrimination in favor of their own products _ on the Web, on
cable, or anywhere else _ would scare off their other corporate
customers. ``If either company did that, there would not be a
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the AOL-Time Warner merger now before the Federal Trade
Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, Klein of the
Justice Department doesn't have jurisdiction in the matter. But he
does have an opinion: that the AOL-Time Warner merger is nothing to
fear or prevent. (He said he couldn't recall the cable company that
had refused to give him a specific appointment, but it wasn't Time
Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would think in a panel of all these people, I'm the
optimist?'' he said. ``There is a market mechanism that is going to
answer this question. Technology is so powerful that in the next
three to five years there are going to be alternative mechanisms
into the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had proven a much bigger threat, he said, because the
company was able to use its monopoly power to restrict Netscape's
access to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had no representative on the Auletta panel. But the
company points to the pending AOL-Time Warner merger as evidence
that other companies can indeed thrive as Microsoft's rivals. AOL,
in fact, has pounded Microsoft's MSN Web network at every
opportunity. ``AOL, before and after its merger with Time Warner,
is a serious competitor on a wide range of businesses,'' Jim
Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   If the panelists' debate had no clear winner, at least one thing
is now clear: In wanting to fend off government, Microsoft, AOL,
Time Warner, Bill Gates and the cable guy are all on the same side.

MICROSOFT CITES AT&AMP;T TO FIGHT BREAKUP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Comparing the proposed breakup of Microsoft to the
AT&AMP;T case of the 1980s, Brad Smith, a Microsoft lawyer, said he saw
one big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T was mostly a national company,'' he said, ``but Microsoft
is operating in a global marketplace. If we are replaced as the
technology leader, there's no guarantee that our successor will be
from this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years ago, as AT&AMP;T was preparing to spin off its
regional telephone companies to resolve an antitrust case, Charles
Brown, AT&AMP;T's chairman, had a similar thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the competition feels pretty good about it,'' he said.
``The Japanese, primarily.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Microsoft antitrust case hurtles toward its conclusion,
both sides are drawing on the experiences of AT&AMP;T to support their
legal and political arguments, though in some cases the references
are inaccurate or incomplete. And a few of Microsoft's darkest
predictions mirror arguments AT&AMP;T made 20 years ago _ predictions
that never came to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal briefs rebutting the government's breakup
proposal, filed with the court on Wednesday, include numerous
references to the AT&AMP;T case, and Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, devoted considerable attention to
the subject in a speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that in the late 1970s and early 1980s, AT&AMP;T
mounted aggressive legal arguments against the government's
proposed breakup plan. Innovation would be stifled, research
stunted and a precious national resource _ the world's best
telephone system _ would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   None of that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing to demonstrate that if Microsoft is
broken up, its experience, for better or worse, will resemble
AT&AMP;T's. Still, in invoking the AT&AMP;T case to justify some of its
arguments, Microsoft is in some instances misstating the record.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bell Labs, which was the vaunted research arm of AT&AMP;T,
and its counterpart at Microsoft, the research division. The
government's breakup proposal makes no recommendation for how
Microsoft's research group would be treated; that would be decided
later.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Microsoft's brief said: ``Research and development
organizations are fragile organisms, and the notion that they can
be pulled apart with minimal adverse consequences is dangerously
naive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one unit of AT&AMP;T that remained intact during AT&AMP;T's
divestiture of its regional operating companies,'' it adds, ``was
Bell Laboratories, an organization with strong parallels to
Microsoft as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, like Microsoft, argued during its trial that a breakup
would damage or destroy the company's research capabilities. But in
fact, Bell Labs, formed in 1925, was broken up along with the rest
of the company; 7,500 of the lab's 25,000 employees were taken away
to form the nucleus of the new Bellcore research lab serving
regional telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has since spun off Bell Labs; now it is part of Lucent
Technologies. And the engineers and executives leading the labs
today say they believe they are doing quite well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure looks to us like we've been just as prolific in the
last 15 years as were were in the previous 50,'' said Michael
Jacobs, a spokesman for the labs. ``The pace of innovation at Bell
Labs today is faster than it's ever been.'' Bell Labs scientists
have won two Nobel Prizes in the last 15 years, in 1997 and 1998,
compared with four in the previous 50 years. Jacobs said he
believed the prospect of increased competition after the breakup
energized the Bell Labs scientists and ``fired up'' the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in its brief, Microsoft seeks to draw a fundamental
distinction with AT&AMP;T by arguing that ``Microsoft is a unitary
company,'' not ``an agglomeration of separate operating
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, AT&AMP;T made the same argument during its trial.
Central to its lawyers' defense was that ``the Bell system was so
tightly integrated that you could not take it apart without doing
enormous damage to the best telephone system in the world,'' said
Philip Verveer, a Washington lawyer who worked for the government
during the early stages of the AT&AMP;T case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed that they had a tremendous number of assets in
common, and the entire industry was structured around integration''
_ down to the long distance toll switches embedded in the local
phone switching stations.
</P>
<P>
   A expert witness who testified on behalf of the Bell system
during that trial, but who asked not to be identified, said the
company's legal team tried to make the case that ``the monopoly was
necessary for rapid technological change.''
</P>
<P>
   Verveer added, ``They said they could not be pulled apart, but
all of these arguments proved to be incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft is also arguing that continued innovation will be
threatened if the company is split up. Microsoft's success and
ability to create innovative new products ``would not have been
possible but for Microsoft's unified structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Another AT&AMP;T argument is more complicated, with both Microsoft
and the government falling afoul of history.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that AT&AMP;T did remain a highly innovative company
after it was broken up, Microsoft argues in its brief that it was
not the breakup that freed AT&AMP;T to compete and innovate, but an
accompanying order to deregulate it.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Tuesday, Klein countered that by noting that
AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells were left with significant restrictions
prohibiting them from entering one another's markets. But Microsoft
notes that AT&AMP;T labored under a far more onerous regulation
previously, prohibiting the unified company from branching into new
businesses not related to telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, a government official said, but while AT&AMP;T was a
monopoly, smaller companies trying to make telephone equipment
``kept running into AT&AMP;T and got nowhere if AT&AMP;T wasn't interested
_ that's exactly analogous to Microsoft.'' The company disputes
that.
</P>
<P>
   Verveer said the analogies could be taken only so far. ``The
AT&AMP;T case was about physical assets primarily,'' he noted, ``while
with Microsoft we are largely talking about human capital _ very
smart people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft does, Verveer says that makes the outcome of this
case harder to predict.

 &HT;    INTERNET CRIMINALS STAYING ONE CLICK AHEAD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.  c.2000 Cox News Service  PARIS _ The
<TEXT>
world's law-enforcement agencies are struggling to keep pace with
Internet criminals who strike without warning and then slip nearly
unseen into cyberspace leaving behind few clues, officials at an
international cyber-crime conference said Monday.
<P>
   The three-day conference, organized by the G8 group of
industrialized nations, is the first international gathering of law
enforcers, business representatives and government officials to
address the burgeoning problem of cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual crimewave is accompanying the surge in worldwide
Internet use that is forcing authorities to develop new sets of
skills to counter rivals who are developing sophisticated new scams
at rate that far outpaces conventional police tactics, industry and
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, because the Internet has no national borders
authorities are hampered as they pursue cyber-criminals across
jurisdictions where laws and customs often have not been brought up
to date.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, the chief scientist at Intel Corp., said that
government and industry leaders are beginning to find some
consensus in how to approach the problems of Internet crime but the
gap remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has outpaced any of our ability to agree on
some of the social ramifications of it,'' said Aucsmith, one of the
industry leaders at the conference. ``The technology is much easier
to evolve than are policies or laws.''
</P>
<P>
   James Robinson, head of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal
division, said law-enforcement officials confront a dizzying array
of issues in combating cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said cyber-criminals ``can sit at a laptop and commit a
crime across the street and weave it through seven countries and
pretty soon you don't have any idea where it's coming from,''
Robinson told reporters at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   International protocols will have to be changed to allow
investigators to move through various jurisdictions quickly. ``When
things are moving at such a speed, you can't sit there and work for
months and months to wait to have things translated and go through
this process,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the interests of law-enforcement agencies often
are in conflict with the desires of computer users to protect the
secrecy of their transactions and privacy of their communications,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tension between finding a way to secure the system
to minimize misuses that still allows us to do the job we need to
do,'' he said. ``We all think about coming across encrypted
communications ... that may involve terrorist acts or kidnapping or
other ... criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials say that it is very difficult to measure the
scope of Internet crime, there is a consensus that is growing
rapidly. The FBI opened an online fraud complaint center last
Monday and received 3,700 complaints in the first 3 1/2 days. ``We
were frankly kind of surprised because it isn't well-known, yet,''
said Tom Packard, the FBI's delegate at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heightened concerns about fraud with the explosion of
online financial transactions, many industry officials say they
worry more about viruses, such as the ``Love Bug'' variant that
struck hundreds of thousands of computers a week and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of serious crime is not that significant at the
moment,'' said Aucsmith of Intel, which produces the ubiquitous
Pentium microprocessors. ``However, the average person using the
Internet is actually subject to a considerable amount of attack.
Those attacks are the equivalent of cyberspace vandalism. They're
not fraud., not someone robbing you.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard said he was concerned by the apparent trust people put
in information on the Internet. ``What's more troubling to me is
the way people view the internet, and if it's on the Internet they
seem to be more trusting of it or more believing in it whether it's
a news article that they read in the Internet or baseball cards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest issues facing the conference is defining
the limits of industry self-regulation. Generally, Internet
companies resist government involvement, seeing in it a potential
form of censorship and an invitation to let states meddle with the
sector's organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer fighting cyber-crime with technical innovation,
educating users and companies about security risks, and making
better use of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   A conference delegate, Stephanie Perrin, chief privacy officer
at a Canadian company, Zero-Knowledge Systems. Inc., said firms,
while eager to uphold the law, are suspicious of ``extending the
arm of law enforcers into the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates hope the conference will develop a consensus on basic
principles in policing cyberspace. However, it is unlikely to
produce any sweeping multi-national policies. It ends Wednesday and
will report its conclusions to the G8 summit in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 comprises the G7 group - Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - plus Russia.

 &HT;    Use browser to open those downloads
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dear Sue and Jacki: I can't find a good answer to why
I can't open many downloads, both photos and text files. Often, all
I get is ``gobbledygook'' symbols. Is software available that will
``read'' all these?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack D.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: These days there are so many graphic and text file types.
You may be able to open one and not another. Take a look at your
browser preferences. In Netscape, go to Navigator/Applications.
You'll see a list of file types and applications. Make sure the
file type you're opening is listed with an application that will
open it. If it is, double-click to make sure the file type
information is correct. In Explorer, refer to the Receiving
files/File Helper preference. Double-click the format to make sure
it's configured properly.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Try to open graphics and text documents in a browser
window. Simply download the file and drop it into your browser.
Voila! The file can be viewed. Browsers have format limitations,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: PC users might want to try Pad. It's freeware. It opens
text and graphics. For Mac viewers, look at DoItAllText or
RealView, $25 shareware. Download them from CNet.com. There may be
garble at the top, but scroll down to see the ``real'' text. They
do a nice job on graphics. DoItAllText even lets you view movies.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki: What can you tell me about the i-opener?
</P>
<P>
   _ William D., Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's a 5-pound gadget that fits anywhere. Billed as an
Internet ``appliance,'' the i-opener could go in your kitchen but
isn't a toaster. It's an out-of-the-box, flip-up-the-screen,
plug-and-play way to hit the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Internet service, browser and e-mail are ready to go. It
has e-mail and Web access _ that's all. Its goal is to connect with
the technophobe and appeal to PC households wanting a mini-Web
cruiser in another room.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It has two components: A 10-inch flat screen and a
keyboard. The i-opener uses a 56k modem (broadband's next). It
shares your phone line but claims it won't hog it. Information
channels bring you news, weather, sports, financial, etc. Get this,
a Pizza button points you to a pizza delivery place.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: The i-opener costs $99 until Father's Day. After that,
it's $199. You can buy a mouse and printer, too. Internet access is
$21.95 a month. Buy from Netpliance (www.netpliance.com/) or
Circuit City and CompUSA, although it's big-time on back order.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Want a real eye-opener? You're locked into the i-opener's
Internet service. Also, you must activate the service within 30
days and buy it for at least 90 consecutive days. If you violate
the terms of sale, there's a $499 termination fee.

 &HT;    Women totally at home on Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always amusing to read those ``gee whiz''
articles in newspapers and magazines marveling at the fact there
are so many women starting up Internet companies, designing and
producing Web sites and actually using the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most stories about wired women make it sound as if we had just
won the vote, when nothing could be further from the truth. If you
are a woman and have a computer, you can go online, e-mail your
mom, order books or even play fantasy baseball. And millions of
women do these things every day.
</P>
<P>
   The annual media excitement about women online always seems odd
to me, because I happen to be one of those women who was somehow
able to find my way to a computer and log on to the Internet about
six years ago without any trouble whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Amazon.com, eBay, Webvan and my close personal friends
at Visa will all tell you their accounting departments just love me
and all the other wired women (and men) who know how to click that
``submit'' button.
</P>
<P>
   With a telephone assist from my best friend Janet, I even
installed a newer, faster modem one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid,'' she said as she coached me through the
installation process. ``It's just a piece of metal.'' And she was
right. Going online is not rocket science, and more and more women
are discovering this, which is good news for the Web and all the
people who write and produce content and commerce for it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the runaway success of Salon's ``Mothers Who Think''
daily columns (www.salon.com) written by ordinary women talking
about ordinary things like parenting and the struggle to balance
work and family. (``Mothers Who Think'' became so popular that
there's now a hardcover collection available from Amazon.com or the
local bookstore.) Sites like iVillage (www.ivillage) and relative
newcomer Oxygen (www.oxygen.com) also cater to an audience of wired
women who want to do more than check stock quotes or read the
paper. Wired women tend to use the Web to communicate and to learn
more about the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   A new study from the Pew Internet and American Life project
released last week shows that women are going online not to isolate
themselves but to stay close to the people and issues that concern
them.
</P>
<P>
   The study (www.pewinternet.org), designed to get an accurate
reading of how the Net impacts the lives of average Americans, was
based on a daily poll of Internet users asking what they did not
just that day only, but the previous day as well, when recent Web
adventures were fresh in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The findings reveal that more than 9 million women have gone
online for the first time in the last six months and that these
women are far from alienated, isolated computer addicts. For women,
the Internet is an enriching experience that enables them to stay
in touch with family and friends around the corner and around the
world. The new crop of online women has reshaped America's social
landscape, the study says, because women have used e-mail to enrich
their important relationships and enlarge their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has the opposite of an isolating effect on these
users,'' the study said. ``They report that e-mail has helped them
improve their connections to relatives and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Pew study, there are millions of women who log
on every day just to chat with faraway friends and relatives.
Several women I know, myself included, have been able to maintain
long-distance relationships with family and friends that never
would have survived if letter writing, birthday cards and phone
calls were the only means of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than men,'' the study says, ``women say they are attached
to e-mail and pleased with how it helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when women are done sending and reading e-mail, they do
go online to search for information. Here, the Pew Study says, the
Web sites women visit most are very different from the sites men
visit. Women are more likely to seek health and religious
information, research new jobs and play games online. Men are more
likely to get news and financial information, trade stocks,
participate in online auctions, shop, access government Web sites
and search for sports news.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily a situation that needs to be corrected,
and the Pew study does not suggest that it should. Everyone has
different interests, and they go to the Web sites that address
them,interests, whether it's the stock market or online grocery
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But the study does note that Web veterans who have been online
for three years or longer know their way around the Web and a wider
variety of sites that reflect that experience. The main point that
should be taken away from the study is that women are online,
surfing the Web for communication, utility and fun.
</P>
<P>
   MaybeNow might be time to stop all the ``golly gee'' noise about
women on the Web and just get used to the fact that women are
online right alongside the boys.

 &HT;    Souping up computer takes just a few touches
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I was a young man, way too much of my time was
spent trying to get more speed and louder exhaust noises out of a
car that began life as a rather ordinary Chevrolet Chevelle.
</P>
<P>
   After I was done, it had more bolted-on equipment than a space
shuttle built from junkyard parts.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays cars aren't that big of a deal to me. Instead, I spend
just as much childish zeal and grown-up money hopping up my home
PC. From what I can tell, lots of folks are in that same boat.
Computers have taken the place of hot rods for those of us who
never quite grew up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a lot of the stuff I do isn't really necessary. It's
just fun. Besides, it does speed up the computer, and as was true
with that red Chevelle, it pleases me in intangible ways. So come
along with me, we'll crawl under the hood of that PC of yours and
make a few minor changes.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Let's add a lot. Modern versions of Windows seem to
thrive on more memory. At one time, you ran into the law of
diminishing returns at 32 or 64 megabytes. But now, if you have
less than 128 megabytes of RAM, you can really add some life to
that old machine with more memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tweaking: Click on the Control Panel to open it, then open the
System icon. Click on the tab at the top of that window that says
Performance. Now select File System. Then _ under settings _ change
the setting that says ``typical role of this computer'' to Network
Server. Only do that if you have 128 megs or more of memory. This
change will let your PC use the memory you added more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Video: Next to adding system memory, the least expensive way to
speed up an existing computer is to add a video card with a lot of
video memory. My own video card has 32 megabytes of RAM (you can
probably pick one up for $120 or so), and there are a lot of
computer enthusiasts who argue that this change offers more
potential for speed than a faster processor. Here's why. Almost
everything about Windows is graphics. Your processor spends a lot
of energy managing all those little dots of light on your screen. A
souped-up video card takes on a lot of that processing work,
freeing your processor and letting it work faster.
</P>
<P>
   Defrag: Hey, this one is free. There's a program that comes free
with Windows called Disk Defragmenter. You'll find it under the
Start button by selecting Accessories, then System Tools. Run this
program at least once a week, and it'll organize your hard disk so
that programs load faster and run faster. The good thing about
Defragmenter is that it also organizes the programs on your disk so
that the ones you use more often load the fastest. So the longer
you run it, the better it learns your own habits and speeds things
up based on them.
</P>
<P>
   Internet: If you have the fastest computer in the world, one of
those 1-gigahertz speed demons, and a slow connection, then when
you are on the Web you have a slow computer. A middle-of-the-road
computer with a fast connection will run circles around it. Since
so many of us camp out on the Web these days, consider getting DSL
service from the telephone company or a cable modem from your cable
TV provider.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done all this, get some orange paint for the side of
your computer. It'll have earned its racing stripes.

 &HT;    Go ahead _ work through the storm
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   I've spent many a long day at the computer and endured a good
many thunderstorms; but it wasn't until recently when the two
events happened to coincide, fiercely, that the importance of
workstation surge protection came to the forefront of my mind. As
it turns out, there are roughly 17 trillion surge protectors on the
market, but I settled on the Recoton Home Office Surge Suppressor
with Phone Line Protection ($25; www.recoton.com) for its
reasonable price and versatility. The unit, which also acts as a
six-outlet power bar, protects one's system from a power surge of
up to 800 joules (bring it on, Zeus!). It works for both the power
supply and the phone/modem jack as well as the suppression of less
cataclysmic and more niggling electrical and radio frequency
transient noise. It's also complete with appropriate blinking
lights telling you just how fine a job it's doing. This particular
model comes with a $15,000 warranty on the product(s) it's
protecting, though only for five years.

Combining paintings with digital images, executive creates new kind
of art &HT;    By Robert W. Gee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Zvi Yaniv isn't the typical artist. He's not the
typical physicist either.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks in staccato bursts and gestures in broad strokes as he
makes bold statements about the future of technology. He envisions
a world with wall-sized video displays and spends his days in a
mostly windowless office perfecting a prototype that he hopes will
make his dream a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's forget about putting a television in the wall. Let's
make the wall a television,'' says Yaniv, president and chief
operating officer of SI Diamond Technology, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At his home in the hills of West Austin, Yaniv retreats in bare
feet to his screened porch amid a rock garden and reflecting pools,
and he flips on his PC to create a new kind of art. He calls it
two-dimensional kinetic art.
</P>
<P>
   He programs a series of digital images _ either photos, other
artists' work or his own _ onto a flat panel, liquid crystal
display and inserts the panel into a rectangular hole that he has
cut in a painting or lithograph, not his own.
</P>
<P>
   A chip drives the display, flashing a series of images often
with a theme independent from the original work giving new meaning
to the art. The digital panel typically measures about 10 inches by
10 inches and the painting 2 feet by 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I combined art with the digital world,'' Yaniv says. ``It
gives the artist and the computer guy the power to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaniv, who is from Israel and moved to the United States in
1983, has created nine works of art, seven of which are on display
at the IC2 Institute in Austin. One is at Gallery Soco and the
other hangs in Yaniv's home.
</P>
<P>
   He holds a patent on the concept. His next work, he says, will
contain 3-D digital images and video display. He also will
collaborate with an Irish sculptor to incorporate the flat panel
displays into sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to launch a Web site that will allow users to make
virtual art by cutting a hole in a canvas and replacing it with
images of their own. He'd also like to use the concept for a
children's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with an idea and I want people to use it and use
it,'' he says, smiling widely. ``It gives people the freedom of
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his favorite works hang on the third floor of IC2. One is
called ``Conflict.'' The digital window, inserted in the center of
an abstract artwork by Linda Dumond, flashes a series of 10 images
that connect seamlessly with the lines of the painting, showing one
color growing into another, then retreating. ``I call it 'Conflict'
because it's a conflict between the blue area and the area it
conquers,'' Yaniv says.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite, ``Oasis,'' displays six frames of the sun
setting from The Oasis restaurant west of Austin. The digital
sunset becomes the focal point of the original work, in which a
pencil hovers near two broken orbs and two strawberries. A woman in
a black formal dress stands to the right of the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Another Yaniv work, ``Faces of the World,'' on display at IC2,
will be shipped to an art gallery in Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Yaniv has long collected art, and despite his giddiness over his
first foray into creating his own works, he emphasizes that he does
not consider himself an artist _ rather a facilitator of art.
</P>
<P>
   He recently made a special wedding display for some friends by
putting 47 images of the couple in various stages of youth and
adulthood on a flat panel in the corner of a larger picture of the
two at their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You open a new dimension to the two-dimensional picture,''
Yaniv says. ``The idea is very simple . . . to combine art and
technology and make it one.''

 &HT;    Modern-day soothsayer: Weather sites predict future
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather this time of year can shift as often as a
four-cylinder car with an automatic transmission. And, in the
Midwest and South, there is the added danger of severe
thunderstorms and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   No list of weather-related Web sites should be attempted without
putting the Weather Channel right at the top of the list. The site
at www.weather.com gets more traffic than any other site devoted
entirely to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features of the site is the ability to customize the
start page so you'll immediately get the weather information you
need for the cities you care about most. You can also decide which
maps will appear and add other weather-related items such as travel
and airport information.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another contender that lacks some of the slickness
of the Weather Channel site yet offers some features that make it
unique on the Web. That's the Weather Underground site at
www.weatherunderground.com.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you can display the information in an incredible
number of languages. Just pick from a list that includes the ones
you'd expect plus some you might not expect _ Bulgarian and Slovak,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, including some things that you may not expect to
find on a weather site. For instance, click on the link labeled
astronomy and enter your ZIP code. You'll be able to see where the
stars and the planets will appear in the night sky in your part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The online edition of the USA Today newspaper also has an
excellent section devoted to the weather. Just go to
www.usatoday.com/weather/wfront.htm.
</P>
<P>
   While you're there, you may want to indulge in one of mankind's
favorite pastimes, talking about the weather. Just click on the
link called Talk Weather and complain to your heart's content. You
can also ask questions or even make your own predictions.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the official version of the weather _ and also
the place where most weather gathering organizations get primary
data _ there's only one choice: The National Weather Service.
You'll find that home page at www.nws.noaa.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll find a staggering amount of information. For
instance, you can click on the link called Web sites and find the
National Weather Service office for your area. In my case that's
the Atlanta office, which is really located in Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find that site at www.srh.noaa.gov/FFC.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers weather data rolled almost any way you'd like,
including links for short-term forecasts, long-term outlooks,
agricultural weather, and weather watches and warnings. You'll also
be able to learn the radio frequency for the Weather Service's
weather warning radio broadcasts for this area.
</P>
<P>
   People in my state also will enjoy a visit to the Georgia
Weather _ Automated Environmental Monitoring Network Page at
www.griffin.peachnet.edu/bae.
</P>
<P>
   This service was established in 1991 by the College of
Agriculture and Environmental Sciences of the University of
Georgia. Mostly the weather information seems to be intended for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The network has weather stations scattered across the state
where air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar
radiation, wind speed, wind direction and soil temperature at
various depths are monitored literally every second.
</P>
<P>
   Then the information gathered at the stations is dumped into a
master computer every 15 minutes. That compilation is used to
provide information to the Web site and researchers.

 &HT;    Add some sizzle to your Sega
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   MadCatz has taken the deficient Sega Dreamcast controller and
corrected its flaws. The Dream Pad ($30; www.madcatz.com) has six
excellently placed, fully programmable buttons as opposed to the
scant four on Sega's default controller. It's also wide and
comfortable enough for adult-sized hands with two effective analog
shoulder triggers, a smooth analog thumbstick and a ``floating''
D-pad. The stylish, ergonomic Dream Pad also utilizes anti-slip
rubber gripper padding that keeps the controller comfortably in the
gamer's hands. In fact, Madcatz Dream Pad is superior in nearly
every way _ almost flawless, save for one nagging fault: The
controller programming button sits right where you're likely to
rest your thumb if you aren't pressing any of the action buttons.
An accidental brush of the program button in the middle of fast
action will suddenly disable all functions or reconfigure the
controller on the fly. Very frustrating. Other than that, perfect.
Madcatz saves Sega.
</P>
<P>
   A JOY STICK, MINUS THE JOY
</P>
<P>
   While InterAct's Cyclone Digital Joystick ($39;
www.interact-acc.com) offers an impressive list of features _ nine
programmable buttons, a hat switch, throttle slider, rotating
stick, USB and serial port connections, and a symmetrical button
splay that makes it lefty friendly (lefties unite!) _ the unit
still comes at a fair price. But there's a reason: The thing is
pretty much junk. The Cyclone's actual stick is so loose and floppy
that maintaining any form of control is almost impossible, and even
small movements lead to large changes in direction or lurches in
motion. In addition, the Cyclone's base is so small and light that
any excited movements result in the joystick sliding across your
desktop or toppling into you. Thus, what you've got here is a
peripheral that sorely misses the thrust of intuitive user
interfacing. Destined for the big joystick bargain bin in the sky.

HIGH-SPEED HOOKUP COULD LET YOU DOWNLOAD NAPSTER BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Your columns about Napster were interesting. In fact,
they introduced me to a new world of songs. My problem is I have
been able to download only one song. All the others resulted in
``corrupt files.'' Do you know what I might be doing wrong? I have
tons of available space, a 56K modem, an almost new computer and a
fabulous CD writer.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: First remember that Napster is beta software _ it's
still in the development stage, and it has bugs. However, that may
or may not be your problem.
</P>
<P>
   When you search for a song and get a list of possible files to
download, Napster presents you with a lot of information about each
file. It shows you the size of the file, the bit rate of the file,
the frequency at which it was recorded, the speed of the file
owner's connection and the ping between your machine and the file
owner's computer. The ping reflects the speed of the Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Pay particular attention to the size of the file. The size is
tied to the bit rate, which is an indication of the song's sound
quality. A higher bit rate means better sound quality, but also a
larger file size.
</P>
<P>
   If you see several copies of the same song listed, the file size
should be the same for all copies of a given bit rate.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're looking for a particular song. You find four
copies, and they all have a bit rate of 128. They should all be
roughly the same size. If you see one that is much smaller or
larger, stay away from it _ it likely is corrupt, incomplete or
mislabeled.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that some Napster users with very fast connections have
a tendency to cut off standard modem users because it takes so long
for the slower users to download a file using Napster. The cutoffs
result in corrupt or incomplete files.
</P>
<P>
   Napster really is a broadband application, much more suited to a
very fast connection. You may want to make the move to a DSL or
cable-modem connection, if either are available in your area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This may seem like a dumb (newbie) question but inquiring
minds want to know: Can you tell me what WINIPCFG is and what it
does? A: Whenever a computer connects to a network that uses TCP/IP
_ the protocol or ``language'' of the Internet _ it either must
have or be given a numeric address, called an IP address. The
WINIPCFG program that comes with Windows is a way to identify your
address, and manage it.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers assign you an IP address when
you dial in, and you are likely to get a different address each
time you connect.
</P>
<P>
   Cable-modem and DSL connections for home users also do this,
though the IP address usually stays the same over long periods of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when your Net connection has come to a standstill,
WINIPCFG may fix your problem. Go to Start, Run, type WINIPCFG and
hit the Enter key. The program will show you a drop-down box with
various connections methods _ your modem's PPP adapter for dialup
and/or your Ethernet card for faster connections. Choose the one
you want to work with.
</P>
<P>
   If your connection seems stuck, try clicking the Release, then
Renew button. This will drop your current IP address and ask your
provider for a new one. Disconnecting and redialing does the same
thing (or rebooting your machine, if you have cable or DSL), but
using WINIPCFG is faster.

 &HT;    High technology, urge to converge melding media

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine going online to play a video game spinoff
of your favorite movie that's based on a hit TV series while
listening to the show's soundtrack on a file downloaded to an MP3
player.
</P>
<P>
   No need to just imagine. It's already happening.
</P>
<P>
   This topsy-turvy phenomenon called ``convergence'' is blurring _
even erasing _ the lines that once separated mainstream modes of
entertainment such as television, movies and recorded music from
newer media such as DVDs, video games and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of tech-savvy consumers who grew up with a TV
remote control in one hand and a computer mouse in the other,
convergence could make it easier to seamlessly mix-and-match
different types of entertainment sources to suit their individual
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's still in its infancy, the urge to converge was in
full swing as 55,000 conventioneers from 60 countries gathered at
the Los Angeles Convention Center for the annual Electronic
Entertainment Expo. Better known as E3, this massive, 6-year-old
trade show left Atlanta in 1998 and has returned to the city
regarded as the world capital of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence was the big buzz at this year's show, where industry
observers were predicting that it will revolutionize mass consumer
entertainment. But beyond the high-tech hypebole, what does
convergence look like?
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the sprawling exhibit floor, several Hollywood
movie studios previewed video games that are being tied to
hoped-for holiday blockbusters such as ``The Grinch,'' ``X-Men''
and ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   At another booth, an actress dressed like Lara Croft, the
impossibly buxom heroine of the ``Tomb Raider'' video game, was
pointing a pair of authentic-looking guns at a mostly male audience
that seemed to be admiring more than her sidearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Croft clone was pulling double duty by advertising the
newest version of the popular fantasy-adventure game and also
promoting an upcoming movie of the same name that will star Oscar
winner Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence also seems to be taking root in book publishing,
albeit more slowly. Two video games based on cloak-and-dagger
novels by noted spy author Tom Clancy were on display. Animorphs, a
popular series of children's books, is already on TV and now has a
companion video game.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending E3 were television's so-cute-it-hurts Olsen
twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, who signed autographs to promote their
new video game. Nearby, hard-core rapper Ice-T did the same for
fans interested in ``Sanity,'' a soon-to-be released video game
that will feature his voice and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games aren't just for kids,'' Ice-T said. ``They're not
even like games anymore. It's like you're making a movie even as
you're playing along with the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Davies, a spokesman for Eidos Interactive, developer of
the Tomb Raider game, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where it's harder to tell the
difference between games and TV and other forms of entertainment,''
Davies said. ``Movies have the look and sound of a video game, and
the games are more like little movies, with drawn-out story lines
and good characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology has played a key role in making the promise of
convergence a reality. Just a few years ago, watching a DVD movie
or copying a digital music file was an expensive and slow process.
But as the cost of high-tech hardware has fallen, the equipment has
become more powerful and sophisticated. Faster modems and
lightning-quick broadband connections have also made it possible to
send CD-quality sound and high-resolution images over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence craze has also caught the attention of prominent
musical artists David Bowie, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails,
composer Danny Elfman and Grammy-winning hip-hopper Coolio. All
have scored, or are workig on, video game soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Luden, president of the Guitammer Company of Ohio, is no
musician. But he's excited about the prospects of creating new
types of sounds for the coming convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Luden's company has developed a device that recreates the
thundering bass that moviegoers are accustomed to at their local
multiplex in the comfort of the average living room. It's called
``The Buttkicker.''
</P>
<P>
   The $700 device is about the size of a football and can be
placed under the foundation or crawl space of a house. A smaller
version, for $149, fits underneath a sofa or easy chair.
</P>
<P>
   When connected to a home theater system, it delivers a powerful
``infrasonic'' rumble that vibrates through the listener's body,
adding another dimension to games, movies, and compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching fireworks on the Fourth of July,'' Luden
says. ``You don't just see them; you hear them and you feel them,
right here in your chest. We want to re-create that sense of being
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Luden, most of the E3 exhibitors were looking at ways to
deal with convergence while boosting their company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Disney plans to roll out more than 16 video games this year
based on its vast library of animated movies, including older
releases such as ``101 Dalmatians'' and relatively new ones like
``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're agnostics when it comes to convergence,'' said Leslie
Oren, a spokeswoman for Disney Interactive. ``Whether it's on the
Internet, on video or on a game, we want consumers to be able to
take the product home, or wherever they are, and extend their
entertainment experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Interactive is also ramping up for the convergence
sweepstakes. It's releasing video games based on ``Planet of the
Apes,'' the long-running TV show ``The Simpsons'' and the upcoming
animated sci-fi flick ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has no plans to release an online version of its
disastrous ``Who Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire'' special, the
company unveiled a new video game based on a more successful but
still cheesy Fox reality show, ``World's Scariest Police Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Edwards Emery, a Fox spokeswoman, explained that these
new games take advantage of built-in familiarity that audiences
have with Fox's branded network broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``World's Scariest'' game, players pursue a fleeing
``perp'' as the action is described by an unseen narrator. As the
chase unfolds, the distinctive Fox News logo is displayed on a
corner of the screen _ just like on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to re-invent the wheel with consumers,'' Emery
said. ``We don't have to. We have a brand they identify with and
recognize, and we just need to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at E3, however, was convinced that convergence is
such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year of the licensee; everything has to have some
celebrity endorsement or crossover appeal,'' said Rick Mears, an
editor with Gamefan, an online magazine devoted to video games.
``We've found that when content producers depend on some brand
name, it dilutes the product. They're just rehashing old stuff.
After a while they don't care if the game or the movie is any good,
just as long as it makes money.''

BEWARE OF THINGS THAT COME BY MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the computing world has recovered from the attack of the
Love Letter virus. Antivirus software has been updated, users have
been warned about its characteristics _ and those of copycat
versions _ and the furor has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   But I have bad news for you, boys and girls. It will happen
again. And again. And then again.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless, two major changes are made. One involves your
behavior; the other involves Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses that bedevil computers are very much like sexually
transmitted diseases in the 3-D world _ they are spread by
conscious action. If you don't engage in the behavior that spreads
them, you won't get the virus.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of VBS.LoveLetter.A and its variants, the behavior
that caused the virus to spread like wildfire last week was the
casual way computer users regard files attached to e-mail. Many
people think nothing of launching an attachment sent to them, even
if they don't know the person who sent it.
</P>
<P>
   With Love Letter, users also were enticed by some clever social
engineering. Like the Melissa virus before it, this nasty bug was
spread by hijacking the address book from Microsoft's popular
Outlook e-mail program. Someone receiving the virus might recognize
the sender's name as someone to be trusted, and would be more
willing to open the attachment.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the problem: Internet and corporate network users too
often send attachments, particularly Microsoft Word documents,
without getting permission. To me, this is like giving someone a
puppy for Christmas without first asking whether the receiver is
ready for the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Attached files that can run a program on your computer are
dangerous _ period. Word documents are capable of running macros, a
form of automated routine. In a sense, a Word document is basically
a type of small computer program. As evidenced by Melissa, which
was a Word macro virus, it's a powerful capability that can be
easily misused.
</P>
<P>
   Most people know better than to run program files they receive
as an attachment, so why should a Word document be any different?
</P>
<P>
   In 99 percent of all cases, you don't need a fancy, formatted
word processing document to get your information across. Plain text
is always better for e-mail, anyway, because anyone can read it,
regardless of their computer, word processor or bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   In the business world, however, Word documents are tossed across
the Net with abandon. For example, I get several a day as press
releases from public relations people _ and yes, I have gotten
viruses from press releases! I simply don't accept Word documents
anymore unless I arrange for them in advance, and I would urge
others in the business world to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with how easy it is for automated
programs, such as macros or scripts, to make major and potentially
disastrous changes to Windows' crucial files.
</P>
<P>
   The Love Letter virus uses Microsoft's Visual Basic Script. The
filename of the attachment is LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs. The VBS
extension indicates it is a script file _ something the average
user doesn't recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft includes this script capability in some versions of
Windows and in its Office productivity suite to automate some
processes. But while powerful, this feature is also pretty dumb; it
lets a program do almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Love Letter does the following, thanks to Visual
Basic Script:
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes the default start-up page for the Internet Explorer by
making changes in the Windows Registry, the master configuration
database. The new page then downloads an executable that collects
passwords off the hard drive and sends them to an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   _ Installs itself as a series of files in the windows and
windowssystem folders, two key repositories for crucial system
files.
</P>
<P>
   _ Makes further changes to the Registry to ensure that the virus
launches each time the computer is booted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reads the Microsoft Outlook address book and sends a copy of
itself to everyone listed there.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that an operating system allows this much destructive
activity to occur without at least warning that major changes are
being made is outrageous, and Microsoft is to blame here.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the company is responding to a market that wants the
ability to automate routine tasks. And it would be fairly
irritating if users had to approve every change made to the
operating system, such as during a software installation.
</P>
<P>
   But as Love Letter shows, Windows _ particularly the Windows
95/98 family _ is simply too trusting. While I'm not sure that I'd
want Windows to be as locked down as Unix, users should at least
have a choice as part of its security features of being alerted
when these kinds of changes are about to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Until that changes, you can expect more attacks _ and probably
even more vicious ones _ from across the Net.

DATABASE: LEXMARK MAKES HIGH RES, LOW COST PRINTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the old days of computing _ when entire programs fit on
one floppy disk _ printer resolution was measured in terms of pins.
The nine-pin printer had nine pins that jabbed at a ribbon and made
letters on paper. The 24-pin printer was a vast improvement. More
pins meant smoother text and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Pin-type printers have gone the way of green-and-black monitor
screens. They've been replaced by ink-jet printers that have far
higher resolution, are cheaper, print faster and print in full
color (something the pin printers did in their later years, but
with limited success).
</P>
<P>
   The highest resolution in the industry is built by Lexmark,
which uses ink cartridges with 1200-by-1200 dots-per-inch
resolution. The company announced this month that its new consumer
ink-jet, the Z52, will have a resolution of 2400-by-1200 dpi and
carry a street price of around $180.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the high resolution can be printed on
plain paper (rather than the more expensive photo variety).
However, the best results will probably come from using the special
photo paper, particularly when printing photographs from
high-resolution cameras.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fast. The Z52 can produce a gray-scale page every four
seconds (15 pages a minute). It will print 7 pages a minute in
color.
</P>
<P>
   For Apple users, there is additional good news. The printer has
the normal printer-port connector, but also has Universal Serial
Bus support so it can be connected to newer Macintosh systems.
</P>
<P>
   The printer uses the same paper-handling system that reduces
paper jams, the same design as the popular Z51 printer that is
currently at the top of PC World's Top 10 Printer List.
</P>
<P>
   A Lexmark spokesman said the new printer has the highest
durability cycle of any Lexmark inkjet printers. Although priced
for the home market, the printer also can handle small-business
tasks, like dual-side printing. Since the printer only prints on
one side of the paper at a time, the pages have to be run through
the printer a second time.
</P>
<P>
   The Z52 will be available in major retail stores handling
computers and electronics. It carries a one-year warranty with a
next-business-day exchange.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ It's an American success story on the verge of
getting even better until, some say, it ran into the reality of
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The story is classic: The Mexico-born son of immigrant parents
graduates from Harvard, goes home to El Paso, forges a successful
legal career and makes this far West Texas border city proud when
the president nominates him to a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   There, the story of Enrique Moreno hits a roadblock. Some blame
the twist in the plot on the politics of this presidential election
year, in which Republican Gov. George W. Bush is primed to face
Democratic Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's nomination to the New Orleans-based appeals court, made
in September 1999 by President Clinton, has been blocked by the
Republican senators from Texas, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison. Judicial nominations are subject to Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas senators said a nonpartisan committee of lawyers that
reviews prospective judges for them found that Moreno, 44, was not
experienced enough ``to be fully engaged and effective on a court
one notch below the United States Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, a trial lawyer whose practice includes employment, civil
rights and personal injury cases, has practiced law 19 years. He
has no experience as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moreno's supporters say the complaint about his
qualifications is patently untrue.
</P>
<P>
   They cited his nearly two decades in private law practice and
support from Republicans as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   They noted his backing from legal, business and law enforcement
entities and high ratings from groups including the American Bar
Association, whose federal judicial committee gave him its top mark
of ``well-qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication from Senator Gramm and Senator Hutchison's
letter is that Enrique is not qualified. That's the meanest,
ugliest thing that you could say about Enrique, because it's
clearly not true,'' said El Paso District Attorney Jaime Esparza, a
Democrat. ``It's just pure politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's supporters generally contend the GOP senators want to
hold open the judicial seat in the hope that Bush will win the
presidency and can choose his own nominee. The court hears cases
from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was clearly a partisan decision without any
regard at all to El Paso as ... a community that needs
representation on the 5th Circuit,'' said El Paso Assistant County
Attorney Annabell Perez, president of the local Mexican-American
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not important enough to jeopardize any kind of strategy
or plan that the senators may have had for the governor,'' said
Perez, who describes herself as a Democrat ``for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno would have been the first judge on the court from El
Paso, his supporters said. That meant a lot to residents of this
city, who can feel geographically isolated, ignored and taken for
granted, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire episode once again shows El Paso that we do not
have the clout on either a state or national level that other
cities in the state have,'' said 327th District Court Judge Philip
R. Martinez, a Democrat who graduated one year behind Moreno at
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez added, however, ``What the senators have done isn't as
much a disservice to El Paso as it is a disservice to the nation.
... He was certainly well-qualified to play a larger role on a
bigger stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the senators' letter speaks for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While suggesting Moreno lacks sufficient experience, it also
notes his ``enviable personal success story'' and doesn't rule out
a future judicial nomination. In addition, it lists those who have
successfully been through the process, including those with
Hispanic surnames.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (lawyers' committee) process has approved 17 Clinton
judges, while only two have been turned down. But it was late in
the term and the committee was not comfortable with an appellate
court appointment for a person who has no judicial experience and
no written record,'' said Hutchison spokeswoman Lisette Mondello.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's defenders point out that half of the 14 judges on the
5th Circuit Court are listed as having no judicial experience,
including six nominated by Republican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   There are three vacancies on the 17-slot court, which has a
heavy workload.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit's chief judge, Carolyn Dineen King, last year
declared a judicial emergency to clear the way for the court to
more extensively use visiting judges.
</P>
<P>
   Noting ``an explosion'' of cases, particularly drug cases, along
the U.S.-Mexico border, Martinez said, ``It escapes me to
understand how ... all those factors have not allowed this process
to move at any faster pace.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently whether he thought the senators opposed Moreno
because he is Hispanic, Clinton said, ``That, or they just don't
want to confirm any judges unless they are right-wing ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the block shows no sign of letting up, with
elected officials touting Moreno's credentials and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund describing itself as
``appalled by the continuing efforts by some in Congress to
stonewall Latino nominees from reaching high-ranking judicial
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has reached into the presidential race, with
Gore and others saying Bush should use his influence to help
Moreno's case. Bush frequently touts his support from Hispanics and
particularly from El Paso residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution gives that authority and responsibility to
the United States Senate,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
``Governor Bush has a proven record of appointing judges from all
walks of life in Texas, and he will do the same as president.''

or plan that the senators may have had for the governor,'' said
Perez, who describes herself as a Democrat ``for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno would have been the first judge on the court from El
Paso, his supporters said. That meant a lot to residents of this
city, who can feel geographically isolated, ignored and taken for
granted, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire episode once again shows El Paso that we do not
have the clout on either a state or national level that other
cities in the state have,'' said 327th District Court Judge Philip
R. Martinez, a Democrat who graduated one year behind Moreno at
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez added, however, ``What the senators have done isn't as
much a disservice to El Paso as it is a disservice to the nation.
... He was certainly well-qualified to play a larger role on a
bigger stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the senators' letter speaks for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While suggesting Moreno lacks sufficient experience, it also
notes his ``enviable personal success story'' and doesn't rule out
a future judicial nomination. In addition, it lists those who have
successfully been through the process, including those with
Hispanic surnames.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (lawyers' committee) process has approved 17 Clinton
judges, while only two have been turned down. But it was late in
the term and the committee was not comfortable with an appellate
court appointment for a person who has no judicial experience and
no written record,'' said Hutchison spokeswoman Lisette Mondello.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's defenders point out that half of the 14 judges on the
5th Circuit Court are listed as having no judicial experience,
including six nominated by Republican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   There are three vacancies on the 17-slot court, which has a
heavy workload.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit's chief judge, Carolyn Dineen King, last year
declared a judicial emergency to clear the way for the court to
more extensively use visiting judges.
</P>
<P>
   Noting ``an explosion'' of cases, particularly drug cases, along
the U.S.-Mexico border, Martinez said, ``It escapes me to
understand how ... all those factors have not allowed this process
to move at any faster pace.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently whether he thought the senators opposed Moreno
because he is Hispanic, Clinton said, ``That, or they just don't
want to confirm any judges unless they are right-wing ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the block shows no sign of letting up, with
elected officials touting Moreno's credentials and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund describing itself as
``appalled by the continuing efforts by some in Congress to
stonewall Latino nominees from reaching high-ranking judicial
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has reached into the presidential race, with
Gore and others saying Bush should use his influence to help
Moreno's case. Bush frequently touts his support from Hispanics and
particularly from El Paso residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution gives that authority and responsibility to
the United States Senate,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
``Governor Bush has a proven record of appointing judges from all
walks of life in Texas, and he will do the same as president.''

POLAROID RETURNS AS A PARTY ANIMAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Oldham liked the camera so much he created a dress from its
tiny snapshots. Britney Spears uses it onstage, snapping pictures
of her fans. Polaroid's toylike I-zone, an instant pocket camera
sold beside cash registers like a Snickers bar, offered in the
shrill hues of teen-age nail polish _ Wicked Wasabi, Go Grape
Sorbet _ is the country's best-selling camera.
</P>
<P>
   The thumbnail-size I-zone images are as grainy and dark as ``The
Blair Witch Project'' and enjoy a similar following: Half the
buyers are girls 14 to 17, who use them at parties and tack the
pictures to notebooks and bulletin boards. Since last fall, two
million I-zones have sold, at $25 each, making Polaroid profitable
last year for the first time in five years. Polaroid, whose images
were often found in real estate office windows, has returned to the
party _ and the backyard and the family room.
</P>
<P>
   The I-zone and its instant-camera siblings, the larger Popshot
and Joycam, mark a radical departure for Polaroid, whose success in
the 1960s and '70s was based on technological innovation. Founded
by an inventor, Edwin Land, it was run for years by engineers. Now
its innovations are coming from design, according to David Laituri,
Polaroid's manager of design strategy, who offered a peek at
Polaroid's future.
</P>
<P>
   Laituri and his redesign team have taken pages from Swatch and
Motorola to turn the cameras into highly personalized and
fashion-influenced consumer products with a new design language for
a company that is speaking less formally and using a far hipper
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call our design language `double bubble,''' said Laituri,
who came to Polaroid in 1998 from Lunar Design, where he helped
shape home computers for Hewlett-Packard. Here, his design theme
consists of an oval intersecting a circle. The shape expresses the
function: The round lens and oval viewfinder intersect, visually
suggesting their similar functions; double bubbles recur in the
shutter pull ring of the Popshot. The ovals lend unifying style to
the Polaroid product line.
</P>
<P>
   The I-zone was developed with Tomy, the Japanese toy and gadget
maker, and became a hit in Japan in 1998. But Polaroid was slow to
bring it to the United States, recalling failed forays into hipness
like the Swinger (circa the late '60s). The low resolution images
appalled many in the company, Laituri says.
</P>
<P>
   The new cameras make smaller pictures than the SX-70 and
top-of-the-line Spectra cameras. The 1-by-1{-inch image emerges
from the I-zone on a paper strip that looks like a large colorful
Band-Aid. Veiled and dark, the images are somehow fresh and new,
like the first photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But for a generation weaned on high tech and high resolution,
the I-zone's small size and low resolution are welcome. So is the
versatility of the sticker-backed film, inspired by photo vending
booths in airports and bus stations. ``There was a lot of
resistance within the company to the change,'' Laituri said. ``The
key idea at Polaroid now is that it's not the quality of the image
that is important. It's how you use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The use transcends the technology. This summer, Polaroid is
introducing a hybrid camera, capable of producing I-zone film
images or digital electronic images that can be downloaded into a
computer, named the Combo Camera. Another product, developed under
the name Webster, will scan I-cam images for posting on the Web.
Both cameras tap the ideas of consultants like Ideo in San
Francisco and Altitude and (Eleven), both based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Polariod intends these cameras to be social devices _ like the
cell phone, which the I-zone resembles in size and shape. Taking
pictures of one another at parties is a way for teen-agers to
communicate. (Adolescent girls in particular say they fear looking
bad in a picture. A photo that develops instantly can be destroyed
instantly, with no nasty negatives.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to produce cameras that reflect not just the
personality of the owner but also her mood. New colors for the
I-zone come out every few months. Feeling upbeat this morning? Grab
a Go Grape model. More mellow? Go for the silver camera. A
secondary line of ``tech translucent'' colors will be introduced
starting next month, with names like Phat Blue and Concrete Jungle.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems far from the high tech vision of Edwin Land _ he
helped design the cameras in the U-2 spy plane in the late 1950s _
the I-zone harks back to his principles. He was both a brilliant
technician and a man driven by democratic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Henry Dreyfuss produced the SX-70 in 1972.
Fine tool, but also fun toy, it was the camera Andy Warhol took to
parties and discos, his portraits composing an informal documentary
of the Manhattan scene of the 1970s. At this year's shows of Walker
Evans' work at the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern
Art, Polaroid SX-70 photographs hang beside his best-known
black-and-white photographs. Of the SX-70, Evans said that, for the
first time, ``you can put a machine in an artist's hand and have
him then rely entirely on his vision and his taste and his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Land's first inspiration for instant photography was, he said, a
request from his teen-age daughter, who wondered why she could not
see family vacation snapshots right way.
</P>
<P>
   He had an idealistic vision of a camera that would release the
artist in everyone. ``My basic faith, is in the random competence
of people in all walks of life, at any level of income, of any
derivation,'' he said. ``There is a common sense of beauty and of
manual aptitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   That these competences should turn up at teen-age girls' slumber
parties would have delighted Land _ and probably should not have
surprised Polaroid's engineers.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   Moving Wild Canada Columbine
</P>
<P>
   Q. Each day on the way to work I drive past a hillside that has
many clumps of beautiful bright red and yellow flowers growing
among the rocks. They look like little rocket ships on tall stems.
What are they? Will they survive transplanting? I would like to put
some by the edge of my front walk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The wildflowers brightening your commute are Canada
columbines, Aquilegia canadensis. This delicate-looking but very
tough species, ancestor of many garden hybrids, is widely
distributed, growing in open woodlands and along roadsides from
eastern Canada to Florida and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, they are not endangered; but that
doesn't mean it's all right to blithely start kidnapping them. Not
only does the removal of plants threaten the parent colony and set
you on the path to sin, it's also a bad idea from the point of view
of pure survival. Plants dug up from the wild often suffer root
damage, and even when roots are preserved intact, the transition to
different soils and different light levels puts a lot of strain on
the plants. Container-grown (or adapted) plants are expressly
created to deal with moving and usually do better at it.
</P>
<P>
   From the columbine's point of view, it would be best if your
front walk were in light shade, but they will tolerate full sun if
it isn't baking hot, and they are adaptable to a wide range of
soils as long as those soils are well-drained.
</P>
<P>
   Canada columbine's flowers bloom only in spring, and the
fernlike blue green foliage is too delicate to attract the casual
browser's eye, so this plant is seldom sold in garden centers, but
it is widely available by mail order. Sources include Prairie
Nursery, P.O. Box 306 Westfield, Wis. 53964, Catalog free at (800)
476-9453. Extensive guide to and discussion of native plants at

</P>
<P>
   If You Want to Save a Yew
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a yew about five feet wide next to the deck of my
swimming pool. It is blocking part of the deck so we cannot pass
by. Can this be trimmed from the front? It looks as if all I will
have is the inside branches left, a rather ugly sight. But if I can
do it, when is the best time?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if you may secretly hope there is nothing to be
done, so before we get to the pruning part, let me encourage you to
be brave and get rid of the thing. Though it goes against a
gardener's grain to kill a healthy shrub, why keep one where you
can look forward to two or three years of bare spots followed by a
lifelong commitment to time-consuming maintenance?
</P>
<P>
   If you are determined to keep it, there are two alternatives.
The yew can be trimmed from the front, but it will be ugly, and not
just while the inside branches are putting on new growth. No matter
how green it gets, the shrub will always look like it has been
sliced in half.
</P>
<P>
   A more attractive alternative is to reshape the whole plant. Cut
back a little bit (6 to 9 inches) all around each year, pruning
individual branches to slightly different lengths rather than
shearing along the face. It will take longer to prune than to
shear, but the result will be a tall, narrow shrub that's vaguely
columnar without looking as though it belongs in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what shape you choose, the best time to start cutting
is early spring, before the plant puts out new growth. This gives
you maximum green to cover the exposed bare spots and gives the
plant maximum time to harden up before winter. But it's not too
late; get going right now and you will still have quite a bit of
new yew this year.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43rd Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to

published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

YOU HAVE THE CARPET, NOW THE PAD

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good carpet should never rest directly on the floor but on a
pad. The pad can add extra cushioning to the carpet and provide a
softer walking surface. In addition, the pad insulates the carpet
from the hard floor and thus prevents the carpet fibers from being
crushed whenever someone walks on it. This can add to the life of
the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Carpet pads can be divided into two broad categories: attached
and unattached. The attached pad is bonded to the back of the
carpet at the factory. It is usually made of an inexpensive foam
material that quickly loses its resiliency. It is cheap and easy to
install, but it deteriorates in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   It is far better to invest in an unattached pad. Unattached pads
are available in a variety of materials, thicknesses and prices, so
you can choose the best product for your carpet. Pads are available
in either natural or artificial (synthetic) materials.
</P>
<P>
   The natural materials include hair, jute, cotton and rubber.
Hair pads are made from horsehair. They are quite durable, but they
are also expensive, so most natural fiber pads are a combination of
hair, jute and possibly cotton. Unfortunately, these amalgams
weaken the pad, causing it to break down over time. In an effort to
prevent deterioration, manufacturers coat both sides of the pad
with a layer of latex.
</P>
<P>
   Natural fiber pads tend to be firm, and they do not create a
cushioned effect the way the more popular artificial sponge pads
do. Sometimes, however, this can be an advantage, especially with
woven carpets. Many woven carpets have stiff backs that cannot be
fully stretched during installation. If these carpets are placed
over a soft pad, they will bend, stretch and wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber pads are a good compromise between the firm fiber pads
and soft ones of synthetic materials. They are made in a firm
sponge composition or in a softer ``waffle'' design. Sponge rubber
pads are available in quarter-inch- and three-eighths-inch
thicknesses. Waffle pads are thicker, a half inch or more, but much
of that thickness consists of air pockets.
</P>
<P>
   All rubber pads have some ingredients that affect their quality
and durability. One common element is clay. The clay gives the
rubber more body, but as it dries out over time, the pad will
deteriorate. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how much clay
is in any pad. The best the consumer can hope for is a warranty
from the dealer stating that the pad will last as long as the
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, natural pads are rated according to the number of
ounces per cubic yard they weigh. A good quality fiber pad should
weigh about 40 ounces, a sponge rubber pad about 64 ounces and a
rubber waffle pad around 80 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial pads are made from polyurethane foam and are less
expensive than natural pads. Artificial pads are called either
prime or rebonded, depending on the composition of the polyurethane
in them. Prime pads are made with urethane of one consistency in
varying thicknesses from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch.
Thickness is not as important, however, as density. Dense pads tend
to be firmer and more durable than an open pad.
</P>
<P>
   Rebonded pads are made of polyurethane chunks that have been
bonded into a single sheet. These pads are heavier, denser and more
durable than prime pads. Rebonded polyurethane pads are the most
common type of residential carpet pad.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to install an extra-thick artificial pad
under a carpet to give it a luxurious feel, this can have some
drawbacks. The carpet may flex too much, and if it is not well
made, the backing and seams may crack. A pad that is too thin, on
the other hand, may not provide enough cushioning and cause the
carpet to wear prematurely. It is best then to choose a pad
three-quarters of an inch a a half-inch thick with a density of six
pounds per cubic foot.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best carpet will bubble or wrinkle if it is not
installed properly. Wall-to-wall carpet should be stretched with
power stretchers. If the carpet is not stretched, it will
eventually expand on its own and create an unsightly surface that
will wear quickly and become a tripping hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The stretched carpet should be secured with tack strips that are
nailed in place one-half inch away from the baseboard around the
perimeter of the room. The gap between the tack strip and the
baseboard allows clearance to tuck the edges of carpet down and
hide any irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Not all carpets are wide enough to cover a large room. Often,
sections have to be joined with seam tape. All seams should be
positioned in low-traffic areas away from direct sunlight. It is
important that the pile in both sections of the carpet run the same
way or the seam will be obvious. &QL;

TO PREPARE FOR WORST, BACK UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are treacherous. Thanks to the wonders of modern
technology, they make it easier than ever before to lose vast
amounts of important information in a hurry. Anyone can misplace a
set of car keys, but only a computer can lose years' worth of
banking and investment records, family photos, music files, a
nearly finished novel and tomorrow's important business
presentation instantly and irretrievably.
</P>
<P>
   But disasters can be minimized, if not avoided entirely, with a
regular backup program. As recounted here last week, a successful
data backup strategy for personal computers has to be reasonably
easy, regular, remote and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   There are three major categories of backup devices: magnetic,
optical and online. I've tried several examples of each, ranging
from the most basic floppy disk system to the newest online storage
services. Each has advantages and disadvantages. There is no single
solution that is perfect for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are shopping for a new PC, adding a magnetic Zip drive or
an optical drive (either CD-R or CD-RW) is highly recommended. If
you are one of the estimated two million lucky people who have a
high-speed Internet connection through a cable modem or DSL, an
online storage service may be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, PC owners may choose to use some combination of
techniques, sort of a belt-and-suspenders approach. Others may
simply choose the easiest or cheapest solution.
</P>
<P>
   Personal psychology affects the decision. For example, I avoid
almost any type of backup solution that involves data compression,
even though compression speeds the backup process by squeezing more
files onto fewer disks.
</P>
<P>
   My aversion stems from two very bad experiences in trying to
restore compressed files after a hard disk failure. I know it is
irrational, just like the geezers who go to the bank and demand to
see and count their money because they don't trust the idea of
their life savings existing only as a green glow on a computer
screen. I like to see my backup files displayed as exact copies of
the original files, instead of the hieroglyphics that compressed
files often resemble. I am happiest when I can back up a file,
click on it and test it immediately, just to reassure myself that
it works.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, tape drives give me the willies. Yes,
magnetic tape is fast and cheap and reliable, and many corporations
rely on it for their most important archiving. But it does not
offer the instant gratification of other options, and testing a
tape backup is a hassle. For those reasons I avoid it. With my
biases now disclosed, let's look at the remaining options.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic Backup
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic systems for desktop PCs include the humble floppy disk
and high-capacity disks like Iomega's Zip and Imation's SuperDisk.
There are other variations, but Zips and SuperDisks are the most
common.
</P>
<P>
   In the easy and cheap category, the floppy disk is king. Most
PC's still come with a floppy drive as standard equipment. A floppy
disk formatted for Windows holds 1.44 megabytes of data, good for
impromptu backups of small files but grossly inadequate for today's
multigigabyte hard drives and multimegabyte digital photo and music
files. Although it may seem like the floppy is flopping toward
extinction _ Apple computers did away with the floppy drive some
time ago _ it still serves a limited role for backups and file
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago I got a computer with a built-in Iomega Zip
drive. Each Zip disk (about $9) holds about 100 megabytes of data,
the equivalent of 69 floppies, making it handy for backing up
entire folders full of files. An external Zip drive costs about
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I bought an external 250-MB USB Zip drive (about $200;
disks about $18 each), which is backward-compatible with older
100-MB disks. The USB connection allows me to move the drive, and
the data, easily from one USB-equipped computer to another.
</P>
<P>
   On my iMac, however, I use an Imation SuperDisk drive (about
$120). Unlike the Zip drive, the SuperDisk drive can read and write
both conventional 3.5-inch floppy disks and 120-MB SuperDisks
(about $10 each, less if bought in bulk).
</P>
<P>
   The Zip is more common, which is an important consideration if
you need to rush to Kinko's in the middle of the night to retrieve
a file. But the SuperDisk is not exactly rare. Several companies
offer SuperDisks in their laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Optical Disks
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW (rewritable) optical drives are increasingly popular,
especially among people who store a lot of music files and digital
photos. The storage capacity of a CD is 650 MB, and blank discs are
cheap, about $2 or less in most computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   CD's have some modest drawbacks, especially in ease of use.
Unlike copying to Zips or SuperDisks, which function a lot like
floppy disks, copying files to a recordable CD typically requires a
bit of study and practice.
</P>
<P>
   A CD-RW drive (around $275) can create both CD-R and CD-RW
discs, while a CD-R drive can make only CD-R discs. Get the CD-RW
for the most flexibility. In general, a CD-R disc is best for
making audio CD's and permanent archives of other types of files.
Almost any CD or DVD drive can read CD-R discs, while CD-RW discs
are more finicky. On the other hand, CD-RW discs are handy for
backing up files that change frequently, because files can be
erased and overwritten.
</P>
<P>
   Online Storage
</P>
<P>
   The new champion of easy and cheap backup is online storage.
There are several free services on the Internet that allow users to
park copies of their important files on secure network server
computers. These personal storage areas, which are password
protected, are accessible from any computer that has a browser and
access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is X:drive (www.xdrive.com), which offers new users
25 MB of free space. More space, up to 100 MB, is awarded in 5-MB
or 10-MB increments for enticing friends to sign up for the service
or for visiting the site frequently. Extra space can also be
purchased for a monthly fee ranging from $4.95 a month for 25 MB to
$19.95 a month for a gigabyte of storage.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to use the service. One is to log on through
a browser (Netscape or Microsoft) and download or upload files one
at a time. The other, limited to Windows 95 and 98 users, involves
downloading a simple application from the X:drive site.
</P>
<P>
   Once the application is installed, the X:drive shows up on the
desktop and in the Windows Explorer file tree just as if it were a
local drive, like the A or C drive. It is then easy to drag and
drop files and folders between the local hard disk and the remote
X:drive.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving on a trip, I copy my most important files into a
private folder on the X drive. I can then retrieve them, or simply
use them on line, from any Web-connected computer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Apple offers a similar service called iDisk, exclusively for
Macintosh computers. But Apple's service is limited to a paltry 20
MB.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks. Working with the X:drive files can be
sluggish, especially over dial-up modem connections, and 25 MB is
not a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   There are also nagging concerns about the free online storage
services. I'm not sure I'd trust my long-term archiving to a
start-up. I have more trust in the Zips and the CD's that I burn
myself and can hold in my hands. Also, as recent events have shown,
no password-protected system is entirely secure from a clever and
determined hacker.

MOTHER-IN-LAW OF ALL VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ This is a city where anything can happen: a jazz
parade might suddenly strike up a march in a quiet residential
neighborhood at 1 a.m., or in the middle of the afternoon a tourist
restaurant could be invaded by masked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   For six years Ernie K-Doe's Mother-in-Law Lounge, a corner bar
opened by this '60s rhythm-and-blues singer, has been a perfect
embodiment of New Orleans unpredictability: every visit to K-Doe's
shrine to himself is an adventure. But nothing in my experience
interviewing musicians or spending time at the Mother-in-Law Lounge
could have prepared me for what happened there this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the history books the 64-year-old K-Doe, whose original name
was Ernest Kador Jr., is known for recording the No. 1 hit
``Mother-in-Law'' followed by several regional successes. But to
the denizens of New Orleans today he is a bona fide character,
brimming with unpredictable energy and an unharnessed ego that has
led him to nickname himself the Emperor of the Universe. He is a
golden oldie who has lifted himself off the skids with the support
of a new wife, the opening of an off-the-beaten-track bar and
tireless dedication to the musical temple that is himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't but two of us left,'' he said one night behind the bar
at the Mother-in-Law Lounge. ``James Brown and K-Doe.''
</P>
<P>
   In his performance at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
Festival, which ran from April 28 to May 7, K-Doe strung his old
hits together in a set that ran 20 minutes shorter than the time
allotted to it. Wearing a canary yellow suit with rhinestones and
stitched music notes, a feathered yellow crown and a flowing yellow
cape with the words ``Emperor Ernie K-Doe'' emblazoned on the back,
he announced songs with lines like, ``Here's another million-seller
by Ernie K-Doe: I never miss.'' His voice was rough, ragged and
tended to flatten out, but he nonetheless put on a blaring, madcap
R-and-B performance that held the audience gleefully rapt.
</P>
<P>
   And the performance didn't stop at Jazz Fest. He and his wife,
Antoinette (who is also his seamstress, backup singer and manager),
made sure that the music continued each night at the Mother-in-Law
Lounge. On a typical night there K-Doe stays behind the bar. In the
front of the room there is a jukebox filled with Ernie K-Doe
recordings from the '50s on. When a patron plays one of K-Doe's
songs, the legend himself will usually pick an old brown taxicab
microphone off the back counter and sing along.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will he karaoke, but he will also talk to his own voice
on the CD, making comments like, ``Tell 'em, K-Doe,'' or ``I'm
cocky, but I'm good.'' Occasionally, in a small room in the back,
K-Doe's flesh-and-blood mother-in-law can be seen watching
television, oblivious to the havoc in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   For the nights of Jazz Fest, K-Doe brought in a dapper-looking
lounge performer named Rico Watts, who plays at the bar on Sundays,
to accompany him on synthesizer and drum machine. It was on one of
those nights that a photographer and I visited to prepare this
column about K-Doe, who sat at the bar running his long, ladylike
fingernails through his suspiciously elaborate long black hair. We
requested permission for an interview and photographs, and he and
his wife were only too glad to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   While on break between sets, we walked out to K-Doe's touring
van, with his name emblazoned on the side surrounded by stars, and
talked. He spoke of wanting to let the record labels know that he
was actually free and looking for a deal, and then proceeded to
recite several of his favorite immodesties, including his assertion
that ``there are only three songs that will last until the end of
the earth.'' Those songs are: ``Amazing Grace,'' ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' and ``Mother-in-Law.'' Because, he observed,
``there will always be mothers-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we headed back into the bar to take photographs and
watch him perform his second set. During his last number, the
racial unity song ``Black Boy, White Boy,'' he stopped singing and
looked directly at me. ``I was good to you, wasn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure were, K-Doe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why are you trying to record my show?''
</P>
<P>
   I looked down at my lap: the recorder I had used to tape our
conversation was sitting there, though, of course, it hadn't been
turned on since the interview. Suddenly, the music stopped and
K-Doe came roaring from behind the bar, demanding that the tape be
handed over. ``We aren't playing any more music until you give us
the tape,'' she shouted.
</P>
<P>
   I offered to let them hear the tape to prove that there was
nothing but interview on it. But K-Doe wouldn't hear any of it. And
I wasn't going to relinquish the tape especially since it included
other interviews I had conducted in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock the door!'' she barked at a man who was either a
heavy-set regular or a security guard. ``Nobody's getting out of
here until he hands over the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff took an unexpected turn when K-Doe called the
police. She screamed that they would force me to hand over the tape
as well as the film, because she had decided that she wanted the
film as well. As an R-and-B singer coming up in the '50s and '60s,
he was no doubt cheated out of his fair share from his music, which
may help explain why they thought I was trying to make a bootleg of
the show to sell for personal profit at some sort of K-Doe black
market swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the K-Does had been extremely exhausted and busy the
weeks of Jazz Fest, with K-Doe staying up all night to make
costumes and cook for her husband's concerts, parties and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of surreal negotiations outside the club with two
police officers (which included a search of the photographer's bag
for more K-Doe bootleg tapes), K-Doe calmed down, and no arrests
were made. ``I'm sorry this misunderstanding happened,'' I told her
and pointed out to her that the article I intended to write would
let more people know about K-Doe and their bar.
</P>
<P>
   She barked back: ``This man is a legend. He doesn't need any
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's going to get it anyway, and don't let this tale
discourage you from dropping in. Take it from someone who will
probably never be allowed to enter the Mother-In-Law Lounge again,
my visits to New Orleans won't be the same without it.

CAUGHT BETWEEN PAYDAY AND PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she was a securities broker in Florida for NationsBank
Corp. in the early 1990s, Catherine Hovis knew that the elderly
clients she was selling mutual funds to did not have the financial
or emotional means to take on risky investments. One couple, both
in their 70s, were living on Social Security and wanted something
as safe as a certificate of deposit but with a better return _
maybe 7 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hovis convinced the couple that the bank's mutual funds were
safe and, at her bosses' urging, reassured them they had made a
smart investment even after the value of the funds declined.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hovis, 43, acknowledges that she had begun to suspect the
mutual funds were not as solid as bank management had led her to
believe. Yet, she continued to sell them to risk-averse elderly
clients because, she says, she was doing what her bosses told her
to do. She was also motivated by her supervisor's praise, a
six-figure salary, financial bonuses and a free trip to the Cayman
Islands, becoming one of the top 25 sellers of the funds for
NationsBank, now part of Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money makes people do very strange things,'' Hovis said. ``As
a single mother, I was willing to do what I had to do.'' Besides,
she added: ``I'm human. I wanted to be a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of pressuring the elderly to buy mutual funds,
which Hovis said was pervasive throughout the bank, led to a $29
million class-action settlement by NationsBank in 1997 with people
who had been sold the funds. Despite the settlement, the bank
vigorously denied the assertions in the suit. Last week, bank
officials declined to comment on Hovis' assertions.
</P>
<P>
   As she describes it, her moral plight was unusually stark. But
the basic choice she faced between her paycheck and her principles
is one that most workers eventually encounter. And with hordes of
people now fixated on stock market riches and million-dollar game
shows, ethicists warn that ordinary Americans are having an even
harder time holding on to their moral bearings.
</P>
<P>
   The transgressions that tempt them can be as seemingly trivial
as fudging an expense report and as troubling as lying to law
enforcement officials to protect their boss. Sometimes, they make
headlines, as happened this year when Christopher Davidge, a former
chief executive of the Christie's auction house, was said to have
told government investigators that Sir Anthony Tennant, a former
chairman, had ordered him to carry out a price-fixing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people just go along with what other people do and
respond to the expectations of those around them,'' said David
Vogel, an ethics professor at the Haas School of Business at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``This encourages and permits
ethically dubious behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the tight labor market _ which logically ought to
diminish worries about job security _ might actually encourage
ethical lapses, some experts say. ``In a rising economy, you don't
want to be left out,'' said William Lundin, author of ``When Smart
People Work for Dumb Bosses'' (McGraw-Hill, 1998). ``To be at the
big table and play with the big guys, you take chances and risks,
and bend your ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have adopted codes of conduct and other ethics
programs in recent years. Yet, a new survey by the consulting and
accounting firm KPMG shows that unethical behavior is still rife in
the workplace. The survey of 2,300 workers in a broad range of
industries was conducted in 1999 and released last week. More than
three-quarters of the respondents had witnessed illegal activities
or breaches of company rules over the previous 12 months, and 38
percent said they believed that senior managers would ``authorize
illegal or unethical conduct to meet business goals.'' Factors that
they said encouraged unethical behavior included the pressure to
meet unrealistic production and earnings goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still seeing fairly significant levels of misconduct,''
said Richard Girgenti, KPMG's national director of investigative
and integrity management services. ``Ethics programs need attention
and nurturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing certain ethical boundaries may be endemic to certain
industries. In a recent survey by the trade journal PR Week of
1,700 public-relations executives, 25 percent acknowledged lying on
the job, 39 percent said they had exaggerated the truth, and 44
percent said they had ethical qualms about tasks they had been
asked to perform.
</P>
<P>
   A common catalyst for wrongful behavior is common to every
industry: blind devotion to a boss. Nan DeMars, an ethics
consultant in Minneapolis, cited an Atlanta secretary who, trusting
her boss, notarized a document for the sale of his wife's car
without witnessing the wife's signature _ a breach of the law _
because he insisted it was hers. It wasn't, the wife said in a
lawsuit, and the secretary ended up with a felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mason, head of the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public
Responsibility at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said
that people guilty of ethical missteps usually have a ``moment of
truth'' in which they either decide to rationalize their behavior
or try to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   Hovis is trying to make amends. ``I paid for the blood money,''
she said, fighting tears. ``All the calls and cries for help'' from
clients gave her sleepless nights, she said, and led to occasional
heavy drinking.
</P>
<P>
   She decided in 1994 she did not want to sell the funds anymore
and soon left the bank. Since then, she said, she has cooperated
with federal and state regulators, including testifying to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. On top of the $29 million
class-action settlement, in 1998 NationsBank agreed to pay $6.75
million to settle charges by the SEC and other regulators that it
had misled investors about their investment risks. NationsBank
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the least I can do to repay my part of what I did,'' said
Hovis, who is now trying to make a career out of teaching financial
education. ``When I'm dead and gone, at least my son will say, `My
mom tried.'''

GOVERNMENT SEIZES INDEPENDENT MEDIA OUTLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Serbian government on Wednesday seized control of the main
opposition television station, accusing it of advocating an
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians, taken by surprise, talked of the
beginning of a dictatorship in Serbia, under Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. They called for an immediate protest rally.
</P>
<P>
   The station that was seized, Studio B, belonged to the city of
Belgrade and also provided a frequency for the independent radio
station B2-92, which was effectively silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Studio B was controlled by the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk
Draskovic, the ruling party in the city and the single largest
opposition party in the country. Studio B, although lavish in its
coverage of Draskovic, is the most important opposition television
outlet in Serbia, able to reach up to half the population in normal
times, and its seizure is an attack on Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, its broadcasts have frequently been jammed, and
it has been one of the main targets of an increasing series of
fines and lawsuits aimed at the independent media and independent
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   The station remained on the air Wednesday, showing
pro-government material and the state news. The government named a
presumed loyalist, Ljubisav Aleksic, as the new editor and general
manager. On the frequency given to Radio B2-92 there was music.
</P>
<P>
   The new management of Studio B broadcast pictures of the empty
newsroom, highlighting cabinets full of expensive foreign liquor, a
British flag and signs from the United Nations and SFOR
peacekeepers in Bosnia, underlining official accusations that the
opposition works for the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The official charge against the station, in an order signed by
radical nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian deputy
prime minister, was that Studio B had called for a violent
overthrow of the constitutional order and had incited people to
riot. For that, the government said, it seized control and
ownership of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of dictatorship,'' said Ognjen
Pribicevic, a top aide to Draskovic. ``Now it's up to the people of
Serbia to see how many show up to defend Studio B. The next step
could be a ban on political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Pribicevic said the opposition is appealing to the United States
and to Russia, an ally of Milosevic, ``to condemn this attack
against the Serbian people, especially when the Yugoslav foreign
minister has just been in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition leader, Vladan Batic, said: ``The government
has imposed an informal state of emergency. This indicates an
introduction of a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   An opposition politician, Zarko Korac, said: ``The Serbian
regime has opted for an open dictatorship. It is up to the citizens
of Serbia to respond and say whether they want to live in such a
society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Studio B director and editor-in-chief Dragan Kojadinovic denied
that the station has called for an uprising. ``I can say that this
has no legal or realistic foundations,'' he said. ``Studio B has
not called for any toppling of legally elected authorities. It only
reported on political and other events.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Association of Independent Electronic Media,
Veran Matic, said that B2-92 was ``collateral damage'' in the
closings and that it was looking for backup broadcasting options.
He said the move was ``the most serious assault'' yet on
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal elections are due in Yugoslavia before the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and other members of the opposition have sometimes
been intemperate in their language and have come close to calling
for a popular movement to sweep Milosevic from power without
benefit of elections. They have also called on the army and police
to defect to the opposition and overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, at a party rally in Ravna Gora, Draskovic said his
party would more strongly oppose ``the terror'' of the Milosevic
regime. ``From today, we will not only defend ourselves by
meetings, speeches and statements, but by all means possible,'' he
said. And when his supporters shot guns into the air, Draskovic
said, ``Save your ammunition _ you'll need it.'' That rally was
shown on Studio B.
</P>
<P>
   Studio B has regularly broadcast Draskovic's charges that senior
government police and political officials conspired to kill him in
a car accident last October in which his brother-in-law and some
bodyguards died.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police moved at 2 a.m. to seize the building housing the
offices and newsroom of Studio B. The police also locked the
offices of B2-92 and Radio Indeks, in the same building, as well as
the offices of the largest independent newspaper, Blic.
</P>
<P>
   Blic, which has a circulation of more than 220,000 copies, was
already being harassed by the government, with the state-owned
Borba printing press refusing to print the paper on the grounds
that a press was broken.
</P>
<P>
   Blic, which has been able to print only about half of its normal
circulation using two other printing houses, presumably will
continue to appear, since it has no connection to Studio B.
</P>
<P>
   But the private printing house that prints Glas Javnosti,
another independent newspaper, and has been printing some copies of
Blic as well as the independent weeklies Nin and Vreme is also
under attack by the government for alleged financial
irregularities. The printing house, ABC Grafika, has been ordered
to vacate its premises, although it has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, especially after the murders of some senior
officials, including Bosko Perosevic, a senior member of
Milosevic's party, Yugoslav authorities have increased their
attacks on the opposition, labeling them traitors, terrorists and
fascists.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, often divided, has lately shown signs of more
unity. But after a successful rally in Belgrade last month, when
more than 150,000 people gathered, a second rally on Monday
attracted fewer than 20,000. Government officials gloated and may
have taken the low turnout as a signal to move forward with this
crackdown and challenge to the opposition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government also increased its attacks on the student
organization Otpor, which means Resistance, which has attracted
more serious political support in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, at least one journalist was accused of
espionage, but was later released. And some 40 Otpor activists and
other opposition figures have been detained in recent days for
``informative talks'' with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent electronic media that could be heard in
Belgrade on Wednesday was Radio Pancevo, based in an
opposition-controlled town nearby. And there were concerns that the
government would try to move against the many small television and
radio stations controlled by the cities where the opposition holds
power.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has typically been careful to keep to the letter of
the law, but he and his government now are acting more arbitrarily
than in the past. He has also generally allowed a zone of free
speech and independent newspapers and magazines that tend to preach
to the converted. He often did so to please the West, but since the
war over Kosovo and his indictment on war crimes charges,
Milosevic's motivation to satisfy Western requirements has been
considerably diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not begin as a dictator and has not been one,'' said
one opposition politician, asking for anonymity. ``But he may
become one yet.''

LACK OF ETHICS IS BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having declared him innocent beforehand, the International
Olympic Committee set about investigating excessive travel
privileges for one of its delegates, Kevan Gosper of Australia, in
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. To no one's surprise, Gosper
was cleared of wrongdoing on Monday. You usually have to be the
president of Indiana University to conduct an investigation as
feeble as an IOC inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved two trips to Utah while Salt Lake City was
bidding on the tarnished 2002 Winter Olympics. One trip, to a ski
resort, was taken in 1993 by Gosper's wife and two children. The
other was an ``official'' visit made by Gosper to inspect Salt Lake
City's bid in 1995. A report by the IOC's ethics commission noted
that Gosper's wife had paid for the ski trip and suggested that
$30,000 in the reported cost of the trips had been deceptively
inflated by the Salt Lake organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ski trip represented another example of
extraordinarily bad judgment on the part of Gosper. The latest
example came last week when he allowed his 11-year-old daughter to
bump another girl as the first Australian bearer on the Olympic
torch run toward the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney. A year and a half
after the Salt Lake City scandal, despite professed openness and
reform, the IOC still reeks of abuse of privilege, arrogance and
brazen entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places his wife and children could have gone skiing
in 1993, Gosper's family chose Deer Valley, Utah. It strains
credulity to think that Gosper did not know that his family would
receive preferential treatment _ even if it was only free meals and
a preferred condominium _ from a group of fawning organizers who
were willing to spend millions in illicit cash payments,
scholarships and medical benefits to gain the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Gosper should
have sent his family elsewhere. The ethics commission said that
Gosper's family acted as friends do among friends, but Gosper
should have known that his friendship was being bought. Apparently,
it never crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it occur to him that it was improper for his daughter,
Sophie, to displace another girl as the first Australian torch
bearer. She has been embarrassed internationally by her own father,
who should have known better as a former member of the IOC's ethics
commission and a man who aspires to replace Juan Antonio Samaranch
as president. Gosper apologized to Samaranch Tuesday, and said he
would pull out of next week's flame ceremonies in Guam, but his
contrition was late and hollow.
</P>
<P>
   As the 2000 Summer Games slouch toward Sydney in September, the
Olympic ideals have been thoroughly and perhaps irretrievably
compromised. Let's recap. Sydney won the Games narrowly over
Beijing by essentially bribing delegates from Kenya and Uganda with
promises of $35,000 apiece the night before the vote. Both IOC
members from Australia have been tainted. Gosper by the torch and
hospitality scandals, and Phil Coles for taking expensive jewelry
from organizers of Athens' failed 1996 Olympic bid and for
contributing to dossiers about the pecadilloes of his fellow
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Inscrutably, Coles remains on the IOC, warned but not expelled.
Like basketball coaches at Indiana, powerful IOC members find their
jobs secured through the wink-wink of double-secret probation.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers also came under heavy criticism for deceiving
the public about the withholding of 500,000 tickets to be sold to
corporate bidders at three times the normal price. And now come
reports from Australia that hundreds of Sydney Olympic officials
and their families have jumped in line for the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was nepotism, now it is self-promotion,'' said an
angered New South Wales legislator, Charlie Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Olympics teeter on, surviving on the myths of
purity and amateurism. Corporate sponsors have capitulated their
watchdog responsibility; even the harshest critic, the John Hancock
insurance company, has re-upped for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   The much larger scandal of pervasive drug use goes unchecked.
Tests to detect the use of performance-enhancing drugs like EPO and
human-growth hormones are unlikely to be approved for Sydney. If
so, not one result could be considered reliable beyond question.
Any fast times, particularly in swimming and track and field, will
bring immediate suspicion. An indifferent IOC has let the problem
get beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Future drug and corruption scandals seem inevitable.
Preparations for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens remain precarious.
The Olympic Games are as decayed as a bad tooth, perhaps facing
permanent extraction sometime in the future.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to see through the gates, shuddering at the
sound of jackhammers and buzz saws, worrying about 85-year-old
cherry trees dangling their roots in the drained pond: It was like
pacing the halls during a beloved's interminable operation. But now
the vigil is over and worrywarts can relax: The Brooklyn Botanic
Garden is about to reopen its Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, and
the patient never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ducks and herons that showed up as soon as the water
returned in April (who told them?) and the three turtles basking on
a rock (how did they escape the turtle roundup last summer?),
people will flock back to the Japanese Garden on May 24, when the
gates are thrown open on the yearlong $3 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   There are interesting things to quibble over, like a few
lollipop grafted cherry trees that may never learn to weep, and the
vibrantly orange-red torii gate, but overall, the restoration has
remained true to the spirit of the original garden, designed by
Takeo Shiota in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very experimental dynamic time, when young designers
were reinventing the Japanese garden,'' said Annie Van Assche, a
art historian at the Japan Society Gallery in Manhattan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn garden, the first public Japanese garden in
America, ``incorporates many of the classical conventions,'' Van
Assche added, like terraced hillsides and a cascading waterfall,
and the borrowed scenery of hills and trees reflected in water.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes liberties too, like the bronze cranes standing in
the pond. ``You would never see a crane sculpture in gardens in
Japan,'' Van Assche said. And that torii gate, she said, modeled
after the great Miyajima gate that stands on its own in the Inland
Sea of Japan, framing the islands in the far distance, is a bit
epic for a little Brooklyn garden. (So maybe Shiota, a young
immigrant himself, was missing home.)
</P>
<P>
   As restorers examined the interpretations of the garden passed
down as truths by ``experts'' over the years, they found them to be
legends that dispelled like mist. Yet like Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan's
``Mikado,'' they tell a story in themselves about what Americans
understood _ or misunderstood _ about this exotic land.
</P>
<P>
   There's a jarring newness to the fresh wooden pilings, the
orange-red paint, the clunky bluestone benches of the amphitheater
dedicated to the garden's first benefactor, Alfred T. White. ``It's
going to take me a little while to accommodate myself to those
pilings that edge the pond,'' said Archie Hobson, a book editor and
garden guide, who married Susan Lacerte, the director of Queens
Botanical Garden, by the Shinto shrine 13 years ago. ``I was used
to a more natural edge. And I'm not happy to see the bird
sculptures come back, or those bright azaleas.''
</P>
<P>
   Those birds are replicas of the original bronze cranes that
stood in the pond, by Turtle Island, when the garden first opened,
so they are just as faithful to Shiota's design as the tall pines
that evoke eternity, the flowering cherries that speak of the
evanescence of life. Or the crisp edges of the dredged pond. But
time, and each person's interpretation of the garden, had blurred
those edges. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese waterfall ``is actually an Italian grotto built
with Manhattan schist,'' said Hobson, who learned this from Marc
Keane, a consultant brought over from the University of Kyoto to
advise restorationists on the garden's authenticity. The
five-tiered waterfall, with echo chamber to magnify the sound of
rushing water, is like something you might see in a Long Island
diner. But what do you expect from stone masons longing for the old
country?
</P>
<P>
   As Hobson said: ``We don't have to be deadeye-Dick about it. We
don't have to be defensive. This is an American garden in Brooklyn.
The water drowns out the traffic.'' It's our garden. And grottos
are just fine with us.
</P>
<P>
   Keane is an American landscape architect who fell so in love
with Japan he now lives in Kyoto. When he went back to Japan, he
left quite a few ripples, good and bad, depending on your personal
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the Miyajima gate twice and it was not orange, it
was vermilion,'' said Elizabeth Scholtz, who directed the botanic
garden for eight years, and is the vessel of all its arcane
history. ``It was orange originally, but when Dr. George Avery went
to Japan in 1960, he came back with the theory that the Japanese do
not like painted wood. So he caused it to be scraped.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery ran the garden from 1945 to 1969; Scholtz steered it
through the budget crunch of the 1970s. Around that time, a
gardener handed her an article in Scientific American about the
Miyajima shrine, which had a picture of the torii gate in glorious
color _ vermilion, not orange.
</P>
<P>
   So Scholtz decided to paint the gate scarlet. ``So it would
stand out in the landscape,'' she said. ``As if to say, `We may be
suffering financially, but look at us!'''
</P>
<P>
   Then the interloper, Keane, came along and stuck in his two
cents: an authentic torii gate would be more orange.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that cockamamie story that the lake echoes the shape of
the Chinese character for heart _ or is it mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``He just tossed that aside,'' Scholtz, who rather liked that
story, said. ``He said it was an irregular shape because it fit the
contours of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when they went back to the 1910 plan of the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, before the Japanese garden was built, why
there was a pond with a squiggly shape.
</P>
<P>
   Keane also debunked the long-told theory, first espoused in a
walking guide written by Bunkio Matsuki, in 1930, that various
parts of the garden represented heaven, man and earth. ``I was so
relieved when he said that,'' Scholtz said. ``Because I could see
that heaven was the top of the hill. But where was man?''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it soon became clear that no one but Shiota, who left
no records of his work, really knew the true meaning of the garden,
nor understood the complexities of centuries of Japanese design,
with its mixture of Shinto and Buddhism, borrowed from the Chinese
(who loved that orange-red paint, as well).
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Shinto religion, the gods, or kami, reside in nature,''
Van Assche said. ``They could be in a tree, a rock, a piece of
moss. They were never represented in human form, until Buddhism
came to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The kami are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pine grove in front of the Shinto shrine always reminds me
of camping in Maine and New Hampshire,'' said Lacerte, who worked
in the Brooklyn garden for five years. ``It's very evocative for
me. When I go hiking in the mountains, I feel like trees and rocks
speak to me. I feel that comes out in the Japanese garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The wisteria is blooming lustily over the arbor that stands on
sturdy locust posts in the pond. The torii gate has had what sounds
like a root canal job _ the rotting cores of its cypress posts dug
out and replaced with fiberglass _ before its glossy paint job.
</P>
<P>
   The curving pond has been restored to its original shoreline,
which had eroded, along with the surrounding slopes, after 85 years
of rain. ``The erosion had been terrible,'' said Ralph Morgan, the
director of capital projects standing by newly planted kurumi
azaleas on the northern slope of the Japanese garden. Now, stone
retaining walls hold soil and plants in place, and an ingenious
drainage system designed by Vollmer Associates of New York channels
torrential downpours away from the pond.
</P>
<P>
   The dreary stockade fence that kept visitors from glimpsing the
mystery of pine, stone and water has been replaced by a graceful
larch fence with a snow-cap top (to artfully catch the snow) and
eye-level openings with views of every angle of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   A wide crushed gravel path, accessible to wheelchairs and baby
carriages, now circles the pond, whose banks will soon be soft
blankets of ferns, liriope and Japanese lilies. New grass covers
Turtle Island, which, like Atlantis, was about to slide into the
sea, and much-needed new trees _ pines, katsura and cherries, to
name a few _ have been planted among the venerable originals.
</P>
<P>
   Now Judith Zuk, the current president, is putting her own mark
on the garden by bringing the bronze cranes and lotuses back to the
pond. Avery had gotten rid of the exuberant flowers in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake was absolutely clogged with lotus,'' Scholtz
recalled. ``And I think Avery decided they looked messy.'' He was
also on the ``vanguard of the weed-killer movement,'' which used up
all those postwar chemicals, ``so he got rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   These new lotuses, germinating in a greenhouse, hark back to
seeds found in a broken piece of canoe more than 3,000 years old.
``They were found in the mud at the bottom of the river Kenmi in
Chiba city,'' near Tokyo, Zuk said.
</P>
<P>
   America's flirtation with Japanese culture cooled during World
War II, of course. The Shinto shrine was razed by an arsonist in
1937. A few years ago, Madoka Yoshida, a grand-niece of Shiota,
came to visit the garden. ``She brought pictures of his birthplace,
Ohtaki Chiba,'' Zuk said. ``It was a village with an Inari shrine
like the one he designed here.'' Inari is the Shinto god of the
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshida brought a letter her great-uncle had written to her
mother, in which he told her of the ``eye-soothing'' lotus flowers
in the pond. ``This garden is the pride of my life,'' he wrote. ``I
believe it will live long and my soul will be always living in the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Takeo Shiota died on Dec. 3, 1943, in a Japanese internment camp
in South Carolina. As his greatest work reopens this week, we think
of him among the pines.

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   `Clean Install' Option Can Mean a Fresh Start
</P>
<P>
   Q. When reinstalling the Macintosh operating system from the
CD-ROM that came with the computer, what does the Clean Install
option mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. The installer program for the Macintosh operating system
gives you several choices when you run it. The usual default
setting will just overwrite the files in your current System
Folder. Selecting Clean Install creates a brand-new System Folder
on your hard drive and disables your old one.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been having nagging, quirky problems with your Mac's
performance or frequent unexplained crashes, sometimes a clean
install of fresh system software can help clear up the problems.
One drawback to a clean install, though, is that your customized
settings, extensions and preferences are still in your old System
Folder.
</P>
<P>
   You can either reinstall your modem, printer and other extension
software or move the old files into the corresponding folders
within your new System Folder.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat is that if the roots of your Mac's bad behavior are
in the Extensions folder, moving old files to the new one may just
recreate the problem, so pay close attention to what you move over.
If you are having extension problems, programs like Casady &AMP;
Greene's Conflict Catcher can help you sort them out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is a wheel mouse?
</P>
<P>
   A. Unlike a basic computer mouse that has just two or three
buttons on top (or one button, if you have a Macintosh), a wheel
mouse has a small movable disk embedded in the top. That disk,
which puts the ``wheel'' into the wheel mouse, allows you to scroll
up and down Web pages and some application windows simply by
rolling the wheel with your finger instead of using the scroll bars
on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   That can save time as you work, along with wear and tear on your
fingers and arms, because you don't have to keep moving the cursor
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My computer seems to run slower as the week progresses and
sometimes even in the course of a day. Do I need to defragment it
more often, or could something else be wrong with my Windows 98
system?
</P>
<P>
   A. Regular maintenance like defragmenting your drive is a good
habit to get into to help keep your computer running smoothly and
efficiently. The Windows 98 Maintenance Wizard, found under the
Start menu in Programs (look in Accessories, then System Tools),
will let you schedule regular times to run a series of maintenance
procedures on your PC.
</P>
<P>
   There could be a number of reasons for your machine's slowness,
so you may want to invest in a good diagnostic-and-repair utility
program to give it a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   The problem could be partly due to what is called RAM leakage.
Each time you open and close a program, some of your system's
memory may lock up and be made unavailable for use, even though it
is still there physically.
</P>
<P>
   Rebooting the computer regularly frees up the RAM that seems to
have leaked away and gives Windows a fresh start with all your
system's available memory.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Windows 98 taskbar used to be on the bottom of my screen,
but it has somehow managed to move itself and now runs vertically
along my desktop. How do I move it back to where it was?
</P>
<P>
   A. The handy Windows taskbar, that narrow gray strip that holds
application icons and the Start button, can be positioned on any
side of the screen you choose. Just click on it and drag it to
where you want it.
</P>
<P>
   You can put your personal stamp on the taskbar by right-clicking
on it to see the pop-up menu of options. From the menu, you can do
things like having the tool names pop up on screen when you pass
the mouse over them, or you can even make the taskbar program icons
bigger and easier to see.

DELTA ENLARGES ITS OVERHEAD BINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The balance has shifted significantly again in the airline
industry's carry-on bag wars. Delta Air Lines, the world's largest
carrier, is retrofitting overhead bins in most of its airplanes to
allow more storage for passengers' carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Continental Airlines defied the industry trend toward
tighter storage and stingier allowances for carry-on bags when it
completed a $20 million project to enlarge overhead bins in its
entire fleet. As some competitors grumbled and the major flight
attendants union asked the federal government to limit passengers
to a single carry-on bag, Continental loudly proclaimed that its
customers were welcome to bring on a reasonable amount of carry-on
baggage _ even more than two, provided space was available.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Delta put some of its aircraft through a
three-month trial with bigger overhead bins allowing for more
carry-on bags. The results were conclusive, said Vicki Escarra,
Delta's executive vice president for customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that it helped us to board the airplane about five to
eight minutes faster,'' she said. That's because people become
seated more quickly when they _ and flight attendants _ are not
struggling and sometimes battling over carry-on bags and limited
space.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has now redesigned overhead bins to accommodate more
carry-on bags on about 10 percent of its long-range 757s and
medium-range MD-88 planes. Within nine months, the carrier hopes to
have more spacious overhead bins in about 240 of those planes,
which are the workhorses of its fleet. In all, about 80 percent of
the Delta fleet will have bigger carry-on bins.
</P>
<P>
   Saving time is the main reason for this and other changes in
Delta's approach to boarding airplanes, said Escarra. In the last
year, she said, ``we've made a huge investment, close to a billion
dollars on improving airport technology,'' installing electronic
check-in kiosks and other services to reduce lines at airports.
That done, Delta turned its attention to carry-on storage and
decided to follow Continental's lead, although Delta will still
enforce a two-bag limit for carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra said of the trial run, ``I thought we'd get some
improvement in boarding times and on-time departure, but didn't
expect it in the seven- to eight-minute range.'' That, in addition
to a substantial improvement in boarding times thanks to the new
airport gate technology, is a direct appeal to business travelers.
``When you talk to business travelers about what is important to
them, 80-90 percent will tell you, being on time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Delta agreed with Continental on overhead storage and
the need to reduce boarding time. ``The strategies are very much
the same, although they have not made nearly the investments that
we have around improvements in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental declined to comment _ much _ on Delta's move. ``What
is it they say, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery?''
said Michele Treacy, a spokeswoman for Continental, who reiterated
the airline's position on carry-ons: ``Our customers should be able
to bring on what they want, within reason. Our customers don't want
to be told the size of the bag they can bring on _ or how many.''
</P>
<P>
   The average business traveler made 21 trips last year and stayed
48 nights in hotels, according to the 1999 OAG Worldwide Business
Travel Lifestyle Survey. Both averages are up from the year before.
International business travel is also increasing, the OAG says.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the growth in international travel, and aware of how
frustrating using a phone in a foreign country can be for those who
need to stay in touch with the office or with far-flung customers
facing what it politely refers to as ``local communications
roadblocks,'' Sprint recently introduced a service called Sprint
Business Traveler, which provides customers with phone card,
personal conferencing, global dialing and Internet, e-mail,
voice-mail and other features that work in 125 countries. Customers
get a small leather carrying case that holds 13 assorted phone
adapters to use with a wide variety of foreign systems.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the same trends, Avis just added four more countries
_ Latvia, Estonia, Morocco and Syria _ to its toll-free ``On Call''
service that links car renters in 25 countries to a U.S.-based Avis
agent 24 hours a day. The agents are trained to help unsnag travel
obstacles of all kinds and can also do things like help customers
find medical services while abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a use for turbulence: Passengers on some United
Airlines flights out of O'Hare Airport in Chicago get a new lunch
item in United's economy and economy-plus seats _ a McDonald's
Chicken Caesar McSalad Shaker. The chicken and greens come in a
tall lidded plastic cup to which you add salad dressing. Then you
shake it yourself. The promotion _ which has some United flight
attendants worried that assembling salads for baffled passengers
will become another inflight chore _ ends June 7.
</P>
<P>
   More women are traveling on business _ and they're more likely
to fly in steerage than males. That's one of the findings in the
latest Runzheimer Reports on Travel Management, an industry
newsletter that surveys corporate travel managers. Among other
findings: Women, who now make up about 25 percent of all business
travelers, are most cost-conscious on the road, even though they're
on the employer's nickel. Also, women chose hotels with greater
care for safety and proximity to their destination, and tend to
make their arrangements further in advance.

HALF AND HALF DO NOT MAKE A WHOLE LOTTA BEER SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now anyone paying attention knows that we believe ``beer'' and
``fruit'' have about as much place together as do ``happily'' and
``married.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same goes for beer befouled by ginger ale. Which brings
us to Shandy Carib, a drink made and bottled in Trinidad. (See
www.caribbeer.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shandy'' is a generic term for a drink that is half beer and
half ginger ale, lemon-lime soda or lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   Now to beer drinkers, meaning people who like the taste and
aroma of beer, adding soda pop, or ginger ale or whatever to beer
is a sin akin to mixing single-malt scotch with Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   So what we have here is the Carib Brewery doing it for us. But,
then, how hard can it be?
</P>
<P>
   To answer this question, we mixed a quart of Old Milwaukee with
a quart of ginger ale. It took fewer than 10 seconds and the total
cost for this half-gallon of swill was about $2, compared with the
$7 for the six-pack of 12-ounce Shandy Carib, which has 1.2 percent
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Now keeping in mind that I drank this only because I get paid
to, I found the homemade shandy preferable. It was less sweet and
without the limey citrus taste of the Shandy Carib. The homemade
stuff had a better head. It lacked the deep amber color of the
Shandy Carib, but the bottled shandy doesn't come by its color
naturally. They add coloring. It says so on the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But the color and sweetness of Shandy Carib was a plus for
D'Licious Pink, a Milwaukee exile, friend, confidant and former
member of the Milwaukee Bucks' Energee! Dance Team.
</P>
<P>
   D'Licious went on to say she thought Shandy Carib was a beverage
that also might be appreciated by her sisters, D'Lightful and
D'Lovely.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to believe, but growing up in Milwaukee, the town
made famous by Schlitz, D'Licious had never tasted a beer, and
something that was even half-beer was a new drinking experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shandy's color is pretty,'' she said, ``and this is
something I could get into drinking at the beach or at a sports
party. It's light, and I'm not feeling the least bit woozy, which
happens easy to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might be something the guys could have on hand
while watching a game on the tube with their wives and girlfriends,
but not both at the same time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And so it seemed that D'Licious had unwittingly hit upon the
message of the day.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mix wives with girlfriends, and you don't mix beer
with soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   D'Licious gives Shandy Carib a 4 ``because it's pretty and it's
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   I give it a 1 for the same reasons.
</P>

UNEARTHING THE TRIVIA ON THE ROYAL FAMILY'S WEB   SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to peek at a family Web site crammed with murder,
treachery, blood-lust, centuries-long feuds, torture, insanity and
whole dungeons full of assorted other skeletons? The British
monarchy is just the ticket (www.royal.gov.uk).
</P>
<P>
   Not the current entries, of course. Since the royal family
entered cyberspace in 1997 to help satisfy the public's insatiable
curiosity, its official Web realm has compiled a ream's worth of
stars and garters, palaces and Plantagenets. But there is more on
the site about the two-penny Tyrian plum stamp of 1910 in the royal
philatelic collection than there is about Sarah Ferguson. (Only one
canceled copy of each is known to exist.)
</P>
<P>
   The pages devoted to Diana, Princess of Wales, are suitably
prominent, reverential and respectful. The pages detailing a
typical day in the life of the queen depict a very wealthy, very
earnest, very busy woman. But the mountains of minutiae seem to
highlight the omissions we are all aware of, and to make them more
poignant. Duty. Dedication. Few tears. Little joy.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Insight, the site's online magazine, highlights important
engagements of the month. It will not be mistaken for a tabloid.
(May's feature: visiting the Chelsea flower show.) There is enough
data about castles, remodeling, acreage, equerries, swan upping,
royal mews and queen's beasts to put even the most ardent
monarchist to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For the casual viewer _ could this site have any desperate ones?
_ here's a recommendation: Scan it quickly for the trivia. You will
unearth some gems:
</P>
<P>
   Prince William began his education at Mynor's Nursery School in
September 1985, at age 3.
</P>
<P>
   The last Welsh Prince of Wales was Llywelyn ap Gruffyd
(1246-82).
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's oldest child, Victoria, the Princess Royal, was the
mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II.
</P>
<P>
   The royal train has two locomotives. They are named Prince
William and Prince Henry.
</P>
<P>
   The royal stamp collection (beloved especially by George V)
includes what is believed to be the personal stamp album of the
murdered Czarevitch Aleksei, heir to the Russian throne. The
brightly illustrated child's album was stolen by a Bolshevik
soldier and sold to an employee of a British company in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia was the 83rd royal yacht.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth I attended the premiere of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   George III's interest in botany earned him the nickname Farmer
George. (No mention of the nicknames he was given on this side of
the pond.)
</P>
<P>
   The site also has some unintentionally funny writing. ``George
III is widely remembered for two things: losing the American
colonies and going mad. This is far from the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the royal site is the deep past, starting with
the Anglo-Saxon kings of Wessex. There are longer profiles of
notable monarchs like Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror,
Henry VIII (who wrote a best seller defending the Roman Catholic
Church, before all that marital unpleasantness changed things) and
Charles I (he stammered). As a capsule British history, the site
isn't bad, as long as you don't look for too much information on
how the common people lived.
</P>
<P>
   For incomparable mayhem, nothing beats the history of the
Scottish crown. Here is a sample from 962 to 1005: Dubh was killed
by Culen who was killed by Riderch, king of Strathclyde, whose
daughter he had seized. He was succeeded by Kenneth II, Dubh's
brother, who killed Culen's brother and was killed by Culen's son,
Constantine. Constantine's reign was short; he was killed, probably
by Kenneth III. Kenneth was killed and succeeded by Malcolm II.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of Britain isn't its pomp, but its language and its
ideals. The speeches of some of its monarchs ring out from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth I to her army on the eve of the Spanish Armada: ``I
know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart
and stomach of a king _ and of a king of England, too.''
</P>
<P>
   James I proclaims an attitude: ``Kings are justly called gods,
for that they exercise a manner of resemblance of divine power on
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Parliament at the time of the ``Glorious
Revolution'' of 1688, on the importance of making William and Mary
and future monarchs financially dependent on the legislative body:
``When princes have not needed money, they have not needed us.''

CRUISE IN THE CARIBBEAN? HOW ABOUT A WEEK IN LUNAR ORBIT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Gump's vacation-in-space ideas make activities like sky
diving or mountain climbing seem downright ho-hum. ``At an orbital
resort, you'd either have zero gravity or a low level of gravity,
which would be supplied by artificially spinning it,'' he said.
``So there are all sorts of amusements that could be created, such
as strapping on a pair of wings and flying around inside a giant
orbital or lunar structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump, the president of Lunacorp, a company that develops
technology and financing for space-related travel, is not alone,
but one of a surprising number of scientists, architects and
entrepreneurs who are developing concepts and designs for
accommodating tourists in space.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rockets to transport people safely and cheaply to
lower earth orbit and beyond have yet to be built, several
companies and organizations are preparing for the day when they
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bigelow, owner of Budget Suites of America, said he
planned to invest $500 million in the next 15 years toward the
building of a space hotel. Passengers would be launched from earth
via a rocket to meet a cruise ship orbiting the moon, he said. The
hotel would be able to handle 150 people and 50 crew members on a
seven-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   Working off the idea that passengers would eventually become
bored with weightlessness in orbit, and that they would want a
degree of gravity for things like taking a shower and eating at a
table, one architecture firm, Wimberly, Allison, Tong &AMP; Goo, based
in Honolulu, has developed a design for a space resort that
combines areas of artificial gravity with areas of weightlessness
for a more varied and comfortable trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seasoned travelers are not going to want to be Velcroed to a
wall when they go to sleep,'' said Howard Wolff, senior vice
president of the architectural firm. Wolff said the structure would
be built from tanks used in future space shuttle launchings, which
typically measure about 27 feet in diameter and 155 feet in length.
The tanks would connect from end to end like a string of hot dogs
and form a circle.
</P>
<P>
   The circle of tanks would rotate to create one quarter of the
earth's gravity at the outside, and the structure would also house
long, cylindrical walkways toward the center of the circle, similar
to the spokes of a wheel, that would lead passengers to an area of
zero gravity for activities in a weightless environment.
</P>
<P>
   Space tourism, however, depends on the development of a rocket
that can shuttle passengers cheaply and safely enough to sustain
the potential tourism industry. Indeed, Bigelow thinks that
building a space hotel might entice rocket manufacturers to build
the means of transporting guests to inhabit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that when our hotel is ready to be launched and
put in orbit that we have the launch capabilities,'' Bigelow said.
``We're very co-dependent on the launch community's success in
being able to provide good launchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-Prize, initiated a few years ago by a group of Missouri
investors to create a ``New Spirit of St. Louis,'' will award $10
million to the company that manufactures a rocket that successfully
transports three passengers into lower earth orbit
(www.xprize.org). The reusable launch vehicle must travel 62 miles
or higher above the earth and must be able to repeat the procedure
within 14 days of landing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Diamandis, the competition's founder and chairman, said
the prize was designed to encourage competition between rocket
companies, and to help them build awareness about the potential
market for sub-orbital flights. Once sub-orbital flights are
successful, he said, the potential for traveling into orbit and
eventually to the moon will open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue is raising the funds to build these
flights,'' said Diamandis. ``We developed this as the very first
step towards sub-orbital fights. The X-Prize vehicle's required
velocity is Mach 5, whereas a space shuttle requires Mach 25, so
we've chosen the lowest first hurdle.'' More than 10 companies are
competing for the prize.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to developers who are designing structures for space
travel, several universities, like George Washington University and
the University of Southern California, have introduced classes that
address elements of the burgeoning space tourism industry, classes
like space policy, architecture and the sociology of space travel.
The Space Tourism Society, founded in 1995, has a Web site at
www.space-tourism-society.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out into space is not a natural thing for humanity,''
said Madhu Thangavelu, a space architect who teaches courses in
building space habitats at the University of Southern California in
Los Angeles. ``When you're removed from gravity, you're not used to
functioning with that force gone out of you. How do we keep people
happy under these constraints?''
</P>
<P>
   Until the space resorts _ and the means to get to them _ come to
fruition, several companies, including Space Adventures, based in
Reston, Va., offer real, but somewhat limited, space travel
vacations. For $5,400, a space enthusiast can fly to Moscow and
board the Ilyushin-76, a zero-gravity training jet used by the
Russian Space Agency to prepare cosmonauts for space travel, and
$12,600 will buy a trip on a Mig 25 fighter that soars to an
altitude of 82,000 feet, giving passengers a view of the curvature
of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   For $699, another company, Space Camp, has five-day programs for
children in Alabama, Florida and California, or a weekend program
for a parent and child for $658 (www.spacecamp.com).
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Dalton, marketing director at Space Adventures, said the
company has taken 140 reservations for suborbital flights for when
a reusable launch vehicle comes to market.

   BUSH-SOCIAL-SECURITY (Washington) _ In laying out his Social
Security plan, George W. Bush talks about federal workers' private
investment accounts and suggests Vice President Al Gore is
hypocritical in denying them to the general public. But federal
workers don't get anything special. They pay comparable payroll
taxes for retirement and like 32 million other American workers,
they have a 401(k)-type investment plan. A Bush spokesman says the
candidate brought up the point only to counter Gore's suggestion
that stock market investing is ``risky.'' A News Analysis. By DAN

   GAO-STUDY (Washington) _ A Government Accounting Office study
last year concluded that privatization of the Galveston County

Gore is pointing to the study in its argument against the Social
Security investment accounts proposed by Republican George W. Bush.

NET PAWNSHOPS SAY THEY'RE JUST THE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snob that I am, I never thought I would consider buying a Norman
Rockwell collector's plate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I never thought that I would consider buying
something from a pawnbroker, either. Until last week, in fact, my
knowledge of the profession was limited to the movies. If you ever
want to feel really hopeless for two hours, find a video of ``The
Pawnbroker,'' with Rod Steiger. In the title role, Steiger conducts
business from behind the metal bars of a security cage as
desperate, lonely customers offer him their meager possessions _
cheap candlesticks, an old radio, a wristwatch _ in exchange for
quick cash.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that none of that misery was evident last week on
Pawnbroker.com, a new site that acts as an online clearinghouse for
the wares of about 600 pawnshops across the country. With its clean
interface, straightforward query box for searches and inventory of
75,000 items organized into 10 categories, the site looks as
sanitized as any other used-goods emporium online. But you can
understand why I shied away from anything resembling candlesticks,
radios or wristwatches as I examined the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As in a typical pawnshop, much of the merchandise fell into the
category of Jewelry/Gemstones, with thousands of rings, watches and
necklaces at prices ranging from a few dollars to $125,000 for an
emerald-cut diamond. The category with the smallest selection was
Vehicles, which last week consisted of three motorcycles with
asking prices ranging from $3,500 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: Unlike most offline pawnshops, Pawnbroker.com
sells no firearms.
</P>
<P>
   I found the Norman Rockwell plate under
Antiques/Collectibles/Art. Issued as a limited edition plate titled
``Santa's Golden Gift'' to commemorate Christmas 1987, it was on
sale for $30.95 (negotiable).
</P>
<P>
   What tempted me was not the apple-cheeked Santa. No, I was
thinking more of the investment possibilities. After years of being
scorned by the art establishment, Rockwell's wholesome
freckles-and-pigtails style is suddenly on the verge of becoming
trendy. Last fall, a national exhibition of his paintings and
Saturday Evening Post covers began traveling to art museums in
major cities. I figured that before the exhibition reaches the
Guggenheim Museum next year, it might be wise to snap up a plate at
pre-Manhattan prices.
</P>
<P>
   As I read the item's description (``plate measures about 8
inches across''), it seemed I didn't have much to lose. Where else
was I going to put my money last week, tech stocks? And if I
guessed wrong, I could always serve dinner on the plate and plop
some mashed potatoes on Santa's twinkly eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to click on the button that said Negotiate, which
would prompt a software program to dicker with me within price
limits set by the pawnbroker who owned the plate. But I hesitated,
considering the tragedy of the person who had pawned the plate in
exchange for quick cash, back in the days before it was OK to like
Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Would I be profiting from someone else's misfortune? To find
out, I phoned Pawnbroker.com's chief executive, Neil McElwee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, unfortunately, are suffering from the same
Hollywood-based stereotype as the rest of the 90 percent of the
public that doesn't go into a pawnshop,'' McElwee said. ``In
September, we did focus groups all around the country, where we
tested attitudes and found all of the stereotypes. People said they
were afraid of being ripped off, afraid of what would happen if a
neighbor sees me.''
</P>
<P>
   For 3,000 years, pawnbrokers have had to combat those
prejudices, McElwee said. ``But what is unique about the pawnbroker
model, how it works, is that it provides a service. The pawnbroker
gets merchandise from people who really were looking for short-term
loans because they have to pay the taxes or something. Seventy to
80 percent of those items are reclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   No money for taxes? The more I heard, the sadder it sounded.
</P>
<P>
   McElwee assured me that focus group participants softened their
attitudes after they heard about the good deals available on
Pawnbroker.com _ he said the site generally sold items for no more
than 40 percent of their retail value.
</P>
<P>
   But I decided to look around for another source of Rockwell
plates. Faster than you could say, ``Is that a real Richard
Diebenkorn painting?'' I found ``Santa's Golden Gift'' for sale on
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I found a number of identical listings on eBay: for a
camera, binoculars and a harmonica. Each sold for less than the
asking price on Pawnbroker.com (on eBay, the Rockwell plate sold
for $6.50).
</P>
<P>
   For all I knew, the eBay listings could have been for the same
items as the ones on Pawnbroker.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pawnbrokers are selling everything under $50 that they can
possibly post on eBay,'' McElwee said. ``But they have a devil of a
time selling anything over $150 because in a consumer-to-consumer
model like that, you have no idea whether what you are buying is
authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike eBay's ``buyer beware'' policy, which the online auction
company overrode last week in canceling the notorious $135,805 sale
of an abstract painting that may or may not have been the work of
the artist Richard Diebenkorn, Pawnbroker.com offers some
insurance. Buyers can get a refund for up to 10 days after
receiving a purchased item in the mail, no questions asked, McElwee
said. That's plenty of time to seek an appraisal from, say, a
qualified Rockwell plate expert.
</P>
<P>
   So where did I buy the plate? After seeing the lackadaisical
bidding on eBay, I passed it up because I decided, in the end, that
buying tech stocks might be a better investment. However, I am
seriously considering another item on Pawnbroker.com: the Franklin
Mint's medal for the inauguration of President Richard M. Nixon and
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in 1973. It's $199.

`MAMA' PRESERVES HER BUSINESS BY KEEPING IT SMALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't bother to look for Mama's Best jams and jellies on the
Internet. Helen Beauchamp _ the owner, chief cook, marketing
executive and the ``Mama'' referred to on the label _ says she's
thought about it, but decided she doesn't want her enterprise to
get much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Durant, still work off two gas stoves on
the converted back porch of their modest brick home in Millsap,
Texas. They've been there more than 30 years, the past 10 or so in
the canning business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started making the jams and jellies, a man told
me to not let it get too big,'' she said. ``I think he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, it's hard enough just to keep up, let alone
expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could get out of it now if I wanted to,'' she
said with a laugh. ``I've added an apricot-peach jam, and I still
do a lot of jalapeno jelly. I have one man who comes from Dallas to
buy the jalapeno jelly, and he sends it to Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp ships her products to several countries. She has
packed it off to 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the marketing is simply word of mouth. Beauchamp does
sell her Mama's Best line at Weatherford's First Monday market and
at the Weatherford Public Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lady come to the last First Monday and tell me she had
to try my mesquite bean jelly,'' Beauchamp said. ``She hadn't
tasted it before, but she said she was in an elevator in Fort Worth
with a man who kept looking at his watch and saying he had to get
to the Weatherford market before it closed so he could get some
mesquite bean jelly. The woman said he was in such a hurry, she had
to try some, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp does take orders at her home. She'll ship her jams,
jellies, picante sauce and chow-chow anywhere UPS goes. She takes
the order over the phone, calls UPS, and then depends on her
customers to mail in their checks when the products arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been pretty honest, so far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chow-chow is still her biggest seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I started out with,'' she said. ``When we are
making chow-chow, we grind up 100 pounds of cabbage at a time,
sometimes 150 pounds. The next day we put it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes Helen and Durant both to keep up. She makes the
chow-chow, he puts the lids on and screws down the tops.
</P>
<P>
   During their busiest season _ the summer _ she gets away from
the canning process only on Sundays and on Monday mornings, when
``I have my hair done.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other time, the couple can be found in their kitchen,
cooking on the two gas stoves, or straining syrup from fruit, or
filling jars or making preparations for the next day's work.
</P>
<P>
   The Mama's Best label is placed on pint jars of picante sauce,
chow-chow, bread and butter pickles, and pickled beets. There are
also jams and jellies made from blackberries, peaches, pears, wild
plums, apricots, wild mustang grapes, wild hog plums and possum
grapes (winter grapes), and watermelon rind preserves.
</P>
<P>
   They also make apple butter.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp says the continuing Texas drought has affected her
business this season. ``We were trying to raise tomatoes and
peppers for chow-chow,'' she said. ``But the drought has been bad.
My son grew some onions that had roots 12 inches long. I guess they
were going down for water, I never saw such roots in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual peach crop is still questionable. Beauchamp's biggest
selling weekend comes during the Parker County Peach Festival in
July. Some customers make the festival their once-a-year trip to
buy Mama's Best, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mama's Best products can be ordered by calling Beauchamp at
(940) 682-4914.

CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE MAY DROP `CONFEDERATE' FROM NAME OF VINTAGE
PLANE GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CONFEDERATE-NAME) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lore has it that a practical joker _ no one has ever said who _
in 1957 painted the words ``Confederate Air Force'' on a P-51
Mustang owned by a group of men in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the name got a laugh. But in the America of today,
the joke doesn't go over as well. Just about anything asssociated
with Johnny Reb tends to incite controversy, even though the modern
aviation buffs have nothing to do with the War Between the States.
</P>
<P>
   So the Confederate Air Force, now with 8,500 members who
preserve a shrinking inventory of World War II warbirds, is
considering changing its name to defuse what some contend is a
growing public relations problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, it's going to take corporate support'' to
keep the planes flying, said V. Neils Agather, a Dallas businessman
and one of 11 board members of the CAF. ``But the very first thing
you do when you meet with a CEO is explain why you have that name.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it's easier to change the name. It
doesn't describe our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing the name will be hard, mainly because the Midland-based
group wrote its bylaws to make it so. Any alteration in bylaws
requires the votes of nine of the 11 board members and 75 percent
of the voting members. The board is expected to vote in July
whether to send the proposal to the full membership.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of changing the name acknowledge that they have to
persuade some members who see it as caving in to political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is clearly a move within the organization to
consider Ghost Squadron, Commemorative Air Force or some less
controversial name. A similar idea was talked about among board
members in the early 1970s, but it never went to a vote. The idea
came up again last year _ this time by rank-and-file members _
during one of the group's annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose the name. It has meaning to the membership,''
Marvin Wood, a retiree and member of the Dallas-Fort Worth CAF
unit, said. ``Still, if you want to maintain your membership or get
new members, you're going to have to follow what's happening. And
looking at the atmosphere of the country right now, it's probably a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate Air Force has about 140 airplanes that flew
during World War II, including the B-24 Liberator, the P-38
Lightning and the only B-29 Superfortress still flying. CAF units
scattered around the country, staffed only by volunteer members,
fly in dozens of air shows, make special appearances and
occasionally get parts in Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   The CAF also operates the American Airpower Heritage Museum in
Midland, Texas. The group's motto is ``Lest we forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be expensive to fly an airplane that is almost 60 years
old. For example, the B-29, nicknamed Fifi for Agather's mother,
costs $5,000 an hour to fly. At least half the costs to keep the
planes flying is borne by CAF members, with perhaps 30 percent
coming from money made selling T-shirts and caps at air shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the CAF's membership is aging _ the average is now 60. In a
few years, leaders have said, money will have to come from sources
other than just members. And so far, many corporations have shied
from linking their products with the word ``Confederate.''
</P>
<P>
   Agather said even the Pentagon withdrew an offer for the CAF to
appear at an event for fear of a public relations problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations have been reluctant to provide monetary support
for that very reason,'' said Bob Rice, the CAF's executive
director. ``Anyway, the name is not reflective of the mission of
the organization. We should spend more of our time talking about
what the organization accomplishes, rather than having to explain
why we're called the Confederate Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Haddock, president and CEO of Fina, a major sponsor of the
CAF, has told the group's leaders that he would like the name
changed, although he said he doesn't want it to appear that he's
pressuring the CAF.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock said he hasn't had complaints from anyone within Fina,
but he has heard from people outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it from people in the community I work with in
other activities,'' Haddock said yesterday from his office in the
Dallas suburb of Plano. ``I've been questioned about our support
for a group called the Confederate Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an impression in the minds of many segments of our
society that is not consistent with the objectives and the mission
of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cole, a history professor at the University of Texas
at Arlington, said it's understandable why corporations might be
reluctant to be identified with a group with that name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing the name ``Confederate'' in 1957 clearly reflects a
stance on race relations that I can see people not wanting to
identify themselves with today,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Agather, whose father rescued the B-29 for the CAF many years
ago, said he doesn't think the group's founders gave much thought
to the name or how it would be viewed generations later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sensitive'' to concerns about changing, he said. ``But at
the end of the day, you have to ask, `What is reality?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the reality is, there is a lack of support out there for
the name.''

CAKE IN A JAR? YES, YOU CAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clara Doshier of Fort Worth saw our request for cakes baked in a
jar and sent the spice cake version. Joan Hallford of North
Richland Hills, Texas, sent in the chocolate version.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Strittmatter has made cakes in a jar, and here's her take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by the premise and made a batch. I discovered
it was novel but way too labor-intensive for my taste. It was a lot
of work without a great deal to show for it. Canning is an exacting
practice no matter what you can _ cakes or tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered something that I liked much better _ `cookie mix
in a jar.' It's simple to do, and it doesn't heat up your kitchen.
They make great gifts, and they're pretty, too.'' She contributed
the recipe for sand art brownies.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SPICE CAKE IN A JAR

</P>
<P>
   Bake exactly 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove jars one at a time and quickly screw lid on each jar. Let
sit until cool, and store. When you use canning jar lids, this cake
has a shelf life of at least three months.

   Requests:

<P>
   A reader e-mails a request for blackberry jam cake.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader would like a recipe that ran years ago in the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram. My predecessor, Joanne Vachule, couldn't
find the recipe in her files but does recall that it ran. The
recipe is for Lucille's chili biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille B. Smith made the biscuits commercially for years _ a
``bowl of red'' in biscuit form.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn King of Springtown, Texas, recalls a dish she used to
make called salmon pie. Clipped from the Star-Telegram, probably in
the mid-1960s, the dish had a double pie crust and was filled with
canned salmon, rice and, she thinks, frozen chopped broccoli. A
cheese sauce made from canned Cheddar cheese soup was served over
the pie when it was sliced.

`CONFEDERATE' NAME SLIPPING IN POPULARITY AS VIEWS CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CLAASSEN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New businesses and groups rarely use it, but owners of some
older places proudly keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and civic groups with the word ``Confederate'' in
their names are as rare in Texas today as Civil War artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, for example, eight businesses and other
organizations with ``Confederate'' in their names have registered
with the Tarrant County clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes a glass company, home builder and
window-cleaning company. But most of those appear to be defunct,
and none is listed in phone books.
</P>
<P>
   Some long-standing businesses, including a steel company and a
restaurant in Houston, hold on to ``Confederate'' with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tough word to use in almost any new business
name,'' said Mike Carr, co-owner of the Name Stormers, a business
consulting company near Austin that helps people find names for
their companies, products and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so clearly associated with one event in history that it's
hard to overcome that meaning, anywhere in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 20 companies with names including ``Confederate''
that are listed with the Texas secretary of state's office are not
in phone directories or could not be reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Confederate Steel Corp. in Houston, however, the word is a
source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any problems, and we've had this name for 38
years,'' company President Clayton Underwood said.
</P>
<P>
   New owners of the Confederate House Restaurant, a 52-year-old
landmark on Houston's west side, said they struggled with their
decision to keep the original name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a concerted effort to let our customers know that by
no means are we agreeing with the negative aspects of the
Confederate era, but instead are paying homage to the former owner,
Gordon Edge; and his family history,'' general manager Thomas Leman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edge's ancestors fought for the Confederacy, and the restaurant
has artifacts from the Confederate and Union armies, Leman said.

WITH ENEMIES LIKE THESE, DOES THE NRA NEED FRIENDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't mind saying that I was worried about the Million Mom
March.
</P>
<P>
   As a supporter of the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep
and bear arms, I feared that the anti-gun demonstration on Mothers
Day could ignite a grassroots furor for new gun-control laws _
including some that might be drastic and unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   As a supporter of George W. Bush's presidential campaign, I
feared that the Texas governor/Republican nominee-to-be might be
perceived as too supportive of gun rights by a massive army of
nonpartisan moms mobilizing in a sincere commitment to making our
country safer.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the march is over, I can see that my concerns were
unfounded. The Million Mom March was not a nonpartisan, grassroots
movement organized to support ``common-sense'' laws that would
promote gun safety. It was an overhyped dog-and-pony show organized
by gun-hating liberals for the purpose of promoting Al Gore's
presidential campaign and putting more Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If the march and the ensuing rally had lived up to its billing,
Mother's Day 2000 might have gone down in history as the day that
the long-standing battle over gun rights was removed from the arena
of partisan politics. As it turned out, the march might mark the
day that the anti-gun crowd became as politically and socially
marginalized as its archenemy, the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA and some of its goofy spokesmen have often made it
difficult for reasonable people to be on their side. If ever there
was a collection of folks who don't know when to shut up, it's the
pro-gun activists who send the likes of Wayne LaPierre out into the
world to argue their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Even the once universally admired Charlton Heston has turned
into a babbling idiot, spouting NRA propaganda with the conviction
of Moses handing down the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   But how lucky can they get? Just as LaPierre and Heston dig a
hole so deep that it looks like the Second Amendment will never
crawl out of it, along comes the Million Mom March with a pair of
spokespeople who make these guys sound like great communicators.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Donna Dees-Thomases, the New Jersey woman who
conjured up the whole idea of a Million Mom March. Asked Monday if
her Million Mom March ``action committees'' would be endorsing
political candidates, Dees-Thomases said she didn't know and then
proceeded to endorse Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   She had only scorn for Bush's plan to offer free trigger locks
to gun owners. This common-sense proposal to promote gun safety
must require more common sense than Dees-Thomases can muster.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Rosie O'Donnell, who presided over the Million
Mom rally and helped lead the crowd in clever chants such as
``Time-out chair for Wayne LaPierre, time-out chair for Wayne
LaPierre ...''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Ellen Goodman recently described O'Donnell as ``mentor
and emcee, adviser and starshine'' for the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's frequent pronouncements on the gun issue have made
it clear that she has no interest in common-sense proposals to
promote gun safety. She believes that the federal government should
do whatever it takes to eliminate guns from society.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd, doesn't it, that an entertainer who makes her
living shooting off her mouth and thus must cherish the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States would have no
use whatsoever for the Second Amendment?
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad, actually, that the Million Mom March turned out to
be a sham. Many _ maybe even most _ of the participants were
sincere and were led to believe that they had signed up for
something meaningful, something that would have lasting value.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that America's legions of concerned, caring moms
really could make a difference if they came together in a
legitimate, nonpartisan movement dedicated to making their families
safer through sensible measures to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Million Mom March was just politics. We didn't need more
politics.

THE AWARD EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE

(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For die-hard theatergoers _ the kind of devoted fans who gnawed
their cuticles over the battle between ``Dreamgirls'' and ``Nine''
in 1982, or agonized over which actor from ``Two Trains Running,''
Laurence Fishburne or Roscoe Lee Browne, to root for in 1992, or
pulled for ``Pacific Overtures'' to upset the popular favorite, ``A
Chorus Line,'' in 1976 _ the Tony Awards have been as exciting as
the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   And here it is again, that theatrical rite of spring: Tony time,
when this season's actors, directors, playwrights, choreographers
and designers get to enjoy their brief anointed status as nominees,
and producers can salivate about the prospect of being able to
plaster ``Best Musical'' or ``Best Play'' above the titles of their
shows and hear their box office cash registers go ka-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Many theater professionals say the Tony Awards are a prestigious
prize that celebrates Broadway's talent and sells Broadway shows,
and that the awards' marketing power is potent, particularly on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   But these same professionals concede that Tony season has also
become an annual opportunity for carping and soul-searching within
the industry, not only about the theater but also about the Tonys
themselves. This year, the debates seem to point to a fundamental
shift in the conception of what constitutes live theater on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether ``Contact,'' a dance show with no
singing or live music, should be considered a musical goes to the
heart of a larger question about the direction of the American
musical. The three other shows besides ``Contact'' nominated for
best musical this year also defy conventional definitions. ``James
Joyce's `The Dead,''' which recently closed, is a play in which the
characters sing Irish songs for one another at a Christmas party.
``Swing!'' is a dance revue that mixes classic swing music with new
pastiche pieces. And Michael John LaChiusa's ``Wild Party,'' like
his other new musical this season, ``Marie Christine,'' features
virtually no dialogue at all, blurring the lines between musical
theater and opera.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this year's Tony Awards suggest a rejection of the
traditional book musical, given that Disney's ``Aida'' was not
nominated for best musical, although it received five other
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The nominators were apparently hard pressed to fill out the
category for best musical revival, nominating ``Tango Argentino,''
a dance show, which has closed, and ``Jesus Christ Superstar,''
which received almost universally poor reviews, in addition to Cole
Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and Meredith Willson's ``Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Tony nominating committee resigned this year.
A.R. Gurney, the playwright, said he resigned because he was not
permitted to abstain from the vote on whether Mandy Patinkin should
be nominated for best actor in a musical. Patinkin had been absent
from the performance Gurney attended of ``The Wild Party.'' ``I
just didn't think it was fair to vote for or against him if I
hadn't seen him,'' Gurney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater
Development Fund, resigned over objections to ``Contact's'' being
considered a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Some nominators expressed frustration that they were unable to
award something special to the two actors who alternate roles in
``True West,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. Even
though the nominators had taken the trouble to see both versions of
the production, they said they were forced to vote for best actor
based only on the play's opening night casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both superb and they both share the play,'' said
Frances Sternhagen, the actress, who serves on the nominating
committee. ``So why do we have to have this rule?
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater so needs a boost that you don't want to be
difficult,'' Sternhagen continued. ``But it's just so hard when you
want to give credit where credit is due.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tonys this year also had to grapple with the notion of what
is a Broadway show. For example, ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour'' and
``Jackie Mason: Much Ado About Everything'' were deemed ineligible
despite their popularity with audiences. One way the Tony
administrators have handled unorthodox shows is to give them
special Tony Awards, as they did this year with ``Dame Edna.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations this year also speak to the dearth of new
writing on Broadway. Two revivals _ ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and ``The
Music Man'' _ led the nominations, with 12 and eight respectively.
Two of the four productions nominated for best new play are
actually old, though they are new to Broadway: ``True West'' by Sam
Shepard was originally produced Off Broadway in 1980, and ``The
Ride Down Mt. Morgan'' by Arthur Miller was first produced in
London in 1991. Similarly, Noel Coward's ``Waiting in the Wings''
is eligible for consideration as best new play because it has never
before been on Broadway, even though it was written in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Despite various complaints about the selection process, most
people associated with New York theater agree that the Tonys are no
more problematic than any other awards show in which an industry
honors itself.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many other theater awards given out around
this time _ the Outer Critics Circle Awards, the Obies, the Drama
Desk Awards and the Drama League Awards _ producers say the Tonys
are the only ones that sell tickets. Winning best musical or best
play, they say, means money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a Tony is a powerful calling card,'' said Rocco
Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Added Emanuel Azenberg, the producer: ``It's industry-created to
hype an industry. And in that it succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is that industry these days? Since Broadway has
become dominated by revivals and British imports, is some of the
best work happening elsewhere? And what exactly are the Tony Awards
intended for? To honor the best of New York theater generally, or
to promote Broadway specifically?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the League of American Theaters and Producers, the
national trade organization for the commercial theater industry,
which presents the Tony Awards with the American Theater Wing,
established a long-range planning committee to examine the future
of the league, including Tony matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the thinking stage on all this right now,'' said
Elizabeth I. McCann, a longtime producer who serves on the
committee. ``You have to look at the season as it plays itself out.
You can't force it into rigid rules that were created when theater
was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like an impartial panel of three people who would view
the situation and make recommendations to the committee based on
this season on Broadway,'' McCann continued. ``Why jam `Riverdance'
into the category of best musical when it is really basically a
dance revue?'' The show had been termed eligible by the Tony
administration committee, though it did not receive a nomination
from the Tony nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   When producers want to get actors or shows considered for
certain Tony nominations, they must petition the Tony
administration committee. This year the producers of ``True West''
petitioned to have Hoffman and Reilly considered jointly so they
would not compete against each other for a nomination in the
leading actor category. The request was denied. In another case,
the producers of ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' asked that Roy
Dotrice, who plays the heroine's father, be considered in the
featured actor rather than the leading actor category. That request
was granted.

 &HT;    TECH VISAS BILL TAKES ANOTHER STEP ALONG A TWISTING PATH
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. companies would be able to hire an unlimited
number of highly skilled foreign workers under a bill the House
Judiciary Committee approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But final approval of the plan to raise the visa ceiling, backed
by industry, President Clinton and most members of Congress, is
being complicated by attempts to attach unrelated amendments to the
popular legislation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton wants to use the legislation as a way to
grant ``amnesty'' to as many as 2 million illegal foreigners
already living in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wants to use it as a vehicle to
carry campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to add freight to the visa locomotive is slowing
it down, much to the frustration of high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not helpful,'' said Thom Stohler, a lobbyist with the
American Electronics Association, a tech trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stohler remains hopeful that Congress will expand the
so-called H-1B visas. ``It's not going to be easy, but in the end,
we'll get a bill that increases the H-1B cap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it's not clear how that will happen amid all of
the political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, high-tech employers can hire only 115,000
foreign workers this fiscal year using H-1B visas, which are good
for six years. The H-1B cap falls to 107,500 in 2001 and 65,000 a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   But high-tech employers say the demand is far greater for
skilled workers, such as computer programmers and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem, then, that they would be thrilled with
Wednesday's vote for a bill that would let employers hire all the
temporary foreign help they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, also would
impose new rules on businesses. For example, a company would have
to pay an H-1B worker at least $40,000 a year, and would have to
show that it has raised median salaries for all workers in the past
year. Most high-tech executives adamantly oppose such salary
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite industry objections, the Judiciary Committee voted 18-11
to approve Smith's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The approval came only after committee chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., joined Smith in resisting an ``amnesty'' amendment that
Democrats wanted. The amendment would have given anyone who arrived
illegally in this country before 1986 the ability to apply for
legal residency. Under current law, only illegal immigrants who
arrived before 1972 may seek legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Smith bill must go to the House Rules Committee, where
it will face new challenges. There, committee chairman Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif, has a competing visa bill backed by the high-tech
industry and numerous Democrats, such as Reps. Lloyd Doggett of
Texas and Zoe Lofgren of California.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreier bill would limit high-tech immigration to 200,000
visas a year, but would put fewer restrictions on businesses. The
Rules Committee could end up substituting the Dreier bill for the
Smith bill.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's vote, Lofgren, the primary backer of amnesty,
said her amendment could yet get tacked on to Dreier's visa
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She added that Smith's bill has gotten as far as it has only
because the GOP leadership has wanted to show deference to Smith.
But now, she said, those Republican leaders must ask themselves:
``Do they want a bill that everyone hates?''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted GOP leaders would make sure the Dreier-Lofgren
bill reaches the House floor for a vote, not the Smith measure.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the legislation takes shape, it ultimately would
have to be reconciled with a Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   And things are complicated over on the Senate side as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's version of the visa bill, sponsored by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would increase H-1B visas
to 195,000 through 2002. But that bill is having trouble getting to
the floor for a vote, in part because Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
wants to maintain the right to add his campaign finance bill to the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republican backers of the Hatch bill want to limit
amendments to five each for Democrats and Republicans. Such a limit
likely would preclude an unrelated measure, such as campaign
finance reform. Democrats have resisted the GOP limits, saying that
while they support consideration of the Hatch bill, they want to
preserve their right to offer any amendment to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement limiting amendments, GOP supporters of
expanded visas may try to get the measure moving by attaching it to
digital signatures legislation or to a bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., has said he
disapproves of such maneuvers, so it's not clear how the Senate
will proceed on H-1B visas.

 NEW YORK: was granted.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such efforts notwithstanding, Jed Bernstein, president of the
league, said the process generally worked. ``It's easy to take
potshots at individual rules and individual outcomes,'' he said.
``But once you start to understand the ultimate goal _ that there
ought to be a level playing field _ whether it's right or wrong, at
least it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some producers beg to differ. Since 1994, Roy Gabay has
produced, or been general manager for, three Pulitzer Prize-winning
plays _ ``Three Tall Women,'' ``How I Learned to Drive'' and
``Wit'' _ all Off Broadway, none Tony eligible. ``That to me is
wrong,'' Gabay said. ``I don't understand how that can be, that
plays that were honored for excellence in the theater are not
eligible for an excellence award.''
</P>
<P>
   The Off Broadway industry itself has in the past resisted the
idea of becoming Tony-eligible because of logistical and financial
obstacles. Trying to get all the Tony voters into the multitude of
small Off Broadway houses to see every production would be almost
impossible. In addition, it could drive up the costs of producing,
due to the loss of revenue that would result from having to give
away seats to Tony voters, and because the unions might then demand
Broadway rates _ or at least a higher wage scale _ for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater executives suggested creating a few Off Broadway
Tony Awards and appointing a special Off Broadway Tony committee so
that every voter would not have to see every Off Broadway show. ``I
don't know if it's feasible,'' said Daryl Roth, an Off Broadway
producer who has also produced on Broadway. ``But it feels like the
right thing to do and where we're heading.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Off Broadway productions are excluded from the Tonys,
Roth said they miss out on national exposure during the Tony Awards
show. This is particularly critical to productions that can barely
afford their own marketing. Broadway producers often counter that
Off Broadway has its own prizes. But others say these do not have
the prestige of the Tonys in terms of what they can do for a show's
fortunes and a performer's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careers change when they get a Tony Award,'' said Virginia P.
Louloudes, the executive director of the Alliance of Resident
Theaters/New York, a service group for nonprofit theaters. ``And
God knows, the actors deserve the recognition. So do the directors
and designers.''
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to, it seems, is what the Tonys are really
about. ``If the point of the awards is to promote Broadway, then
keeping Off Broadway out of the awards is appropriate,'' said Todd
Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, an Off
Broadway house that also produces on Broadway. ``If the point is to
award excellence in the theater in the New York metropolitan area,
then to keep Off Broadway out is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadway executives say the Tony is not an equal-opportunity
perk; it is reserved for those foolhardy enough and financially
able to gamble on Broadway. Big risks, this argument goes, deserve
the biggest potential reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business is going to give away its franchise for nothing,''
said Landesman, the producer. ``Would Rolls-Royce say, `Here's our
emblem, go put it on a Chevy?' I don't see why we're expected to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabay said the major flaw of the Tonys was who rules on
eligibility. ``You're looking at people with completely vested
interests,'' he said about the 24 members of the Tony
administration committee. ``It's not a group of people who can make
a fair decision. They are theater owners, they are producers. Why
would I want `Wit' to be eligible when I'm producing `Art' or `The
Beauty Queen of Leenane'?''
</P>
<P>
   Gabay said that when a producer appears before the
administration committee to argue his case, as he has, the deck is
stacked. ``You feel like you're just going through the motions,''
he said, ``because it's completely political in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers who serve on the committee defend the selection
process, saying, essentially, welcome to the real world. ``Is it
any different in this industry from the television industry or the
recording industry or the film industry?'' asked Barry Weissler,
who, with his wife, Fran, has produced several of Broadway's
biggest hit revivals. ``It's the same. Everyone has
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Azenberg, the producer, said, the Tonys make no
pretense of being about which artist or project is better than
another; it isn't like winning a track meet because you ran the
fastest. ``We have an artificial competition,'' he said. ``Shows
don't compete. It's just a subjective choice between people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, of the league, pointed out that many of those who
criticize certain rules are not prepared to present viable
alternatives. Some people in the industry, for example, have
objected to considering ``True West'' a new production because,
although it was written in 1980 and produced Off Broadway, the play
has never been produced on Broadway. But then, Bernstein asked,
what does the definition of a new play become? A production that
was never done in New York City but might have been done in
Connecticut or New Jersey? A play that has never been given an
``important production''? And if that is the case, what defines
important?
</P>
<P>
   As to what constitutes a musical, that appears to be up for
grabs these days. With shows like ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' ``Fosse,''
``Riverdance,'' ``Swing!,'' ``Contact'' and ``James Joyce's `The
Dead''' stretching the boundaries of a traditional book musical, it
is hard to know what a musical is anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater professionals suggested creating more specific
categories, along the lines of London's Olivier Awards or
Hollywood's Golden Globes _ like Tonys for best solo performance or
best entertainment _ though this would mean more to squeeze into
the already crowded broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who argue that there are not enough voters
with the appropriate expertise in each category, like craftspeople
who can judge design. But critics of this idea caution that the
voting pool is already bloated and adding voters is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are too many people voting,'' Azenberg said.
``You can't get a lifetime franchise by producing one play. Some of
us still want to be judged by our peers.'' He said he had given
Tony voters $125,000 worth of tickets to ``The Iceman Cometh,''
which he produced last year in a limited run starring Kevin Spacey
(who was also a producer of the play). ``If I'm going to do a play
for 12 to 14 weeks, that's giving away 25 percent of the potential
profit if the play is successful,'' Azenberg said. (``Iceman''
orchestra tickets were $100.)
</P>
<P>
   With increasing numbers of new people dabbling in Broadway, ``it
will get out of hand,'' he warned. ``It IS out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the league stepped up its enforcement of a policy
mandating that only producers who have produced a show in the
previous four years could remain active members and therefore have
a Tony vote, though they may retain their league membership _ a
decision that angered several voters, about 30 of whom have drafted
a complaint against the league that has been sent out to members of
the group for approval. This reduced the number of Tony voters from
825 to 705, a figure that will jump slightly, because the league
recently lengthened the required time period within which someone
must have produced to six years and decided to create a new
lifetime membership category for inactive theater veterans to honor
their service.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are still a lot of voters, each of whom is
entitled to a pair of tickets per show, which amounts to a
potential loss of about $100,000 for each production. Moreover,
many producers complain that some voters give their tickets away
but cast their votes nonetheless _ a violation of rules that
producers nevertheless feel unable to enforce without alienating
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be offensive and cost myself a vote,'' Gabay
said. ``Will they get really annoyed and not vote for me if I put
the screws in?''
</P>
<P>
   When the Tonys were created by the American Theater Wing in
1947, the ceremony took place at the Waldorf-Astoria. The award
consisted of a scroll and women got a monogrammed sterling silver
compact; men a cigarette lighter or an engraved gold money clip.
Some people miss the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the intimacy and the feeling of family in the ballroom
that we had then,'' said Isabelle Stevenson, chairwoman of the
American Theater Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson makes no secret of her belief that the Tonys have
become too concerned with commercial interests. ``The Tony Award
was created to reward excellence in the theater,'' she said.``There
was no thought of it being of economic value.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be blind to the fact that it is an important
economic boost to the theater. On the other hand, it cannot become
just that. The commitment to excellence must remain. You cannot use
it only as an economic marketing tool.''

&HT;     PRESIDENT SKIPS EVENTS TO BACK FIRST LADY'S CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ President Clinton broke two engagements to be by
his wife's side when she officially became the state Democratic
Party's nominee for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The lame-duck president's decision to attend the New York
Democratic convention Tuesday night came after days of uncertainty
over whether he would join her on what was undoubtedly one of the
most important nights of her life, not to mention her new political
career.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife addressed more than 11,000 delegates in Albany,
Clinton sat quietly on the stage with retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and other top Democrats. But in a party given by state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope, he explained his last-minute
decision and gave a speech of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that before they knew when his wife would speak, he
had already committed to attending a dinner for the Mexican
American Legal Defense Fund and a campaign event for the Senate
Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said he finally canceled the MALDF event, telling the
organization: ``I've been with you folks a long time, and if you'll
let me go hear my wife give a speech, I'll do any event you want in
America, anytime, wherever in the future. And I told the Senate
Democratic Campaign Committee that the Senate campaign I was most
interested in was otherwise occupied tonight and I was going
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The president took a more serious note in talking about the
race, thanking the crowd for supporting his wife and urging them to
fight for her victory, and for Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big test facing New York and America is what are we going
to do with this magic moment of prosperity we have all worked so
hard for,'' Clinton said. ``A moment like this imposes a test on a
people just as severe as great adversity does.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how Americans elected Franklin Roosevelt in the middle
of the Depression, Clinton chided Republicans for promising ``a big
tax cut and all the things you ever dreamed of'' and warned against
squandering the riches brought on by the sustained economic boom
throughout his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a little something about American history,'' he said.
``It may be 30, it may be 50, it may be 80 or 100 years before our
country ever has so much prosperity, so much social progress, so
little internal crisis and external strife as we have today. We are
being tested as surely as if we were in the middle of a war or a
depression. And we are being tested when it's easy for us to be
distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   The president gave his wife good marks for her speech and told
party-goers he wasn't alone: At one point, he said, Moynihan
commented, ```Good speech.' Now that would be like the rest of us
comparing it to the Gettysburg address, and I knew that she was on
a roll.''

RAMSEYS PLAN TO DISCUSS FAITH, JONBENET'S KILLING IN TEXAS TALK
SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ They may just be the most recognizable parents
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing of their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, more
than three years ago, John and Patsy Ramsey took center stage in a
case that continues to evoke strong emotions from an audience of
American onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the Ramseys, especially JonBenet, are regularly
splashed on the covers of supermarket tabloids, and the killing
remains a popular topic on radio talk shows. Sometimes, the parents
are accused in the child beauty pageant queen's death. Other times,
their innocence is proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Ramseys added their voices to the chorus by taking
to the interview circuit to promote their new book and to answer
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, the Ramseys can again be heard _ this time in Euless.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will tape a segment of ``Life Today with James
Robison,'' a talk show hosted by the Christian television
evangelist. The show will air in mid-July, producers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to talk very candidly with them but give them an
opportunity to perhaps share some areas that they have not been
able to share on other programs,'' James Robison said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Ramseys are eager to speak about their
Christian faith, said Rolf Zettersten, publisher of the Ramseys'
book, ``The Death of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their relationship to Christ is an element that hasn't been
explored in any of the other interviews they have done,''
Zettersten said. ``They really would like to talk to someone purely
about their faith experience and how God has sustained them through
this ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Ramseys have appeared on a series of
television programs. An interview with the couple also appeared in
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's show is the first Christian program to host the
Ramseys. But they may speak on other religious television or radio
shows, Zettersten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the Ramseys have been portrayed to the public by
the tabloids in a negative way,'' he said. ``I don't think the
Christian community understands that these are decent God-fearing
people who have a deep relationship with Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found bludgeoned and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in
the basement of the family's Boulder, Colo., home.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury investigated the case for 13 months before
disbanding in October without indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Although no charges have been filed, the Boulder police have
said that the parents remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have repeatedly said they were not involved in their
daughter's death. In their book, they present a theory that an
intruder beat and strangled JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the couple said they would undergo polygraph tests
if administered outside the Boulder Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department Monday declined an offer by the American
Polygraph Association to conduct the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Robison said he and his wife, who co-hosts the show, will not
shy away from asking the Ramseys difficult questions about
JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   But the show also will offer time for prayer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If public opinion were raising all sorts of questions about
me, I would want someone to pray for me,'' he said.

broad concept of national security, President Clinton Wednesday
told the graduating class of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy that the
world is becoming more dangerous with new threats from disease,
terrorism and even global warming. Clinton also sought to link his
message about America's long-term security with the imminent
political question of extending trade preferences to China, arguing
that Congress should realize that next week's vote on the issue
will have deep implications for America's security. By Neil A.
Lewis.

escape beyond its bounds. It said any damage would likely be
confined to ``timber and private land values,'' not buildings. At
the same time, however, the plan warned that federal officials
might be underestimating the danger that the fire or any other

 &HT;    TECH VISAS BILL TAKES ANOTHER STEP ALONG A TWISTING PATH
 &HT;    Eds: Rewords 2nd graf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. companies would be able to hire an unlimited
number of highly skilled foreign workers under a bill the House
Judiciary Committee approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort to expand visas, backed by industry, President
Clinton and most members of Congress, is being complicated by
attempts to attach unrelated amendments to the popular legislation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton wants to use the legislation as a way to
grant ``amnesty'' to as many as 2 million illegal foreigners
already living in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wants to use it as a vehicle to
carry campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to add freight to the visa locomotive is slowing
it down, much to the frustration of high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not helpful,'' said Thom Stohler, a lobbyist with the
American Electronics Association, a tech trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stohler remains hopeful that Congress will expand the
so-called H-1B visas. ``It's not going to be easy, but in the end,
we'll get a bill that increases the H-1B cap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it's not clear how that will happen amid all of
the political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, high-tech employers can hire only 115,000
foreign workers this fiscal year using H-1B visas, which are good
for six years. The H-1B cap falls to 107,500 in 2001 and 65,000 a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   But high-tech employers say the demand is far greater for
skilled workers, such as computer programmers and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem, then, that they would be thrilled with
Wednesday's vote for a bill that would let employers hire all the
temporary foreign help they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, also would
impose new rules on businesses. For example, a company would have
to pay an H-1B worker at least $40,000 a year, and would have to
show that it has raised median salaries for all workers in the past
year. Most high-tech executives adamantly oppose such salary
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite industry objections, the Judiciary Committee voted 18-11
to approve Smith's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The approval came only after committee chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., joined Smith in resisting an ``amnesty'' amendment that
Democrats wanted. The amendment would have given anyone who arrived
illegally in this country before 1986 the ability to apply for
legal residency. Under current law, only illegal immigrants who
arrived before 1972 may seek legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Smith bill must go to the House Rules Committee, where
it will face new challenges. There, committee chairman Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif, has a competing visa bill backed by the high-tech
industry and numerous Democrats, such as Reps. Lloyd Doggett of
Texas and Zoe Lofgren of California.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreier bill would limit high-tech immigration to 200,000
visas a year, but would put fewer restrictions on businesses. The
Rules Committee could end up substituting the Dreier bill for the
Smith bill.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's vote, Lofgren, the primary backer of amnesty,
said her amendment could yet get tacked on to Dreier's visa
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She added that Smith's bill has gotten as far as it has only
because the GOP leadership has wanted to show deference to Smith.
But now, she said, those Republican leaders must ask themselves:
``Do they want a bill that everyone hates?''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted GOP leaders would make sure the Dreier-Lofgren
bill reaches the House floor for a vote, not the Smith measure.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the legislation takes shape, it ultimately would
have to be reconciled with a Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   And things are complicated over on the Senate side as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's version of the visa bill, sponsored by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would increase H-1B visas
to 195,000 through 2002. But that bill is having trouble getting to
the floor for a vote, in part because Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
wants to maintain the right to add his campaign finance bill to the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republican backers of the Hatch bill want to limit
amendments to five each for Democrats and Republicans. Such a limit
likely would preclude an unrelated measure, such as campaign
finance reform. Democrats have resisted the GOP limits, saying that
while they support consideration of the Hatch bill, they want to
preserve their right to offer any amendment to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement limiting amendments, GOP supporters of
expanded visas may try to get the measure moving by attaching it to
digital signatures legislation or to a bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., has said he
disapproves of such maneuvers, so it's not clear how the Senate
will proceed on H-1B visas.

Facts about Baby Boomers.BOOMER FACTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born than
were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year for
births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During the
peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four children
in quick succession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

STUDY REVEALS WEB AS LOOSELY WOVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web idealists and online merchants like to think that the World
Wide Web is, like its name suggests, an interconnected global
bazaar of ideas and products, a place where the answers to any
question or want is only a few clicks away.
</P>
<P>
   But a sweeping new study of the Web _ the largest ever
undertaken _ paints a very different picture. The impression that
emerges is less like an elaborately interwoven community and more
like the vast bureaucracy in Kafka's ``Castle'': a mountain of
disconnected information, lost files and frustrating dead ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an assumption when we started that the Web was like
a ball of spaghetti that allowed you to get from one page to
another pretty quickly,'' said Andrew Tomkins, a researcher at
IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., who worked on
the study. ``This is a real surprise. It's just not what you would
have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was presented this week at conferences in
Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Dallas, focused on Web links, the
characteristically underlined pieces of hypertext that allow users
to leap from page to page. The study looked at roughly 200 million
Web pages (about one-fifth of the estimated current Web) and the 5
billion links to and from each page.
</P>
<P>
   What the researchers found was that more often than not, links
are a trip to nowhere. ``Most of the time, it's not the case that
you can get anywhere from anywhere on the Web,'' Tomkins said.
``There's no point at all in even trying. It's a lot tougher than
we thought to get around.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Users trying to reach a specific destination using only links
will fail three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only about 28 percent of all Web sites are what the study
calls ``strongly connected'' to the rest of the Web _ sites with a
substantial number of links to and from other sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ The theory of six degrees of separation exists on the Web
except that the number is somewhat higher. It takes, on average, 16
mouse clicks to get from one strongly connected page to another.
</P>
<P>
   Links, of course, are only one tool for surfing the Web, but,
the authors argue, they are as integral to the Web _ and as popular
_ as search engines. ``The opportunity to find yourself somewhere
totally unexpected through links is a big part of the Web's
attraction,'' Tomkins said. ``The dogma is that this is what's
really made the Web into the Web instead of a big, distributed
database.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymie Stata, a researcher at Compaq and an author of the study,
agreed that ineffective links weaken the Web's appeal. ``If we
didn't have links, the Web would basically be the Lexis-Nexis
collection,'' he said, referring to a popular commercial database
of corporate news, newspaper and magazine articles and legal
decisions. ``The average person wouldn't find that a compelling
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the frustrations of a weakly linked Web, the survey's
results are important for another reason. The Web crawlers that
search engines use to explore the Web also use links to determine
the value of a particular page. The large number of elusive or
weakly linked sites will also elude Web crawlers, meaning that
surfers who rely on search engines ``probably won't be able to
reach substantial portions of the Web,'' said Andrei Broder, a vice
president for research at the AltaVista Co. and a member of the
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Until the release of this study, which was conducted by IBM in
cooperation with the Compaq Systems Research Center and AltaVista,
most descriptions of the Web were based on fairly small samples.
Steven H. Strogatz, an applied mathematician who studies
large-scale networks and teaches in Cornell University's department
of theoretical and applied mechanics, said that those studies bring
to mind the old joke about three blind men trying to describe an
elephant. ``This study is the first suggesting what the entire
elephant really looks like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers began with fairly modest ambitions, hoping to
compile statistical tables about links and possibly answer some
fairly obscure questions of interest only to people building search
engines. But the group had at hand some exceptionally powerful
research tools. The first was a Compaq AlphaServer 4100 computer
that had a staggering 12 gigabytes of random access memory. The
second was access to the usually closely guarded efforts of
Scooter, AltaVista's Web crawler. Normally the results of Scooter's
efforts are analyzed by AltaVista for its content. But for this
study, Tomkins said, ``we threw the words away and only looked at
the links.''
</P>
<P>
   The research group was also able to perform a trick that is
impossible for the lone Web surfer. Not only could they link
forward from a page but they could also link backward. That is,
they could analyze how many links pointed to a particular page and
determine which pages were particularly attractive link targets.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising pattern formed almost immediately. ``About half the
time, we'd follow all the links from a page and the whole thing
would peter out fairly quickly,'' Tomkins said. ``The other half of
the time, the list of links would grow and grow and eventually we'd
find 100 million other pages _ half of the whole universe.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all pages, even the ones with strong connections, were
linked in the same direction. The researchers quickly discovered,
for example, that many pages offering relatively few links to the
outside proved to be popular linked destinations from other pages.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this analysis, the researchers compiled a new map of the
Web, one that looks less like an interconnected web and more like a
bow tie. The most connected pages _ the roughly 56 million in the
center knot _ link to pages on either side as well as to one
another. These include portals like Yahoo, large corporate sites
like Microsoft's and popular news and entertainment destinations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pages in the knot link directly to what the study calls
``the introverts'' in the right side of the bow. But those 44
million pages do not have any links back to the center. Broder said
that there were many e-commerce sites in this wallflower group
because they frequently do not include external links on the theory
that the longer they keep shoppers trapped, the more the shoppers
will spend. Similarly, intranets _ corporate sites intended mainly
for employee use _ generally do not link outward.
</P>
<P>
   In the left side of the bow is a far more elusive group of 44
million relatively recent pages _ the newbies. They link to the
powerhouse sites in the middle. But the powerhouses, probably
because they do not know the newbies exist, do not have links back
into the left side the bow.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the bow tie are the least connected Web pages of all.
The study estimates that another 44 million pages _ the tendrils _
have links only to the newbies or the introverts and have no direct
ties to the most popular parts of the Web. Beyond the tendrils,
about 5 percent of all pages sit in total isolation, with no links
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed reasonable to assume that a fairly high mass of the
Web was connected,'' Broder said.``But this is a fascinating
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   For Web surfers, a better word might be frustrating. ``From the
point of view of a surfer, links are useful. But there's no way
that just by clicking, you're going to get to all the places you're
going to go,'' Broder said.
</P>
<P>
   So far the research group has run its experiment three times
using data from three crawls the first in May 1999 and the latest
earlier this year. That is not really enough data to predict a
trend, Broder said.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a slight increase in the relative number of
sites in the connected core. ``Maybe everyone's original concept of
the Web will be borne out,'' Stata speculated. ``It just might be
10 years late.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Debbie Wintz often surfs the Internet in the evenings,
much of that time is actually spent folding a load of clothes,
feeding the cat or tidying up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Wintz, a real estate agent who lives in Pryor, Okla., about 40
miles northeast of Tulsa, uses a standard dial-up modem, connecting
through her local Internet service provider. The connection is
never very fast _ 33 kilobits per second at most, although she has
a 56K modem _ and at night it often slows to a crawl. So Wintz
occupies herself with other tasks until a Web page with a few links
and pop up messages finally reveals itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other Americans, Wintz craves a faster Internet
connection. But unlike millions of urban and suburban Americans,
Wintz has no alternative to dial-up service in Pryor, population
8,300.
</P>
<P>
   While high-speed options like cable modems and digital
subscriber line service are becoming increasingly available in
populous areas, Wintz and others in more isolated communities are
stuck in low gear, limited by the capabilities of local providers
which in turn rely on the local phone network to transmit data. For
her and other rural Americans, the much-touted promise of a
high-speed Internet seems as far off as the East or West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that it's about profits,'' Wintz said, ``but I
feel like we're being discriminated against. How come we always
have to be last?''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband technologies like digital subscriber lines, or DSL,
and cable have been slow to reach rural America. According to a
report issued last month by the Commerce Department, 5 percent of
towns with fewer than 10,000 people have access to DSL service,
compared with more than 56 percent of cities with more than 100,000
residents. Less than 5 percent of towns with fewer than 10,000
people had cable modem service, compared with 65 percent of cities
with more than 250,000 residents. And although some people who have
tried to get high-speed access, particularly DSL, have been
frustrated by poor service and other problems, people in rural
areas would at least like to have the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of high-speed connections is not the only complaint
among rural Internet users. News and information about rural areas
is often difficult to obtain online _ it can be far easier to find
the address of every coffee bar in Seattle, say, than the hours of
the local library in a small town in rural eastern Washington. And
rural residents who use national Internet service providers like
America Online or EarthLink often find themselves paying toll
charges to call their access numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for free local access, you're better off
going with a small, local ISP,'' said Laura Kelso, co-founder of
Ubundle.com, a company that lets consumers customize their Internet
and telecommunications services. ``Even America Online has a lot of
areas where it's going to be a long distance call to dial up.''
Most big providers, she said, do not have the necessary Internet
connection points, known as points of presence, to accommodate
rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, slow Internet transmissions and crowded phone
networks are the biggest frustrations for many people in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Holton, who lives in Fort Gibson, Okla., and works in nearby
Muskogee, said he could not call his office between 8 p.m. and 10
p.m. because the phone lines in his area are tied up by young
people who are logged on to the Internet. ``The bottom line is that
the infrastructure is old and noisy,'' he said, ``and the issues to
fix it are cost and amortization of the equipment. It leaves me and
everyone else in the area just dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Holton, who uses Azalea.net, a local ISP, also has an America
Online account for e-mail, but he has to dial a number in Tulsa,
which is a long-distance charge, to gain access to the service.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of Internet access in rural areas have begun to
attract the attention of the Federal Communications Commission.
Linda Kinney, assistant chief of the common carrier bureau, said
the agency would conduct a survey this summer to determine whether
rural areas are being properly served.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the larger telephone companies say they are working to
increase local dial-up access. ``It's been a part of our strategy
to continue reaching into smaller calling areas,'' said Rich
Jeffers, a spokesman for Bell South, which covers nine southeastern
states. Jeffers said Bell South's Internet service, BellSouth.net,
is available to more than 80 percent of its customers through a
local call. ``Our goal is to get it to 100 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trish Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online, said the
company offers consumers who cannot dial in to the service from a
local number an alternative plan in which they can sign up with a
local ISP, and connect to AOL through their ISP at a reduced rate
of $9.95 per month.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, many rural communities have connected to
the Internet through small, local Internet service providers that
sprang up to fill a need. In many rural areas, the local ISP is the
only access available for a toll-free call, because the larger
ISP's have opted not to invest in the installation of network
equipment in that area.
</P>
<P>
   John Nunn, for example, started Twin County Internet Access, an
ISP, in 1996, because he and his neighbors in Galax, Va., in the
southwest corner of the state, were paying long-distance charges
for access to ISP's like America Online and Netcom.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn was also frustrated by a lack of local information
available online. Nunn's ISP provided local users with links to
Virginia newspapers, and even had its own advice column, ``Ask the
Blonde,'' written by a local schoolteacher. (He has since sold the
ISP to NetAccess, a regional ISP.)
</P>
<P>
   But as broadband DSL and cable Internet access spreads to
metropolitan areas and suburbs, rural ISPs that were started to
provide basic dial-up service find that they cannot meet the demand
for faster access. Instead, they have usually been forced to wait
until their local phone network or cable company decides their
market is worth the investment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Mendocino Community Network, an ISP in Mendocino, Calif.,
with about 5,000 customers, was built in part to foster economic
growth in the community, which is about 125 miles north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mendocino Community Network provides community residents with
150 hours of local dial-up access for $19.95 per month, and it
donates ISP services to local nonprofit organizations. The ISP also
functions as an active community service, featuring local news and
events on its Web page and sending out e-newsletters from movie
theater and storeowners. But without broadband Internet access, the
community is at a disadvantage, said Rennie Innis, manager of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest complaints is the slow speed of the phone
lines,'' Innis said. ``DSL or cable access would be a real gift,
because how you operate your business depends on what the
technology will allow. It's not just about faster speeds, it's
about people living where they want to live and still maintaining
an urban quality job.''
</P>
<P>
   DSL service is limited to customers who live within about five
miles of a telephone company central office, which is more of a
problem in rural areas than in cities or suburbs. But DSL providers
say new technology will help ease the distance limitations before
the end of the year. ``We'll break through those limitations, which
will justify a further reach into rural areas, from an economic
standpoint,'' said Hank Carabelli, president and chief operating
officer of (AT)Link Networks, based in Louisville, Colo., which
sells broadband services to regional ISPs and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some broadband providers, including New Edge Networks and
DSL.net, specialize in bringing DSL service to smaller markets
through line sharing agreements with local telephone companies and
reseller agreements with local, regional and national ISPs. And
although they are still in the testing stages, wireless
technologies like multichannel multipoint distribution services and
satellites are seen by some in the industry as effective ways to
bring high speed Internet access to rural areas without incurring
the high costs of building network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Broadband Wireless Group is test marketing Sprint
Broadband Direct in Phoenix, a multichannel multipoint service the
company says is 36 times faster than a regular dial-up connection.
It relies on radio transmission rather than phone or cable lines,
and works with a two-way digital transceiver installed on a rooftop
that is pointed toward a radio tower to send and receive signals.
Although the service is designed to reach people who do not have
DSL or cable access, it has a 35-mile limit, which does not help
many rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in rural areas are hopeful about satellite
technology, which does not pose the same distance limitations as
other broadband solutions. Hughes Network Systems, which has about
8.5 million subscribers on its DirectTV satellite service, said it
expects to add two-way high-speed Internet access later this year.
``We discovered we could hit a low cost for this two-way terminal,
and offer it to consumers for about the same cost as a dial up
account,'' said Paul Gaske, executive vice president of the
Consumer Division at Hughes. Pricing has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The two-way transmission works with an antenna that transmits
data to satellites. Uploading speeds are expected to range between
128 kilobits per second and 256 kilobits per second, but
downloading speeds are expected to average a much slower 40
kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what speeds are involved, larger ISPs have
generally been slower than local and regional ISPs in building
their networks to provide rural residents with local Internet
access. There are a few larger ISPs, however, that are focusing
specifically on rural markets.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, for example, OneMain.com, based in
Reston, Va., has been acquiring small, local ISPs, in addition to
building Internet connection points in rural areas, in an effort
become the leading national ISP for rural communities. ``In 65
percent of the rural markets, you can't access America Online with
a local phone call,'' said Stephen E. Smith, chairman and chief
executive of One Main. ``We think there's a lot of growth potential
because they've been largely ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   OneMain.com also designs its ISP affiliates as local portals and
directs content to customers geographically through agreements with
local newspapers and merchants. ``People don't want to dial up from
Bakersfield, Calif., and read information about Roanoke, Va.,''
Smith said. ``We built our networks around geographical content,
which is what the larger ISPs can't do because they've outsourced
nationwide networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said One Main has 800,000 customers, and the plan is to
provide Internet access to more than 65 markets by the end of this
year. Many of OneMain affiliates will also offer DSL access, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another ISP, OneWorldOnline.com, based in Provo, Utah, offers
potential users cash incentives to get other people in the area to
fill out forms saying they will sign up once a local connection is
established. When a local ISP affiliate is established, the
original customer will get $25 for each subscriber he signs up for
the service. ``Our rural approach has been to go and identify the
customers first, then go and put a point of presence in,'' said
David Nemelka, chief executive of OneWorldOnline.com.
</P>
<P>
   ISP Channel, a subsidiary of SoftNet Systems, a San Francisco
broadband Internet access company, is entering into partnerships
with smaller cable television operators to provide rural areas with
broadband Internet service via cable networks. Customers who sign
up with ISP Channel buy or lease a cable modem which connects to
their home cable. The customer's modem data travels to the cable
operator, where ISP Channel connects via high speed telephone lines
to the Internet. Download speeds average 500 kilobits per second,
and upload speeds average about 100 kilobits, according to ISP
Channel's president, Jonathan Marx.
</P>
<P>
   ISP Channel also provides Web building services to cable
operators who want to build and host local Web sites. ``A lot of
other ISPs have national content, but we provide local,'' said
Larry Brilliant, chief executive of SoftNet Systems, ISP Channel's
parent company. ``We've found that people really like to do
business locally and to know who they're working with.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx said ISP Channel has agreements to reach 2.4 million homes
in 22 states. It is available in parts of California, Arizona,
Mississippi and Florida. The service will not benefit rural
residents who do not already have cable service, however.
</P>
<P>
   Even if problems of low-speed access are solved, however, there
is still the problem of a lack of content geared to smaller
communities. But several companies, including Streetmail.com and
Koz.com, are working to improve the situation, creating local
content to be provided by smaller ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Streetmail.com, based in Waltham, Mass., for example, hires
correspondents in small communities around the country and has a
central editing group at its headquarters to produce local
newsletters, which it then co-brands with the local ISP. A recent
newsletter for Cape Lookout, N.C., for example, included an opinion
poll about what the local drawbridge's hours of operation should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small ISPs have wanted this kind of thing but aren't
organized enough to create editorial content,'' said Barbara
Johnson, chief executive of StreetMail. ``We've used the Internet
to connect in all kinds of ways around the globe. We're only now
turning to connect ourselves to where we live.''

CLINTON NOTES NEW DANGERS TO NATIONAL SECURITY AT COAST GUARD
CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed. This story is
being considered for page 1.) 
(See also CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TRADE-LOBBY) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ Embracing a broad concept of national
security, President Clinton told the graduating class of the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy Wednesday that the world is becoming more
dangerous because of new threats from disease, terrorism and even
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have used their annual commencement speeches before
one of the service academies to present grand visions of the
future, and Clinton in his final such address offered a view that,
while promising, encompassed menace on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central reality of our time is that the advent of
globalization and the revolution in information technology have
magnified both the creative and destructive potential of every
individual, tribe and nation on our planet,'' he told the audience
of 5,000, which included 189 graduating cadets, a third of them
women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to link his message about the long-range
future with the imminent political question of extending trade
preferences to China, arguing that Congress should realize that
next week's vote on the issue will have deep implications for
America's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest question marks of the 21st century is the
path China will take,'' he said. ``Will China emerge as a partner
or an adversary? Will it be a society that is opening to the world
and liberating to its people or controlling of its people and
lashing out at the world?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that if Congress votes to provide China with
permanent normal trading relations, ``It will not guarantee that
China will take the right course.'' But, he added, ``I believe a
`No' vote invites a future of dangerous confrontation and constant
insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the larger issue for future leaders is to maintain
a balanced security strategy, one with diplomatic and economic
elements in addition to traditional military ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is tearing down barriers and building new
networks among nations and peoples,'' he said. ``The very openness
of our borders and technology, however, also makes us vulnerable in
new ways.''
</P>
<P>
   While the internet and developments like the growth of democracy
are heartening, ``We must understand the other side of the coin as
well,'' the president said. ``The same technological advances are
making the tools of destruction deadlier, cheaper and more
available, making us more vulnerable to problems that arise half a
world away, to terror, to ethnic, racial and religious conflicts,
to weapons of mass destruction, drug trafficking and other
organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In cataloging some of the issues that he said should become part
of any new discussions of national security, Clinton also touched
on part of the presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Vice President Al Gore, the presumed
presidential candidate, have sought to portray Gov. George W. Bush
as mired in a narrow military vision of national security no longer
appropriate in a post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Clinton's lengthy remarks about global warming as a
security threat were a gesture of support for Gore, who has been
criticized by Republicans for his warnings about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also accused Osama bin Laden, the Saudi expatriate
believed to be living in Afghanistan, of plotting to harm Americans
gathered for millennium celebrations. Links between bin Laden
associates and terrorist plots uncovered in Jordan and at the
U.S.-Canadian border have been widely reported, but Wednesday's
comments were the president's most extensive on the subject.

&HT;     DRAFT REGISTRATION NUMBERS DECLINING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas, Louisiana and Hawaii have the poorest rates
of compliance with the Selective Service requirement that men born
in 1980 must register for the draft, the agency reported Wednesday.
New Hampshire, Maine and North Dakota have the best rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are simply not getting the word'' in many cases that they
must register, Selective Service System Director Gil Coronado said
at an agency news conference in which he released a survey on
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, when every male born in 1980 was at
least 19 and should have registered with the agency, only 73
percent of those in Hawaii, 74 percent of those in Louisiana and 77
percent of those in Texas had actually done so.
</P>
<P>
   Others states with low compliance were California, Georgia,
Kentucky, Mississippi and South Carolina, all with a 79 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The compliance rate was 95 percent in New Hampshire and 93
percent in Maine and North Dakota. Others with high rates were Iowa
and Nebraska at 91 percent and Minnesota at 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking in between were such states as New York and Michigan,
with an 82 percent compliance rate, and Illinois, with 84 percent
of those born in 1980 registering.
</P>
<P>
   The Selective Service System requires that all men aged 18
through 25 residing in the United States register for a possible
draft. The agency asks young men to register within 30 days of
their 18th birthdays but accepts registrations even from
25-year-olds. It gets concerned when eligible men fail to sign up
within two years of their 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't register face up to five years in jail and up to
$250,000 in fines, but since 1985 no one has been prosecuted for
failing to register.
</P>
<P>
   Non-citizens living in the United States cannot gain citizenship
if they have not registered.
</P>
<P>
   Those failing to comply with the law are also ineligible for
federal student loans and scholarships and cannot hold most federal
jobs. Many states, such as California, also refuse to give loans or
scholarships to eligible students who fail to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent is to have young men understand their obligation''
to the nation, Rep. Steven Kuykendall, R-Calif., said at the news
conference. Kuykendall introduced California's non-registration
legislation when he was a state assemblyman. ``This is a need we
still have for America's defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley said, ``The consequences of
not registering for whatever reasons, are enormous.'' Riley joined
Coronado at the news conference, where they announced the draft
agency's partnership with educational associations to urge eligible
young men to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   No one has actually been drafted since 1973 near the end of the
Vietnam War, and military service is now completely voluntary. But
Coronado said his agency must continue to register young men
because it ``preserves America's ability to conduct a fair and
equitable draft in an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he admitted that as the last draft fades into history,
Americans are losing awareness of the Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman Lewis Brodsky said it is ``difficult to know
who you're not reaching. But we suspect, based on the demographics
we've seen, that it's high school dropouts and immigrants'' who are
not registering.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said the agency is working with the Immigration and
</P>
<P>
   Naturalization Service as well as schools to try to get more
</P>
<P>
   immigrants to register.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide compliance has declined one percentage point in each
of the last five years. While the compliance rate among 18- to
25-year-old men was 95 percent a decade ago, it now stands at 88
percent. Only 83 percent of men born in 1980 had registered by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to raise compliance, the Selective Service has produced
a video for high schools. It features Riley and actors Sean Astin,
the title character in the football movie ``Rudy,'' and Mario
Lopez, a former leading character in TV's high-school sitcom
``Saved by the Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which is forbidden to buy ads, will continue to ask
broadcast outlets to run public service announcements. It will also
mail registration reminders to high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also introduced a program that allows
17-year-olds to register so that they are automatically added to
the draft list when they turn 18. Eligible men may also now
register online at www.sss.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said there are now 13.5 million men aged 18 to 25 in the
Selective Service data base. Men 26 and older are not eligible for
the draft. An estimated 1.6 million men 18 to 25 have not complied
with the law, he said.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: At least they can agree on one thing
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   Against the backdrop of a gleaming new airplane, George W. Bush
urged Congress today to extend China's normal trade status as a way
to boost U.S. sales overseas and spread liberty in the communist
nation. Bush, speaking at a Boeing Co. airplane factory in Everett,
Wash., noted it was a rare moment of agreement with the Clinton
administration, which is pushing for normalization. He said
political differences should not prevent Congress from voting in
favor of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A SUBJECT AT THE AARP'S HEART
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was using an address today to about 10,000 senior
citizens at the AARP ``Celebrates 2000'' biennial convention in
Orlando, Fla., to attack George W. Bush's plan to partially
privatize Social Security. Gore contrasts his proposal to bolster
the Social Security system by paying down the national debt with
George W. Bush's privatization scheme that Gore calls ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   RONNIE WOULD HAVE WANTED IT THAT WAY
</P>
<P>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan endorsed George W. Bush for
president today, calling him ``a candidate Ronnie would be proud
of.'' She said that Bush, whose father was Ronald Reagan's vice
president, ``is doing a fine job carrying on Ronnie's legacy,''
according to an announcement by the Bush campaign. Using one of her
husband's famous phrases, she said the younger Bush ``will help
America once more become a `shining city on a hill.' '' The
89-year-old ex-president, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, no
longer appears in public.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CERTAIN CANDIDATE IN UNCERTAIN RACE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton lavished praise on her husband, the president,
as she accepted the nomination of New York's Democratic state
convention to make a Senate run in her newly adopted state. The
nomination from the 352 delegates of the only first lady to run for
public office was unanimous. Still uncertain is whether Clinton's
opponent still will be Republican Rudy Giuliani, who within recent
weeks announced he has prostate cancer and is separating from his
wife. The New York City mayor's candidacy was expected to make the
Senate race a clash of political titans.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ALLIANCES IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years remain until the 2002 election for governor
in New York, but the jockeying for position between two Democratic
hopefuls, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, was on full display at the Democratic state convention in
Albany. By the night's end, there was no question that this was
McCall's crowd. He has an early, imposing lead in collecting
supporters among elected officials and party leaders and, as the
sole trustee of the state pension funds, he is a favorite of public
employee unions and retirees. And as the only black person ever
elected to statewide office in New York, he has a devoted following
among his party's minority members.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE WELFARE CASELOAD
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader vowed to wage an active campaign
for president as he slammed elected officials in both parties for
subsidizing corporations. In Hartford, Conn., the Green Party
candidate called for a grass-roots movement to enact such reforms
as universal health care, public financing of campaigns and
stronger labor laws. He accused Democrats and Republicans of
catering to corporate interests and cited efforts to lure the New
England Patriots football team to Hartford and the Adriaen's
Landing riverfront development as examples. ``The program of the
Green Party is to get the rich off welfare,'' he said. Nader got 1
percent of the vote as a presidential candidate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN GOING TO MICHIGAN _ BUT LATER
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will campaign in Michigan later this summer despite
strong disagreements with the state Republican Party. Spokesman
Todd Harris said McCain will visit Michigan in August or September
after the GOP Convention in Philadelphia. Harris said the visit
doesn't mean McCain has patched up his differences with the state
party. McCain canceled two events with Republican candidates in
Michigan this week after accusing the party of ignoring a delegate
selection agreement at its convention last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKET GOES UP, THE MARKET GOES DOWN . . .
</P>
<P>
   With a twinkle in his eye, George W. Bush played a videotape of
Al Gore talking about the virtues of investing Social Security
money in the stock market. In response, Gore said he had indeed
explored the idea last year, but found ``the problems were
severe.'' And he lobbed a firecracker of his own, quoting Bush's
chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, as saying he had pulled
his money out of the market because ``I don't take any risks. I
hate losing money.'' Bush said that Gore's taped comments last year
showed that the investment idea is a good one, and Gore is only
posturing now for political gain. Gore acknowledged saying that
``over any 10-year period in American history, returns on equities
are just significantly higher than these other returns.'' He added:
``I did not support it, but there was a time when I said let's
explore this.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND AS USUAL, THE POORER MAKE OUT WORSE
</P>
<P>
   Trying to bolster his case against privatizing Social Security,
Al Gore's campaign is pointing to a Texas experiment that auditors
concluded was a bad deal for low-income workers and a mixed bag for
those in the middle. The experiment, created more than a decade
before George W. Bush became governor of Texas, allows three
counties to invest workers' pension money in private funds. Bush is
advocating that workers be allowed to invest part _ but unlike the
Texas program, not all _ of their Social Security payroll taxes in
the stock market. The General Accounting Office audit of the Texas
program found that workers making the most money benefit from the
experiment, while those of lower means fare worse.
</P>
<P>
   YOU MEAN POLITICIANS DON'T WANT TO GET RICH?
</P>
<P>
   Missing out on maybe millions in Wall Street's bull market ``is
not the greatest thing in the world,'' Al Gore said with a touch of
wistfulness. ``But for me it was the right decision.'' He was
explaining spokesman Chris Lehane's surprising revelation a day
earlier that Gore has no investments in the stock market.
``Twenty-four years ago when I ran for Congress, for good or ill I
made the decision ... to avoid even the appearance of any conflict
of interest on the many subjects that would come up for a vote,''
Gore said. ``Missing the bull market is not the greatest thing in
the world financially, but for me it was the right decision.'' Gore
added that his wife Tipper once owned stock in her father's
plumbing supply company, but no longer does.
</P>
<P>
   GOING INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   For years, Tipper Gore teasingly, and privately, called her
``the next senator from Tennessee.'' And her father, Al Gore, said
recently that she has ``perfect pitch, or very nearly perfect
pitch'' for politics. Political daughter and granddaughter,
campaign adviser and fund-raiser Karenna Gore Schiff, heard her
father give the commencement speech, claimed her degree at Columbia
Law School, and took another step toward the family business.
Schiff's late grandfather, Albert Gore Sr., was a senator from
Tennessee. With school finished and no immediate plans for
employment, Schiff, 26, the eldest of the Gores' four children, is
expected to become more active in her father's campaign, where she
heads Gorenet, an effort to attract young voters. The vice
president dropped out of Vanderbilt Law School 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   POWELL READY TO BESTOW HIS AURA
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell, the retired general with political muscle, will
visit Austin, Texas, soon for a meeting and political event with
George W. Bush. Although the meeting is still in the planning
stages, Powell is scheduled to have a private visit on May 25 with
Bush, and Bush is to sign a proclamation in support of Powell's
group, ``America's Promise, the Alliance for Youth.'' Powell, a
Republican, has said repeatedly that he's not interested in the
vice presidency and that ``political life is not for me.'' But John
McCain has said Bush, if elected, should appoint Powell secretary
of state. Powell has not ruled that out. Since retiring from the
Army in 1993, Powell has remained one of the most popular figures
in public life.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'LL NEED A BIGGER CONFERENCE ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has assembled a large team of foreign policy advisers
whose members could form the national security nucleus of a Gore
administration. The current role of the advisory group is somewhat
nebulous, however, since Gore has never relied on outsiders for
advice on foreign policy, and the new panel has not yet contributed
much of substance to his campaign. Gore has great faith in his own
experience and instincts, and an intimate, 20-year relationship
with his national security alter ego, Leon Fuerth, through whom all
foreign policy information flows. But Gore's advisory group now
includes 25 people, many of whom are veterans of the early years of
the Clinton administration, and the list of experts is expected to
swell to include as many as 100 names over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW AS E-MAIL IS REPLACING THE MAILS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oregon made history as ballots were counted in the nation's
first regular primary election conducted not at polling places but
by mail _ a move intended to improve turnout. Ballots were mailed
to voters' households on April 28. With the presidential
nominations already wrapped up, and no governor's race, the primary
didn't generate much heat. Oregonians have voted by mail in local
elections and special statewide elections since the early 1980s,
but this was the first all-mail ballot for a regularly scheduled
election. Two years ago, Oregonians voted to abolish the
traditional polling place in all statewide elections in favor of
the mail ballot because it's cheaper and more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   . . . LESS THAN HALF OF THE VOTERS MAIL IN
</P>
<P>
   Oregon used the vote-by-mail occasion to reject a proposition
that would have allowed the Legislature to limit how much money
people could receive in personal-injury lawsuits, and a proposed
nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase to pay for road repairs. The
most hotly contested race was between ``the battling Lynns'' _ two
Republicans who vied to run against Secretary of State Bill
Bradbury in November. House Speaker Lynn Snodgrass, a woman,
defeated state Rep. Lynn Lundquist, a man, 48-44 percent, with 8
percent going to a third candidate. Bradbury was unopposed for the
Democratic nomination. The secretary of state's office estimated
voter turnout at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR OWN PRIVATE IDAHO
</P>
<P>
   A millionaire businessman and a scorched-earth conservative
lobbyist are fighting to claim the right-wing mantle of retiring
Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, the darling of the militia movement who
once claimed that black government helicopters were harassing
ranchers. Lt. Gov. Butch Otter, the businessman, says that his
guiding political philosophy is live-and-let-live and that
government should butt out of people's lives. Dennis Mansfield, the
lobbyist, believes in moral absolutes and says even limited
government has a duty to enforce them. Chenoweth-Hage, 62, admitted
before the 1998 election that she had had an affair with a married
business partner years earlier, and that God had forgiven her. The
Republican primary is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY OPPOSITION COMING FROM WAY OUT THERE
</P>
<P>
   A Libertarian could be the toughest competition Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) faces in November. The challenge would come from
Carla Howell, a 44-year-old health care consultant who wants to
kill the federal income tax, abolish the U.S. Department of
Education, and counts marijuana smokers among her most ardent
supporters. In her 1998 run for auditor, Howell won 6 percent of
the vote, guaranteeing the party official status. By failing to
field their own candidate, the GOP has raised Howell's status from
obscure third-party candidate to Kennedy's most viable opposition.
The sole Republican still in the race, Jack E. Robinson, appears to
be falling short of the 10,000 signatures needed to get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   EARLY BIRDS IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   It's a year early, but the 2001 gubernatorial race in Virginia
is already taking shape, with one self-made millionaire announcing
this week that he is stepping aside for another in the Democratic
competition. Former Rep. L.F. Payne Jr., a Charlottesville
developer who was defeated for lieutenant governor in 1997, took
himself out of the running and endorsed Mark Warner, who heads a
venture capital firm in Alexandria. The Republican nominee is
expected to be Lt. Gov. John Hager, who defeated Payne in 1997, and
Attorney General Mark Earley.
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT'S TAX-FREE OR DIE
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen announced she will seek a
third two-year term, but she didn't say whether she would renew her
pledge to veto an income tax, which is seen by some state leaders,
albeit reluctantly, as the best way for the state to respond to a
court order to reform school financing. In this year's Democratic
primary, Shaheen will face state Sen. Mark Fernald, who supports a
state income tax to solve the school problem. On the Republican
side, four candidates are competing for the nomination, with mixed
views on the tax question. There is also an independent candidate.

A DIRECTOR WHO `MAKES IT SEEM EASY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (For release Sun., May 21) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Casually dressed in a crisp royal blue button-down
shirt on a sunny Saturday morning in the newly renovated kitchen of
his Hampstead townhouse, grinding his own coffee beans (around and
around) by hand, Michael Blakemore hardly seemed the high-powered
theater director who presided over two major Broadway hits this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in talking about the success of his two productions,
which could not be more dissimilar _ Cole Porter's light confection
``Kiss Me, Kate'' and Michael Frayn's weighty new play about
nuclear physics, ``Copenhagen'' _ Blakemore, who turns 72 next
month, sounded merely pleased that the shows managed to find their
way to Broadway within months of each other. ``It's lovely, it's
terrific,'' he said. ``A very unexpected thing to happen to me at
my age, so I'm very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed only mildly hopeful that each would be nominated
for a Tony Award _ which they were just a few days later. (Between
them, the productions have also won Drama Desk, Drama League, Drama
Critics' Circle and Outer Critics Circle awards.) ``It's silly to
take the awards seriously _ they're really just a means of show biz
advertising itself,'' Blakemore said, settling in with his coffee
on a couch in the home he shares with his wife, Tonya McAllin, a
stage designer, and their two teen-age girls (he also has a son,
38, from his first marriage). ``Imagine if dentists gave themselves
a Tony. It would be something like, the Tony for the Best Root
Canal in the Most Hysterical Woman Over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win,'' he continued (he hasn't before). ``But I am
not going to get upset if I don't _ or I shall try not to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this low-key, unassuming quality that people who have
worked closely with Blakemore believe helps make him such a strong
director. They say he is authoritative without being strident; that
because he doesn't blow his top, other people working on his shows
don't either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes it seem easy,'' said Blair Brown, one of the three
actors in ``Copenhagen.'' ``He makes you feel calm and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Blakemore's even keel and elegant bearing, one cannot help
wondering whether there is any mess to the man's otherwise
apparently ordered life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a reserved man,'' said Marin Mazzie, who stars in ``Kiss
Me, Kate.'' ``He's not loud, he doesn't scream, but he has a great
energy about him. There is an intensity and a fierceness in those
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the complexity of Blakemore, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Mazzie's co-star, said, one need only look at the
director's body of work _ particularly this season's two
productions. ``It's miraculous that both of these came from the
same director,'' Mitchell said. ``That says more about Michael
Blakemore than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The British director Sir Trevor Nunn, who has known Blakemore
for years and first produced ``Copenhagen'' at the Royal National
Theater in London in 1998, said Blakemore's unflappable aura was
deliberate. ``Michael likes to disguise his passion,'' Sir Trevor
said. ``He's very passionate but he doesn't like too many people to
know it, so he goes wonderfully impenetrable, he goes sphinxlike
when you know there's a raging passion inside him.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors speak of Blakemore in respectful terms, as a father
figure, an elder statesman, a wise leader with a dry,
self-deprecating sense of humor who inspires loyalty and fondness.
``He comes just before a generation of British directors who are
starry in their own right,'' said Michael Cumpsty, who is in
``Copenhagen.'' ``He doesn't seem to have a compelling need to
exert his own ego. As a result, he commands a tremendous amount of
affection. Nobody questions his ability or authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumpsty said Blakemore's paternal quality resonated particularly
well with ``Copenhagen,'' which deals with the father-son
relationship between Niels Bohr, the Danish atomic physicist, and
his German pupil, Werner Heisenberg, the author of the uncertainty
principle. ``It's been a fascinating experience for me because I
don't have a close relationship with my family,'' said Cumpsty, who
plays Heisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore had something of a strained relationship with his own
father, an eye surgeon, who was disappointed that his son flunked
out of medical school in his native Australia and became an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a director, Blakemore worked onstage for 15
years, including a season in 1959 at Stratford-on-Avon, playing
supporting roles to legends like Charles Laughton, Laurence
Olivier, Paul Robeson and Edith Evans. Ultimately, he decided he
preferred being behind the scenes. ``I was very dissatisfied,'' he
said. ``I couldn't stand being at the mercy of other people's
estimates of you.''
</P>
<P>
   What he really wanted to do, he said, was direct, but it was
almost impossible to break in because Oxford-educated directors had
a lock on London theater. When he was 37, a friend who was running
the Glasgow Citizens Theater asked him to direct three plays. He
went on to become associate director of the theater, where he
directed ``A Day in the Death of Joe Egg.'' The acclaimed play by
Peter Nichols, about bringing up a handicapped child, moved to
London and then to Broadway. ``So within 18 months of being a
director,'' Blakemore said, ``I had a show on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   He has since directed such Broadway shows as Frayn's
door-slamming farce ``Noises Off'' and the Cy Coleman musicals
``City of Angels'' and ``The Life.'' In Britain, he was an
associate director at the National for five years under Olivier and
then for two years under Sir Peter Hall, with whom he parted ways
over how to run the theater. He has directed 20 successful
productions in London's West End.

</P>
<P>
   Blakemore said he had a special place in his heart for ``City of
Angels,'' which opened on Broadway in 1989. ``Of all the things
I've done, I have a greater fervor on its behalf,'' he said,
``because we did it against enormous skepticism and pushed it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get the script and it's self-evident how it
should be done,'' he added. ``But other scripts come along where
you have a contribution to make, where you know that if you hadn't
done it, it wouldn't be like it is. I had some bright ideas on
`City of Angels.''' Chief among these, Blakemore said, was the
show's screenplay-within-a-play and its scenic shifts between color
and black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Equal to his passion for directing, Blakemore said, is his
interest in writing _ a pursuit he finds more difficult but
ultimately more satisfying, because it is less ephemeral. His
novel, ``Next Season,'' based on his acting experiences, was
published by Simon &AMP; Schuster in 1968 and reissued by Applause
Books in 1995. He has also written several articles _ like the one
published in The New Yorker in 1996, ``Death Defying Director,''
about directing ``Death Defying Acts,'' a program of one-act plays
by David Mamet, Elaine May and Woody Allen, at the Variety Arts
Theater Off Broadway in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped to find time to finish the memoir he started 10
years ago, which describes his arrival in England in 1950. Because
it took him so long to get to it, Blakemore said he paid back his
advance to his publisher, Penguin Books.
</P>
<P>
   While Blakemore comes to a show with a clear idea of what he
wants, his collaborators say he seems to welcome their ideas, even
if they differ from his own. ``I could struggle with him,'' Cumpsty
said. ``He was amazingly generous about allowing me to test him,
allowing me fairly wide boundaries and encouraging my exploration _
even if it became contentious _ rather than forcing me to accept a
predigested solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Marshall, who choreographed ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' said
Blakemore had an apologetic way of offering his responses to a
dance number. ``He would always preface everything by saying, `I
don't know anything about musical theater, but you might want to
think about. . . .''' she said. ``And everything he said was
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore also seems to savor the substance of what he is
working on. He had seen the original ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and loved
it. And, having already directed six Frayn plays, he speaks of
``Copenhagen'' with the fervor of a true fan. ``The exciting thing,
and why it works with an audience in spite of being forbidding on
the page, is the human story of the rivalry and competition and
jealousy, which any member of the audience can understand,''
Blakemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Copenhagen'' is packed with intricate language, the
actors said it was the most difficult play they had ever had to
memorize. ``It's two hours and 20 minutes nonstop,'' said Philip
Bosco, the veteran stage actor who plays Bohr. ``If your
concentration falters at all, you pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The play depends on clarity, the actors said, and Blakemore
hammered the point home during rehearsals. ``When talking about the
science, you have got to be letter perfect,'' Bosco said. ``The
audience has to believe that you believe it; your credibility as
scientists must be beyond reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosco said he was initially wary of agreeing to do
``Copenhagen,'' but Blakemore's faith in the project turned him
around. ``I realized it was something of importance, but I said, `I
don't think people are going to sit through this,''' Bosco
recalled. ``Michael said: `You must trust me. This works.' He was
absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore knew that it worked because it had been successful in
London, where he originally directed an eight-month run at the
National, after which it transferred to the West End, where it is
still playing after more than a year. He also mounted a successful
production in Paris that is now touring France.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that Blakemore only eventually came to accept the
Broadway cast's emotional approach to ``Copenhagen,'' in contrast
to the London cast's more detached delivery. ``Initially, Michael
was urging us to be cooler and more reserved,'' she said. ``And we
couldn't help it. We're a different breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore said he worried about how Broadway audiences would
receive such a production, and he added that he was surprised the
producers were willing to risk it. ``It's very heartening for
Broadway that a play of this difficulty and seriousness can fill a
Shubert theater,'' he said. ``The heroes of this undertaking are
really these American producers flying in the face of common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gamble looks as if it might pay off. The critics
almost uniformly had high praise for the play, which opened on
April 11 at the Royale Theater. Writing in The New York Times, Ben
Brantley called it ``the most invigorating and ingenious play of
ideas in many a year and a work of art that humanizes physics in a
way no other has done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some reluctance of a different sort about attempting
``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened at the Martin Beck Theater last
fall. Mitchell, the actor, said he was initially not a great fan of
the show, and that its old-fashioned quality was unfamiliar
territory. ``I had reservations,'' he said. ``I thought the script
lacked heart.'' He said he later realized that what he thought was
missing from the text was actually already there, something that
Blakemore pointed out to him in private conversations and had
clearly known all along.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore said he hesitated before accepting the project also,
for different reasons. ``I was a little reluctant because I'd seen
it and I'd seen it done wonderfully,'' he said. ``I wondered, `What
can I do with this that hasn't already been done?'''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some subtle tinkering _ most notably starting the
show with the song ``Another Openin', Another Show'' and altering
one of the supporting roles, changes implemented with the help of
the playwright John Guare _ Blakemore honored the original spirit
of the show and was rewarded for it with rave reviews. Brantley
wrote in The Times: ``The director Michael Blakemore and the
choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad,
brazen, often shameless and finally irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, the Tony Awards will reveal whether the theater
community at large considered ``Kiss Me, Kate'' the season's best
musical revival. It has stiff competition in Susan Stroman's
staging of Meredith Willson's ``Music Man,'' which opened last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Copenhagen'' is facing tough contenders for best
play, including Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' Claudia Shear's
``Dirty Blonde'' and Arthur Miller's ``Ride Down Mt. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore has been here before _ in 1990, when ``City of
Angels'' was up for best musical and ``Lettice and Lovage'' for
best play. He cannot help but hope things will turn out differently
this time
</P>
<P>
   Of course he would not confess as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously delighted,'' he said when asked in a subsequent
conversation how it felt to learn of the nominations. Then added
with typical self-effacing humor, ``But I contained my excitement
and steeled myself for disappointment.''  &QL;

NO LONGER A MIDSUMMER'S DAYDREAM: ROBOTS THAT MOW THE GRASS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although many futurists have envisioned robots that could
relieve humans of ordinary tasks like cooking and cleaning, people
must still do most of the domestic drudge work, at least inside the
house. But outdoors, the future is here, in the form of mow-bots.
</P>
<P>
   One of these devices is the Robomow, designed by Friendly
Robotics, whose U.S. office is in Abilene, Texas. The Robomow can
propel itself around the yard, cutting the grass and even turning
the clippings into mulch, eliminating raking from the to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   The Robomow Limited Edition Silver Classic has been on the
market in Israel and Europe for about 18 months and in the United
States since late last year. The latest model, the RL-500, costs
$795 and will become available in the United States in June.
</P>
<P>
   Robomow is not the only robotic lawnmower around. Husqvarna, a
Swedish manufacturer, makes two robotic mowers, including one that
was introduced in 1995 and runs on solar power.
</P>
<P>
   Husqvarna's machines, called the Auto Mower and the Solar Mower,
cost $1,999 and $3,000, respectively. Installation _ yes,
installation _ costs $250 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these lawnmowers needs guidance from a wire that is
installed around the perimeter of the yard; the wire is usually on
the surface of the ground, but it can be buried a few inches
underground. The mowers may be robotic, but they are not very
smart. They need to be told where to go and where not to. Each
mower contains sensors that detect signals from the wire and direct
the machine to stay within the mowing area.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the mowers do what they're told, they can have some
trouble with hills and tight corners.
</P>
<P>
   Although robotic mowers may appeal to anyone who needs to cut
the grass, some people could benefit more than others from this
hands-free approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who say, `I have waited all my life
for something like this,''' said John Bunton, products manager for
Friendly Robotics. ``People with allergies, disabilities, the
elderly, people with heart disease _ for the first time, a lot of
these people can maintain their own lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunton said his company's machines, which use battery power for
both propulsion and cutting, were environmentally friendly, with
none of the air pollution and little of the noise of gas-powered
mowers. He said that about 700 machines had been sold in the United
States since December and that a few thousand had been sold abroad
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The machines from both companies look a lot like canister vacuum
cleaners without hoses or attachments. The Robomow RL-500 tips the
scales at 71 pounds, including its rechargeable lead-acid
batteries, while the Solar Mower from Husqvarna weighs only 16
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After the Robomow mows along the perimeter one or two times, it
starts cutting from one side of the lawn to the other, moving over
for each new path. The Solar Mower and Auto Mower turn whenever
they reach the perimeter, cutting swaths of grass in angular
patterns that are not repeated until all the grass is cut.
</P>
<P>
   The original Robomow can work for three hours before its fixed
battery must be recharged; the RL-500's battery, which can be
removed for recharging, works for up to 2 1/2 hours on one charge.
</P>
<P>
   Husqvarna has designed its mowers to stay on the job, mowing
small amounts at a time but mowing frequently.
</P>
<P>
   A robot mower can be hazardous for children and small pets. ``It
is deceptively quiet for a power tool,'' Bunton said. ``This has a
large blade underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the mowers have proximity sensors so they can avoid
large obstacles, the lawn must be cleared of objects, just as it
would be for an ordinary mower, before a robotic mower begins work.
``It's not going to go around and pick things up for you,'' Bunton
said. ``You have to make sure the hose is picked up, large limbs,
toys, flip-flops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robomow has a manual mode, but it is hardly the familiar
push mowing of the past. The user simply follows the mower while
holding a remote control keypad that is attached to the Robomow by
a cord. That lets the user guide the mower without breaking a
sweat.

NEW FRONT IN THE COPYRIGHT WARS: OUT-OF-PRINT COMPUTER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(EDS: Greg Costikyan designs games, consults on game industry
business issues and writes science fiction and articles about
games.) 
 By GREG COSTIKYAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``software pirate'' conjures up images of foreign
sweatshops mass-copying software or hackers swapping files. But the
Interactive Digital Software Association is trying to shut down a
different type of pirate: people who just want to play out-of-print
games.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers don't want to make old games available. The market
wants games that push the limits of the processing and graphics
capabilities of modern computers; a game designed for the Atari 800
or Apple II just won't sell at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   But at more than 100 sites on the Internet, you can download old
out-of-print games, along with emulators to let you run them _ the
games include the original versions of Atari 2600 games like
Missile Command and Space Invaders as well as landmark computer
games like MULE and Balance of Power. These sites call the games
abandonware: software for which publishers no longer offer
technical support.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the publishers don't view the games as abandoned.
``Copyrights and trademarks of games are corporate assets,''
Nintendo says on its Web site. ``If these vintage titles are
available far and wide, it undermines the value of the intellectual
property and adversely affects the right owners. Emulator and ROM
piracy is competing head-on with Nintendo's current systems and
software.''(ROM piracy is the copying of game code from the old
read-only memory chips into files that can be stored on a
computer.) So Nintendo and other companies want abandonware sites
to shut down _ they leave enforcement to the software association.
</P>
<P>
   Their position is highly debatable. Gamers don't go out and
download games for the original Nintendo Entertainment System
instead of buying new games for Nintendo 64. Someone who wants to
play an older game is looking for an experience that is different
from what is available from a modern game. And by keeping older
games alive, abandonware sites sometimes serve the ultimate
interests of publishers: a new version of Frogger (first released
in 1981) was one of the Top 10 best-selling computer games in 1999.
Publishers became interested in re-releasing titles like Frogger
precisely because they noticed that people were still playing it.
Abandonware helped them identify a new market niche.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, publishers provide no legal way for gamers to get
older games; the market is too small to justify the effort. So
gamers feel justified in making vintage games available, despite
the legal risks.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm of older gamers for the games of their youth is
only part of the story. In a speech at the Game Developers
Conference in May in San Jose, Calif., Henry Jenkins, director of
the comparative media studies program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, called electronic gaming one of the
``lively arts for the 21st century.'' He contended that just as
once-despised art forms like jazz and film were now accepted as
legitimate, so, too, would games be someday.
</P>
<P>
   If Jenkins is right, if gaming is ever to be understood as an
art form that is worthy of study and has valuable things to offer,
critics and academics and gamers must come to appreciate the
history and development of the form. That appreciation can be
created and sustained only if they have access to the games of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Access to vintage games is important for game designers, too.
Just as novelists learn from novels and artists from art, game
designers learn technique from the games they play.
</P>
<P>
   Their design repertory is expanded through exposure to games,
but far too many game designers are ignorant of games published
more than five years ago. That is especially a problem now because
the hit-driven, me-too nature of the current market means that
there is far less variety in the industry than there was even a few
years ago. There is no way a company would pay to produce a game
like Balance of Power, a serious simulation of international
political dynamics by Chris Crawford; MULE, a nonviolent economic
game by Dani Bunten; or the original SimCity, by Will Wright (all
best sellers in their day), because those games don't fit into any
of the accepted marketing categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preserving old computer games isn't about sentimentality or
retro trendiness or collectibility,'' said Richard Carlson, a game
developer at Rogue Entertainment, in an e-mail message. ``It's
about the history of art, storytelling, music, animation,
programming, level design and all of the other disciplines involved
in making classic game entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   A book printed on acid-free paper will last for centuries. Film
stock will last for decades before disintegrating, but even so,
many early movies have been lost forever. Game preservation is in
worse shape. Hardware and operating systems come and go. If you
have a game designed for an Apple II, you will have a hard time
figuring out how to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Software is about as ephemeral as you can get, yet preserving it
is essential. Illegal abandonware sites are providing a critical
service to game designers and scholars and gaming enthusiasts. They
do not, however, provide a lasting and satisfactory solution to the
problem because they are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There may be another way. A group called the Electronic
Conservancy has periodically mounted a museum exhibition called
``Videotopia,'' which last appeared in 1999 at the Maryland Science
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Videotopia'' consists of 75 old and new arcade game machines,
along with historical and background material. The Electronic
Conservancy is devoted to preserving and maintaining these
machines, and its advisory board consists of some of the most
prominent figures in the development of the arcade game industry.
</P>
<P>
   Arcade gaming, however, is now about one-eighth the size of the
combined console and computer gaming industries. It has stagnated
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   No one is doing anything similar to preserve console and
computer games. And doing so through a museum exhibition or
physical collection would be pointless; the way to offer these
games to the largest possible audience is the way the abandonware
movement does it: via the Web, providing emulators to allow people
with new computers and consoles to play the original code. Ideally,
you would do it one better, however: You would do it legally, with
a Web site and with information to help people install and play the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Gamemuseum.org. Create it as a nonprofit organization
offering software that enables people to play out-of-print games _
with the permission of the owners. Publishers could offer older
products at no cost to themselves, and scholars, designers and fans
of retro games could gain access.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a publisher developed a new version of an older game,
the older version could serve, in a sense, as a demo for the new
one. Players of the old version would be very likely to search out
and buy the updated, superior version.
</P>
<P>
   Such a project would require financing, of course, but probably
not much. The same enthusiasm that leads to abandonware sites could
be harnessed, providing volunteer labor to build and maintain the
online museum.
</P>
<P>
   It would take an energetic person from the nonprofit sector to
raise the money and build the organization, of course. But surely
the effort would be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Any takers?

 &HT;    Tomorrow's technology offers much greater diversity
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The anti-Microsoft crowd has been preaching
diversity lately, arguing that the ``Love Bug'' virus did so much
damage because so many of us use Windows-based programs at home and
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Whether diversity in computing is necessary or not, it's
probably on its way.
</P>
<P>
   As computing continues to evolve into smaller and more powerful
forms, devices from mobile phones to kitchen appliances are
increasingly being designed to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that that's a trend that's about to start to reverse
itself and we're moving toward a world of greater diversity,'' said
Eric Berg, director of strategic technology services for consulting
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid proliferation of non-PC computing platforms is one of
the major evolutions predicted in PricewaterhouseCoopers' latest
Technology Forecast, an annual publication that looks ahead at the
innovations that will drive business in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you've heard this story before, you may be right.
</P>
<P>
   The network computer, WebTV and Internet appliances have all
been marketed as alternatives to the PC, to little impact so far.
</P>
<P>
   But because personal digital assistants and wireless phones are
simpler to use, less expensive and more mobile, it is predicted
that they will eventually surpass everything else in connecting to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, some industry observers
believe that three-quarters of the 1 billion people connected to
the Internet by 2002 will be connected via a wireless device.
</P>
<P>
   The front end of the trend has already been seen in Europe and
Asia, where consumers have adopted wireless Internet access in
rapid fashion. At the end of 1999, 4 million people were
subscribing to a wireless Internet service from DoCoMo, Japan's
largest mobile phone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said he believes that success will eventually be replicated
in Europe and the U.S. Already companies such as Sprint PCS and
VoiceStream offer wireless Web access and other carriers are
readying their services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the crucial factors in consumers actually subscribing to
wireless Internet will be the growth of compelling applications
that work on the wireless platform _ perhaps more compelling than
the games that are popular on Japanese phones. And those
applications will have to overcome the small screens and text-only
formats that limit what can be displayed on a mobile phone,
typically 11 lines of data.
</P>
<P>
   Across Scandinavia, banks are testing a system from Austin's
Tantau Software Inc. that allows secure banking transactions over
wireless devices. Customers in Finland, Sweden and Norway an pay
bills, check balances and transfer money between accounts while
riding on the train or walking to work.
</P>
<P>
   While financial institutions in the United States will be slower
to incorporate such services, it will happen, said John Sims,
Tantau's chief executive. And eventually, Sims said, wireless
commerce will be bigger than PC-based Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``''If you look at the Internet its limited by PC people. The
numbers of people that will have access to phones and are
phone-literate will be much much bigger,'' Sims said. ``Our view is
that yes, the U.S. is six months or 12 months behind Europe, but we
don't think it's going to stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   AgentGO.com, another Austin startup, is betting that wireless
phones will be great vehicles for personalized, targeted marketing
messages, though its first foray into that market in Austin was
slow to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, phones will be able to handle applications that
provide information, advertising and coupons based on a user's
location.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a user was driving by the mall and pushed a
button requesting information on nearby bargains, the phone might
respond by displaying a digital coupon for $5 off at the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad agencies start salivating and quaking at the knees when you
start talking about this,'' said Ian Gillot, a telecommunications
analyst at International Data Corp. in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And San Diego, Calif.'s Packet Video believes that the emergence
of broadband wireless networks that can handle video news reports,
music videos and movie previews is not far off. While Berg doesn't
think wireless video will become a reality for some time, he said
that application developers like Packet Video play a critical role
in the growth of wireless in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the case that one of the most important
factors in the success of a platform has been the availability of
applications for it,'' he said. ``In order to believe that
(Internet-enabled) phones are really going to take off you've got
to believe that there are going to be services available that
people want.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The storm over the Plains will weaken considerably as it moves
quickly toward the middle Mississippi Valley. Heavy thunderstorms
will produce flash flooding near and just north of the path of low
pressure from Nebraska and Iowa to the central Great Lakes. Storms,
strong to locally severe, will erupt just south of the path of the
low in the middle Mississippi and northern Ohio Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of very warm, humid air into the Northeast will produce
clouds and showers, particularly in New England. An advancing cold
front in the St. Lawrence Valley will trigger a line of
thunderstorms, perhaps with large hail from central New York to
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be sultry with sunshine and isolated thunder.
Residual cold, moist air in the eastern Rockies will keep clouds
and showers over some of Colorado and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE LID
</P>
<P>
   With regard to severe weather, the atmosphere often attacks
where defenses are the weakest. On Wednesday, a wedge of very warm
air several thousand feet aloft invaded the southern Plains from
Mexico. With readings aloft as high as the upper 80s, the resulting
temperature inversion acted like a heavy lid, preventing moist air
rising from the ground from penetrating into the upper atmosphere
and igniting severe thunderstorms. But farther over the central
Plains, near the cooler and thus weaker edge of the lid,
forecasters focused their attention and prepared for severe
weather.

&HT;     BUSH'S CLAIMS ON FEDERAL PENSIONS ARE NEWS TO U.S. WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     A News Analysis 
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Claims by Texas Gov. George W. Bush that 1.3
million federal workers have an advantage in retirement income over
private-sector workers is at odds with what federal workers do _
and do not _ get when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush points to the federal retirement plan when he is arguing
that the Social Security program should include individual
investment accounts so that workers could invest in the stock and
bond market and earn a higher rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every federal worker is offered a personal account to help
improve their retirement _ 1.3 million have these accounts,'' Bush
said Monday when he announced his Social Security privatization
proposal in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock and bond market is good enough for federal workers,
why does Vice President Al Gore ``object to young Americans doing
the same?'' Bush said. Gore, his expected opponent in the
presidential election this November, opposes privatization of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the nation's 2.4 million federal civilian
workers pay Social Security payroll taxes and will collect Social
Security when they retire, just like virtually everyone in the U.S.
workforce of 141.2 million. The federal employees also are eligible
for the federal pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.3 million _ 86.2 percent of the federal workforce _ also
participate in the government's Thrift Savings Plan, which is
similar to 401(k) plans covering 32 million workers in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman insists that the governor wasn't claiming that
federal employees have a privatized version of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, the spokesman, said Bush isn't asserting that
federal workers use private investment accounts in place of Social
Security. Instead, Fleischer said, Bush was referring to the
government's Thrift Savings Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush is talking about what all Americans can enjoy, what
we all can learn from federal workers' success with thrift
savings,'' said Fleischer. ``The point is if it's OK for all these
people to invest in markets, have control over their investments
and watch their nest egg grow, why is it not alright for all young
people to do the same?''
</P>
<P>
   In 401(k) plans, which are designed to supplement Social
Security income, employees and employers chip in to the account.
Employees have a choice of investments and the yields are tax-free
until retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 14 percent of eligible federal workers have chosen
not to participate in the thrift plans.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of privatized Social Security accounts counter that
they have nothing against stock market investments, as long as it's
not done through Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major point is not to say that we shouldn't have other
ways to encourage savings and investments,'' said Roger Hickey,
co-chair of liberal Campaign for America's Future. ``Rather, we
should not cannibalize Social Security in order to allow people to
invest in this stock market scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here _ optional material follows.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 39 percent of the total federal workforce are in the
government's pre-1984 retirement plan, which, under law, makes them
ineligible to participate in Social Security. Their retirement
package consists of their pensions and their own thrift plan, which
does not draw a matching government contribution.

&HT;     ARCHBISHOP SAYS HE WAS MISQUOTED ABOUT GAY PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When in Rome, don't do as San Francisco does,
especially when it comes to gay pride events.
</P>
<P>
   That is the drumbeat out of Italy's ancient capital these days,
and among those reportedly pounding it out is the Catholic
Archbishop of San Francisco, William Levada.
</P>
<P>
   Levada's comments, reported May 11 in the popular Roman
newspaper Il Messaggero, added to intense Vatican pressure to
cancel or postpone World Pride Roma 2000, planned for July 1-9,
because it coincides with the Catholic Church's millennial Jubilee
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, which Levada claimed Tuesday were reported
inaccurately, raised hackles in San Francisco's gay community,
particularly over what were seen as the archbishop's gross
distortions of pride events here.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Vatican is targeting plans for a gay march
July 8 through central Rome nowhere near the papal palace. It's the
most visible event during a week of political and cultural events
that have been planned since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it. It's not possible for this to happen
during the Jubilee. I'm amazed that the government would permit
it,'' Levada is quoted as telling fellow prelates over dinner at a
cardinal's home. ``Obviously the Italian authorities have no idea
what might happen. This kind of demonstration is not
controllable.''
</P>
<P>
   An English translation of the article, widely circulated via
e-mail by World Pride 2000 organizers, including Deborah
Oakley-Melville of San Francisco, says Levada told his peers that
San Francisco's annual gay parade goes right by St. Mary's
Cathedral, a fact that critics point out is untrue. Many marchers
wear costumes caricaturing Catholic nuns and priests, gesture
obscenely toward the church and strip in public, he reportedly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Il Messaggero has been crusading against World Pride 2000 since
the Vatican launched its opposition in January, and has frequently
used distorted depictions of San Francisco's gay community,
Oakley-Melville said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Levada said in a statement Tuesday the
comments attributed to him in February contained inaccuracies and
were made at a private dinner in Rome attended by a journalist who
did not take notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asked in conversation about the annual Gay Pride Parade
in San Francisco, I said that I personally had not seen it, because
I usually go out of town,'' Levada said in the statement. ``I said
that there were reports of public displays of nudity that were
offensive and displays of costumes that ridicule Catholic leaders
and members of religious orders.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the journalist at the dinner took no notes, but when the
journalist later asked for a formal interview, Levada said he
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Orlandi, an Italian-born gay San Franciscan, read the
Il Messaggero article over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like what the archbishop said because he was
lying or at least stretching the truth about gay pride in San
Francisco. I don't think it's right,'' said Orlandi, who is going
to World Pride 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The march does not go near the San Francisco cathedral, he said.
And ``maybe 10 or 20'' people among 500,000 attending dress in the
exaggerated nun garb of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the
charitable drag troupe who raised Levada's ire last year.

 &HT;    Poppies keep perennial beds abloom
 &HT;    By Diana Blowers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When tulips and dogwoods are finishing up their
spring show, poppies come along to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year, when there're not a lot of perennials
blooming, they just add a lot of color,'' said Aileen Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 70 species of poppies, but the most common
perennial in area gardens is P. orientale, the Oriental poppy.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are 2 to 3 feet high, and the blooms are maybe 3 or 4
inches across so you can see them from a good distance,'' Holliday
said.
</P>
<P>
   The large blooms, featuring petals like crepe paper, with dark
centers, emerge from coarse, hairy, toothed leaves. The leaves tend
to look prickly, like a thistle, but they are soft. The orange
varieties are the most familiar, but today many cultivars are
available in shades of red, pink and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you plant them, they really require hardly any care. . .
. But they are a little hard to get started,'' she said. ``If you
buy them in the pot, you don't want to disturb the roots very much
at all because they don't like to be transplanted or moved, except
after they've started to die down.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bad feature of the poppy, according to Holliday, is
that as soon as it is done blooming it starts to die down, becoming
completely dormant by July.
</P>
<P>
   In late summer the Oriental poppy produces a small amount of new
growth. This basal rosette, a tuft of small leaves, will remain
green throughout the winter and can be divided in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental poppies can be difficult to get rid of once their roots
are established, but another perennial, the Iceland poppy, is
considered a short-lived perennial and is best treated as a
biennial. This poppy, P. nudicaule, usually grows to 1 to 2 feet
tall with flowers about 3 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   There are also annual poppies. One of the most familiar is P.
rhoeas, known as field poppy, corn poppy or Shirley poppy. These
have 3- to 4-inch blooms on hairy stems and come in shades ranging
from white, pink and red. The seed pods are often used in dried
floral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some Shirley poppies, and they will reseed every year.
They will bloom for a good part of the summer if you keep them
deadheaded,'' Holliday said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Common name: Poppy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Genus: Papaver (pa-PAVE-er).
</P>
<P>
   _ Family: Papaveraceae (poppy).
</P>
<P>
   _ Plant type: Perennials and annuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size: 1 to 2 feet wide, 1 to 3 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloom season: Early summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Color: Red, pink, orange, salmon and white.
</P>
<P>
   _ Light: Sunny.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soil: Well drained, moist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fertilizer: 5-10-5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pests: Aphids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diseases: Fungal wilts, downy mildew.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some that grow here: P. orientale (Oriental poppy), P.
nudicaule (Iceland poppy), P. rhoeas (Shirley poppy, corn poppy,
field poppy).
</P>
<P>
   _ Propagation: Seed, division.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uses: Beds, borders and cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special note: Keep moist during growing period, but perennial
poppies like to be dry when dormant. Poppies don't like to have
their roots disturbed, so transplant with care and plant seeds
where the plants are to grow when possible. Oriental poppies can be
invasive when roots get established.

<P>
   Austin Hill has become skilled at speaking for those hard-core
computer programmers who spend their time making sure that no one _
not hackers nor marketers nor government investigators _ can pull
aside the curtains cloaking their electronic domains. As president
of Zero-Knowledge Systems, which builds privacy software, Hill has
spoken at conferences around North America, espousing the credo
that a person's online movements are no one else's business.
</P>
<P>
   So when he stood up last month at the Computers, Freedom and
Privacy Conference in Toronto to kick off a low-budget ritual known
as the Big Brother Awards, he was relaxed and smiling. Standing on
a makeshift platform in a crowded lobby, he joked that his company
had spent a million dollars to sponsor the event.
</P>
<P>
   Then he covered his mouth with an expression of mock horror and
said, ``I hope our VCs didn't hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a telling moment. The mention of the million dollars was
obviously a joke, but the reference to venture capitalists was not.
Zero-Knowledge does indeed have a band of VCs helping to bankroll
its operations; it has received as much as $37 million in financing
since October.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, it seemed like a programmer's dream to
think of making big money from cryptography, the field in which
programs are developed to hide e-mail, shield online identities and
lock up files. But today, abbreviations like VC and IPO, for
initial public offering, are becoming as much a part of the
language of secrecy as are three-letter federal agencies and
code-locking keys.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy issues are becoming public concerns as Internet privacy
is increasingly turning up on the evening news. More people are
becoming aware of the vulnerability of their computer files because
of things like hard-drive excavations by private and public
investigators, who routinely dig through e-mail and other archives
once thought to be far beyond the reach of any curious eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And entrepreneurs are betting that as soon as mainstream
computer users realize their vulnerability, they will rush to sign
up for privacy products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming big business,'' said Lance Cottrell, president
of Anonymizer.com, one of the first privacy services to let people
surf the Web anonymously. ``I think that in the next five years,
the majority of Internet users will be using some form of
privacy-enhancing technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies are being started by all sorts of people, whether they
have a background in computer code or not. But it is the emergence
of high-profile, high-budget companies like Zero-Knowledge that
signals a shift in the culture of cryptography.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential encryption expert thrives in a shadowy world,
writing code in obscurity for days on end. Several of these experts
are suspicious of outsiders, including the press. Many of them
champion individualism, deride big companies and dismiss anyone
toeing the corporate line. The more familiar they are with the
hacker underground, the more status they have.
</P>
<P>
   But now their software may just be something the masses will
want. At the same time that the federal government is loosening
restrictions on encryption technologies, building commercial
products and cashing in on them (either through sales or
advertising revenue) has become a viable option. And that means
meshing two seemingly opposed ways of life, one based on
advertising and corporate profits and another that prides itself on
its insider culture and was founded on fervent beliefs in
individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of the companies, Hush Communications, got its
start on the Caribbean island of Anguilla to avoid federal
regulations on exporting encryption. Its co-founder, Cliff
Blatzley, has a pierced tongue and has been known to work on
projects for days without sleep. Another company, PrivacyX, was
started by a Canadian named Wil Boucher, who describes himself as
``a bit on the paranoid side.'' He once had a Mohawk haircut that
was dyed green and was 6 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   And Zero-Knowledge's chief scientist is Ian Goldberg, a computer
expert who is well known among early Internet users for finding
security holes in popular software. He goes by the title head
cypherpunk (a label embraced by libertarian computer programmers)
and leads a research group he calls the Evil Geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   Such irreverence may seem odd for people trying to attract
mainstream users to their cause, but it may work to their
advantage, just as a mass audience can be attracted to
alternative-rock bands. The more these privacy companies snub
corporate conventions, the more they may appear to be true
crusaders against intrusive marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But can these companies maintain their underground image while
engaging in the promotion that is required of most new tech
companies these days? Can they continue to uphold the values of
straight talk and consumer trust while focusing on profits and
advertisers? Or, like some rock bands, will they be accused of
selling out?
</P>
<P>
   Hill says they can. He equates his privacy company with
start-ups like Netscape that emerged from Silicon Valley before
dot-coms began to rule the Internet. It was a different time, he
said. ``It wasn't about, How do I get my new Porsche?'' Hill said.
``There was a culture about, How do we change the world?''
</P>
<P>
   Changing the world by building privacy software has not always
been a simple business proposition. It used to require years of
legal fights for the right to market the technology at all. Just
ask Philip R. Zimmermann. In 1991, Zimmermann created a system
called Pretty Good Privacy, which was distributed on the Internet
and subsequently drew the ire of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   PGP, as the system is now known, was designed to keep the
contents of e-mail messages secret to everyone except their
intended recipients. The technology is based on public-key
cryptography, a technique that requires two related keys for
messages to be opened. In simple terms, one key is used to lock the
message, and the other is used to unlock it.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, however, the system is much more sophisticated. PGP
was considered so strong an encryption program that the U.S.
government was considering whether to classify it as a munition
that was not allowed outside the country. By 1993, the code behind
PGP had been posted on the Internet. Although Zimmermann maintained
that he was not the person who posted it, he came under
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in San Jose, Calif.,
for possible prosecution for violating export laws. Federal
officials argued that terrorists and other criminals could use the
system to keep their plans secret, even from intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, the government decided to drop the
investigation. In the meantime, PGP had become the encryption
program of choice among longtime Internet users and technical
wizards. It had also started to be adopted by people living under
oppressive governments in countries where speaking freely in an
unprotected e-mail message could mean a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Zimmermann said, ``PGP is used by every human rights
organization in the world.''

</P>
<P>
   Back in the last century, I was a licensed private eye. More
Erin Brockovich than Philip Marlowe, I didn't carry a revolver,
follow cheating spouses, or drink Jack Daniels. Still, I was the
real thing, solving cases with brains and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   But recently I wondered what effect the Internet has had on my
old profession. With a plethora of ``research'' Web sites making
the detective's job easier, does it still take a savvy gumshoe to
work a case? Or, can any Tom or Harry be a dick?
</P>
<P>
   I fell into sleuthing after dropping out of college in the late
'60s. I started by working toll fraud for the phone company,
chasing down phony calling card charges billed to numbers
teen-agers got out of High Times magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a natural aptitude, I soon ran a thriving detective
business in the morally heedless climate of Southern California. My
specialty was ``skiptracing'' _ hunting down deadbeats who bought
cars with falsified loan applications. My targets ran the gamut:
hippies ``getting over'' with a free ride, pyramid salesmen one
step ahead of the sheriff, and hardcore con men with six months'
head start driving the bank's Cadillac Seville.
</P>
<P>
   I became a master at sniffing out leads. Ex-girlfriends, former
co-workers, landlords and neighbors all had clues. Easily 15
percent of my skips were found after a chat with their moms. Most
mothers happily gave their wayward sons' new phone numbers to a
sweet, polite-sounding girl who might be an old friend or a new
love. I once called a skip at a pay telephone he'd used to call
home collect. He regularly used that same phone booth and
unsuspectingly picked up when I rang. Unnerved at getting caught,
he personally delivered the hot Lincoln to the bank's front door.
</P>
<P>
   I kept a notebook of useful phone numbers and jargon to navigate
``the system.'' Sounding conversant and acting entitled, I asked
about their days as beleaguered key-punchers and overworked
switchboard operators read me data from unemployment claim forms,
utility bills and drivers' records. I spent a couple of weeks
following each skip's trail and charged my clients as much as $500
per car. A client once paid me $2,000 for finding a stolen yacht
anchored in the Dutch Antilles.
</P>
<P>
   Next, growing bored at high-end bill collecting, I turned my
detecting skills to complex legal cases. As with skiptracing,
getting information took imagination, shoe leather and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Long before detectives were hired to do opposition research for
their political clients, a mayor employed me to investigate public
charges that he had been shaking down municipal workers. Had they
been muscled to donate ``gifts'' for His Honor's birthday party? To
assess my client's political vulnerability, I befriended City Hall
secretaries, building-permit clerks and parking commissioners.
Grateful for cushy jobs, they'd all written generous birthday
checks. After my report, the mayor returned their money.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a corporate client believed his competitor had
rigged the bid on a state Medicaid contract. To test his
hypothesis, I read every proposal and solicitation document related
to the multimillion-dollar award. State employees who evaluated
bids, supervised contracts, or were ``non-essential'' to the
contract, were all contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Using all my sweet-talking skills, I enlisted the opposition's
employees and called officials in states where they competed for
other contracts. I became pals with folks at the attorney general's
office, who soon joined the search for suspicious patterns and odd
relationships. Enough hanky-panky finally turned up to invalidate
the rival's bid. The client's cost for my time, copying, travel,
and other expenses came to well over $30,000. If you did the same
job today with old-time methods, it would cost more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   So, has the Internet reduced Philip Marlowe's job to a series of
clicks on a home computer?
</P>
<P>
   Take my old job of skiptracing. It's no longer hard work
tracking down a fugitive's ex-neighbors to ask about his sudden
departure. Recently, working as a reporter, I used the Internet to
collect tenants' names and phone numbers for an entire New York
high-rise by clicking on the reverse field of www.555-1212.com/, a
White Pages Web page. The Web probably cuts 10 percent off the time
to locate a deadbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Online databases give detectives (amateur and otherwise) cheap
access to everything from campaign contributor lists at FECInfo to
the Swiss Bankers Association's list of dormant accounts. Looking
for background on every licensed U.S. physician? Perhaps you're
interested in workers' compensation claims or the ``accident scene
documentation'' from police files. If you're willing to spend $4 to
$50 per report, the info is yours.
</P>
<P>
   The data on these Web sites comes mostly from the same source:
you. Every time you fill out a warranty card, redeem a rebate
offer, or enter a contest, some information consolidator might be
entering your job, income, and unlisted phone number into a
searchable database.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are in on it, too. Arrest records, property taxes,
and drivers' histories are input along with the coupon collector
data. Sites such as TR Information Services sell employment
histories ($100) and long-distance call printouts ($90).
</P>
<P>
   Though many sites restrict use to subscribers with a legitimate
business purpose _ landlords, lawyers, journalists, guard
businesses and, of course, private investigators _ the armchair
dick needn't be locked out. Want to call yourself a detective? Get
a diploma through the Spy Tech Agency correspondence course for
around $150.
</P>
<P>
   Such data-rich Web addresses seem to make full-service snooping
the latest intermediary casualty. If the job is finding somebody's
long-lost friend or enemy, the Web has pretty much put the
professional bloodhound out of business. But I wondered about more
complex cases. With ready access to so much data, is there still a
job for a sweet-talking sleuth?
</P>
<P>
   After looking at a few electronic reference sites, such as DBT
Online Inc., Data-Trac Online (``a fully integrated on-line
investigation service''), and ChoicePoint Inc. (which even the FBI
uses), I borrowed a private eye friend's AutoTrackXP subscription,
which costs him $25 a month, to mount my own cyberinvestigation.
</P>
<P>
   First, I typed in ``George W. Bush,'' pretending he was my
client.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many George W. Bushes summoned forth, only one was the
same age as the Texas governor. The database had ``found'' the
right guy. In a double-click, the search service supplied me Bush's
Social Security number. But, I also learned that a 52-year-old
Houston woman has been using the same identifier. Was the governor
sharing his unique identification number with the Houston woman?
Was she impersonating him? The report gave no explanation for the
duplicate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring she was a random data blip, I eliminated the woman from
my search and ordered AutoTrackXP's $21 widest-net search choice _
called ``National Comprehensive'' _ and a few other options
including one called ``SEC Insider Trading'' on the presidential
candidate. It would have taken Marlowe weeks of legwork from
mountains of records to build the AutoTrackXP dossiers I clicked
out in less than an hour for a cost of about $125. A pre-Web-era
sleuth might have charged $5,000 to search the same archives
manually.
</P>
<P>
   My 23-page printout included the names of the former occupants
of his residence (including ex-Gov. Ann Richards), the date he
married Laura Welch, that he registered to vote in Dallas on Nov.
12, 1988, that his accountant apparently shares his post office
box, and descriptions of vehicles registered to the same box
number.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed ``business affiliations'' but no mention of
the Texas Rangers baseball team in which Bush once prominently
owned an interest. The Web resource also detailed some stock trades
from the days he was director of three publicly traded companies,
yet the ``comprehensive`` database missed a 1990 Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation of one of the stock transactions,
even though the probe was reported last year in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   To judge the precision of AutoTrackXP's info dump, I targeted a
similar search at _ me! The 20-page report included my husband's
driver's license number (and an option to search for more info
about it), my daughter's college address, and detailed data pulled
from motor vehicle departments, recorders of deeds, voter
registrations, marriage license bureaus, vessel registrations,
professional licensing bodies, and court proceedings. It even gave
the address of an apartment I lived in 25 years ago. All accurate.
</P>
<P>
   But, along with the facts was a lot of what Marlowe and I called
false leads. Data entry mistakes and omissions caused my file to be
riddled with irrelevant and misleading details.
</P>
<P>
   Data needs context. If all the world's documents were accessible
by search engine, a pro would still have to sort them out. On my
Medicaid case, those bid documents I read held many details but, to
make them useful, I wheedled the remaining puzzle pieces from the
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a useful tool, but Marlowe's job is safe. The wealth
of cyberdata doesn't tell me why George W. Bush shares a post
office box with his accountant or whether the first time he
registered to vote was really the week his father was elected
president. Luckily for Marlowe, half of what a detective looks for
isn't written down.

 UNDATED: the world.''

   Most people looking at Internet privacy now seem to be
contending with problems that have little to do with government
oppression. Instead, they want to avoid spam, direct-mail
marketing, identity theft and the possibility that one of their
e-mail messages might show up someday in a public courtroom. By
using programs that encrypt their e-mail messages, people can send
notes that can never be read by their employers or the wandering
eyes of network administrators. Only the intended recipient of each
message has the key to unlock the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is just that much more on people's minds these days,''
said John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an Internet and civil rights group. People are starting
to hear about friends who have had their Social Security numbers or
credit card numbers stolen. Or they have read news reports about
DoubleClick, an Internet advertising company that had planned to
match data about people's surfing habits with information
identifying the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relentless advertising nature of so many of the commercial
Internet companies is partly driving the public reaction,'' Gilmore
said. ``People are saying, We don't want this.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach this new market, cryptographers are starting to realize
that they must become less of an enigma to people. Zero-Knowledge,
for example, has started posting essays under the heading
Demystifying Cryptography on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the companies are enjoying the kind of growth
familiar to Internet start-ups, and the perks as well. Hush
Communications, now based in Ireland, has doubled in size in the
last few months to include more than 30 people. Anonymizer.com has
an arcade game in its office, offers its employees unlimited soft
drinks and will soon move into a larger office in downtown San
Diego. Zero-Knowledge has swelled to 200 employees; it is building
a new office in Montreal with a massage room, a cappuccino stand, a
rooftop terrace and free laundry services (a bonus to computer
programmers who come from a culture that values smart code over
personal hygiene).
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't quite feel the same as in the days when online
privacy was the realm of the most paranoid and technically elite.
The Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference, which celebrated its
10th anniversary last month, used to attract an eclectic group of
cryptographers, hackers, academics, privacy advocates and law
enforcement officials. Many longtime attendees are now there on
behalf of companies they have started or have been recruited to
join. Not many meet the description of the lone cryptographer
living hand-to-mouth, writing secret codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are very few people like that left,'' said
Boucher, of PrivacyX. ``I know some people who started out in the
cypher underground, and most of them are now holding high-level
positions in companies. And they are not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   To make money, privacy-protection companies have two basic
strategies: sell software and services or give away their products
and sell advertising instead.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising model can be risky, but Anonymizer, PrivacyX and
Hush Communications have arrangements with advertisers, and
Zero-Knowledge has contracts in the works with online shops. Each
one differs in how the advertisements appear, but all the companies
assure their customers that no advertiser will ever know any
personal information about them.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, would rather
have people pay for privacy protection, preferably with
micropayments (each a fraction of a cent) for each encrypted e-mail
message, than accept the free products that come with advertising.
``Any company that is taking ads supposedly to protect your privacy
is now serving two masters,'' Gilmore said. ``And ultimately they
may have to choose between them at some point.'' A company might
decide, for example, that the only way to stay afloat is to start
divulging personal information about its users.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the double-edged sword of advertising, computer
users with little technical expertise may have to trust that the
products they are using are really secure. That puts privacy
companies in a paradoxical position, said Cottrell, of Anonymizer.
``You are standing up and saying, `You can't trust anyone,''' he
said. ```Come trust me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge says that it has designed its system to sidestep
that issue entirely. The company has no way to retrieve any
specific data on any of its users. It says it has built technical
limitations into its software so that retrieval is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have also published the code that lies behind
their programs _ open-source code _ so that the programming can be
reviewed by other technical experts. Among those that have
open-source philosophies are Hush Communications, Zero-Knowledge,
PrivacyX and Network Associates, which now owns the PGP software.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the technical expectations of the cryptography crowd
while creating a simple product for consumers can be a challenge.
Computer experts get a charge out of exposing security holes in
systems that hold themselves up to be fail-safe and are constantly
searching for signs of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, for example, Goldberg publicized a problem with
PrivacyX's Web browser service. Boucher said the problem was with
an early version (a beta release) of PrivacyX. ZipLip.com has been
criticized in the cypherpunk community for not divulging the code
behind its system. ZipLip.com says it uses well-established
encryption systems and employs independent auditors to test its
security.
</P>
<P>
   Generating serious interest among the general public in secret
e-mail programs and anonymous-surfing tools is another hurdle.
Despite news reports about privacy breaches, Hill said during a
keynote address at the conference last month, there are still signs
that people are more than willing to disclose personal information
if tempted with a free personal computer. There are people, Hill
said, who seem to have no problem asking, `` `Will I get free
McDonald's if I leave my DNA sample at the door?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The education process is just starting,'' Hill said in an
interview. He is convinced that such a drive to change the world
can mix well with the need to make money. So far, he appears to be
successful on both ends. He still wears the requisite black attire
common to most cypherpunks; he still berates online companies for
their privacy intrusions. And with the profit he made from his
first start-up company, an Internet service provider, he bought a
black Porsche 911, which sits in his garage during Montreal's
winter months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun toy,'' he said. ``I'm just taking it out this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the many privacy services.
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMIZER.COM: www.anonymizer.com
</P>
<P>
   Offers free and subscription-based services that allow people to
move around on the Internet or send e-mail without being traced.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM: www.freedom.net
</P>
<P>
   This software from Zero-Knowledge Systems sells for $49.95. It
lets people create pseudonyms to use while they chat or shop
online, surf or send e-mail. Uses encryption to hide the contents
of information that travels over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   HUSHMAIL: www.hushmail.com
</P>
<P>
   From Hush Communications, this provides free, Web-based e-mail
accounts that let people send encrypted messages. The messages can
be opened only with a key, a code that is sent to the recipient _
and that key is locked up until the recipient uses a pass phrase to
gain access to it. Both the sender and recipient must have HushMail
accounts to take advantage of the security.
</P>
<P>
   PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY: www.pgp.com
</P>
<P>
   This program, from Network Associates, offers free and fee-based
security services for e-mail. To use the system, the sender must
register for a pair of keys _ one is used to lock up, or encyrpt,
messages and the other is used to unlock them. A recipient of a PGP
e-mail message must have one of the sender's keys to open the
message. PGP can be used alone or integrated into popular e-mail
programs like Eudora.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACYX: www.privacyx.com
</P>
<P>
   Offers a free e-mail service that allows the sending of both
anonymous and encrypted messages _ as long as you are using a
Netscape or Microsoft e-mail system. To read messages sent through
the PrivacyX system, recipients must have a digital certificate, a
small, encrypted file that proves the identity of the recipient and
sender and acts as a key by locking the message. Digital
certificates can be obtained by signing up for a PrivacyX account.
</P>
<P>
   ZIPLIP.COM: www.ziplip.com
</P>
<P>
   A service that provides free Web-based e-mail accounts (like
those offered by HotMail) that let users send encrypted messages as
well as regular e-mail. Recipients of the encrypted messages do not
have to have ZipLip accounts. But they must enter a password _
which is agreed upon between the sender and receiver ahead of time
_ to read the message.

</P>
<P>
   Back in the last century, I was a licensed private eye. More
Erin Brockovich than Philip Marlowe, I didn't carry a revolver,
follow cheating spouses, or drink Jack Daniels. Still, I was the
real thing, solving cases with brains and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   But recently I wondered what effect the Internet has had on my
old profession. With a plethora of ``research'' Web sites making
the detective's job easier, does it still take a savvy gumshoe to
work a case? Or, can any Tom or Harry be a dick?
</P>
<P>
   I fell into sleuthing after dropping out of college in the late
'60s. I started by working toll fraud for the phone company,
chasing down phony calling card charges billed to numbers
teen-agers got out of High Times magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a natural aptitude, I soon ran a thriving detective
business in the morally heedless climate of Southern California. My
specialty was ``skiptracing'' _ hunting down deadbeats who bought
cars with falsified loan applications. My targets ran the gamut:
hippies ``getting over'' with a free ride, pyramid salesmen one
step ahead of the sheriff, and hardcore con men with six months'
head start driving the bank's Cadillac Seville.
</P>
<P>
   I became a master at sniffing out leads. Ex-girlfriends, former
co-workers, landlords and neighbors all had clues. Easily 15
percent of my skips were found after a chat with their moms. Most
mothers happily gave their wayward sons' new phone numbers to a
sweet, polite-sounding girl who might be an old friend or a new
love. I once called a skip at a pay telephone he'd used to call
home collect. He regularly used that same phone booth and
unsuspectingly picked up when I rang. Unnerved at getting caught,
he personally delivered the hot Lincoln to the bank's front door.
</P>
<P>
   I kept a notebook of useful phone numbers and jargon to navigate
``the system.'' Sounding conversant and acting entitled, I asked
about their days as beleaguered key-punchers and overworked
switchboard operators read me data from unemployment claim forms,
utility bills and drivers' records. I spent a couple of weeks
following each skip's trail and charged my clients as much as $500
per car. A client once paid me $2,000 for finding a stolen yacht
anchored in the Dutch Antilles.
</P>
<P>
   Next, growing bored at high-end bill collecting, I turned my
detecting skills to complex legal cases. As with skiptracing,
getting information took imagination, shoe leather and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Long before detectives were hired to do opposition research for
their political clients, a mayor employed me to investigate public
charges that he had been shaking down municipal workers. Had they
been muscled to donate ``gifts'' for His Honor's birthday party? To
assess my client's political vulnerability, I befriended City Hall
secretaries, building-permit clerks and parking commissioners.
Grateful for cushy jobs, they'd all written generous birthday
checks. After my report, the mayor returned their money.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a corporate client believed his competitor had
rigged the bid on a state Medicaid contract. To test his
hypothesis, I read every proposal and solicitation document related
to the multimillion-dollar award. State employees who evaluated
bids, supervised contracts, or were ``non-essential'' to the
contract, were all contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Using all my sweet-talking skills, I enlisted the opposition's
employees and called officials in states where they competed for
other contracts. I became pals with folks at the attorney general's
office, who soon joined the search for suspicious patterns and odd
relationships. Enough hanky-panky finally turned up to invalidate
the rival's bid. The client's cost for my time, copying, travel,
and other expenses came to well over $30,000. If you did the same
job today with old-time methods, it would cost more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   So, has the Internet reduced Philip Marlowe's job to a series of
clicks on a home computer?
</P>
<P>
   Take my old job of skiptracing. It's no longer hard work
tracking down a fugitive's ex-neighbors to ask about his sudden

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CANNES FESTIVAL, SOME ENCHANTING OUTSIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ Though one could lose several nights' sleep
trying to catch all the films in competition at this year's Cannes
International Film Festival _ and some of them, at over three
hours, seem to last at least one night _ there are great movie
finds outside the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is ``Girlfight,'' from the writer and director Karyn
Kusama, which is being shown in the highly regarded Directors'
Fortnight series for new talent. Kusama's debut work is the story
of a young girl (Michelle Rodriguez, in her acting premiere) who
discovers a way to channel her anger and aggressions through
training as a boxer. The film is enchanting audiences at Directors'
Fortnight the way it did at the Sundance Film Festival, where it
was awarded the Jury Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama discovered the boxing world three years ago through a
friend who was training as a boxer. ``I went to Gleason's in
Brooklyn,'' she said. ``There were people who took me in there and
didn't swat me away. It was a very dramatic spot, a different world
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' wasn't the first story of an outsider that Kusama
considered. The script she worked on before shooting ``Girlfight''
was considerably different. ``This other script was a perverse road
movie,'' she said, ``much darker, before serial killers had become
run of the mill.'' The script, which she ended up not making,
trailed a pair of killers who travel across the country with a
young girl in tow: ``It's told from the point of view of the
girl,'' she said, ``and we never really see what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   She is attracted to young women growing up in broken or unusual
family situations. ``I don't know where the interest in weird home
settings comes from,'' she said, ``because I had a very normal
upbringing. On some level I do want to be an outsider. I think as I
get older, I'm more resistant to change and went back to Gleason's
to fight _ I'm not good at getting hit _ when I could have quit to
fight that part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crop of films advertised on billboards here are not
her cup of tea. ``It's a convention about conventionality,'' she
said, ``but I have no problem going to festivals. I have to
participate in some aspect, or it won't get seen, and going to
festivals is the only way to get the word out. At the same time, I
love things about this festival. I just wish I had time to go see a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Kusama gone to the market screening of ``Memento,'' a tart
and engrossing crime film, she would probably have left the theater
happy. Market screenings, for films hoping to attract a
distributor, are often so packed they resemble passenger trains in
third-world countries; if someone yelled fire in these crowded
theaters, the resulting stampede would mean no one would be left to
bid on David Hasselhoff movies. ``Memento'' is a slippery knot of a
noir starring Guy Pearce as a man hunting his wife's killer.
Because of an injury, his memory disappears when he falls asleep,
so he has clues and instructions tattooed all over his torso; he
never knows where he is. Directed by Chris Nolan, ``Memento'' toys
with linearity, both chronological and narrative, in a way that
makes him an inheritor of the director Nicolas Roeg, whose
delirious editing rhythms and broken storytelling wreaked havoc
with movies in the 1970's. Nolan's smarts about the genre give
``Memento'' a stylish freshness that raises it above the rut that
crime films have found themselves in _ it's one of the most
enjoyable pictures in years. His previous film, last year's
no-budget black-and-white film ``Following,'' toyed with
expectations, too.
</P>
<P>
   Joel and Ethan Coen have spent their careers cheating
expectations in their films, peppering the lives of their marginal
protagonists from both sides of the law with enough obstacles to
blind a Raymond Chandler hero. Their film in competition here, ``O
Brother, Where Art Thou,'' has a credit in its opening sequence
that got probably the biggest laugh here: ``Based Upon `The
Odyssey' by Homer.''
</P>
<P>
   You could also tick off other, less literary references,
including a big slice of the screwball comedy ``Sullivan's
Travels'' and more than a passing nod to the legend surrounding the
life of the blues guitarist Robert Johnson, but the main characters
in ``O Brother, Where Art Thou'' are indeed seeking knowledge,
treasure and the road home, and they do run into sirens. This may
be the world's first picaresque hillbilly musical, with three louts
on the run from a Southern prison and their intelligence at best a
dim flicker behind their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers aren't out to make friends here. This athletic
and tricky comedy isn't a politically correct look at the South of
the 1930s, but it has as big a heart as ``The Big Lebowski,'' their
absurdly lovable mystery starring Jeff Bridges. ``O Brother, Where
Art Thou'' features the elements that delight Coen fans, such as
repeated blows to the head that would make Tex Avery flinch and a
ferocious amount of meaningless patter, particularly by George
Clooney as a lowlife blade who constantly replenishes his hair with
enough pomade to lubricate a Hudson Hornet. John Turturro and Tim
Blake Nelson are the other parts of this convict trio. Clooney
doesn't have the usual audience rapport at the start; it takes a
while to get ahold of his character, but he broadens his perfect,
sly double-takes and finds the right beats to keep up with the Coen
regulars, Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. ``O Brother,
Where Art Thou'' is a lush fable about forgiveness _ the mantra is
``looking for answers'' _ in which everything fits together. When
Clooney says the devil is red with a pitchfork and the blues
musician played by Chris Thomas King says he's white, they're both
right: he turns out to be the wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, which
gets its own musical number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow of the Vampire,'' by E. Elias Merhige, is also in
Directors' Fortnight. It's a comic fantasy in which F.W. Murnau
(John Malkovich) is making his classic vampire film ``Nosferatu''
with his star Max Schreck, only Schreck is really Dracula, an
actual vampire (Willem Dafoe). Murnau is a trippy perfectionist ham
who will do whatever it takes to get his masterpiece finished, and
Malkovich's flamboyant toughness is a boon. He's a showy sadist who
knows that he has to have drama even in his real life. The movie
feels a little leaden, despite a glorious turn by the British
comedian Eddie Izzard as a silent film actor who can pop his eyes
with the best of them. That is, until Dafoe shows up. With his
parchment-pale countenance and devotion to character _ the
strangest professional ever seen on a film set _ he is beloved by
the crew despite the fact that he's eliminating them one by one.
``The German stage needs you,'' someone says after this real-life
Nosferatu grabs a bat out of the night air and hungrily drains it.
Dafoe uses his natural gravity for laughs; his Dracula is a vain
lizard who hijacks the production with ideas of his own in this
movie that intelligently mocks the self-absorption of the artist.
Proof that all a viewer's time at Cannes isn't best spent just
watching films at the main festival.

   SIERRA-LEONE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ Sierra Leone's rebel

   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ China trade legislation received the

Congress, indicating that the White House and congressional
supporters may be less than 10 votes shy of the number needed for
passage. By Eric Schmitt.

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-TRADE (Seattle) _ Calling trade relations with China the
work of ``13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush
on Wednesday urged congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to
support President Clinton and vote next week to grant China
permanent trade rights. Although Bush has long supported free
trade, his address on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant here
marked one of the very few times that he has tried publicly to
affect pending legislation in Congress. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ALA-CHURCH-BOMBING (Birmingham, Ala.) _ Two of four suspects in
the 1963 Birmingham church bombing are indicted by state
authorities after a lenghty investigation with federal officials.
The case is the most prominent of a number of unresolved, racially
motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era that are now
under scrutinty. Thomas Blanton Jr., a onetime member of the Ku
Klux Klan, surrendered Wednesday and Bobby Frank Cherry was
expected to turn himself in. By Kevin Sack.

   YUGOSLAVIA-MEDIA (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In a dramatic

television station, Belgrade's Studio B, which it accused of
advocating an uprising against the authorities. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-SCHOOLS (Macy, Neb.) _ Even in a nation used to hearing
stories about battered public schools, those in Indian country
stand out. Last year, the average student here at the Omaha Nation
Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national
standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th
percentile. Less than half the students in grades 3 through 12 came
to take the test. And while this year's graduating class of nine is
twice as big as those of a few years ago, it represents only a
third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade. The
obstacles the Omaha Nation School wrestles with are echoed in
Indian schools around the country. On average, between 36 percent
and 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school,
according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout
rate of any ethnic group. Only about 17 percent of high school
graduates go to college, and most do not finish. Now, the white
house and others are staring to go after this problem. By Pam
Belluck.

<P>
   Q: I want to install a ceiling fan in my kitchen in place of the
ceiling light.
</P>
<P>
   The outlet box for this lighting fixture is simply nailed to the
side of a joist, and I have been told that the mounting of this box
is not strong enough to support a ceiling fan.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I want the fan to be mounted in a different location that
is between the joists, not right against or under the joist.
</P>
<P>
   I can only work from below because there is a second floor above
this room.
</P>
<P>
   How can I install a bracket or box that will support a ceiling
fan without having to tear out much of the ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can work from below through a hole no bigger than the
existing outlet box by installing a special adjustable metal brace
or bar that is made for this purpose. It is designed to fit between
the joists.

   Slide one end of the bar up through the hole, then tip it to a
horizontal position when it is above the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Position it so the non-adjustable leg presses against the side
of one joist, then rotate the shaft at the other end to expand the
brace until the spikes at that end dig into the wood and the brace
is wedged firmly between the two joists. The bottom of the box
should be flush with the bottom of the joists.
</P>
<P>
   You can then proceed with installing and hanging the fan from
the metal outlet box according to the directions supplied with the
fan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our downstairs shower changes from a normal temperature to
very hot while it is use.
</P>
<P>
   A plumber told us he thought this was because the pipes are old
and need replacing. Yet this problem does not occur in our upstairs
shower where the pipes are just as old.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think the plumber is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: It could be, but doesn't seem likely. Chances are the
temperature changes when someone flushes a toilet or turns on the
dishwasher or clothes washer in another part of the house while the
shower is in use.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a particular problem if the water pressure in the
house is lower than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the problem would be solved by installing a
temperature control faucet instead of the existing one, but this
could be an expensive solution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My patio is covered with flagstones that sit in a bed of sand
and very fine gravel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sand and fine gravel comes up between the flagstones
after a very heavy rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   How can I prevent this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently there was no mortar used under or between the
flagstones so there is nothing to keep the sand from being washed
away where it is not covered.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are prepared to scrape out the joints between the
flagstones and then apply a mortar or cement of some kind I'm
afraid the only solution is to take up all the flagstones and then
reset them with no spaces in between.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house has a fireplace that has one problem. Every time we
light a fire a small amount of smoke comes out into the room. After
a few minutes the fire gets going and the smoking problem
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way to avoid this smoke coming into the room at the
beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: Make sure the damper is fully open before you light the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Then before you light it, roll up a wad of newspaper and light
the end of this while holding it inside the fireplace and up near
the damper.
</P>
<P>
   Allow this to burn until it's almost gone, then drop it on top
of the logs and light the fire as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The burning paper will have warmed the air going up the chimney
and thus start the draft going to prevent that early smoking
problem.

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: the opposition.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government also increased its attacks on the student
organization Otpor, which means Resistance, which has attracted
more serious political support in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, at least one journalist was accused of
espionage, but was later released. And some 40 Otpor activists and
other opposition figures have been detained in recent days for
``informative talks'' with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent electronic media that could be heard in
Belgrade on Wednesday was Radio Pancevo, based in an
opposition-controlled town nearby. And there were concerns that the
government would try to move against the many small television and
radio stations controlled by the cities where the opposition holds
power.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has typically been careful to keep to the letter of
the law, but he and his government now are acting more arbitrarily
than in the past. He has also generally allowed a zone of free
speech and independent newspapers and magazines that tend to preach
to the converted. He often did so to please the West, but since the
war over Kosovo and his indictment on war crimes charges,
Milosevic's motivation to satisfy Western requirements has been
considerably diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not begin as a dictator and has not been one,'' said
one opposition politician, asking for anonymity. ``But he may
become one yet.''

DIVERSIFYING THE SUBURBS: MORE THAN A BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROSPECT HEIGHTS , Ill. _ There are places architects fear to
tread, and suburbs that are chockablock with colonials, ranch
houses, McMansions and good-taste design committees often give them
pause. ``I didn't think there was anything you could really do in
the suburbs,'' said Doug Garofalo, a Chicago architect. ``All those
cliches about how everybody is wealthy, white and conservative,
with two and a half kids and a dog, weren't encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, 41, helped design one of the most radical structures
recently built in New York, the computer-generated, amorphously
shaped Korean Presbyterian Church in Sunnyside, Queens. In the
leafy suburbs of Chicago, he might have expected a sort of
autoimmune reaction to his designs. But the suburbanites who have
come calling on his firm haven't played into the Ozzie and Harriet
stereotype befitting an Eisenhower era, marshmallow-salad
neighborhood. ``They are first-generation, self-made immigrants _
Polish, Thai, Chinese, Ukrainian entrepreneurs used to taking risks
_ and they're not here to fit in and disappear,'' he said. ``They
had no interest in Cape Cod or any other vernacular style. That
isn't their culture; they all had progressive attitudes. They
didn't want to just melt into the pot.''
</P>
<P>
   His clients, Andrew and Aleksandra Markow, for whom he designed
a new version of their home in Prospect Heights, defied the
suburban stereotype. ``I don't mind having Georgian and colonial
houses around me, but that's not my style,'' said Markow, a
contractor who was born in Poland. ``America is more conservative
and less contemporary than Europe, especially in the Midwest. We're
a little behind here.''
</P>
<P>
   A street-side view of their remodeled 2,000-square-foot,
three-bedroom split-level house reveals a large, angular, two-story
prism, plain and abstract, rising out of its own sloping shadow.
The split-level roof is dog-eared up at one corner, to accommodate
a high window. With another (yellow) Dryvit wing hovering over the
garage to the left, and a glass entryway in between, the facade
owes much to Hans Hoffmann. Something has happened here.
</P>
<P>
   Markow began cultivating an interest in contemporary design as a
teen-ager in Poland. ``Except for Frank Lloyd Wright, I didn't
really find a modern style here,'' he said. ``And American colonial
doesn't speak to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, he gave up his position as a biochemical
researcher at Northwestern University to start his contracting
company. ``Somewhere deep inside was a love for design, and
becoming a contractor was a way of getting closer to the field,''
he said. His wife, also a chemist, left the lab to raise their two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   They had extended the original house into the rear yard in the
early 1980s, but the spaces inside remained small, closed and
surprisingly dark. ``Coming home every day was kind of boring,''
Markow said. Several years ago, with the birth of their second
child, the couple decided they needed larger, brighter bedrooms for
the children, along with a playroom, another bedroom and a music
room that would double as a home office. They were ready to trade
in their tidy but conventional version of domesticity for something
bolder. Markow would act as his own contractor, but he needed the
right design.
</P>
<P>
   The Markows decided to think outside the box. They wanted to
open up the dark middle of the house to get more light and to
create a central gathering space. But that gathering space would
displace the bathrooms, pantries and laundry often parked in the
middle of a house.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Garofalo from a project he had worked on a decade
ago, Markow approached the architect with his ideas. ``I noticed
that the diagonal views down the street across the fronts of houses
were really pretty nice,'' Garofalo said. So he oriented his
two-story addition to the side yard, which guaranteed a sunny south
exposure. To do so, however, meant they would have to tear down the
upper bedroom portion of the split-level house.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Adding to suburban houses has been a national pastime since
America's first suburbs were built. Usually, the houses are left
picture-perfect in front, while sprouting casual additions in back.
The Markows had already added in the rear, and Garofalo liked that
their intervention wasn't seamless: The horizontal ranch-style
dormers in the back didn't match the lines of the original split
level. Aiming for gothic eccentricity rather than classical unity,
Garofalo built on the irregularity. Taking the mismatched roofs as
a point of departure, he developed the existing set of discordant
dormers into a choppy topography of cresting gables. He folded and
hinged the sloping planes into a set of butterfly roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked that hybrid quality of the house facing the backyard
and wanted to keep it, but we had to think of a way to glue it all
together,'' Garofalo said. ``The roof was the opportunity. If you
squint, you can still see the shapes relate to the surrounding
roofs, with their valleys and gables, though ours evolved into a
system closer to a landscape than a traditional roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect structured the turbulent roofscape with a thin
steel truss system inside; the trusses support a ceiling whose
complex faceting follows the roof topography. Midway through
completion of the production drawings of the house, Garofalo
started using computers with animation software, which confirmed
the idea of connectivity and fluidity in the roofscape. The
structure looks like a Cubist's interpretation of a house of seven
gables.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their interest in bringing in light, Andy and Aleksandra
were adamant about opening up or removing sections of the existing
house,'' Garofalo said. ``So we started thinking of perforating the
house at all levels right away.'' The architect likens the porous
quality of the house's interior to ancient Indian houses, with
their subtle, continuous gradient between public and private
spaces. He was socializing the interior of the typical suburban
house by blurring its boundaries. He also choreographed a
steel-and-plexiglass ramp and bridge that wind their way over the
central space to the music room at the peak. This large central
living ``tube'' gives the house a large-scale open room at its
core. Thinking big paid off with a heart space, an indoor piazza,
onto which all other rooms flow.
</P>
<P>
   The Markows were able to bring this unconventional renovation in
for $100 a square foot, for a total of $275,000. ``We really
searched for the best products and prices, and made big savings,''
Markow said. ``I didn't ask Doug to do this, because it takes a lot
of time.'' The couple called dozens of companies for competitive
prices on the glass entry doors. They originally planned to put
Kalwal translucent windows on the ceiling, but found a Wisconsin
company making a similar window for 25 percent less. ``That saved
us $3,000 or $4,000,'' Markow said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo had specified a Swedish prefinished floor called Karss,
``but we were able to find a really great prefinished floor out of
Finland for $4.50, rather than $8 or $9,'' Markow said. ``And we
really didn't sacrifice quality.'' The couple also went through
hundreds of catalogs for lighting and furniture, consulting the
architect on final choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a contractor, I know where to hunt,'' said Markow, who used
Sweet's Catalogue, the Building and Construction Blue Book and the
annual Architects' First Source for Products. ``We searched through
a lot of magazines, also a great source, and we did some research
on the Internet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And the neighbors? ``The guy on the other side of the street,
who just remodeled his split-level into a Georgian, said that he
loved it,'' Markow said. ``Our new design is something different on
the street that really strikes people. And inside, there's always
something interesting going on with the sunlight. I never feel
bored.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual structure now recalls an earlier era when Chicago
suburbs welcomed architectural experiments. Frank Lloyd Wright
designed many of his masterpieces in nearby Oak Park, and the
locally famous Keck brothers (building as Keck &AMP; Keck from the
1930s through the 1950s) did suburban houses that gestured to the
landscape. Before formulas set in, suburbia was the petri dish.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of adultery used to be straightforward. ``Thou shalt
not commit adultery,'' said the Ten Commandments. Recently,
however, public opinion has grown rather more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Hart and Newt Gingrich were ruined by cheating, Bill
Clinton and Rudy Giuliani have gotten away with it. By a margin of
77 percent to 12 percent, New Yorkers say Giuliani's newly
disclosed ``friendship'' with Judith Nathan, a divorced socialite,
``is a private matter and has no effect on how I view Giuliani as a
Senate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   So is adultery now OK? Not quite. Thanks to the eternal human
craving for scandal and gossip, the old strictures against adultery
haven't disappeared. They have merely evolved into a subtler, more
confused list of commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. THOU SHALT NOT FLAUNT IT. The old rule said you couldn't do
it. The new rule says you can do it, but we don't want to know
about it. Giuliani says his sex life is ``private.'' His Senate
opponent, Hillary Clinton, agrees. So does his old enemy, ex-Mayor
Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   1a. THOU SHALT NOT HIDE IT. Watergate taught Americans that the
cover-up is worse than the crime. That's why Bill Clinton got in so
much trouble over Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky. ``The mayor will
not lie about it, to his credit,'' applauds The New York Times'
Joyce Purnick.
</P>
<P>
   2. THOU SHALT GIVE THY LOVER PRIVACY. Chivalry requires that
while enduring the scrutiny all politicians face, the adulterer
must ``protect'' his paramour. ``You can pursue public officials
all you want,'' Giuliani tells reporters. But as for Nathan, he
argues, ``People who are private citizens should really be left
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   2a. THOU SHALT GIVE THY LOVER PUBLIC AFFECTION. The paramour may
deserve privacy, but the politician reaps praise for ``holding
hands'' and being ``affectionate'' with her. ``Everything about
this _ illness, love _ humanizes the mayor,'' an analyst tells the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   3. THOU SHALT BE ASHAMED. The old rule said everybody is
tempted, but you shouldn't do it. The new rule says everybody does
it, but you should repent afterward. Hence the post-Monica
obsession with Bill Clinton's ``contrition'' and the laments from
some quarters at Giuliani's frankness.
</P>
<P>
   3a. THOU SHALT NOT BE ASHAMED. The old school said moral reality
should determine perception. The new school says moral perception
determines reality. You dignify your adultery by confirming it with
dignity. ``It is the way one behaves when confronted with his or
her actions'' that matters, says the New York Post's Andrea Peyser.
``The mayor stood before the hungry press corps alone'' and ``made
no attempt to conceal'' his affair. ``He's got guts.''
</P>
<P>
   4. THOU SHALT NOT GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT. The old rule said a
lapse was bad. The new rule says a pattern is bad, but a lapse is
OK. Gennifer Flowers was OK. But Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and
Monica Lewinsky were not OK. Giuliani doesn't have to abstain from
adultery. He just has to abstain more often than Bill Clinton does.
</P>
<P>
   4a. THOU SHALT ACCUSTOM THE VOTERS TO IT. This school of thought
says the more often you commit adultery, the less surprised your
constituents will be each time. By the time Clinton got to
Lewinsky, the voters were too jaded to throw him out. Likewise,
Giuliani's advisers say voters are shrugging off his affair because
over the years he ``has made no secret of his estrangement from his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   5. THOU SHALT NOT DO IT BEHIND THY SPOUSE'S BACK. The old idea
was that God decides whether adultery is OK. The new idea is that
your spouse decides. ``It probably helps Giuliani that this story
lacks a true victim`` since his wife knows about it and leads an
openly ``independent existence,'' writes The Washington Post's
Richard Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   5a. THOU SHALT NOT DO IT IN THY SPOUSE'S FACE. This is the
show-and-tell rule. You're supposed to tell your spouse you'll fool
around, but you're not supposed to show her or make her confront a
knowing public. Everyone sort of knows Giuliani's marriage is a
sham, a worried Giuliani adviser concedes to the New York Daily
News, but the mayor's latest statements to the press cross the line
of ``in-your-face confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   6. THOU SHALT BLAME THY FRIGID SPOUSE. When a marriage goes bad,
somebody's going to get blamed. Make sure it's not you. A large
camp has formed in New York blaming Giuliani's ``icy'' and
``chilly'' wife for driving him into another woman's arms. ``What
came first _ the girlfriend or the marital estrangement?'' asks
Peyser.
</P>
<P>
   6a. THOU SHALT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Giuliani's skeptics answer
that the girlfriends came first, leading to the estrangement. His
marriage ``hit the rocks five years ago when he confronted reports
that he was having an affair with his then press secretary ... a
claim denied by all sides,'' says The Times of London. An adulterer
can't win the blame game, goes this theory. He's better off taking
his lumps than looking like a lying coward.
</P>
<P>
   7. THOU SHALT ENDURE THY SPOUSE'S ADULTERY. The New Testament
mentality says it's virtuous to suffer humiliation. This yardstick
puts Hillary Clinton ahead of Giuliani. She reaps ``the sympathy
vote,'' according to the London Times, because the Lewinsky affair
``transformed her from one of the villains in the many scandals to
hit the Clinton White House to the role of wronged wife.''
</P>
<P>
   7a. THOU SHALT NOT ENDURE THY SPOUSE'S ADULTERY. The Old
Testament mentality says it's disgraceful to suffer humiliation.
``The biggest issue amongst women with Hillary is, 'Why do you stay
with him?''' observes a Democratic consultant. Voters figure that
Giuliani's wife, like Hillary Clinton, must be trading silence for
career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   8. THOU SHALT NOT DIVORCE THY SPOUSE. The old rule said you
should remain faithful in practice. The new rule says you should
remain faithful in theory. Marriage, like religion, is an
inspirational illusion you owe your kids. And if you're a
politician, it's an illusion you owe your country. This argument
puts Bill Clinton ahead of Newt Gingrich and puts Giuliani ahead of
both of them, since unlike Clinton, he's still living with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   8a. THOU SHALT MARRY THY LOVER. The old rule said you're
supposed to stay married. The new rule says you're just supposed to
be married. If you don't like your current spouse, find another.
This argument puts Gingrich ahead of Bill Clinton, since Gingrich
has become engaged to his girlfriend, while Clinton dumped his. And
Giuliani gets credit for sharing Thanksgiving dinner and other
family events with Nathan, her parents, and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   9. THOU SHALT HOLD HER IN SICKNESS, NOT IN HEALTH. Giuliani
confirmed his affair just after announcing he had prostate cancer.
This arouses sympathy for two reasons. First, people figure that an
unhappily married man facing mortality is entitled to a bit of
happiness. Second, his girlfriend gets to look maternal by
mothering him. Already, Nathan has accompanied Giuliani to the
hospital for cancer tests. ``I am quite concerned for his health,
and I hope you will respect that,'' she tells reporters. ``That's
really my concern.''
</P>
<P>
   9a. THOU SHALT HOLD HER IN HEALTH, NOT IN SICKNESS. This school
of thought says you have to change wives before playing the illness
sympathy card. ``Getting caught with the girlfriend when you and
your family are supposedly locked in fear about a life-threatening
disease? Could God even spin that?'' a Giuliani friend tells the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   10. THOU SHALT NOT PUSH THY MORALITY ON OTHERS. ``In liberal
circles ... it's far worse to be a hypocrite than it is to be a
sinner,'' writes the New York Post's John Podhoretz. Giuliani's
adultery is OK because ``throughout the Lewinsky ordeal, the mayor
expressed the view that the president's private life was nobody's
business.'' Purnick, on the other hand, says Giuliani flunks this
test, since he ``tried to punish a museum that exhibited art he
considered immoral'' and ``wants the Ten Commandments posted in
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   10a. THOU SHALT NOT PUSH THY IMMORALITY ON OTHERS. Conservative
circles take a different view: Just as hypocrisy can be useful,
candid indecency can be pernicious. According to a New York
political consultant, these voters found it ``unseemly'' that
Giuliani's wife had planned to perform in ``The Vagina
Monologues,'' a sexually explicit play. But the play was fiction,
and the wife has since backed out. Giuliani's dalliance is real.
And at the moment, he's going full steam ahead.

<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of adultery used to be straightforward. ``Thou shalt
not commit adultery,'' said the Ten Commandments. Recently,
however, public opinion has grown rather more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Hart and Newt Gingrich were ruined by cheating, Bill
Clinton and Rudy Giuliani have gotten away with it. By a margin of
77 percent to 12 percent, New Yorkers say Giuliani's newly
disclosed ``friendship'' with Judith Nathan, a divorced socialite,
``is a private matter and has no effect on how I view Giuliani as a
Senate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   So is adultery now OK? Not quite. Thanks to the eternal human
craving for scandal and gossip, the old strictures against adultery
haven't disappeared. They have merely evolved into a subtler, more
confused list of commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. THOU SHALT NOT FLAUNT IT. The old rule said you couldn't do
it. The new rule says you can do it, but we don't want to know
about it. Giuliani says his sex life is ``private.'' His Senate
opponent, Hillary Clinton, agrees. So does his old enemy, ex-Mayor
Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   1a. THOU SHALT NOT HIDE IT. Watergate taught Americans that the
cover-up is worse than the crime. That's why Bill Clinton got in so
much trouble over Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky. ``The mayor will
not lie about it, to his credit,'' applauds The New York Times'
Joyce Purnick.
</P>
<P>
   2. THOU SHALT GIVE THY LOVER PRIVACY. Chivalry requires that
while enduring the scrutiny all politicians face, the adulterer
must ``protect'' his paramour. ``You can pursue public officials
all you want,'' Giuliani tells reporters. But as for Nathan, he
argues, ``People who are private citizens should really be left
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   2a. THOU SHALT GIVE THY LOVER PUBLIC AFFECTION. The paramour may
deserve privacy, but the politician reaps praise for ``holding
hands'' and being ``affectionate'' with her. ``Everything about
this _ illness, love _ humanizes the mayor,'' an analyst tells the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   3. THOU SHALT BE ASHAMED. The old rule said everybody is
tempted, but you shouldn't do it. The new rule says everybody does
it, but you should repent afterward. Hence the post-Monica
obsession with Bill Clinton's ``contrition'' and the laments from
some quarters at Giuliani's frankness.
</P>
<P>
   3a. THOU SHALT NOT BE ASHAMED. The old school said moral reality
should determine perception. The new school says moral perception
determines reality. You dignify your adultery by confirming it with
dignity. ``It is the way one behaves when confronted with his or
her actions'' that matters, says the New York Post's Andrea Peyser.
``The mayor stood before the hungry press corps alone'' and ``made
no attempt to conceal'' his affair. ``He's got guts.''
</P>
<P>
   4. THOU SHALT NOT GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT. The old rule said a
lapse was bad. The new rule says a pattern is bad, but a lapse is
OK. Gennifer Flowers was OK. But Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and
Monica Lewinsky were not OK. Giuliani doesn't have to abstain from
adultery. He just has to abstain more often than Bill Clinton does.
</P>
<P>
   4a. THOU SHALT ACCUSTOM THE VOTERS TO IT. This school of thought
says the more often you commit adultery, the less surprised your
constituents will be each time. By the time Clinton got to
Lewinsky, the voters were too jaded to throw him out. Likewise,
Giuliani's advisers say voters are shrugging off his affair because
over the years he ``has made no secret of his estrangement from his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   5. THOU SHALT NOT DO IT BEHIND THY SPOUSE'S BACK. The old idea
was that God decides whether adultery is OK. The new idea is that
your spouse decides. ``It probably helps Giuliani that this story
lacks a true victim`` since his wife knows about it and leads an
openly ``independent existence,'' writes The Washington Post's
Richard Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   5a. THOU SHALT NOT DO IT IN THY SPOUSE'S FACE. This is the
show-and-tell rule. You're supposed to tell your spouse you'll fool
around, but you're not supposed to show her or make her confront a
knowing public. Everyone sort of knows Giuliani's marriage is a
sham, a worried Giuliani adviser concedes to the New York Daily
News, but the mayor's latest statements to the press cross the line
of ``in-your-face confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   6. THOU SHALT BLAME THY FRIGID SPOUSE. When a marriage goes bad,
somebody's going to get blamed. Make sure it's not you. A large
camp has formed in New York blaming Giuliani's ``icy'' and
``chilly'' wife for driving him into another woman's arms. ``What
came first _ the girlfriend or the marital estrangement?'' asks
Peyser.
</P>
<P>
   6a. THOU SHALT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Giuliani's skeptics answer
that the girlfriends came first, leading to the estrangement. His
marriage ``hit the rocks five years ago when he confronted reports
that he was having an affair with his then press secretary ... a
claim denied by all sides,'' says The Times of London. An adulterer
can't win the blame game, goes this theory. He's better off taking
his lumps than looking like a lying coward.
</P>
<P>
   7. THOU SHALT ENDURE THY SPOUSE'S ADULTERY. The New Testament
mentality says it's virtuous to suffer humiliation. This yardstick
puts Hillary Clinton ahead of Giuliani. She reaps ``the sympathy
vote,'' according to the London Times, because the Lewinsky affair
``transformed her from one of the villains in the many scandals to
hit the Clinton White House to the role of wronged wife.''
</P>
<P>
   7a. THOU SHALT NOT ENDURE THY SPOUSE'S ADULTERY. The Old
Testament mentality says it's disgraceful to suffer humiliation.
``The biggest issue amongst women with Hillary is, 'Why do you stay
with him?''' observes a Democratic consultant. Voters figure that
Giuliani's wife, like Hillary Clinton, must be trading silence for
career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   8. THOU SHALT NOT DIVORCE THY SPOUSE. The old rule said you
should remain faithful in practice. The new rule says you should
remain faithful in theory. Marriage, like religion, is an
inspirational illusion you owe your kids. And if you're a
politician, it's an illusion you owe your country. This argument
puts Bill Clinton ahead of Newt Gingrich and puts Giuliani ahead of
both of them, since unlike Clinton, he's still living with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   8a. THOU SHALT MARRY THY LOVER. The old rule said you're
supposed to stay married. The new rule says you're just supposed to
be married. If you don't like your current spouse, find another.
This argument puts Gingrich ahead of Bill Clinton, since Gingrich
has become engaged to his girlfriend, while Clinton dumped his. And
Giuliani gets credit for sharing Thanksgiving dinner and other
family events with Nathan, her parents, and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   9. THOU SHALT HOLD HER IN SICKNESS, NOT IN HEALTH. Giuliani
confirmed his affair just after announcing he had prostate cancer.
This arouses sympathy for two reasons. First, people figure that an
unhappily married man facing mortality is entitled to a bit of
happiness. Second, his girlfriend gets to look maternal by
mothering him. Already, Nathan has accompanied Giuliani to the
hospital for cancer tests. ``I am quite concerned for his health,
and I hope you will respect that,'' she tells reporters. ``That's
really my concern.''
</P>
<P>
   9a. THOU SHALT HOLD HER IN HEALTH, NOT IN SICKNESS. This school
of thought says you have to change wives before playing the illness
sympathy card. ``Getting caught with the girlfriend when you and
your family are supposedly locked in fear about a life-threatening
disease? Could God even spin that?'' a Giuliani friend tells the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   10. THOU SHALT NOT PUSH THY MORALITY ON OTHERS. ``In liberal
circles ... it's far worse to be a hypocrite than it is to be a
sinner,'' writes the New York Post's John Podhoretz. Giuliani's
adultery is OK because ``throughout the Lewinsky ordeal, the mayor
expressed the view that the president's private life was nobody's
business.'' Purnick, on the other hand, says Giuliani flunks this
test, since he ``tried to punish a museum that exhibited art he
considered immoral'' and ``wants the Ten Commandments posted in
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   10a. THOU SHALT NOT PUSH THY IMMORALITY ON OTHERS. Conservative
circles take a different view: Just as hypocrisy can be useful,
candid indecency can be pernicious. According to a New York
political consultant, these voters found it ``unseemly'' that
Giuliani's wife had planned to perform in ``The Vagina
Monologues,'' a sexually explicit play. But the play was fiction,
and the wife has since backed out. Giuliani's dalliance is real.
And at the moment, he's going full steam ahead.

 PROSPECT HEIGHTS, Ill.: split-level house.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding to suburban houses has been a national pastime since
America's first suburbs were built. Usually, the houses are left
picture-perfect in front, while sprouting casual additions in back.
The Markows had already added in the rear, and Garofalo liked that
their intervention wasn't seamless: The horizontal ranch-style
dormers in the back didn't match the lines of the original split
level. Aiming for gothic eccentricity rather than classical unity,
Garofalo built on the irregularity. Taking the mismatched roofs as
a point of departure, he developed the existing set of discordant
dormers into a choppy topography of cresting gables. He folded and
hinged the sloping planes into a set of butterfly roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked that hybrid quality of the house facing the backyard
and wanted to keep it, but we had to think of a way to glue it all
together,'' Garofalo said. ``The roof was the opportunity. If you
squint, you can still see the shapes relate to the surrounding
roofs, with their valleys and gables, though ours evolved into a
system closer to a landscape than a traditional roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect structured the turbulent roofscape with a thin
steel truss system inside; the trusses support a ceiling whose
complex faceting follows the roof topography. Midway through
completion of the production drawings of the house, Garofalo
started using computers with animation software, which confirmed
the idea of connectivity and fluidity in the roofscape. The
structure looks like a Cubist's interpretation of a house of seven
gables.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their interest in bringing in light, Andy and Aleksandra
were adamant about opening up or removing sections of the existing
house,'' Garofalo said. ``So we started thinking of perforating the
house at all levels right away.'' The architect likens the porous
quality of the house's interior to ancient Indian houses, with
their subtle, continuous gradient between public and private
spaces. He was socializing the interior of the typical suburban
house by blurring its boundaries. He also choreographed a
steel-and-plexiglass ramp and bridge that wind their way over the
central space to the music room at the peak. This large central
living ``tube'' gives the house a large-scale open room at its
core. Thinking big paid off with a heart space, an indoor piazza,
onto which all other rooms flow.
</P>
<P>
   The Markows were able to bring this unconventional renovation in
for $100 a square foot, for a total of $275,000. ``We really
searched for the best products and prices, and made big savings,''
Markow said. ``I didn't ask Doug to do this, because it takes a lot
of time.'' The couple called dozens of companies for competitive
prices on the glass entry doors. They originally planned to put
Kalwal translucent windows on the ceiling, but found a Wisconsin
company making a similar window for 25 percent less. ``That saved
us $3,000 or $4,000,'' Markow said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo had specified a Swedish prefinished floor called Karss,
``but we were able to find a really great prefinished floor out of
Finland for $4.50, rather than $8 or $9,'' Markow said. ``And we
really didn't sacrifice quality.'' The couple also went through
hundreds of catalogs for lighting and furniture, consulting the
architect on final choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a contractor, I know where to hunt,'' said Markow, who used
Sweet's Catalogue, the Building and Construction Blue Book and the
annual Architects' First Source for Products. ``We searched through
a lot of magazines, also a great source, and we did some research
on the Internet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And the neighbors? ``The guy on the other side of the street,
who just remodeled his split-level into a Georgian, said that he
loved it,'' Markow said. ``Our new design is something different on
the street that really strikes people. And inside, there's always
something interesting going on with the sunlight. I never feel
bored.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual structure now recalls an earlier era when Chicago
suburbs welcomed architectural experiments. Frank Lloyd Wright
designed many of his masterpieces in nearby Oak Park, and the
locally famous Keck brothers (building as Keck &AMP; Keck from the
1930s through the 1950s) did suburban houses that gestured to the
landscape. Before formulas set in, suburbia was the petri dish.

THE WEIRD SCIENCE OF ANGELIC POSSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(Eds.: Game notes at end of review.) 
 By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new kid in town, and he's not like the macho,
muscle-bound heros brandishing brazen attitudes and big guns in
games like Quake III and Unreal Tournament. His name is Bob, and
he's the cute little cherub starring in Messiah, a new 3-D action
game from Interplay.
</P>
<P>
   The world that Bob is sent from heaven to save is a distressed
one. The apocalypse has come, and those who have survived it are
none too happy or friendly. Outfitted only in diapers and a cuddly
layer of baby fat, Bob explores a realm that includes gorgeously
rendered burned-out alleys, Byzantine factories and processing
plants where the main ingredient is all too human.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, Bob is one of the mightiest heroes to hit
the gaming scene in a long time. His secret weapon is possession:
He can take over anyone's body, usually the bodies of those who can
get him access to the next level of the game through a special key,
a code or sheer firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of hosts is crucial. Guards, for instance, can open
only some doors, while lab technicians have special skills needed
to operate certain machinery. Maintenance workers _ by far the
funniest of the bunch, they wear baggy jeans and utter niceties
like ``Hey, little fella'' and ``Well, I'll be'' _ wield
blowtorches, used for repairing faulty elevators.
</P>
<P>
   The game player has a third-person point of view, following the
actions of Bob as if floating over his shoulder (or over the
shoulder of whatever body he inhabits). Getting Bob into the body
of any of the characters takes stealth and good aim. In most cases,
Bob's best tactic is to sneak up behind the soon-to-be host, then
make a flying leap to land square between the shoulder blades.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Bob's possession of the host will take place
without anyone's noticing. That may seem more than a little fishy
since the excruciatingly all-consuming act occurs with a startling
flash of pyrotechnics and gasping sounds that go a long way to
indicate the unpleasant role the host must now play. It's hard to
believe that anyone nearby wouldn't run in horror. Still, in this
game's weird science, stealth begets a kind of invisibility and the
safety it offers.
</P>
<P>
   A translucent halo floats above the host's head _ handy in
heated firepower situations when it is sometimes hard to tell just
which soldier you're playing. Once the shooting starts, both fellow
soldiers and the rebels they're fighting, whose allegiance you'll
switch to and possess in the dank underbellies of the havoc-racked
futurescape, will turn on you and blast away, once they see Bob pop
out of a deceased body. Bob must then quickly fly into another,
playing this form of human-host pinball as many times as necessary
until the last man or woman standing is the one you will continue
with. For a while, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Bob will sometimes have no more use for his host
and will need to escape it so he can run around barefoot or duck
under stuck doorways. Or, more enthralling, he may rise to a higher
place by using his angelic wings, which he beats with a
whoosh-whoosh sound and which grow more powerful as the game
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   But depossession has its nasty side effects. A few moments after
Bob springs from the host's head with fireworks, the soldiers, and
at times even the gentler inhabitants, will attack Bob. Sometimes
the attacks are with firepower or fists, and sometimes they come
with swift kicks punctuated by curses and taunts like ``take that''
or ``little punk.''
</P>
<P>
   One strategy for depossession involves having Bob stand his host
in a corner and then abandon the body, sneaking to safety before
the host has time to turn around and spot him. An even better
tactic is to abandon the body with a swan dive off a high ledge.
That lets Bob flap backward to safety while the useless host falls
to its death with a bone-smashing thud.
</P>
<P>
   With all its profanity and often graphic violence, Messiah isn't
for the faint-hearted. The explicit religious references (Bob is
supposed to be acting on the orders of God to restore order to the
world) might also offend some players. Bob's selection of unseemly
hosts even lands him in a lustful red-light district known as Sex
City. Once there, he will get into the tormented hearts, burned-out
minds and scantily clad bodies of prostitutes, a transvestite and
eventually a particularly unhygienic pimp.
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Bladerunner'' meets ``Dogma,'' and you will begin to
understand the feeling Messiah is trying to evoke. Players who stay
in the game through the first few levels discover that the voice
that is bellowing orders at Bob with a rising tone of menace
belongs not to God but to an imposter. Hint: Hell won't be freezing
over anytime soon as long as it's under this bad guy's watch. And
it's up to Bob to stop the masquerader in an extremely challenging,
mischievous, apocalyptic showdown ending that comes far too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In its short in-store life, Messiah has had a history of
technical problems, including lockups and quirks and
incompatibilities with certain video and sound cards.
</P>
<P>
   Players and would-be players passionately vent these gripes and
others in news groups and on the official Messiah Web page. My
version didn't play any of the accompanying music tracks by the
rock band Fear Factory, which Interplay made a big deal of
promoting during the game's much-delayed development, which took
more than two years. Other than that, Messiah played fine on my
computer, running under Windows 2000 Professional no less, which
isn't exactly touted as being game-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the company posted the latest patch to correct many
of the game's errors, I had already reached the open-ended ending,
which finds Bob tired, alone, wandering and wondering where
everyone has gone. He calls out: ``Hello? Dad? I'm ready to come to
heaven.'' It's a poignant moment.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts aside, Bob is an engaging character, vulnerable and
sympathetic. He even elicits a weird sort of affection as he draws
out his finger and utters an earnest ``bang'' to desperate effect,
finishing with a little blow on his finger as though it were a
smoking gun, his lower lip pushed out in defiance as his attackers
swarm and ultimately overtake him. Thank goodness the Save Game
feature lets you back up to your last safe point to try another
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Messiah transcends much of the usual senseless
carnage that describes most first-person shooter games. For gaming
mortals equipped with fast computers and 3-D video cards capable of
running the game with no hang-ups, Bob's role in taking on the
presumed Almighty is mighty entertaining. But for those unlucky
souls whose systems can't accommodate Messiah, heaven will have to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   GAME NOTES:

PLAN WARNED OF `MODERATE' RISK THAT FIRE WOULD ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ A National Park Service plan for igniting
what has become the largest fire in New Mexico history said the
danger that the blaze would escape beyond its bounds was
``moderate.'' It said any damage would likely be confined to
``timber and private land values,'' not buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the plan warned that federal
officials might be underestimating the danger that such a fire, set
to reduce the possibility of dangerous, unplanned fires, might
spill beyond its intended limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have not lost one in a long time and are starting to feel
a little smug,'' said the 250-page plan, dated April 19 and filed
to the National Park Service headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that before the fire was set, the National
Weather Service told Park Service officials that winds would be
brisk, humidity low and the chance of volatility high. Park Service
officials have said that they knew there was some danger of the
fire spreading, but that conditions for a successful controlled
fire were similar to those for a dangerous wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the plan was made available by federal investigators
who are tracing the decisions that led to the fire, which has
consumed more than 46,000 acres, destroyed more than 200 homes and
shut down the nation's leading nuclear weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of the investigation are scheduled to be
released here on Thursday, when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
will arrive to oversee an event that has the potential to reshape
the government's fire policy.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the days since the Los Alamos blaze began to rage
out of control, the government has imposed a 30-day ban in the West
on the kinds of deliberate firestarting that led to the
conflagration. The fire was set by the Park Service at Bandelier
National Monument on May 4 to diminish the chances of a
catastrophic wildfire. The goal was to clear away underbrush that
had accumulated over years in which federal policy has emphasized
suppressing fires, rather than allowing them to run their course.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, fire officials said, firefighters had controlled
about 45 percent of the blaze. The remaining portion was burning in
heavily forested areas north and east of Los Alamos, out of range
of human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear who wrote the planning document for the fire,
because all names were blacked out in the version released by the
federal investigators. A spokeswoman would not identify the authors
or recipients of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document revealed deep apprehension among federal
experts about risks inherent in the setting of fires, even though
the practice has become a routine part of the practice of forest
management.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the burn in the Los Alamos area warned that
escaping flames were ``somewhat likely'' and that ``political
problems'' that might could affect future controlled fires. The
language seemed to refer to the potential for ``adverse publicity''
should the fire go awry and threaten the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory, the founding home of the nation's nuclear
weapons program, remains closed, along with schools and most
businesses in the area. Most residents in the town of Los Alamos
have been allowed to return home, but at least 20 percent of the
town remains off-limits, with more than 400 structures burned.
</P>
<P>
   About one in 100 of the controlled fires ignited by federal
workers typically escapes beyond the expected bounds, Forest
Service officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Los Alamos fire, the report filed in April
calculated fire's expected range at 968 acres. Instead, driven by
high winds and fueled by dry weather conditions, it has consumed
some 50 times that amount of territory.
</P>
<P>
   The wind-driven fire quickly overran the burn area and roared
into Los Alamos. Some lawmakers have called for a re-examination of
the nation's controlled burn policies, which have been put on hold
in 11 Western states until at least June 11.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Superintendent Roy Weaver, who took responsibility
for igniting the blaze, has been placed on paid leave and declined
requests to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The plan spelled out a number of conditions that should have
been satisfied before any fire was ignited. It was unclear whether
any of the conditions had been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The plan said dead wood in the burn area was to be tested for
moisture content for at least three weeks before the fire was set
and weather conditions were to be monitored hourly afterward.
Smaller test fires were to be set before the big one. For the
planned fire to take place, the plan said temperatures were to be
between 40 and 90 degrees, with relative humidity of 15 percent to
20 percent and wind speeds of no more than 8 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A National Weather Service report sent to the Park Service the
day the fire began forecast temperatures of 68 to 72 degrees and a
humidity of 14 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that weather also forecast winds of 5 mph to 10 mph at lower
elevations and 10 mph at the ridge tops. Additionally, winds were
projected to increase the next day to up to 15 mph, with gusts
reaching 20 mph at the ridge tops.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicted humidity would fall overnight,
creating dry and unstable air, making for conditions in which
wildfires can easily rage.

CBS ADDS COMEDIES, AIMING MIDLER AT `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a week in which all the networks are announcing their new
fall television lineups, CBS is the first to take the bold step of
predicting flat out that it has a hit series on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Bette Show,'' a new comedy starring Bette Midler, and
CBS is demonstrating its ultimate faith in it by scheduling it on
Wednesday at 8 p.m., where it will challenge the ABC juggernaut
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives called it the best comedy they have developed in
years. It had better be, because it will lead off CBS' Wednesday
night lineup against ``Millionaire'' and will shelter another new
comedy, ``Welcome to New York,'' under its wing. The executives
said they were trying to expand the store of comedies because CBS
really has only one night, Monday, on which comedies have worked.
So CBS is adding three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bette Show'' will get the most attention because it is
Midler's first attempt at a television series. Essentially, she
plays a fictionalized version of herself, an entertainer who keeps
her household in turmoil, including a professor husband and a
13-year-old daughter trying to escape her mother's outsize image.
She also has a manager and an accompanist: Midler is expected to
sing every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to New York'' stars Christine Baranski as a producer
of a morning television show in New York. The show hires a green
weatherman from Indiana played by the stand-up comedian Jim
Gaffigan.
</P>
<P>
   The network's third new comedy gets the best spot on the CBS
schedule, Monday nights at 8:30 between ``King of Queens'' and
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' It is ``Yes, Dear,'' a show about two
couples whose life styles differ widely, especially when it comes
to raising children. The show stars Mike O'Malley, who failed
spectacularly with a comedy for NBC last season.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' four new dramas are headed by a show that few took
seriously when it was first proposed: a remake of the classic
series ``The Fugitive.'' It is basically the same as the one that
set ratings records in the 1960s with David Janssen and then became
a hit film starring Harrison Ford. It now stars Tim Daly as Dr.
Richard Kimble, who escapes execution and hunts for the one-armed
man he believes killed his wife. One switch is that his pursuer,
Lt. Gerard, is an African-American with his own personal baggage.
He is played by Mykelti Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``CSI,'' another crime drama, is about a criminal investigation
unit that uses forensic science to solve crimes in Las Vegas. It
stars William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger. A third
crime-oriented drama, ``The District,'' stars Craig T. Nelson as a
police commissioner in Washington. Finally there is ``That's
Life,'' a family drama about a 30-year-old woman who returns to
college. It stars Heather Paige Kent and Ellen Burstyn.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is dropping ``Early Edition,'' ``Ladies Man,'' ``Cosby,''
``Martial Law'' and ``Now and Again.'' It has also juggled the time
periods of its three Thursday night shows.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the new CBS schedule:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: `Kings of Queens,'' ``Yes, Dear,'' ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' ``Becker,'' ``Family Law.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: ``JAG,'' ``60 Minutes II,'' ``Judging Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: ``The Bette Show,'' ``Welcome to New York,'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: ``48 Hours,'' ``City of Angels,'' ``Diagnosis
Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: ``The Fugitive,'' ``CSI'' ``Nash Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: ``That's Life,'' ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' ``The
District.''
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Touched By an Angel,'' movies.

JAPAN'S FINANCE MINISTER DENIES BRIBERY CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on Tuesday denied
charges that when he was prime minister he bribed a politician for
his silence.
</P>
<P>
   The politician, Kishiro Nakamura, who served as construction
minister from 1992 to 1993, said in court on Monday that Miyazawa
handed him a paper bag containing 3 million yen, or roughly $27,000
at current exchange rates, in cash when he visited the prime
minister's residence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Nakamura said Miyazawa did not say what the money was for, but
he assumed it was to silence his opposition to government efforts
at the time to increase fines for violating Japanese antitrust
laws. At the time, he was serving as the acting chairman of the
ruling party council that was studying reform of the antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Nakamura also said in court that he believed he was later given
the construction portfolio _ a powerful cabinet position because of
the vast sums of taxpayer money Japan spends on public works
projects _ because the ruling Liberal Democratic Party hoped to
keep the bribe secret. Nakamura, a member of the Lower House of
Parliament since 1976, served in the cabinet during Miyazawa's
tenure as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came during hearings in an appellate court, where
Nakamura is contesting a lower court conviction on charges that he
accepted 10 million yen in another bribery case.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Miyazawa said the accusations were unfounded. ``I
have no memory at all'' of the activities Nakamura described,
Miyazawa said. He characterized the charges as ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of Japanese political scandals, this one is
minor. But Miyazawa's international stature is such that any hint
that his tenure as finance minister may soon come to an end has the
potential to upset financial markets. Indeed, the yen's fall
against the dollar in early trading Tuesday was attributed in part
to the brewing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But Miyazawa has already told some ruling party officials that
he wants to leave his post at the Finance Ministry sometime after
the upcoming election, which is widely expected to be called for
June 25, according to party insiders who asked not to be
identified. A finance ministry spokesman said he did not know the
minister's plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, 80, relinquished control of the party faction he
controlled in December 1998, and he has asked to run for a
proportionally elected seat in the next election rather than a
directly elected seat, a sign many regard as his desire to take a
more marginal role in government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He has thus far refused to say anything publicly about his
plans, perhaps in deference to the concerns party elders have that
his departure could further complicate Japan's role in the Okinawa
summit meeting of world leaders scheduled for late July. Miyazawa,
who has developed strong ties to U.S. leaders since serving as a
translator during the American occupation of Japan after World War
II, is considered the man in Japan best able to keep the subtly
tense economic relationship between the two countries from erupting
into contentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the one constant figure of authority in a country
that changes its prime ministers almost as frequently as Italy.
President Clinton, for example, has dealt with seven different
Japanese prime ministers during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa is also the cabinet minister that has most sought to
call a halt to the vast public spending that underpins Japan's
deficit, which has risen to levels that are unparalleled globally
and historically. And he was pivotal in arranging a bailout package
for the Japanese banks in 1997, when the financial system was
teetering on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Miyazawa has found himself embroiled
in a bribery scandal. He resigned as finance minister in 1988 after
being implicated in a scheme by the Recruit Co. to buy political
influence.
</P>
<P>
   And some still remember him as one of the chief architects of
the ``bubble'' economy that defined Japan in the 1980s and became
the root of the problems it has suffered for the last decade.

`HUNTS IN DREAMS': PUCKISH RAMBLINGS IN A MIDSUMMER WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How incompetent at reality the characters are in Tom Drury's
beguiling novel _ beguiling and itself not 100 percent
reality-competent. A common enough thing, this, in an age when
reality can seem to float and a brightly attuned young writer may
not feel authorized to assert it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only truly competent character in the book is
Micah, a little boy. But then in childhood, where the mind needs
straying room to accommodate growth (an infant's skull bones drift
for the same reason), it is essential sometimes to see things
askew. In that respect, competence at reality lies in being
incompetent at it.
</P>
<P>
   Micah is the youngest member of the Darling family, residents of
a Midwestern farm town. Like Charles, his father; Joan, his mother;
and his stepsister Lyris, he spends a long summer weekend
wandering. Even in the most traditionally settled American
heartland life is an unmoored thing, ``Hunts in Dreams'' suggests.
The title sketches the theme.
</P>
<P>
   The four Darlings amble through something resembling separate
fugue states; so do the other people in the book. Sunny, funny and
lurching into disconcert, the fugues are musical as well as
dismaying, their zigzags the best attempt the characters can make
at straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, the local plumber, pursues a well-meaning principle of
order without knowing how to go about it. He makes a series of
far-fetched efforts to recover a fine old shotgun his stepfather
once gave to the town minister. The minister's widow hung it over
her fireplace and refused to sell it to Charles, who finds it
demeaning that a thoroughbred weapon should be reduced to an
ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Joan, convinced that their marriage has gone dead,
packs to attend an animal-rights convention in a nearby city,
hoping to find romance and change her life. A vague suspicion
prompts Charles to the antiromance precaution of emptying her
makeup kit and substituting walnuts. Joan and the lover she
acquires _ a smitten doctor neighbor who has followed her to the
city _ nibble the walnuts to go with the vodka from her hotel
room's minibar.
</P>
<P>
   Lyris, a teen-ager, has only joined the Darlings recently. An
unmarried actress at the time of her daughter's birth, Joan had
left her at an orphanage; later Lyris lived with four successive
sets of foster parents. When explosives were found in the home of
the last set (Lyris scorched her jeans while ironing them and the
smoke alerted the authorities), Joan was traced.
</P>
<P>
   Though welcomed into her family, Lyris is insecure; on the same
night that Joan goes off and Charles is breaking into the
gun-widow's house (the widow smashes him in the nose with a heavy
coat hanger and gives him a cold compress for the blood), she takes
a ride with Follard, an unbalanced young man. When she nervously
asks to go home, his answer is all the creepier for its fashionable
blur of text and reality:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would take you, but the car's out of gas. Or it's
thrown a rod, or the key's in the trunk, or there is no car. This
is another story that I'm telling now, and this one is true. He
wanted to take her home but could not, and therefore, with nothing
better to do. . . . You see where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Micah, deposited at his grandmother's so Charles can go
burglarizing, he is unable to sleep. He ventures out in his pajamas
and makes a dreamlike peregrination through the town's deserted
streets.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a number of lovely passages stretched between
lyrical and cockeyed that give a Puck-like air to Drury's midsummer
night's dream-hunt (even to its subliminal ``what fools these
mortals be''). When Lyris manages to get away from Follard by
jumping into the river and taking to the dark woods, she removes
her wet socks under the gaze of an owl in a nearby tree. She
resumes her flight: ``Soon the owl overtook her, flying low beneath
the branches with one of her socks snagged in its talons. Its body
hung like a weight from the yoke of its wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Misdirections abound, though most come out all right. Follard's
later evil efforts, for instance, are frustrated by his pure
incompetence. Drury is tender toward his characters (like many of
his contemporaries, he uses an absurdist black light, but in his
case the result is shade more than darkness). Meaning well, they
occasionally manage to do well.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lovely sequence in which, with some difficulty,
Charles gets Micah the pet goat he longs for. An old farmer advises
about the diet: separate buckets of oats, lamb feed and sunflower
seed. To a child, suddenly, it is the newfound joy of the world's
specifics: ``Many buckets, and one with black sunflower seeds . . .
The future was taking shape before Micah's eyes and it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan's wandering is sensitively handled for a while. Her tryst
with the doctor _ a figure of at least equal zaniness and
misdirection _ is blissful and comically vague. When they stroll
out together in the early morning, the walk seems more real to her
than the love-making. ``Now what do we do?'' she wonders. ``We have
no present.'' She continues her fugue alone; and here, in a series
of incidents I would have to call toylike, Drury falls into some
arch contrivance.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he avoids it. ``Hunts in Dreams'' is just short of
allegory, but the characters have a comic innocence that persuades
us quite a way into even their more far-fetched ventures. The
Darlings' struggles to find a balance in an unmoored world carry
some real eloquence. ``Sometimes I feel like whatever I'm supposed
to be is tacked to the back wall of the universe and moving away
from me at the speed of light,'' Joan complains, uniting the
contemporary states of physics and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying on with physics a moment to suggest the problem with
this perceptive and captivating book: the characters are convincing
in the postmodern wooziness with which they feel and think, most of
all about their own lives. These float touchingly, but Drury cannot
or does not choose to get them to tread hard enough for a reality
that is more than conceptual. They do fine as wave; not so well as
particle.

CD-ROM GAME `PANTY RAIDER' DRAWS RANGE OF PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scheduled release on Saturday of a new CD-ROM game, ``Panty
Raider: From Here to Immaturity,'' has drawn protests from a wide
range of organizations: groups on the Christian right, national
advocacy groups for women and girls, and a group of hard-core
gamers. Many of them are using phone calls, e-mail, letters and
even prayer in an effort to halt the distribution of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is for the player to strip cartoon
supermodels down to their underwear, take their photographs and
deliver the photos to three sex-starved aliens before the aliens
blow up the earth in ``hormone-driven anger.''
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that goal, the player uses pickup lines supplied
by the game, clothes-dissolving goop and bait, like a lunch of tiny
breath mints and credit cards, which a press release says ``no
self-respecting supermodel can resist.'' Created by Hypnotix for
Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive, the game was rated M by the
Entertainment Software Review board, indicating that the game is
aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlton Kendrick, a family therapist in Boston, said adults
were not the intended audience. ``Anybody who hasn't been
lobotomized knows that this game is not being geared toward mature
teens or grown-ups,'' said Kendrick, a consultant for the
FamilyEducation Network, which operates a group of Web sites and
issued a statement calling for Simon &AMP; Schuster to halt the game's
release. ``This is aimed at pubescent little boys who are trying to
sneak onto Web sites and see porn.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests seem to have been sparked by Dads and Daughters, a
national group based in Duluth, Minn., whose mission is to urge
fathers to help their daughters develop self-esteem without regard
to how they look. The group took up the cause against ``Panty
Raider'' and asked its members to send letters of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kelly, founder of the group, said the protest had ``gotten
the biggest response on any actions we've done.'' Kelly said the
game treated women as objects and made fun of anorexia. He said it
sent the message that ``I'm a male, I have sex on my mind _ if I
don't get it, I'm going to kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the National Center for Policy Research for Women
and Families and the Center for Health and Gender Equity have also
denounced the game as offensive. The American Family Association
has asked members to pray that Viacom, the parent company of Simon
&AMP; Schuster, will choose not to release the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not for kids at all,'' said Peter Binazeski, a
spokesman for Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive. ``It is for mature
adults only and is being marketed accordingly.'' He described the
problem of the product's getting in the hands of children as ``a
retail issue,'' and added, ``I think a parent is the one who should
be there watching.'' Binazeski said that he had received only five
letters protesting the game's release but that many e-mail messages
had been sent to the company's ``Panty Raider'' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protest letters outweigh support 60-40,'' he said. ``We've
gotten quite a few e-mails from people saying it's hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Some adult male gamers are not thrilled either. ``Please don't
accuse us of not getting the joke of `Panty Raider' or of being
politically correct zealots,'' Chris Kramer wrote in an article for
DailyRadar.com about the game's release. ``We're as PC as `Panty
Raider' is funny: not at all.'' He called the premise of the game
``heinously stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kay, senior editor of MyVideoGames.com, said that even
though the premise of the game was ``unusually dumb,'' calls for
censoring it were even more worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said the game's list price, $19.99, indicated that even
Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive did not consider ``Panty Raider'' much
of a game. Most high-profile games sell for $40 and up, he said, so
the low price indicates that ``Panty Raider'' may be headed
``straight for the bargain bins.''
</P>
<P>
   Binazeski explained the price by saying, ``It's considered a
casual game, not a game you'd play for hours and hours, and it's
priced accordingly.''

BOOK TALK: `FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' _ RUN IT UP, SEE WHO SALUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: in reference to ``M.A.S.H,'' replace points with
asterisks) 
By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``No one wants to read a book about old men weeping
into the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   This was perhaps the harshest of 27 rejections that a particular
book proposal received when it was offered around in New York in
1997 and 1998. But there were 26 others, representing nearly all of
the most esteemed publishers in the country. They were just as
unyieldingly dense, if not quite as nasty, when it came to
evaluating the project's possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as it turned out, one of those fantastical enormities in
judgment, as unprophetic as it was ridiculous, that engulfs the
industry periodically, like the coming of the locust. For the book
dismissed with such general brio by publishing's best and brightest
has become the surprise runaway nonfiction best seller of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``Flags of Our Fathers,'' the story of the six young men
who raised a flag on Iwo Jima and who, by accident, became forever
part of the iconic frieze of what the book's authors call ``The
Photograph.'' Written by James Bradley, son of one of the
flag-raisers, with Ron Powers, the book (from Bantam) will be No. 3
on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list on Sunday and
will rise to No. 2 the following week. It had an initial printing
of 60,000 when it went on sale May 2. There are now 270,000 in
print.
</P>
<P>
   So why was it so soundly and roundly rejected? The acquisition
of a book is mostly a subjective decision, often involving nothing
more than personal taste, but of course there are other factors.
Was the proposal submitted by the writer and the agent compelling?
Will the finished product deliver on the promise of that proposal?
Will it be too hard to get the manuscript in publishable shape?
Will it be a good book? Will anybody buy it? (Certainly it is true
that most books celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of
World War II went unread.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, maybe even subliminal reason. Most of
today's book editors and publishers were culturally formed by the
1960s and '70s and seem to suffer that Manhattan-West Coast
ambivalence toward, if not aversion to, things military. As one
publisher said: ``There's a snobbishness about book people. They
aren't attracted intellectually to stories about soldiers. They are
seen as Middle America books, which is still a hard sell to
editors. Even editors who come from Middle America like to forget
that.'' (Give a publisher Tom Clancy, and see how he overcomes this
allergy.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' began to change that
antagonism for soldiering, but ``Flags'' was offered around before
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``Flags'' is not the first hugely successful book that was
hideously rejected, although most of them were fiction works.
Twenty-three publishers rejected the first Dr. Seuss book, and John
Grisham had trouble getting sold. Seventeen didn't want Irving
Stone's ``Lust for Life.'' Twenty-two said no to Richard Hooker's
``M.A.S.H,'' and 18 disdained ``Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' by
Richard Bach. Laurence Peter's ``Peter Principle'' failed to entice
16 publishers, and Thor Heyerdahl's true tale of crossing the
Pacific on a raft, ``Kon-Tiki,'' simply wasn't exciting enough for
20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Little comfort to the authors and agents for ``Flags'' back in
1998. A number of the rejects suggested, in the words of one, that
``nobody saw a particularly big market'' for the work. Indeed, one
prominent editor and one publisher known for his literary smarts
each thought that ``Flags'' would make a dandy magazine article,
but forget it as a book. In a manuscript that was really all about
the personal stories of six individuals, one editor, speaking for
himself and five colleagues, wrote that the biggest problem ``was
trying to figure out how to present the personal stories.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't my intent to embarrass anyone, so I am leaving the
blameworthy nameless. And to be fair, the book's proposal underwent
changes when Powers was brought in as the writer, and the project
was given to two new agents, Frank Weinmann and Jim Hornfischer,
but nonetheless one would have thought that some smart editor
somewhere would have seen its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one finally did. She was Katie Hall, then 30, an unwarlike
editor at Bantam, who grew up in Indiana and graduated from DePauw
University and who actually didn't think of it as a war book at
all, or even a ``boy'' book. She recalled: ``You had to see beyond
the battle of Iwo Jima. It was the back story that counted, six
boys who grew up in the '30s and who came together from all parts
of small-town America, and did this by accident. We could tell a
story about what it was like to be a kid in the '30s. There's a big
America between the coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hall, now a senior editor, tells it: ``Perhaps it wasn't that
clearly shown in the proposal, but it was so obvious immediately. I
walked into Irwyn's,'' that's Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of the
Bantam Dell Publishing Group, ``and said, `There's a beautiful back
story here.' And he got it immediately and said, `Let's go for
it.''' And they did, for an advance of only $75,000. Hall says that
perhaps her Indiana roots helped her ``see'' the book in the
proposal. On the other hand, Applebaum grew up in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Quite naturally, Bradley and Powers are thrilled with Hall.
``Before she came along,'' Bradley said, ``I was used to very
literate people sitting down and composing a letter telling me what
an idiot I am. You know the title of the book that was in my mind
was `Mothers and Sons,' so I was glad to have a female editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers was equally impressed. ``She understood military history
and was interested in having a salable product,'' he said. ``But
she was also interested in a strong narrative. I give her a lot of
credit for our success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flags'' is apparently destined to become one of those great
word-of-mouth best sellers. Everyone I know who has read it, myself
included, has urged it on friends. Will it start a trend, since
publishers, like moviemakers, seem slavish at times to trends? Most
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Probably ``Flags'' has been helped by Tom Brokaw's two best
sellers, ``The Greatest Generation'' and ``The Greatest Generation
Speaks'' (both from Random House), the latter a collection of
letters by people who fought in World War II. But one wonders: If
those books had not been proposed by a celebrity, would anyone have
published them?

MORE ETHIOPIAN TROOPS MOVE INTO ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKOMBIA, Eritrea _ Ethiopia's drive into Eritrea intensified on
Wednesday, as dozens of tanks and thousands of troops streamed
north to join a battle for control of the area around the strategic
town of Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   For the two years of the war, the fighting has been confined
largely to a sophisticated network of trenches along the nations'
border. But five days after Ethiopia mounted an offensive, the
trenches are empty and the war has shifted firmly into Eritrean
territory. Barentu is about 40 miles from the Ethiopian border, and
about 19 miles from this market village to the south.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, Ethiopian jets streaked toward Barentu,
and smoke could be seen from here rising from the area. Ethiopian
officials said its army was 4 miles south of the town _ one of two
major supply routes to the westernmost front of the war _ and
advancing in heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean officials said their soldiers had repulsed several
assaults on Barentu but said the Ethiopians' gains _ which have
emptied several Eritrean towns in the path of advancing troops _
confirmed the worst: Eritrea, until 1993 the northernmost province
of Ethiopia, has always maintained that Ethiopia had its eye on
permanently taking territory.
</P>
<P>
   The war started in May 1998 as a dispute over contested spots
along the nations' 620-mile border. ``Ethiopia says it wants to
regain contested territory, but then why do they keep trying to
gain territory beyond the contested territory according to the
colonial maps?'' Yemane Ghebremeskel, an aide to Eritrea's
president, said on Wednesday to the French news agency in the
capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   But Haile Kiros, an Ethiopian spokesman, said the nation's
interest was purely in retaking land it said was invaded by Eritrea
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is only to regain our territory,'' he said.
``The invading forces have to be pushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of calm along the border, Ethiopia launched
an offensive on Friday, saying it wanted a quick end to a war that
has drained its economy and complicated a food shortage that has
affected millions of its citizens. While Eritrea has condemned
Ethiopia for reigniting the fighting and for reluctance in signing
a peace accord, Ethiopia has said Eritrea was the original
aggressor and needed to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, government officials
said its soldiers had shot down an Eritrean MiG fighter jet after
it had bombed recaptured territory on Tuesday. Here, Ethiopian
troops poured through this town on the way north to Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   As they did, dozens of other Ethiopian troops looted the town,
whose residents fled during the fighting on Saturday. Ethiopian
soldiers picked through the mud-and-thatch houses and emptied shops
in the main square. One soldier carried an umbrella and a soccer
ball; another two new axes and a bottle of vegetable oil. Abdu
Seid, a 22-year-old company commander, said that despite
appearances, no one was really looting. The soldiers were dirty
after all the fighting, he said, and looking for things they could
bathe with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to wash ourselves,'' he said. ``People have taken only
what they need,'' he said.

over as well. Just about anything asssociated with Johnny Reb tends
to incite controversy, even though the modern aviation buffs have
nothing to do with the War Between the States. So the Confederate

 &HT;    BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 'STOCK MARKET ROULETTE,' GORE CLAIMS
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush's plan to partially
privatize the federal retirement system would ``take security out
of Social Security'' and ask people to ``play stock market
roulette,'' Vice President Al Gore warned seniors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 8,000 delegates at the biennial AARP
convention, Gore said the Texas governor's recent statements about
reforming Social Security have raised numerous questions about the
program's future.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a debate on Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really settle for so many unanswered questions on an
issue as important as Social Security?'' Gore asked. ``He deserves
a chance to fill in the blanks on his plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was accompanied here by his 87-year-old mother,
Pauline, called Social Security _ which covers 44 million Americans
with retirement, disability and survivors benefits _ ``the greatest
act of social policy in the entire history of the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that Bush's proposal could be a first step toward full
privatization of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the end of Social Security as we know it,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said there were no plans
to replace Social Security with a fully privatized system. Instead,
he said Bush's plan would ``save and strengthen Social Security and
have money available for people in addition to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, declined
invitations to appear at the convention either in person or on
video, said AARP Executive Director Horace Deets.
</P>
<P>
   Deets noted that Bush was the only presidential candidate of
either party to fail to appear at AARP-sponsored candidate forums
in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say they are snubbing us. ... They just haven't
accepted a number of invitations, and it's kind of hard to
understand why,'' Deets said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said scheduling problems prevented the Texas governor
from attending the convention. Bush was campaigning in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bush said Gore ``is willing to try and
scare the elderly and frighten people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job as the president is to assure Congress that I will
spend the capital necessary to get something done and lay out the
framework for reform,'' Bush said. ``This is an issue that shows
the vice president is mired in the past and my campaign is willing
to think about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer scoffed at Gore's call for a debate on Social
Security, commenting that Gore has issued 68 challenges for debates
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no shortage of opportunity for debates,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his speech to question Bush's statements this week on
Social Security. Although Bush has not offered a detailed plan, he
said he wants younger workers to have the option of investing a
portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by workers and
employers in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said such a plan would be unfair because it would not
provide guaranteed benefits to all retirees, ``and you shouldn't
have to foot the bill for those who do play and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a warm reception for his Social Security comments,
but received the loudest applause when he said he would work to
ensure that doctors make medical decisions without interference
from health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Minna Wilensky, an AARP member from West Palm Beach, Fla., said
Gore ``hit the correct note with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in investing in the stock market. I'm a
Depression kid and I don't forget what happened in 1929 and 1930,''
Wilensky said, adding that Social Security has ``given us a base
for the prosperity of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holden, another AARP member from West Palm Beach, said he
strongly believes people should be encouraged to invest in the
stock market as part of their retirement income planning, ``but
there should be a portion of our retirement income that is
guaranteed, and that would be from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   George Puca, an AARP member from Atlanta, said, ``I think, for
the most part, he (Gore) was right. Back in 1932 when the New Deal
started, every American working man and woman was made a promise,
and the United States government ought to keep its promise. Gore's
plan is more realistic than the other plan.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   James Dunham, 65, a retired district fire chief from Dayton,
Ohio, said Gore ``kicked butt today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the right things for the people here and in the
nation. You don't put all of that money into stocks and bonds,
because there are some people who will make some bad decisions and
some people who will make good decisions,'' Dunham said.
</P>
<P>
   Although AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired
Persons, has not taken a position on any Social Security plan,
Deets said Bush's plan raised serious questions about the risks of
a privatize plan versus the guarantees of the existing program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has indicated he would appoint a bipartisan
commission to decide how much of the payroll tax to divert into
private accounts, several other proposals have suggested that 2
percentage points should be invested. Gore noted that would reduce
Social Security revenues used to pay current retirees by 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 years, that reduction in revenues could total $1
trillion in transition costs, Gore said. ``How would Governor Bush
pay for that $1 trillion?''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer, asked about Gore's statement, quipped: ``Just as Al
Gore invented the Internet, he will invent numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that his plan, which would use the projected
federal budget surplus to pay off the national debt by 2011 and
credit the savings to Social Security _ plus the saved interest
payments on the debt _ could keep the program financially solvent
until 2054.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the debt and stimulating the economy could even
extend the trust fund's life for the 75 years used as a benchmark
for the program's health, he said.

 &HT;    BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 'STOCK MARKET ROULETTE,' GORE CLAIMS
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush's plan to partially
privatize the federal retirement system would ``take security out
of Social Security'' and ask people to ``play stock market
roulette,'' Vice President Al Gore warned seniors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 8,000 delegates at the biennial AARP
convention, Gore said the Texas governor's recent statements about
reforming Social Security have raised numerous questions about the
program's future.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a debate on Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really settle for so many unanswered questions on an
issue as important as Social Security?'' Gore asked. ``He deserves
a chance to fill in the blanks on his plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was accompanied here by his 87-year-old mother,
Pauline, called Social Security _ which covers 44 million Americans
with retirement, disability and survivors benefits _ ``the greatest
act of social policy in the entire history of the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that Bush's proposal could be a first step toward full
privatization of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the end of Social Security as we know it,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said there were no plans
to replace Social Security with a fully privatized system. Instead,
he said Bush's plan would ``save and strengthen Social Security and
have money available for people in addition to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, declined
invitations to appear at the convention either in person or on
video, said AARP Executive Director Horace Deets.
</P>
<P>
   Deets noted that Bush was the only presidential candidate of
either party to fail to appear at AARP-sponsored candidate forums
in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say they are snubbing us. ... They just haven't
accepted a number of invitations, and it's kind of hard to
understand why,'' Deets said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said scheduling problems prevented the Texas governor
from attending the convention. Bush was campaigning in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bush said Gore ``is willing to try and
scare the elderly and frighten people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job as the president is to assure Congress that I will
spend the capital necessary to get something done and lay out the
framework for reform,'' Bush said. ``This is an issue that shows
the vice president is mired in the past and my campaign is willing
to think about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer scoffed at Gore's call for a debate on Social
Security, commenting that Gore has issued 68 challenges for debates
with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no shortage of opportunity for debates,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his speech to question Bush's statements this week on
Social Security. Although Bush has not offered a detailed plan, he
said he wants younger workers to have the option of investing a
portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid by workers and
employers in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said such a plan would be unfair because it would not
provide guaranteed benefits to all retirees, ``and you shouldn't
have to foot the bill for those who do play and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a warm reception for his Social Security comments,
but received the loudest applause when he said he would work to
ensure that doctors make medical decisions without interference
from health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Minna Wilensky, an AARP member from West Palm Beach, Fla., said
Gore ``hit the correct note with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in investing in the stock market. I'm a
Depression kid and I don't forget what happened in 1929 and 1930,''
Wilensky said, adding that Social Security has ``given us a base
for the prosperity of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holden, another AARP member from West Palm Beach, said he
strongly believes people should be encouraged to invest in the
stock market as part of their retirement income planning, ``but
there should be a portion of our retirement income that is
guaranteed, and that would be from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   George Puca, an AARP member from Atlanta, said, ``I think, for
the most part, he (Gore) was right. Back in 1932 when the New Deal
started, every American working man and woman was made a promise,
and the United States government ought to keep its promise. Gore's
plan is more realistic than the other plan.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   James Dunham, 65, a retired district fire chief from Dayton,
Ohio, said Gore ``kicked butt today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the right things for the people here and in the
nation. You don't put all of that money into stocks and bonds,
because there are some people who will make some bad decisions and
some people who will make good decisions,'' Dunham said.
</P>
<P>
   Although AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired
Persons, has not taken a position on any Social Security plan,
Deets said Bush's plan raised serious questions about the risks of
a privatize plan versus the guarantees of the existing program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has indicated he would appoint a bipartisan
commission to decide how much of the payroll tax to divert into
private accounts, several other proposals have suggested that 2
percentage points should be invested. Gore noted that would reduce
Social Security revenues used to pay current retirees by 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 years, that reduction in revenues could total $1
trillion in transition costs, Gore said. ``How would Governor Bush
pay for that $1 trillion?''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer, asked about Gore's statement, quipped: ``Just as Al
Gore invented the Internet, he will invent numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that his plan, which would use the projected
federal budget surplus to pay off the national debt by 2011 and
credit the savings to Social Security _ plus the saved interest
payments on the debt _ could keep the program financially solvent
until 2054.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the debt and stimulating the economy could even
extend the trust fund's life for the 75 years used as a benchmark
for the program's health, he said.

A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM THE `MAESTRO' TO HIS `HOLINESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Poland, France, Spain, Britain and Israel)   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Popes do not make a big deal of their birthdays. John
Paul II usually celebrates his by holding a private lunch for close
aides.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, he turns 80, a milestone that falls in a
Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church, and the Vatican has
prepared a daylong religious and musical extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, who is
well aware of the pope's preference for low-key birthdays, dryly
described the Vatican's fevered party-planning as a ``cardinals'
plot.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the chief conspirators is Gilbert Levine, a Jewish
Brooklyn-born conductor who is so comfortable inside the Vatican
that he refers to audiences with the pope as ``going upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said he would ``go upstairs'' with his wife and two sons
for a private, relaxing audience with the pope on Friday. His
younger son plays chess, and Levine said he would take along a
chessboard in case the pope wants to test his skills against his
8-year-old's.
</P>
<P>
   But first, on Thursday evening inside the Vatican's vast Paul VI
concert hall, Levine is planning to conduct the London Philharmonic
Orchestra and Chorus and guest soloists in Haydn's ``Creation'' to
honor the pope.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Levine's third Vatican concert and the first at which
he will wear a small red-and-gold button on his lapel, an insignia
of the Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great, a papal
knighthood bestowed on Levine in December 1994, a few months after
he conducted a papal concert in the Vatican in memory of the
Holocaust. The concert was a watershed event that Levine helped
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my suggestion that the pope attend a concert for the
Holocaust organized by the Jewish community,'' Levine said in an
interview, recalling another private meeting with the pope
``upstairs.'' He added: ``But the pope said, `No, I want this to be
a papal concert.' That's the way he is: if an idea is compelling,
he makes it his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Few popes in history could have credibly claimed Jewish friends.
But John Paul II, who grew up alongside Jews in Wadowice, Poland,
before World War II, remains close to some survivors of the
Holocaust, including a boyhood friend, Jerzy Kluger, who moved to
Rome after the war and operates as a kind of backdoor emissary
between the pope and Polish and American Jews. Levine is a more
recent acquaintance, but his eagerness to put his music at the
service of the pope has forged a friendship between the two very
different men.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II has made Jewish-Christian rapprochement a hallmark
of his papacy, an odyssey of reconciliation that began when he
visited Auschwitz in 1979 and culminated in his whispered prayer at
the Western Wall in Jerusalem during his Holy Land pilgrimage in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, whose grandparents were immigrants from Poland, became
the conductor and musical director of the Cracow Philharmonic in
December 1987 when Poland was still under Communist rule. He was a
Jew taking on a prominent artistic position in a city whose Jewish
residents had been all but wiped out by the Holocaust. That unusual
role made him an ideal agent of the pope's larger goal of
Jewish-Christian reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cracow conductor came to the pope's attention through
Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who succeeded John Paul II as
archbishop of Cracow, and sent a Newsweek article about Levine to
the pope. ``If you are coming from Cracow,'' Macharski joked in an
interview, ``it is very easy to meet with the Holy Father.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1988 Levine was summoned to the Vatican. He recalled
that the pope greeted him by saying, ``How are you treating my
orchestra?'' and added, ``More importantly, how are they treating
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year he was invited to bring the Cracow orchestra to
the Vatican for a concert to celebrate the 10th anniversary of John
Paul II's pontificate. On that visit he also brought his
mother-in-law, an Auschwitz survivor, to meet the pope. ``He really
made her understand powerfully, as a nonsurvivor, how much he
understood,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 52, who studied at Juilliard and Yale and worked with
Nadia Boulanger in Paris and Sir Georg Solti in London, has never
shed his down-to-earth Brooklyn manner. Blunt and exuberant, he
does not seem like an obvious papal confidante. For one thing, his
eagerness to talk about his relationship with the pope and repeat
papal remarks raises some eyebrows in a milieu where self-promotion
is more expertly veiled. As one Vatican official put it, ``People
who really are his friends never say it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levine, well versed in Vatican protocol, has learned at
least part of that lesson. ``I call him, `your holiness,' he calls
me `maestro,''' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is warm and personable but I would never call
myself a friend of the pope. He has showed me the most incredible
warmth. I think that after our first meeting, he saw something
about me that made it possible for him to think he might want to
know me better.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine also became close to the pope's personal secretary, Msgr.
Stanislaw Dziwisz, the real gatekeeper at the Vatican. ``I would
never bother him unless it is important; he is a very busy man,''
Levine said. But later he recalled with relish a phone conversation
with Dziwisz he had had a few days earlier on his way from Cracow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our city has really changed,'' he recalled telling the pope's
secretary about Cracow, a city that he last saw in 1991 and that is
the monsignor's hometown. Levine added that Dziwisz ``was stunned
how my Polish came back after only two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who learned Polish in Cracow, said that he and the pope
converse in Polish and that in one early meeting, when he and the
pope and Lustiger were discussing Levine's plans to hold a memorial
concert for reconciliation at an empty Cracow synagogue, the pope
translated their conversation into French for the cardinal. (
Levine said he and the cardinal usually speak in German, using the
familiar ``du.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lustiger, archbishop of Paris, has known Levine for years and
was the one to invest him as a papal knight in 1994, making him the
fourth Jew so honored. (A fifth was named in 1998.) The cardinal
shares Levine's Polish-Jewish roots; the cardinal was born in
Paris, his mother, who had been born in Poland, died at Auschwitz,
and he was sheltered by Catholics during the war and eventually
converted. The cardinal did not hesitate to describe Levine as a
``friend'' of the pope, saying that John Paul II was fond of the
American conductor.
</P>
<P>
   But he placed the friendship in the context of the pope's larger
vision. ``Gilbert's enthusiasm was helpful to the pope,'' he said.
``Music is a language that can help advance human understanding and
ease conflicts. The concert for the Shoah was quite astonishing,
though in the year 2000 and the pilgrimage to the Holy Land the
pope has in a way surpassed that which music promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said he had sold the pope on the idea of another Vatican
concert by presenting it as a papal concert to commemorate the
millennium; a series of concerts to promote interfaith
understanding in 2000 that Levine plans to take on tour to the
United States, France, Spain and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said that John Paul II chose the date for the Vatican
concert. ``It was really his idea,'' Levine said. ``When I
described the idea for the concert, the pope told me, `It should be
on my birthday.'''

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS SUE CALIFORNIA OVER DISPARITIES IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Miss., Fla., Ohio, N.C., Ala.)  By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the 46th anniversary of the landmark Brown vs.
Board of Education decision, a coalition of civil rights groups
filed a class action lawsuit saying that the disparities between
California's best and worst public schools are so great as to
violate the state constitution's guarantee of a free and equal
public education for all, and demanding that the state assure that
all schools have the bare necessities of teachers, textbooks,
classrooms and toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the state court suit as the
first in the nation to seek a guarantee of education basics, and
say they hope it will open a new front in a three-decade drive that
began with attempts to equalize school financing, then moved on to
address the adequacy of conditions. The suit seeks no monetary
damages, only an order requiring the state to assure certain
essentials like textbooks and safe buildings throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes as Gov. Gray Davis and other state politicians
are grappling with how to return the state, which once led the
nation in educational spending, standards and achievement, to
something close to the national average in per pupil spending,
computers per student and the like. In his revised budget this
week, Davis proposed more than $3 billion in new spending for
education, including a controversial plan to exempt public
schoolteachers from state income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first case that has said what are the bare
essentials that a kid needs to even have a hope of equal
educational opportunities,'' said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal director
of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which
filed the suit along with other civil rights organizations,
including the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, on
behalf of students and parents in poor and minority districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``California used to be the model which all states would look to
for a public education system that was the institution for
democratizing the citizenry,'' Rosenbaum added, referring to the
era before the late 1970s when Proposition 13 and tax revolt set
off a decline in school funding that the state has struggled to
stem. ``Now it's a measure of the Mississipification of California
that the national average is looked at as a goal to accomplish, and
not necessarily one that will be met anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, a spokesman for the state department of education,
and for Delaine Eastin, the superintendent of public instruction
and the lead named defendant in the suit, said it would have no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department counsel, which just received the lawsuit, has
not had an opportunity to thoroughly review it,'' Stone said. ``The
next logical step is for our counsel to work with the attorney
general's office and the governor's office to develop a response.''
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar suit was filed last year in Florida and is
pending in state court there, accusing the state of violating the
constitutional rights of tens of thousands of school children by
failing to provide them with an adequate education that would
enable them to pass standardized tests, learn basic skills and
compete in the workplace. Similar suits have been filed in Alabama,
North Carolina, Ohio and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several decades, various court decisions have
sought to rectify imbalances in financing among districts, or to
end overt racial discrimination. But because equalizing current
financing cannot address disparities built up between rich and poor
districts over time, and because discrimination suits have faded
with the end of legally sanctioned segregation, the latest wave of
cases has begun focusing on conditions and programs, not money.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, state chapters of the Civil
Liberties Union, have already filed suits against the state
university and the state's public schools, arguing that a lack of
advanced placement classes in poorer high schools leads to
discrimination in college admissions and advancement, since
students in many schools have no access to the classes that could
gain them extra credit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed against the state Department of Education on
Wednesday, based on five months of research in schools around the
state and interviews with students, parents and teachers, found
some textbooks so outdated that they describe the Soviet Union as
still in existence and locked in a Cold War with the United States.
In at least 68 schools, at least half the teachers lack full
credentials. Others require students to pay for basic instructional
materials in core subjects like English and science, while others
lack bathrooms, ventilation or adequate seats in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staggering range of disparities in public education in
this state offend the core constitutional principle of equality,''
according to the plaintiffs' 44-page complaint, which catalogs a
range of horror stories. At Jefferson Senior High School in Los
Angeles, for example, students in five different classes must share
one set of 30 Spanish textbooks, students lack desks and teachers
must pay for gas for field trips out of their own pocket, the suit
says.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore M. Shaw, associate director and counsel of the national
office of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is
not a party to the suit but supports its goals, said it was
``obviously no coincidence that the suit was filed today,'' on the
anniversary of the Supreme Court case that held separate schools
for blacks and whites were inherently unequal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony lies that 46 years ago we had the Supreme Court
saying that separate but equal is never equal, and almost half a
century later, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have been
making it more difficult to achieve racial desegregation,'' Shaw
said. ``And this suit, in a sense, is circling back around to the
pre-Brown days, focusing on conditions in the schools, the
tangibles, and saying you have to make schools equal. The argument
here is not so much that there's invidious segregation and
discrimination, but that the policies and practices and the willful
ignorance of the disparities that characterize our public schools
still have this racially disparate effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's a reflection of the kind of retrogression
we've seen,'' Shaw added, ``or to use a term popular in black
churches, the backsliding we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew I. Kreeger, a lawyer in San Francisco for the firm of
Morrison &AMP; Foerster, which is helping to argue the case pro bono,
said the timing was apt.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, there are resources available from the state
now to deal with problems like this, and a commitment from state
officials to try,'' he said. At the same time, he said, the need
for adequate conditions is ``even more acute'' in the face of newly
adopted standards for students, including strict new exit
examinations for high school that will make it harder than ever for
students from disadvantaged schools to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum of the Civil Liberties Union added: ``At a time when
the governor is properly calling for accountability from students
and teachers, it's the state that must be held accountable first.
Right now the buck isn't stopping anywhere.''

 &HT;    Badly trimmed shrubs are `everywhere you look'
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Most of what people know about trimming hedges is
probably wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first rule you have to follow, no matter what shape you
cut, is that the base of the shrub should always be wider than the
top,'' said Chris Jensen, horticulturist with the Wegerzyn Center
at Stillwater Gardens MetroPark. ``Very few people seem to know
that, and you see bushes cut the wrong way everywhere you look.''
</P>
<P>
   If a bush is wider on top than at the bottom, the top of the
plant keeps light from reaching the lower branches. The lack of
light causes the lower branches to die, creating top-heavy plants
with bare bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't trimmed the evergreen hedges or bushes around
your house yet this year, they're probably kind of shaggy with new
growth right now.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen and two other horticulturists _ Reuben Huffman of
Fullmer's Landscaping and Liz Cramer of Siebenthaler Inc. _ say now
is the perfect time to get evergreen bushes into shape.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is deciding whether you want the plants to be
formal, as in sculpted geometric shapes, or informal, as in more
naturally shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Formal shrubs complement formal housing styles while informal
shrubs go well with more relaxed styles such as cottages or
farmhouses. But the final decision between formal and informal is
generally made on the basis of personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   The best tool for maintaining a row of bushes as a formal hedge
is an electric hedge trimmer. In especially large yards where
electric outlets are scarce and rechargeable trimmers can't finish
the job, gas-powered trimmers are available. Hand trimmers, the
ones that look like giant scissors, are OK if you have only a few
bushes to trim.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably only use the trimmers a few times each year, so
don't go overboard on buying expensive ones. Also remember that
longer electric trimmers _ 2 to 3 feet _ may be harder to control
than more moderate ones of 12 to 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   For an even cut, run a level string between posts at each end of
the hedge. Use the string as a reference to keep your cuts
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Start trimming near the top of the bush, and remember that
you'll probably trim more plant material high on the bush than near
the bottom. Try to avoid cutting away so much of the growing layer
that you expose bare branches from the interior of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, try not to make the top of the hedge too flat. Snow
builds up on the top of a flat hedge, weighing down the branches
and causing them to splay out. In fact, it's a good idea to go out
after a heavy snow and knock the snow off bushes to keep them from
being squashed out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Taxus bushes, also known as yews, are the most common ornamental
shrub in the area, and they can withstand removal of a lot of
needles. However, if you trim the tree so deeply that bare branches
show, the plant will take a lot of time to green up again.
</P>
<P>
   Some other evergreens _ including junipers, hemlocks and white
pines _ only grow from the ends of branches and must be trimmed
very delicately. Cut off the end of a branch, and that branch will
never recover.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure what kind of evergreen bush you have, take a
cutting to the Wegerzyn Center or to a nursery and ask one of the
professionals there for an identification and some trimming tips.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming an evergreen to an informal shape is done with hand
pruners, one branch at a time. Nip off the fronds of new growth
that are heading in directions you don't want the plant to go. You
can also remove dead or damaged branches.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said an important way to beautify any hedge is to get rid
of the weeds and volunteer trees growing from underneath. She
suggests cutting off any unwanted woody plants at the soil line and
painting the stumps with a herbicide such as Round Up.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreens have small, closely placed waxy needles that stay
green year round. Deciduous shrubs, shrubs that lose their leaves
in the fall, tend to have bigger, softer leaves.
</P>
<P>
   A few leaf-shedding shrubs, such as densely growing privets, can
be shaped with hedge trimmers like evergreens. But most deciduous
bushes look ragged after being attacked with hedge trimmers because
the trimmers leave many leaves half shredded.
</P>
<P>
   The horticulturist suggest pruning off unwanted branches to keep
deciduous shrubs in shape. First remove branches that are dead,
dying, diseased or poorly shaped. Get rid of crossing branches that
are growing in such a way that the bark of one branch touches
another branch or the tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the branches off but leave their collars intact. Collars are
the rounded knobs that form where a branch meets its parent branch
or the tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your pruning shears or other cutting tools are sharp
and clean. Dip the blades in bleach occasionally to avoid carrying
diseases from one plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to prune most woody plants is during their dormant
season in late fall or early spring, before the plants are actively
growing. But most deciduous plants still flourish if pruned
judiciously at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid pruning or trimming shrubs during hot, dry spells,
however. Plants have a hard enough time dealing with the heat
without the added stress of pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Certain flowering shrubs can be improved by trimming them in the
weeks after their spring blooms die, said Huffman. Lilacs,
forsythia, viburnum and flowering quince all develop new flower
buds in the summer after their spring blooms fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you prune the plants now, the plant will be forced to direct
its energies to producing buds for next year on the branches you
leave behind. If you prune these flowering shrubs in the fall or
spring, you'll be cutting away buds the plant worked all summer to
produce, and next spring's flower production will be small.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pruning and trimming are not enough. If the species of
plant you have in a particular spot is simply too big for its
location, constant aggressive pruning will lead only to frustration
and an ugly plant.
</P>
<P>
   If a plant refuses to live in the space it has been given,
sometimes the best option is to remove the plant and replace it
with a more appropriate variety.

`MURDER ROOMS': A BLUEPRINT FOR IMAGINING SHERLOCK
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing explains Sherlock Holmes' ongoing appeal better than his
own analysis of his detective work. ``It saved me from ennui,''
Holmes once said to his sidekick, Dr. Watson. ``Alas! I already
feel it closing upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to
escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems
help me to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's figuring out one of his little problems, the universe
has focus and meaning. When he isn't solving mysteries, or fencing
or boxing, he escapes by means of cocaine or his violin music, or
he simply sinks into an existential torpor. His brilliant
deductions are amusing, but it's the languor _ the hints of
personal darkness _ that captivates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, numerous films and then television
adaptations have been based on the Sherlock Holmes stories. Yet a
new British series has found a clever way to capitalize on Holmes'
popularity without trying to reinvent ``The Hound of the
Baskervilles'' yet again. In fact, Holmes doesn't even appear in
``Murder Rooms: The Dark Origins of Sherlock Holmes,'' presented in
two hourlong episodes Thursday night and next Thursday on
``Mystery,'' the PBS anthology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps taking its cue from ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Murder
Rooms'' places the author _ in this case, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle _
at center stage and aims to satisfy our curiosity about the
creative process with a dramatized version of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Conan Doyle might actually have approved of this fictionalized
fact. As Holmes observes to Watson, in ``A Case of Identity'':
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over
this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep at the queer
things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,
the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make
all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions
most stale and unprofitable.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pirie's witty and intelligent script for ``Murder Rooms''
begins with the premise, promulgated by Conan Doyle himself, that
Conan Doyle's mysteries were rooted in reality and that Holmes was
modeled after Joseph Bell, a professor at the medical school in
Edinburgh when Conan Doyle enrolled as his student in 1878. Bell
was modestly famous for making extravagant (but often accurate)
diagnoses divined as much from a patient's accent or clothing or
occupation as from specific symptoms _ much the way Holmes would
solve crimes. Apparently Bell also had a night job as a kind of
forensic detective, using his powers of deduction to help the
police unravel difficult cases. Conan Doyle became Bell's helper,
his Dr. Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressing these spare facts with considerable research about
Victorian Edinburgh, and an obvious affinity for the Holmes
stories, Pirie has imagined Conan Doyle's apprenticeship as a
blueprint for his life as an author. Not incidentally, he has
staged these events that could have fed Conan Doyle's imagination
as a satisfying Sherlock Holmes story.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing after his mentor, Bell, the 19-year-old Doyle
encounters the city's bottom-feeders (many of whom hold positions
of prominence). Though young, he isn't innocent _ his own father, a
disappointed artist, has drank himself into madness. But Bell
enlarges Conan Doyle's education further. Their investigations
uncover gruesome examples of cruelty (a corpse whose ears have been
severed) as well as less vivid but even more heartbreaking forms of
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The superb Ian Richardson, who has played Sherlock Holmes (on
HBO's version of ``The Hound of the Baskervilles'' and ``The Sign
of Four''), expertly conveys a plausible prototype with his Bell.
The real doctor may or may not have shared Holmes' quirks. We're
privy only to the intelligence that Richardson uses to make his
character as alluring as a man with steel-wool hair can be.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur Conan Doyle, the young actor Robin Laing communicates
sweetness and resoluteness in the face of hard sorrow, as well as
offering a touch of self-pity that makes Conan Doyle all the more
human. The actors are generally good and mostly not well known,
except for Charles Dance, playing aristocratic scum, a part he does
well. His character pops up only briefly here and there, but like a
cockroach skittering across a wedding cake, makes an impression.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting on location in Scotland, the filmmakers have made the
streets and laboratories of their 19th-century Edinburgh seem
Gothic and sinister, while the interiors _ where appropriate _ are
warmly lit and elegantly Victorian. Jim Parker's sensitive score is
lovely, especially the violin homages to Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Paul Seed (whose credits include the classic
``Masterpiece Theater'' miniseries ``House of Cards'') deftly
maneuvers the action through the busy scenario Pirie has concocted.
There are many crimes to contend with, of course, but also poignant
relationships as well as sour ones, and even a dalliance with Big
Issues (feminism, specifically, when Conan Doyle's female
classmates are harassed). That's a lot to cover in two hours, but
everyone manages very well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Wednesday overcame a major hurdle
blocking legislation that would boost the number of visas for
foreigners with technical skills such as computer programmers and
electrical engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle, a measure that would have granted amnesty to between
1 million and 2 million undocumented immigrants, was cast aside,
and the House Judiciary Committee approved the bill _ sponsored by
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas _ that would end limits on such visas,
known as H1-Bs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judiciary Committee's action is another step toward
enactment of balanced legislation,'' Smith said in a statement
after the 18-11 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote on the measure next month.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt last week by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., to attach a
provision _ originally suggested by President Clinton _ to the bill
that would grant amnesty to an estimated 1 million to 2 million
people who are in the country illegally threatened to stall the
legislation. But Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., refused
Wednesday to allow a vote on the attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lofgren's proposal, anyone who arrived illegally in the
United States before 1986 would be eligible to apply for legal
residence. Currently, only undocumented immigrants who arrived
before 1972 can seek legal status.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy now growing at a 5 percent pace and
unemployment at 3.9 percent, labor markets have become so tight
that many industries are having trouble filling vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Information Technology Association of America
(ITAA), a Washington-based high-tech industry lobby group, about
850,000 jobs will go unfilled during the next year because of a
lack of qualified U.S. applicants. The problem is costing
businesses $4.5 billion a year in lost productivity, ITAA
said.``For a business, this lack of workers means that projects
don't get done or products get delivered later,'' said association
spokesman Bob Cohen. ``And, unfortunately, if the informational
technology industry slows down, it has a ripple effect on the
entire economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Using such statistics, ITAA and other information industry
lobbyists have been leaning on Congress to raise the ceiling on
H1-B visas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a consensus is emerging in Congress to expand the
immigration program. H-1B visas are capped at 115,000 this fiscal
year, but all of them were issued in the first six months. Under
present law, the ceiling will fall to 107,500 in the next year
starting Oct. 1 and 65,000 in fiscal 2002. Smith's bill would
eliminate those ceilings. But Smith said his bill also contains
provisions to protect American high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent companies from hiring H1-B workers at substantially
lower salaries than their U.S. counterparts, Smith's legislation
would set minimum pay at $40,000, the computer industry's average
starting salary, for foreign workers. Companies also would have to
conduct annual reviews of wages for new American workers to ensure
that their pay either stays at the industry average or rises. In
the Senate, an industry-supported bill proposed by Orrin Hatch of
Utah and Spencer Abraham of Michigan is pending. It has cleared the
Senate Judiciary Committee and would boost H-1B visas to 195,000
annually for each of the next three years. The bill would include
an education fee of $500 per visa for U.S. worker retraining
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the H1-B program enjoys high levels of support in
Congress, labor unions and many U.S. high-tech workers contend the
industry has used the visas to hold down wages and discriminate
against higher-paid American workers.

CHEERS FROM THE PIT ACCOMPANY A CODA: THE MET'S CONCERTMASTER IS
RETIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Raymond Gniewek was appointed concertmaster of
the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in 1957, he was a 25-year-old
graduate of the Eastman School of Music with scant experience in
vocal music, let alone opera. Though he was a brilliantly talented
violinist, he immediately became the youngest member of the
orchestra, its first American-born concertmaster, and he was
expected to assume a leadership role among musicians far more
knowledgeable than he about the European opera heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Things obviously turned out well. After 43 years as
concertmaster _ a position little understood even by regular
concertgoers _ Gniewek, 68, is retiring. During his tenure he has
performed in 115 different operas under a roster of conductors
ranging from some now-forgotten beat-keepers to giants like Dmitri
Mitropoulos, Karl Boehm, Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein
and, of course, James Levine. An opera neophyte when he arrived, he
leaves with an incomparable understanding of operatic style and
practice. In 1977 he even married a singer, the soprano Judith
Blegen.
</P>
<P>
   His final performances come this weekend with two concerts by
the Met Orchestra conducted by Levine: Friday night at the New
Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, and on Sunday afternoon at
Carnegie Hall, an all-Bartok program offering the one-act opera
``Bluebeard's Castle'' and the Concerto for Orchestra. Count on
Levine, who was a precocious 13-year-old piano student in
Cincinnati when Gniewek got the Met job, to acknowledge him warmly
at the end of the concert.

   During an interview the other day in his office, Levine grew
emotional trying to explain how important Gniewek has been to the
artistic growth of the orchestra. They share a musical heritage,
since two of Levine's teachers, the conductors Jean Morel and
Fausto Cleva, were important figures at the Met during Gniewek's
early years. ``The single luckiest thing to happen to me since I
have been at the Met,'' Levine said, ``is that Ray Gniewek was the
concertmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Many operagoers will have to accept Levine's tribute on faith,
since there are such misconceptions about the role. What exactly
does a concertmaster do?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put into words,'' the silver-haired, fit and
affable Gniewek said during a recent interview at the Met. In the
18th century, ``before conductors were even around,'' he said,
``the concertmaster essentially led the orchestra, for the simple
reason that the violin was the highest voice in any ensemble.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``As music became more complicated, and more
instruments were involved, communication between the musicians
didn't work very well. So a director, a conductor, was put there,
to keep things in order.''
</P>
<P>
   This outmoded historic conception of the concertmaster as a sort
of second in command, ready to assume the podium if the conductor
should be unable to continue, has persisted in the public
imagination, Gniewek said. But all major orchestras have a number
of assistant conductors on staff. The Met has a whole roster of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Like most modern concertmasters, Gniewek has a different set of
responsibilities. The public notices his work most when he plays
solos in an opera. These can range in length and difficulty from
the short, bittersweet melody that comforts Strauss' introspective
Marschallin at the end of Act I in ``Der Rosenkavalier'' to the
miniconcerto that functions as an orchestral interlude in Act III
of Verdi's ``I Lombardi.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, he acts as a leader of the violin section,
responsible for making sure that all phrasing, bowings and
articulations are being done the same way by everyone. In a house
with the heritage of the Met, such solutions have long been
established and are written into the orchestra parts. But a
conductor is free to change them. In that case the concertmaster
must find a technical solution to the conductor's wishes and
communicate it somehow to the other musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players tell me all the time, `Don't worry, Ray, we're
watching the tip of your bow,''' Gniewek said. But many things have
to be dealt with in detail, on the spot, in rehearsal:
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, Jimmy will say, `No, Ray, I want this phrase a
little lighter, a little shorter.' So I'll play it. He'll say: `No,
that's too short. Just a little brushing sound, tat-tat-tat.' I'll
play again. `That's it!' he'll say. So I turn to the violins and
demonstrate. It's my job to make technical translations of the
desired sound. And you have to show, not tell, because the same
words can mean different things to different people.''
</P>
<P>
   This intuitive way of working has been essential to Levine,
whose goal has been to make the Met orchestra sound ``like a
sensational, huge chamber group.'' This is critical in opera, where
timing should be free and expressive, and where, ideally, the
conductor and orchestra respond to the singers the way a pianist
accompanies a voice recital.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a conductor is waiting on a singer's response,
Gniewek said, ``there is a lag between them, between what is
happening onstage and what is happening in the pit.'' If there is
any uncertainty, the orchestra players ``feel a little surer if
they can follow me,'' he said. ``I mean, I make a sound. The
conductor's beat doesn't. So if they jump in when I start to play,
they know they will be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some modern-day concertmasters have also been aspiring
conductors, the most renowned example being Joseph Silverstein, who
resigned as concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1984
after 22 years to become the conductor of the Utah Symphony
Orchestra. Gniewek ``never had the itch'' to conduct, he said.
``I'd rather play. I have strong feelings about sound, the actual
act of playing of the instrument. It's what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly must have done it impressively to win his post at
such a young age, especially considering that his focus on a
musical career came late. He was born in East Meadow, on Long
Island, to a mother who loved music and sang in a church choir, and
a Polish immigrant father who had played the violin at dances in
Poland but wound up working as a barber in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family joke was that my parents' first son was going to be
a violinist,'' Gniewek said. Coming after two sisters, he was the
first son. He became the violinist. ``I had no choice,'' he said
wryly. ``I never really took to practicing too well. I loved math
and science.''
</P>
<P>
   He intended to be a physics major and was accepted by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But he was persuaded to
attend the University of Rochester, where, somehow, he said, he
wound up enrolling at the affiliated Eastman School of Music. Erich
Leinsdorf, who had been conducting at the Met since 1938, was the
director of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra at the time and
invited Gniewek to be its concertmaster. But it was the conductor
Max Rudolf, then an assistant manager at the Met, who worked with
Gniewek in Rochester and told him of the opening at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   The concertmaster appointment came at a difficult time in
Gniewek's life. His first marriage, which produced two daughters,
was breaking up. ``I was 20 when we got married,'' he said. ``We
were just too young.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met musicians might have been expected to be resentful of
this young newcomer. But, Gniewek said, ``I sort of waded my way
through things, wasn't too arrogant, and the musicians were very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely he earned that support through the quality of his
musicianship. Today, after four decades of absorbing operatic
style, his playing has a special vocal quality, Levine said: ``It
shimmers, it's lyrical. You can imagine putting a text to it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gniewek joined the Met, the autocratic Rudolf Bing was in
his seventh year as general manager. However Bing's tenure is
regarded today, he was ``a singer's man,'' Gniewek said. ``To him,
we were just an accompanying orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers Levine's 1971 debut as a turning point. ``When
Jimmy came, it was the end of the season, just another `Tosca' for
us,'' Gniewek recalled. ``But he really lifted us up and carried us
along. Afterward I did something I didn't do much. I found him
backstage and said, `That was the most phenomenal debut since
Herbert von Karajan.'''
</P>
<P>
   The morale in the orchestra, in that next-to-last year of the
Bing era, was not high. Levine's positivism was just the tonic
needed, Gniewek said. He sometimes chides jaded friends from the
New York Philharmonic who are suspicious of Levine's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me, `Ah, he's always smiling.'
</P>
<P>
   ` `What's wrong with that?' I say. `You have to always make
music scowling? Music always has to be done with suffering and
intensity?'''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when Gniewek was so exhilarated after a
Met performance _ many nights with Birgit Nilsson and Renata
Tebaldi, he said, and Wagner's ``Ring'' with Levine _ that he would
go home and stay up until 4 a.m. doing things like tiling the
bathroom floor. He would have retired years ago, he said, but he
wanted to be a part of two transforming additions to the
orchestra's musical life introduced by Levine over the last 10
years: the Met Orchestra concert series and the founding of the Met
Chamber Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure Gniewek has witnessed a turnover of orchestra
personnel; only three players have been there longer than he.
Naturally, he was very involved with the auditions for string
players, though he said he was ``not 100 percent happy'' with the
process. To prevent discrimination, the candidates play from behind
a screen, and the musicians on the audition committee write down
their comments without consultation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have a little discussion,'' he said.
``Sometimes you don't completely trust what you are hearing.'' For
example, was a violinist's playing exciting, or a bit aggressive?
Different listeners may feel differently. Also, although he accepts
the reasons for it, he has been frustrated by the use of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see a person playing,'' he said. ``Playing an
instrument is a very physical thing.'' If there are problems after
the fact, the contract allows for a two-year probation period
during which a newcomer can be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Only the concertmaster can be appointed directly by the artistic
director, Levine. The Met orchestra has traditionally had two
principal players of each instrument, but only one concertmaster,
though there are several associates. Levine has been seeking to
change that policy, and over the last season a second
concertmaster, Nick Eanet, 28, whom everyone is excited about, was
finally broken in. Gniewek is now taking part in the audition
process to find another concertmaster to share the work with Eanet.
</P>
<P>
   Gniewek knows that playing in an opera house orchestra involves
a lot of hard, routine work, day after day. But he always had an
answer for musicians who found themselves feeling uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell people: `You are going to be here for four hours
anyway. Do you want to walk out feeling: ``Ugh! What a headache!
That was not so good''? Or do you want to walk out feeling, ``Wow,
that was fantastic'' '? Might as well give it everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And that explains exactly what a concertmaster does. &QL;

PUTIN MOVES TO CURB POWER OF REGIONS; DUMA APPROVES PREMIER  
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Moving swiftly to gather the reins of power in Kremlin
hands, President Vladimir Putin proposed legislation Wednesday
night that would oust Russia's provincial governors from their
appointed seats in the parliament and, in some instances, permit
him to fire them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to redraw parliament's upper house, called the
Federation Council, would replace its 178 governors and regional
legislative leaders with lower-level appointees from each of the
nation's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a series of moves by the new Kremlin
administration to reassert central control over its sprawling
territory, which in recent years has sometimes seemed to be
drifting into a collection of autonomous fiefdoms.
</P>
<P>
   Putin went on national television Wednesday evening to reveal
the proposed legislation and several other initiatives that he said
were aimed at ``strengthening and cementing Russian statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A moment has come to separate partisan, regional and personal
ambitions from the strict necessity to strengthen the state system
and reinforce its power,'' he said. ``The citizens of Russia have
been waiting for it for a long time. We have to justify these
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He took pains to stress that the proposals, which would require
the parliament's approval, ``are fully within the framework of the
current Russian constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are nevertheless sure to be controversial. But the Kremlin
seemed confident _ and outside experts agreed _ that Putin can
muster enough votes to push the proposals into law. Late Wednesday
night, news services reported that leaders of both the left-wing
Communist Party and the western-oriented Union of Right Forces back
the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   That impression of support was bolstered by the lopsided 325-155
vote earlier Wednesday in parliament's lower house, the Duma, to
confirm Putin's nominee for prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov. The
overwhelming vote for approval, the biggest majority received by
any of Russia's seven prime ministers, suggests that Putin is
beginning his term with an unusually strong political base in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said Wednesday night that his latest proposals are driven
not by power politics, but by the need to make the executive and
legislative branches of Russia's government more effective. But one
clear effect would be to shift political power away from regional
leaders and back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Besides rearranging the Federation Council, Putin said he will
seek the authority to remove provincial leaders from office and
dissolve regional legislatures that enact laws in violation of the
federal constitution. Noting that even he can be impeached for such
violations, Putin called it ``an outrageous fact'' that a fifth of
provincial laws are at odds with federal legislation and that many
provincial charters contradict the federal constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of such violations are catastrophic,'' he
said. ``From such seemingly petty issues, drop by drop, separatism
ripens, which sometimes becomes a stronghold for an even more
dangerous evil, international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin also proposed that regional leaders get new authority to
remove officials below them, something he said was only fair given
the expanded powers he seeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But symbolically, at least, the plan to create a new Federation
Council outshined the Kremlin's other proposals. Russia's
constitution, written in 1993 after President Boris Yeltsin used
tanks to put down a parliamentary revolt, calls only for the
council to be composed of officials from each province's executive
and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kremlin that allowed legislation specifying that the
governors and legislative chiefs sit on the council, a compromise
that Yeltsin apparently struck to gain political support. The
council's far-flung members assemble only a few days each month and
often use their Moscow posts to trade political influence for
benefits back home. Putin said Wednesday that he is returning to
the constitution's original meaning and freeing the governors and
legislators to tend to their real business back home. In return, he
said, the council will become a more professional, full-time
legislative chamber _ something he suggested would make his life
more difficult but would benefit Russia in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed Wednesday night that the Russian presidency,
already an immensely powerful institution under Yeltsin's
constitution, would only become stronger should Putin's plans
become law. But they were hard put to say that the proposals were
wrongheaded. Not only has the Federation Council become the
weakling in the Russian legislative system, but some Russian
governors have all but become autocrats in their provinces as the
Kremlin's authority ebbed in the 1990s. A few have erected small
empires based largely on public corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is quite sure about the parliament and Moscow for the
time being,'' Lilia Shevtsova, a political scholar at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Moscow, said Wednesday night.
``He has no enemies, no opponents. So the major activity now is to
curb the power of the feudals, the robber barons of the provinces.
Even liberals and democrats want to curb their activity. The
problem is on what basis. Putin could have done it in creating the
new role of judicial system, or increasing the role of
self-government. But he followed Russian and Soviet tradition, and
did it from the top.''

HELPING PATERSON, N.J., GET BETTER GRADES IN URBAN RENEWAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trees. I would like to add trees,'' reads the legend on a
simple map of a street in Paterson, N.J., drawn in colored pencil
by a freshman high school student, Leon White, who lives on it.
Green trees have been swirled onto the black and white street like
the rotations of a wand.
</P>
<P>
   Urban solutions can be this simple _ so simple, in fact, that a
child can create them.
</P>
<P>
   Through an ambitious plan called the City of Learning, Paterson,
a city of 170,000, is giving public high school students not only
the tools to understand its urban problems, but also the chance to
solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Leon White is enrolled at the Metro Paterson Academy for
Communications and Technology, or Mpact, a new public school
established in September in an empty downtown mall, where
open-classroom walls are papered with student projects: urban
renewal studies and school construction proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Mpact is a pilot in a program of innovative academies that offer
specialized curricula and smaller classes. Started by Manhattan's
Center for Innovative Education, they are being tested in other
cities. In Paterson, the academies are also being proposed as tools
for urban renewal in an economically distressed city with a school
performance so poor that the district was taken over by the state
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating $500 million to $800 million in state money to
build new school facilities, Dr. Edwin Duroy, the state-appointed
superintendent of schools, realized that improving schools was
meaningless if the struggling city was ignored. His budget
represented Paterson's largest potential capital investment. Why
not use it to rescue the schools and try rehabilitating the city at
the same time? And put students at the center of the equation by
teaching them city planning _ at school.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity demanded vision. Duroy invited urban designers
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with experience in
school districts from Berkeley, Calif., to Washington, D.C., to
develop a master plan for Paterson's schools and its 25,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   The New American School Design Project, a workshop of graduate
students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Roy
Strickland, an architect, developed a concept called the City of
Learning _ an expanding system of academies throughout Paterson
that would spark investment in neighborhoods, especially a sorely
vacant, turn-of-the-century downtown.
</P>
<P>
   By September, seven academies will be in operation.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year, when the nature of education and the fate
of cities are being debated at a national level, Paterson is
putting the American high school on Main Street. Mpact is at number
175. At the school, which opened last September with a freshman
class of 25, students study college preparatory subjects like
mathematics and history in the morning and technology,
entrepreneurship and urban planning in the afternoon. It is an
extended day, ending at 4 p.m. Visited recently, students were
still working at 6.
</P>
<P>
   Posted in the classroom where urban planning is taught is a list
of ``Existing Conditions'' in Paterson, identified by students.
They include ``railroad tracks,'' ``crackheads,'' ``parking lots,''
``lost treasures'' and ``discarded clothing'': a stream of
consciousness from its younger citizens that runs like the Passaic
River and its treacherous falls, through the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here; nobody knows it better than us,'' said Kemesha
Pringle, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate, Maurice Moore, 14, said, ``Now, we've got a
responsibility to give people what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, the class will present its first proposal to the
Board of Education: a plan to replace a faculty parking lot between
two schools with an educational park for the community. Their
proposals include a food court (the children complained about the
cafeteria lunch), a swimming pool (the community asked for it), an
arcade for games after school and a tent for reading during the
summer _ improvements to school property that a school budget
theoretically would pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Mendez, 15, said that his work improving Paterson with
planning was important because ``it's my home.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``stepping outside the box,'' as Duroy called
beyond-the-classroom steps like Mpact and the City of Learning,
Paterson hopes to realize not just new facilities with novel
opportunities for urban growth, but to move toward smaller, more
personal learning environments, which are now widely acknowledged
as improving performance. Paterson hopes smaller classes will
combat the dropout rate, which exceeded 15 percent in the 1998-99
school year. The state average was 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many eighth-graders choose not to go to the high schools, but
to vocational schools,'' Duroy said. ``Recognizing this, I felt we
needed to become competitive. We needed to bring alternative
choices to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The academies are being created to compete. Applications to
Mpact, which is choosing its second freshman class of 25 now, have
doubled because of word-of-mouth between parents.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated budget is Paterson's share of a 1998 New Jersey
Supreme Court decision requiring the state to dedicate billions of
dollars to school construction in 28 low-income districts.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey state Senate will vote Thursday on a proposal to
put the Economic Development Agency in charge of school
construction, a plan that Gov. Christie Whitman supports, said
Gregg Edwards, executive director of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsors of the bill want towns to think creatively about
what school money can be used to do, and that's just what Paterson
is talking about,'' he said. ``Paterson is looking at the money as
part of an economic development strategy. The Economic Development
Agency will be more sympathetic to the sort of things Paterson
wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, questioned the
ability of schools to act as economic engines in a city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think of what they'll achieve beyond bailing out
property owners,'' he said, explaining that putting schools in
vacant, downtown buildings was not the invitation to commercial
development that placing businesses would be. And, he added,
``there's not that much buying power to support retail
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lonreghan, executive director of the Special Improvement
District in Paterson, a coalition of local businesses and property
owners, said of the academies' new downtown: ``We do feel the
schools have had a positive impact _ the added presence of hundreds
of students and teachers. But as for bringing in higher-end
business like Starbucks, I haven't seen that impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, there has been little criticism of the Paterson
approach. If there are critics, they have been local, though
reluctant to be vocal about what is regarded as an unprecedented
windfall for a city with no substantial money from the private
sector in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Anna-Lisa Dopirak, director of community development in
Paterson, expressed frustration at being out of the loop created by
a state superintendent working with an out-of-state planning
group.? ``There should have been a closer working relationship with
this department on the project,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Paterson take its student planners seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Partnerships with institutions like MIT and Lucent Technologies,
which is working with Stephen Cohen, the school district's
technology planner, to wire the City of Learning with
Internet-access cable for every school in Paterson, has gotten the
city's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That these are ideas being generated by kids doesn't undermine
the fact that they are bright ideas that have merit,'' said William
McKoy, president of the Board of Education, who was elected to the
Paterson City Council last week on a platform promoting Paterson as
the City of Learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're training and thinking with good institutions,'' he
said. ``The collaboration is meaningful to the city _ it's not
Monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mpact, the students have already developed their own
mass-transit system: rolling desk chairs that speed them from desk
to desk, across the plaza of the classroom, to confer on projects.
The plan for the laboratory is a Socratic circle; there are no rows
or lecterns.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Riesman, an instructor with an MIT master's degree in city
planning, is developing Mpact's first year of programs, which
include working with the class on converting a municipal parking
lot into a civic center and park, with schools, malls and a
transportation hub for a proposed light-rail link to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like any planning session, the discussion, chaired by Riesman, a
woman in black jeans and wide-heeled boots with a salt-and-pepper
ponytail, came down to what Paterson had, what it didn't have and
what it could have as a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted stores,'' said LaToya Matthews, 14. ``Old
Navy, Gap. But then we had to stop and think: That's going to take
away business from the stores that are here. We don't want to put
them out of business. So there had to be some sort of
collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sindy Ponte, 14, explained that they took role-playing parts in
the situation to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the city; other kids were the businesses,'' she said,
referring to local merchants like the pizza parlor down the block,
now a favorite student stop.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Medina, 15, said that she thought people living downtown
would encourage businesses to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the building across the street?'' she asked, turning
to the classroom window behind her. Above an open store, the
building was empty. ``There's just a bunch of junk in there. We
would like to turn the old buildings into apartments, because there
are a lot of apartments needed in Paterson, with more living
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Melecio, 15, qualified the idea. ``Not change the outside,
just the inside,'' she said. ``We have some really nice buildings.
We want to keep those in Paterson, so it's not like everywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the students agreed that there should be
recreational facilities and entertainment at the city-center site,
which are lacking now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only for us, but for younger kids growing up, too,''
Kemesha Pringle said. ``We're trying to change things so that they
could have a better life or experience different things that aren't
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Melecio, 15, interviewed her family. ``I asked my mom what
she thinks would go nicely downtown,'' Melecio said. ``She said,
`Oh, a movie theater, a bowling alley.' I brought that in, and
everyone said, `Oh yeah, I didn't think about that.'''
</P>
<P>
   With no theater of its own, Paterson moviegoers travel to
Passaic and Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   More citizen than city official, Leon White, 14, proposed the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the movie theaters that aren't being used, that are just
collecting dust,'' he said, speaking of several shuttered theaters
downtown, ``maybe they should try reopening them.''
</P>
<P>
   LaToya Matthews added: ``When a movie comes out, everybody talks
about going that Saturday night. Why can't they go in their own
town?'' She also advocated a skating rink. ``When a DJ from
Paterson wants to throw a party, we have to go all the way to
Wayne,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Moore, 14, made an observation that could help him in an
election, if he pursues his participation in the city. ``If we had
all this stuff that we want,'' he said, ``it would be stuff that
would attract tourism. People would come in, spend money and
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The adults led the class in appreciative laughter.

 &HT;    Family ties bind Bush, first lady
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They aren't usually likened to each other, and either of them
would probably be indignant at the comparison. But politically,
George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton have some things in common.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, family connections have been crucial for both
the ex-president's son and the president's wife. Neither of them
would likely be in the spotlight this year without those
connections, but the roles they've played in the past have also
affected the way they approach their races, for the presidency and
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Standing behind the shoulder of another candidate has taught
both of them to tone down their rhetoric, even as it has sharpened
their resentment of those they view as having attacked their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tempers his rightward leanings with the theme of
compassionate conservatism. Clinton, traveling New York state on
her ``listening'' campaign, has sublimated her more outspoken
liberal tendencies to what might be called a more consumer-oriented
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The family connections have given both candidates a wealth of
political experience on which to draw, while at the same time
causing them to be underestimated in political circles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is thought not to have the gravitas his father had, opening
the way for charges that he's a lightweight. (The Oval Office and
the U.S. Senate are the only places left where that old word has
much meaning, incidentally. No one ever worries that Bill Gates
doesn't have enough gravitas.)
</P>
<P>
   Some might describe Clinton's problem as too much gravitas. On
the stump, it is often noted that she lacks the glad-handing
charisma of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms are fair enough, but they miss something vital
about the political aptitude of both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their deficiencies, both seem to understand a
fundamental campaign principle: When the way has been cleared
before you, the only thing you have to do is plod forward. Now that
both of them have the bit in their mouths, that's exactly what
they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   As his poll numbers have mounted, Bush has put off any talk of
debating Vice President Al Gore or being drawn into an argument
through the media. Clinton, accepting the Democratic Senate
nomination in New York Tuesday night, declared that the Senate race
was not about her or any possible Republican opponent. No need to
refer to any of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's problems of the past
week or so: Just keep pulling that wagon in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comment touches on one of the big differences in their
situations right now. Bush can be sure who he's running against.
She can't.
</P>
<P>
   Until Giuliani's situation gets sorted out, it will be
impossible to know how Clinton is likely to do in her first bid as
a candidate. Similarly, while Bush has an impressive lead in the
polls, there's still a long time until November.
</P>
<P>
   If both of them win this year, however, Bush and Clinton are
likely to be linked in another way: as potential opponents in the
2004 presidential race. The comparison game would begin in earnest.

 &HT;    Fruits of your labor
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the romance of abandoning your cubicle and
driving down wildflower-lined roads to a place in the country where
you can pluck produce and drop it into a basket (or your mouth).
Then picking again and again as the sun shines brightly overhead,
little kids scamper among the rows of bushes or trees and the Texas
wind blows the hat off your head.
</P>
<P>
   Have another blackberry. Or strawberry. Or peach.
</P>
<P>
   It's springtime in Texas, and the picking is good if you dodge
the less enticing elements of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the scorpions and snakes?'' asks a visitor to the
Bella Vista Ranch in Wimberley.
</P>
<P>
   ``No snakes, no scorpions,'' reassures owner Jack Dougherty, who
has planted hundreds of blackberry bushes, with fruit bigger than
your thumb, among a grove of young olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   Just some fire ants and the occasional bee.
</P>
<P>
   John Meyer, a pharmacist picking blackberries at the ranch,
quips, ``I really have enjoyed your fire ants,'' as he settles up
with his Wimberley neighbor. He is going to turn the berries into
cobbler for guests at the Bella Vista Bed and Breakfast (no
connection), which he co-owns.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbler, smoothies, jams, jellies, bowls of ice cream and cereal
_ the lure of farm-fresh fruit is strong. Even in a high-tech,
convenience-minded millennium, pick-your-own farms have a
following. The Texas Department of Agriculture, which compiles a
list of pick-your-own farms, says it continues to be one of the
most frequent consumer requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been something people have loved,'' observes
TDA's Susan Dunn. And the practice has been sustained by the influx
of people from other states where pick-your-own farms are also big.
It's also a popular family activity because it appeals to so many
generations.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, John Ivey, a carpenter, was introducing
berry picking to his 2-year-old daughter Melina, who was having as
much fun feeding them to her dad as pulling them from the vines.
</P>
<P>
   For Jim Morrow, a Compaq program manager, and his mom, Veronica
Morrow, peaches are the goal of annual family outings. Last May, in
a short period of time, the Morrows headed over to Fredericksburg
and filled boxes with 100 pounds of peaches (about two bushels)
after a brief tasting and picking lesson from the Marburger Orchard
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a ball with it. That's why we're planning on doing it
again soon,'' said Morrow. There is another reason, too. The
Morrows are down to their last peaches in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut them up, tossed them with Fruit Fresh, no sugar,'' says
Veronica Morrow. ``They looked just as pretty as a year ago. The
color stayed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   They still tasted great, too, added Jim. But it's time to
replenish the freezer. And, sure, they could buy peaches at the
market or a roadside stand, but there is something magical about
picking your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell and aroma of the peaches when you are out among
those peach trees _ it is so nice to be out there, `` says
Veronica.
</P>
<P>
   RULES OF THE ROWS
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't wear your favorite white T-shirt to the fields or
orchards. Fruits stain.
</P>
<P>
   _ If given a choice, pick fruit that is close to your car.
Baskets of peaches get heavy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sun hats are great, but on a windy day, a baseball cap works
better.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to pick in gloves.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have kneepads, take them with you to the berry fields.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandals are fine for the lake, but cowboy boots or athletic
shoes work better in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry Salsa
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 large or 3 small bananas, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped or grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   1 kiwi, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons powdered sugar, may omit if coconut is sweetened
</P>
<P>
   Place strawberries and bananas in a medium bowl and cover with
lime juice. Add remaining ingredients and gently stir to combine.
Chill for no more than 1 hour. Serve over pound cake or ice cream.
Makes about 3 cups salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Best-Ever Peach Crisp
</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 peaches, peeled, pitted and cut in 1/4 inch slices.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar, about 6 cups
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose white flour
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose white flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Put the peaches and 1/2 cup of sugar in a large bowl and stir
until the sugar evenly coats the fruit. The amount of sugar you use
depends on how sweet the peaches are. Taste a peach slice to see if
it seems sweet enough. If not, add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar
and stir again.
</P>
<P>
   Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the bowl and mix until it is
evenly distributed on the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Put the peaches in an 8-inch square or a round 1 1/2-quart
baking dish. Don't bother to butter the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup sugar, the baking powder, and
the salt. Crack the egg into a small dish, beat with a fork until
it is all one color, and add to the flour-and-sugar mixture. Using
your hands or a fork, gently mix the egg into the flour-and-sugar
mixture until the egg evenly moistens the dry ingredients. Be sure
not to press the dough into one solid mass. The topping should be
loose and crumbly so that it can be sprinkled over the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the top of the peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat,
stirring regularly. Spoon the melted butter over the top of the
crisp so that it is evenly coated with butter. Put the crisp on the
center rack of the oven and bake for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When 30 minutes are up, check to see if it's done. If the top of
the crisp is a deep golden brown, and the fruit is bubbling, it is
done. Remove it from the oven. If not, bake another 5 or 10 minutes
and check again.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the crisp into squares and lift from the pan with a small
spatula onto individual serving plates. Serve warm with whipped
cream or vanilla ice cream. Makes an 8-inch crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Blackberry Smoothie
</P>
<P>
   1 pint vanilla frozen yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1 pint fresh blackberries
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup skim milk
</P>
<P>
   Wash the berries thoroughly in two rinses of cold water. Remove
all sand, leaves and other particles. This can be done in advance
and the berries chilled in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients a blender. Cover the blender carafe and
blend the mixture at medium speed for 30 to 45 seconds. Serve in
your favorite drinking glasses.

AND THE MOLIERE FOR BEST ACTOR GOES TO ...  
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``It is something of a paradox,'' Conor Brady, the
editor of The Irish Times, remarked a few years back, ``that a
director who may have a Tony on his mantelpiece will have no
corresponding award from his Irish peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Brady soon helped fix that. In 1997, The Irish Times
created the Irish Theater Awards in partnership with the country's
Electricity Supply Board. And since then, peer recognition has been
gradually filling mantelpieces from Dublin to Galway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ireland's theater is necessarily the better for joining
the awards game. After all, from Oscar Wilde to Sebastian Barry,
the country's playwrights have fared well enough on a diet of
scandal and applause. And surely no Irish actor ever needed more
than an attentive audience for the muse to stir. On the other hand,
since a theater award usually means a splash of publicity and a
good party, no complaints. Free Champagne and a decorated
mantelpiece? Even better.
</P>
<P>
   So is that what theater awards are all about? Sort of, because
the Oscars are everyone's role model. Playwrights, directors and
actors may be at the heart of the show, there to provide glamour,
to excite the paparazzi, perhaps even to add a touch of class, but
they are in fact only bit players. In the more serious business of
selling tickets, it is the party _ the awards ceremony _ that
counts. As with the Oscars, the prize, rather than any individual
winner, is the real star.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on their own, theater awards can do little. Above all, they
are no substitute for good writers, directors, actors, managers,
theaters _ and keen audiences. In fact, for such prizes to be
coveted, for awards ceremonies to be televised, for the competition
to stir interest, a country and, above all, a city must first have
a healthy and active theater life. Conversely, the paucity of
prestigious theater prizes speaks alarmingly of the theater's
losing battle against television and movies in much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new Irish Theater Awards have prospered, then, because the
ground was already fertile. With the Gate and Abbey theaters its
traditional pillars, Dublin has been a theater town for well over a
century. And in the last decade, a burst of fine writing and a
fresh generation of directors have injected new blood into theater
there. So even though they have not created it, the theater prizes
are a nice way of celebrating that renaissance. This year's best
new play was ``Howie the Rookie'' by Mark O'Rowe, while the best
director award went to John Breen for his production of his own
play ``Alone It Stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the water in London, theater awards are as well
established as the theater business itself, indeed self-confident
enough to honor Irish or American or even French artists who help
keep the lights bright in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard Theater Awards, created in 1955, eight
years after the Tony Awards, have as good a record as any for
spotting the best. In their first year, they included a bizarre
category, most controversial play. The winner? Samuel Beckett's
``Waiting for Godot.'' And in 1956, the most promising playwright?
John Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, while acting and directing awards have often gone to
pillars of the London stage like the actors Dame Maggie Smith and
the directors Sir Richard Eyre and Deborah Warner, The Evening
Standard's jury of theater critics continues to seek out new
writing talent.
</P>
<P>
   Recent most promising playwrights include Martin McDonagh (``The
Beauty Queen of Leenane'') in 1996, Conor McPherson (``The Weir'')
in 1997, Mark Ravenhill (``Handbag'') in 1998 and Rebecca Gilman
(``The Glory of Living'') in 1999. The 1999 awards ceremony,
broadcast by Carlton Television, nonetheless had a surprise: no
best play was picked, a decision widely applauded as evidence that
quality matters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the Laurence Olivier Awards were added by the Society
of London Theaters, an organization that, much like the League of
American Theaters and Producers (one of the sponsors of the Tony
Awards), represents the theater business _ producers, proprietors
and managers. While the Evening Standard Awards are given in a
maximum of 10 categories, the Oliviers have 22, including two each
for opera and dance. Unusually, the theater, opera and dance juries
are formed by a mixture of theater professionals and members of the
theatergoing public (theater lovers can apply to become jurors),
which assures that popular appeal remains a key variable.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of this is the emphasis given by the Oliviers to
musical comedies, the West End's main crowd-puller, with awards for
best actor in a musical, best actress in a musical, best theater
choreographer and best supporting performance in a musical, as well
as the Radisson Edwardian Award for Best Musical. This year, when
the ceremony was televised by BBC-2, the Royal National Theater
picked up three musical prizes as well as best director for two
Shakespeare productions by its own artistic director, Sir Trevor
Nunn, accolades that reflect the broad range of the theater's work.
(Sir Trevor also won the less glitzy Critics' Circle Theater Award
for best director.)
</P>
<P>
   France's main theater award, the Moliere, has an even weightier
name and a still stronger commercial lineage. It was created in
1987 by the Union of Theater Managers and the administrator of the
Comedie Francaise, with a Paris publicist, Georges Cravenne, given
the job of founding the Professional and Artistic Theater
Association to promote the Molieres. Since then, winners have
included the actors Jeanne Moreau, Ute Lemper and Sophie Marceau,
the directors Peter Brook and Patrice Chereau and the playwright
Yasmina Reza (``Art'').
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, however, the award was caught in the
perennial French squabble between government-subsidized theater and
commercial theater, a problem it temporarily resolved by awarding a
best-production Moliere in each of those categories. But some
people in subsidized _ read intellectual and experimental _ theater
felt that commercial theater was favored, and their resentment
surfaced in 1996 when they boycotted the televised Moliere
ceremony. Negotiations followed, and the distinction between
subsidized and commercial theater was eliminated, replaced by
prizes for best repertory play and best new creation.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   This year's ceremony, held on May 8 in the Opera-Comique and
broadcast in prime time on the government-owned television channel
France 2, went off without controversy, with top prizes spread
around diplomatically. Best playwright, best adaptation of a
foreign play and best comedy went to Dario Fo's ``Accidental Death
of an Anarchist'' at the private Theatre la Bruyere, while best new
creation, best director and best scenic design went to Ariane
Mnouchkine's ``Tambours sur la Digue'' (``Drums Over the Dyke''),
presented at her subsidized Cartoucherie de Vincennes. The prize
for best female newcomer, in turn, went to Brook's daughter, Irina,
for her production of ``Resonances,'' by the young American
playwright Katherine Burger.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, where theatrical experimentation flourished in the
early 20th century, the end of Communism has spawned intense new
interest in theater despite the economic troubles plaguing most
theaters. As with Ireland, the conditions were ripe for the
creation of a prestigious theater award. The Golden Mask was
established as a Moscow award in 1995 and became the main national
award the following year. In order to embrace work done across
Russia, above all in St. Petersburg, winners in a range of
categories (covering music and dance as well as drama and puppetry)
are chosen from participants in a Golden Mask festival, which now
takes place in Moscow every spring. And while this year's award
ceremony was as long-winded as some Oscar evenings, the Golden Mask
now seems to have established itself as worthy of any mantelpiece.
</P>
<P>
   More of a puzzle is the absence of major theater awards in
Germany and Italy, despite traditions that embrace the likes of
Goethe and Brecht, commedia dell'arte and Pirandello. One
explanation may simply be that both countries were only founded in
the 19th century and, as such, are not dominated by a single city.
Certainly, in Germany, most theater awards are still regional. One
exception is the Bavaria Theater Prize, announced in Munich every
summer, with jurors drawn from across the country and awards given
to opera, drama, dance and new plays performed anywhere in Germany.
With Berlin the new German capital, its two main theater awards _
the Daphne Prize and the German Theater Prize _ are also growing in
stature. No German theater awards ceremony, though, has yet earned
live television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, scores of less important theater awards given by towns
and cities across the peninsula go largely unnoticed in the rest of
the country. ``In Italy, every steeple has its own teeny prize,''
Marcantonio Lucidi, a spokesman for the National Academy of
Dramatic Arts, explained. ``It's a cheap form of publicity. It
costs less to invite someone to your town and give them a tin
statue than it does to run an ad campaign.'' Still, one prize, the
Premio Ubu, created in the late 1970s by Ubu Libri, a Milan
publishing house, has won some respect, if only because, unlike
much of Italy's cultural life, it is thought to be above political
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, though, theater awards are known to those in the
theater industry and few others. Poland's Schiller Prize, given
annually to an eminent theater figure, does little to boost
contemporary theater. Japan's Education Ministry offers an annual
theater prize, but it barely merits a mention in the press.
Argentina, which offers Latin America's most developed theater, has
no fewer than four theater awards, too many to create a buzz. In
Brazil, the Shell Prize of $1,750, sponsored by the British oil
giant, has existed since 1983, but the state government of Rio de
Janeiro has now stepped in with a much more lucrative theater prize
_ $100,000 for the best production _ to be awarded for the first
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, money helps _ money for prizes, for publicity, for
glitzy awards ceremonies, for television coverage. And yet for
theater prizes to stir genuine excitement, theater-goers must first
be excited by what they have seen onstage. Or at least that is how
it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The danger arises when awards ceremonies evolve into ends unto
themselves, because once the show becomes the priority, the
temptation is to have television and movie stars handing out and
receiving top prizes. This may be good for the tabloids, good for
the television ratings, even good for the awards, but it probably
does little for theater.

 &HT;    It's the berries
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ And you thought the perfect partner for
strawberries was whipped cream. We're here to tell you about a
different marriage of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries and sweet, tart lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't pucker up.
</P>
<P>
   Think of lemon pound cake topped with berries. Or lemon curd,
lightened with _ yes _ whipped cream or sour cream, tucked in a
puff pastry or phyllo cup and topped with a sliced berry. Or maybe
strawberry-cobbler with a lemon butter cookie crust.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May in Ohio, we straddle the berry seasons. The
California strawberries will soon give way to the cherished local
crop, which, in deference to a past when this was our only
strawberry season, inevitably sparks the annual debate about
strawberry shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you grew up, or whether your mother could
cook, the argument has two antagonists. One insists on
biscuit-style cakes, which may be either individual, sweetened
biscuits or wedges cut from a large, buttered, cake-pan biscuit.
The other uses sturdy store-bought sponge cakes shaped to hold the
berries.
</P>
<P>
   But there are alternatives. To avoid a family split over the
issue, try a lemon cake, which pairs beautifully with the berries.
</P>
<P>
   Or skip the shortcake entirely and try this much easier dessert.
</P>
<P>
   We'll give you our favorite recipe for making lemon curd below.
But that said, a jar of store-bought lemon curd on the shelf is
insurance that you can fix dessert on a busy day. When buying it,
avoid cheap brands that contain artificial ingredients. The shorter
the ingredient list, the better the product. The Thursday Cottage
and Crabtree and Evelyn brands are good.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with lemon curd in the pantry and some puff pastry shells
in the freezer, all you have to bring home is the strawberries.
And, of course, the whipping cream.
</P>
<P>
   STRAWBERRY-LEMON CREAM TARTS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chilled whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup prepared lemon curd
</P>
<P>
   1 package puff pastry shells (see alternative preparation below
picture)
</P>
<P>
   1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   Sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced to fan out
</P>
<P>
   Whip cream to stiff peaks. Place lemon curd in medium bowl. Stir
in half the whipped cream to lighten the mixture, then fold in
remaining cream, leaving some streaks. The recipe can be prepared
ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate for up to one day.
</P>
<P>
   Bake four puff pastry shells according to package instructions.
When puffed and golden, remove to a rack to cool. While still warm,
use a fork to lift out the pastry lid and remove and discard any
underbaked dough in the bottom. Let cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon lemon-cream mixture in tart. Arrange strawberries on top.
Serve with additional strawberries around the pastry shell.

</P>
<P>
   (Recipe adapted from Bon Appetit).
</P>
<P>
   How to make a single large tart
</P>
<P>
   To make a single rectangular tart as pictured above, use 1 sheet
puff pastry thawed 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat
oven to 350 degrees (note: That is a lower temperature than package
instructions). Roll pastry out on lightly floured surface to
14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut four 1-inch-wide strips off short side
and four 1-inch strips off long side. Transfer pastry rectangle to
an ungreased cookie sheet. Pierce with fork. Brush with egg glaze.
Arrange 1 pastry strip on each edge of rectangle, trimming as
necessary to form straight edges. Brush top of strips with egg
glaze. Repeat with remaining pastry strips. Brush top of strips
with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake tart 5 minutes. Pierce with
fork if puffed. Continue baking until golden brown, about 20
minutes. Cool completely. Continue with recipe at right, using
berries sliced in half.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague I met in a French cooking school shared this recipe
for lemon curd years ago. I thought then, and still do, that curd
is an ugly word and renamed the recipe fresh lemon pudding when it
appeared in It's Simple, my 1980 cookbook. But lemon curd it is.
</P>
<P>
   LEMON CURD
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 1/2 cups
</P>
<P>
   1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 whole eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Juice the three lemons and grate the rind of one of them (the
best way to do this is to use a lemon zester).
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler set over simmering
water. Add the lemon rind and strained juice, the salt and sugar
and mix well with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the whole eggs and yolks together with a hand beater. Add
to the lemon-sugar mixture and cook over the simmering (not
boiling) water, stirring from time to time. After about 10 minutes
the mixture will begin to bubble. Stir or whisk constantly until
the pudding is thick and shiny. The white froth will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Cool the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   (This can be made ahead and refrigerated. Use in the tarts
above, or just mix with some freshly whipped cream for a fresh
summer pudding).

<P>
   LEMON POUND CAKE WITH STRAWBERRIES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 to 10 servings
</P>
<P>
   For cake:
</P>
<P>
   Butter and flour for greasing and dusting pan(s)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cake flour (not self-rising)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   For glaze:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   For topping:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sliced strawberries
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 1-quart kugelhopf or tube
pan with butter and dust with flour. Invert pan and tap out excess
flour.
</P>
<P>
   In medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, salt and lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl of electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until
light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after
each addition; add vanilla and beat until blended. Beat in half
flour mixture. Beat in milk and lemon juice. Beat in flour mixture
until just combined.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon batter into pan, smoothing top. Bake in middle of
preheated oven 45-55 minutes or until golden brown on top and a
tester comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on a rack 15 minutes and
invert onto rack to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare glaze while cake is cooling: In small bowl, gradually
whisk powdered sugar into lemon juice until smooth and thick.
</P>
<P>
   When cake is completely cooled, drizzle glaze over cake and let
it drip down sides. Cake can be prepared one day ahead and chilled,
covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Cut cake into slices. Top each slice with strawberries. If
desired, sweeten strawberries with a little sugar and allow to sit
10 minutes before using.
</P>
<P>
   The colored outside portion of peel is best removed with a
zester so that no bitter white pith is included.

   This recipe is from the new Instant Gratification, No -Hassle
Desserts in Just About No Time by Lauren Chattman (see review on
1C). It's nothing more than sweet strawberries baked under a lemon
cookie crust that crumbles into the juicy fruit when you dig a
spoon in. Serve it with vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   STRAWBERRY COBBLER WITH A LEMON BUTTER COOKIE CRUST
</P>
<P>

a large bowl. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until the sugar
dissolves, 5 to 7 minutes. While the berries are standing, make the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   With an electric mixer cream together the butter and remaining
1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolk, vanilla and lemon
zest, beating until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl

ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAWING FROM LEBANON OUTPOSTS
</HEADLINE>
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli troops in southern Lebanon have begun
evacuating outposts there in preparation for an overall pullout
from the area by July.
</P>
<P>
   Two outposts well inside the 9-mile-wide strip of territory
controlled by the Israelis were turned over this week to the South
Lebanon Army, or SLA, the Israeli-backed militia in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israeli positions are being emptied of heavy equipment so
they can be evacuated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a coastal outpost that had included a naval radar
station at Ras Bayada, on the northwestern edge of the Israeli-held
zone, was evacuated. And on Monday, the Israelis left another
outpost near the village of Taibe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage we've handed over forward positions to the
SLA,'' said a senior Israeli officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``These outposts are very close to villages where the
SLA men live, and will enable them to defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The handovers appear to be designed to enable members of the
Israeli-backed militia to continue functioning as locally based
armed groups after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the SLA fighters, who have been condemned as
traitors by the Lebanese government, remains unclear. The United
Nations, which is likely to take on an enhanced peacekeeping role
in the area after the Israelis depart, is said to be pressing for a
disbanding of the militia.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli officer said this week's handovers did not signal an
acceleration of the timetable for the Israeli withdrawal, which is
supposed to be completed by July. ``This is all according to the
plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The army apparently intends to relinquish outlying positions
that are more difficult to reach and defend in preparation for a
quick withdrawal from outposts closer to Israel. The process will
gradually leave fewer soldiers exposed to attacks by guerrillas of
the Party of God, who have been fighting a war of attrition to oust
the Israelis from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have kept up their assaults this week, shelling
Israeli outposts just over the border with Lebanon. Israeli
officers say they are planning for a possible withdrawal under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fighting nearby, preparations for the pullback are
in full swing along Israel's border with Lebanon. Frontier fences
that were built inside Lebanese territory are being moved back to
the boundary, military outposts jutting into Lebanon are being
relocated, and mines that were laid across the border are being
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to improve the morale of jittery residents of Israeli
border settlements who fear that the withdrawal will leave them
exposed to guerrilla attacks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced
Wednesday a government aid package for their communities. The $400
million program includes sewage, water and road projects,
assistance to schools and business incentives.

A JAZZ ICON WHO SPENT HALF A LIFE IN JAZZ TURNS 90 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY TEACHOUT   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   H. L. Mencken once suggested that in a well-run universe,
everybody would have two lives: ``one for observing and studying
the world, and the other for formulating and setting down his
conclusions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is more or less the way the clarinetist Artie Shaw, who
turns 90 on Tuesday, has contrived to arrange things.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of his long, spectacularly eventful life, he
played jazz with Bix Beiderbecke and Mozart with Leonard Bernstein;
married Lana Turner and Ava Gardner; made a movie with Fred
Astaire; and was interrogated about his left-wing ties by Joe
McCarthy. Then, at the age of 44, he stopped playing music and
started writing fiction, eventually producing a monstrously long
autobiographical novel called ``The Education of Albie Snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Though only a single chapter has seen print, Shaw's magnum opus
really does exist. (Robert Altman says he wants to turn it into a
movie, with Johnny Depp in the title role.) Still, it is unlikely
that his second career as a writer will overshadow his previous
career as a musician. In part because he became a pop-culture icon
at the age of 28, he has never been properly acknowledged as a
giant of jazz _ except by his fellow musicians. Yet his recordings
leave no possible doubt of his immense stature, as both virtuoso
soloist and nonpareil bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, much of Shaw's achievement must now be taken on faith, for
most of his records are out of print, and no label, incredibly, has
gone to the trouble of commemorating his 90th birthday. BMG, which
owns the 78s he made between 1938 and 1945, has no plans to release
a retrospective boxed set, and the only tribute thus far has been
the publication of Vladimir Simosko's ``Artie Shaw: A Musical
Biography and Discography'' (Scarecrow Press), a dry but thorough
survey of his musical career. Shaw can hardly be surprised by this
lack of interest in a legendary veteran of the swing era, since he
has spent much of his life decrying the commercialism of the
pop-music industry _ even though he also spent the better part of
three decades playing ``commercial'' music, and profiting
handsomely by it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's first big band was an ensemble of unorthodox
instrumentation (it included a string quartet) whose failure
inspired him to change musical directions and organize what he
called ``the loudest goddamn band in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He then struck it rich in 1938 with a crisp, incisive recording
of Cole Porter's ``Begin the Beguine'' that made him a superstar
virtually overnight. For all his oft-expressed contempt for
commercialism, he had a knack for making good music that pleased
the public _ a knack with which he would never come to terms _ and
the ``Beguine'' band, which featured the superlative singing of
Billie Holiday and Helen Forrest, the fiery drumming of the
21-year-old Buddy Rich and a saxophone section that played with
breathtaking fluidity and grace, was an incomparable dance band, by
turns lyrical and galvanizingly hot.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw himself wrote many of the band's lucid, transparent
arrangements. Their simplicity was intended to appeal to a mass
audience, but it had the paradoxical effect of providing an ideal
background for Shaw's richly elaborate improvisations. His intense,
saxophone-like tone was sharply focused but never shrill, even when
he was cavorting in the instrument's highest register, and his
blues solos were tinged with an exotic modal color suggestive of
synagogue chant.
</P>
<P>
   A self-made intellectual manque, he loathed the adoring teen-age
fans who had made him rich, telling one reporter they were ``a
bunch of morons.'' In 1939, he walked off a New York bandstand in
the middle of a set and never came back; within a matter of months,
though, he had moved to Hollywood and started another band, this
one equipped with nine string players and a pianist, Johnny
Guarnieri, who doubled on harpsichord with Shaw's in-house jazz
combo, the Gramercy Five. The new group became as popular as its
predecessor, turning out an elegantly poised version of ``Star
Dust'' that remains to this day one of the best-remembered
recordings of Hoagy Carmichael's most famous song.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the ``Star Dust'' band gave way to a 32-piece orchestra
with 15 strings, billed as ``Artie Shaw and His Symphonic Swing.''
Shaw, who had been studying with the classical composer David
Diamond, now sought to meld jazz and classical music in a manner
reminiscent of the Paul Whiteman band of the late '20s, using the
bluesy trumpeter-vocalist Oran (Hot Lips) Page in much the same way
Whiteman had featured Beiderbecke, an early Shaw idol. The erratic
but brilliant drummer Dave Tough drove the potentially unwieldy
group with consummate subtlety, and Paul Jordan contributed
original compositions like ``Suite No. 8,'' in which the string
section was not tacked on as an afterthought but integrated into
the ensemble with deceptive ease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Shaw broke up his Symphonic Swing, enlisted in the Navy
and toured the Pacific with a band that performed under fire at
Guadalcanal. Combat fatigue forced him stateside in 1944, and he
started a stringless civilian band featuring the great trumpeter
Roy Eldridge and an unusually diverse library of arrangements that
ranged from the Basie-style charts of Buster Harding to such wryly
witty Eddie Sauter compositions as ``The Maid with the Flaccid
Air.'' Though it was known as an ``arranger's band,'' Shaw was, as
always, firmly in control, and its performances reflected his
lifelong liking for versatility _ and accessibility. Woody Herman's
contemporaneous, bop-flavored First Herd was far looser, which may
explain why highbrow critics have always preferred it to Shaw's
postwar band, despite the latter's undeniably progressive tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Like the First Herd, the Shaw band had players interested in
bebop, including the guitarist Barney Kessel and the pianist Dodo
Marmarosa, and the ever-curious clarinetist began to explore the
new style alongside them in an updated Gramercy Five. After a
hiatus during which he played only classical music, he returned yet
again to the bandstand in 1949, this time with a full-fledged bop
group; by then, he had assimilated the musical dialect of bebop,
and his solos were every bit as contemporary-sounding as those of
his younger side men, among them the tenor saxophonists Al Cohn and
Zoot Sims.
</P>
<P>
   The big bands were dying off fast, though, and Shaw's bop band
broke up after just five months. Thereafter, he shuttled in and out
of music, taking a year off to write ``The Trouble With
Cinderella'' (1952), a self-conscious but compelling memoir in
which he cataloged the destructive effects of what he called
``$ucce$$.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he put together one last Gramercy Five that
teamed him with the guitarist Tal Farlow and the pianist Hank
Jones. Stimulated by their playing, he rose to new heights of
musical sophistication, and it seemed he was finally ready to give
up on $ucce$$ and settle for being a distinctive jazz soloist.
Instead, he quit music in the fall of 1954, and never played
clarinet again. Giving up the clarinet, he has said, was like
cutting off ``a gangrenous right arm . . . to save your life.''
</P>
<P>
   At 90, Shaw is by all accounts the same garrulous, curious,
contentious man who put down his instrument 46 years ago, longing
to free himself from the seductive lures of superstardom but never
quite capable of turning his back on fame. He has a Web site,
artieshaw.com, on which is posted a third-person autobiographical
statement so self-aggrandizing as to be endearing: ``Shaw is
regarded by many as the finest and most innovative of all jazz
clarinetists, a leader of some of the greatest musical aggregations
ever assembled, and one of the most adventurous and accomplished
figures in American music.'' You'd have to laugh at such
braggadocio, except for one thing _ it's all true. &QR;

   NEW YORK _ Dance Theater of Harlem celebrates its 30th
anniversary this year. The classical ballet company was founded by
Arthur Mitchell, a leading dancer with the New York City Ballet at
the time, in response to the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the
founders of City Ballet, encouraged Mitchell to start the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   City Ballet will salute the company in three shared programs on
May 25, 27 and 28 at the New York State Theater . The two companies
performed together at the State Theater in 1971. This week's event
will include a new ballet, ``Tributary,'' choreographed by Robert
Garland of Dance Theater and Robert La Fosse of City Ballet, as
well as performances of Balanchine's ``Agon'' and ``Slaughter on
Tenth Avenue,'' two works associated with Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, Mitchell and Peter Martins, a principal dancer at
City Ballet who became artistic director of the company after
Balanchine's death in 1983, talked with Jennifer Dunning of The New
York Times backstage at the State Theater about the joys and perils
of directing ballet troupes. Here are excerpts from a conversation
punctuated by roars of laughter and sympathetic murmurs.
</P>
<P>
   PETER MARTINS. What I often wonder, when I look back, is what it
must have been like for B. when he started. What is the hardest
thing: to establish something, to start from scratch, build
something where there was nothing before? Or to maintain a colossal
institution that requires so much attention in so many areas?
Probably the toughest thing is to start something.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR MITCHELL. Well, it's something like six of one and half a
dozen of the other. You have to have a maniacal belief in what
you're doing. In the final analysis, I think the common denominator
is the vision that we're all after. All of us want the best that we
can do in the art form. We are in service, not servants, but in
service to the art form. And once you understand that, everything
else begins to fall in place.
</P>
<P>
   I look back at some of the things that B. and Lincoln were
criticized for. Everyone says they want change, but when you try to
change something they just resist you all the time. I think that
tenacity rubbed off on us.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNNING. How did you feel when you realized you were
going to do this? Terror? Excitement?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. I never felt terror. Not one moment in my life. I don't
know why. Excitement? No. Neither excitement nor terror. It was
much more like it was the right thing. I had to do it. It was
almost my calling.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. You don't think in terms of terror. There is a sense
of excitement. But you know this is the right thing to do and you
are consumed with it. There are moments when you think, Oh, Lord,
why me? But you are doing what you love to do. How many people ever
get that opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. What were your earliest priorities?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. The very first thing that I thought of was stability.
Somebody like George Balanchine passes away and you've got an
organization here where everybody's sobbing and a lot of you
couldn't even get to work. I've never seen such despair, and such
misery, when he died, within these walls. Myself included. But
there was no time to dwell on it. We had to go onstage two hours
later. So life had to go on. My priority was to try to create an
environment in which we could just go on. It was very important to
put calmness on the agenda. To provide leadership that did not
introduce change. I wanted continuation. And I wanted the natural
time to go by. That was very very important to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. With the assassination of Dr. King, I was driving
through the streets of Harlem and I saw all this unrest and
unhappiness. How could we funnel this into something that will be
constructive, not destructive? The arts. And particularly dance,
because it's so physical. And I said, ``Well, let me take the
education I've had downtown with the New York City Ballet,
Balanchine, Lincoln, all my colleagues, and start what could be
like a haven, where young people can come in and get that sense of
discipline and structure in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every child is going to be an artist or be a dancer. But
they're learning how to live by doing. That sense of loss, of
giving a sense of purpose, is what we're all about. When the
physical entity has been taken away, you've got to put something in
its place. And that is when you have to do what you do well.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. What are the priorities today?
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. Survival. It was a challenge years ago to prove that a
dancer can be an administrator or fund-raiser. But that's not my
goal. The Arthur Mitchell of 31 years ago and the Arthur Mitchell
of today are totally different persons. I've only gone through high
school. I've never been to college. So I don't know what Harvard
Business School would do. I know what I would do.
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. I would second Arthur by saying survival is always the
No. 1 priority in the world in which we live. On the other hand,
considering that it's been 17 years since B. died, and considering
the health and the state of affairs of the New York City Ballet,
both artistically and financially, and public attendance and so
forth, I don't think it is premature to say that we sort of did
survive. I look at the dancers and they're as fine as they've ever
been, if not better. I look at the management team. It is
extraordinary. I look at quality of life in this theater that has
improved so vastly.
</P>
<P>
   I would say that the next thing I wish more than anything is new
repertory. I think it is vitally important for the New York City
Ballet to be able to identify _ or help identify _ choreographers
of the future. To be able to create a repertory for the future that
will appeal to today's public, and beyond that, I think is sort of
my mandate.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. What are the most enjoyable and troublesome aspects of
running a company today?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. Just yesterday or the day before, I taught class. And
Arthur's and my own company kids were there. And there was
something unbelievably enjoyable about being in that studio for an
hour and a half trying to give these kids everything I know, that I
had learned from Balanchine and elsewhere. And see how they soaked
it up, with enthusiasm and hunger. That was a moment of great,
great pleasure. Another moment is just to be in a studio
choreographing with some of the best dancers anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. Teaching, choreographing, coaching, working. All the
other aspects are very intriguing but not really what you're about.
For myself, I do it because I have to do it. At one time it was a
challenge. But I've proven that, to myself anyway. So consequently
I'd like to get back to what I should be about.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. Troubles?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. I never look at things as trouble. There are things I
don't enjoy as much. I don't particularly love staying behind my
desk and I basically don't ever do that. I sort of run around with
papers in my hand. Running this company is like a puzzle. Every
little piece works together. I love to deal with marketing. It
fascinates me. But if I only did marketing, I'd go crazy. The fact
is I can do that for an hour, and then go in and choreograph, and
then run in and teach, and then go to a board meeting, and then
have a fund-raising event. So I don't know if there's anything _
yes, the only thing I cannot bear is 8:30 morning meetings!
Especially now that I am a suburbanite.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. Yes, yes! I understand! Basically, we're night people.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. Is this a somewhat lonely job?
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. It's the aloneness of the long distance runner. If you
are leading the pack, everyone is running behind you and looking at
the back of your head. Occasionally, you'd like to look to the side
and see somebody there.
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. I don't feel lonely. But there are very, very tough
decisions to be made. You have obviously a few people whom you
trust and you ask advice and so forth. There have been two or three
times in my life here when I thought: ``What would B. have done?
What would Lincoln have advised?'' Those are the tough moments, I
think. You go in and you close your door.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. Have there been things Balanchine or Kirstein said that
proved particularly helpful?
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. B. used to say to me all the time: ``No, dear, don't
listen to anybody. Don't take anybody's advice.'' Just do what you
think is right. You will make mistakes. But at least you did what
you believed.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. What might Balanchine say looking down on you and your
two companies today?
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. ``Very good, my son.''
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. Who knows? But I'd like to think that B. might say,
``You know, my dear, I can't tell you.'' And then he would probably
say, ``No, not perfect, but still, amazing.'' That's what I think
he would say. And you know what? He should be saying that.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. Should the Balanchine repertory be preserved in part by
having dancers coach the roles they created?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. It depends. Can you remove yourself enough from when
you danced the role? Once there was a very famous dancer here,
coming and coaching another very famous dancer, in a very famous
role. And I can tell you, B. had a fit. He said: ``He did it that
way, and that was great for him. This one should do it his way.''
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. And the thing is, when you're dancing B.'s
choreography, it's all in the music.
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. There is a very famous ballet in this company,
originated by a very famous ballerina, that has very famous images.
And you know what? Those images were mannerisms. If you were not
present when these things occurred, you automatically assume that
that is the choreography. And I remember B.'s saying, ``I didn't
choreograph that.'' I could go on and on and on about these famous
or, if you want to call them infamous, stories. Don't forget, we
were here. And the people who are writing about it, they don't know
these things.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. These are the moments that you asked about earlier.
It's not loneliness, it's making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   DUNNING. Are you preparing successors?
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS. I'm not looking for a successor at all. I find myself
very useful and vigorous. On the other hand, from the day I started
I looked for people who might have the inclination to devote their
life to what I have been doing in my life. But no one has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL. There's a hunger. There's something inside people. You
can't stop it. And all you can say is: ``Pick my brain. Learn from
me. I'll give you all the opportunities. But then are you willing
to devote your life to this?'' Everything else is going to take
second place. B. and Lincoln said I would never sleep again. Not
that I think I'm going any place, because I asked the powers above
to please take me away and they said: ``Not yet, my son. You've got
much more to do.''

   Any good marketer knows that one of the keys to a product's
success is to extend the brand name into new areas. America Online
has lots of good marketers (witness those 250-hours-free CDs, the
stuff of junk-mail legend), so it comes as little surprise that AOL
is now extending its brand name into schools.
</P>
<P>
   With AOL(at)School (www.school.aol.com), which began operating
this week, America Online is offering schools an easy gateway to
the Internet, similar to what Electric SchoolHouse, the Copernicus
Education Gateway and others have done. AOL's service consists of
six portals, four for students (grouped by grade, from kindergarten
through high school), one for teachers and one for administrators.
All are available no matter what Internet service provider is used,
and will also be available from home.
</P>
<P>
   The student portals contain links to educational sites that have
been approved by a group of educators selected by AOL and the
American Association of School Administrators, including Compton's
Encyclopedia, the Smithsonian Institution and The New York Times
Learning Network. The portals also offer several controls on
access: a search engine filters out inappropriate sites, and access
to chat, e-mail and instant messaging can be restricted by school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free, and there will be no advertising on student
portals, the company says. The teachers' and administrators'
portals, however, will have ``sponsorship messages,'' AOL says, as
well as an e-commerce component so schools can stock up on
old-fashioned things like chalk and erasers.

   Photo Bought on the Web May Show Emily Dickinson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emily Dickinson has always been a mystery. Before her death in
1886, only 10 of her more than 1,700 poems had been published. She
has also been known by one photograph, taken when she was 17, but
another image has surfaced which may show her at age 25 or 30
(www.unc.edu/ &UR; (tilde) &LR; gura/ed/index.html).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Gura, a professor of American literature and culture
at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill who is a
collector of daguerreotypes and 19th-century photographs, bought
the photograph for $481 from a collector on eBay, the Internet
auction site.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph looks like the poet and has her name and the year
of her death on the back, but Gura, a forensic anthropologist, will
compare the new photo with the older one to see if the physical
measurements match. He will also examine the handwriting on the
back to see if it matches one of her known correspondents.

   A New Service on the Net That Will Take Dictation
</P>
<P>
   Slow typists of the world may find relief in a new Internet
dictation service that promises to turn spoken words into a
polished document in about an hour, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Users of the service first call the company, iDictate.com, at
(877) DICTATE or (800) 342-8283 and speak their message. The
service, based in San Francisco, records your voice, turns it into
an audio computer file and sends the file over the Internet to one
of hundreds of typists based around the world, as far away as
India.
</P>
<P>
   Once the message is transcribed, the company checks for errors
and returns it to the caller via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The service is available only in English, but the company's
founder, Lee Dorfman, said that other languages were on the way.
Callers can also fax a handwritten note for typing and can have the
company send a message.
</P>
<P>
   First-time users can try the service free for up to 100 words.
After that, the service charges one cent per word, or about $3 to
$4 per page of double-spaced text.

   Gamepad Uses Radio Waves And Awaits PlayStation 2
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the $40 Airplay video game controller looks
much like any one of many handheld game devices. But a closer look
reveals a significant advance: hey, no wires.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Eleven Engineering, based in Canada, Airplay uses radio
waves, which are more reliable than the infrared signals used by
television remote controllers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company hopes to ride an expected tidal wave of
console-product sales with the introduction in October of Sony's
much-anticipated PlayStation 2 in North America. Sony is preparing
to ship 2 million PlayStation 2 consoles to North America this
year.
</P>
<P>
   John Sobota, the chief executive of Eleven Engineering, said his
company's controller, which has the familiar configuration of
control keys, d-pad and thumb-controlled joysticks, is fully
compatible with the new PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a range of up to 25 feet, and in a demonstration
last week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles its
game could not be interrupted by objects or people moving between
it and the game console.
</P>
<P>
   ``Console gaming has evolved well beyond conventional
controllers,'' Sobota said in a company statement.

   A Lilliputian Printer For Palm Handheld Devices
</P>
<P>
   Got a Palm PDA and no place to print? Monarch Marking Systems
has developed a small portable printer that snaps on to the Palm
and allows users to print text, graphics and bar codes from their
handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarch 6015 Printer, which sells for $399, weighs less than
16 ounces and runs on four AA batteries or an optional AC adapter.
The Monarch 6015 uses a roll of thermal paper and can print
documents 2 inches by 4 inches. Information on how to order is
available at www.monarch.com.
</P>
<P>
   The current version of the printer will work with the larger
Palm III and Palm VII devices, and a model that will fit the petite
Palm V series is being developed. Another version of the printer
will offer a magnetic-stripe reader so that a user can swipe a
credit card and print out a receipt on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the printer may appeal most to those who spend their days
hanging around bar codes and other professional applications, the
Monarch 6015 could be helpful around the house for printing grocery
lists, recipes, calendars and business cards. Users of the Palm VII
may find the Monarch printer useful for printing out directions
from the MapQuest Web site, movie and flight schedules, e-mail
messages and articles from some of the online versions of The Wall
Street Journal and other news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Although unsuitable for printing out term papers, the Monarch
may find its way into the hallowed halls of academia anyway. The
company says that schools have inquired about using the 6015 to
print detention slips on the spot.

THE SEEKER: CATCHING UP WITH THE FORMER CAT STEVENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curiosity killed Cat Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   A singer, songwriter and guitarist whose simple melodies were
artfully aligned with lyrics both whimsical and mysterious, he'd
clawed out a niche for himself in the early 1970s with a string of
hits including ``Wild World,'' ``Moonshadow'' and ``Peace Train.''
He had eight gold albums in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born son of a Greek Cypriot father and Swedish
mother, Stevens' dark, exotic good looks made him stand out, and
women everywhere found him irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't enough. Admired and coddled, but troubled
inside, Stevens began investigating the Koran, the Islamic holy
book, and within its pages he found the answers he felt he'd been
looking for. In 1977, he pronounced himself a Muslim, took on the
name Yusuf Islam (``Joseph Rescued'') and eventually entered into
an arranged marriage. He auctioned off his guitars, pianos and
awards and bid good riddance to the secular world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always extremely committed to whatever I did,'' Islam
said. ``And sometimes I had to close my mind to everything else in
order to achieve my goal. I did that when I was a songwriter. I
almost didn't listen to anybody else's music, because I thought it
might influence me, and I'd end up copying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did it when I entered my spiritual discovery of Islam.
It made me think only about just that, and I didn't want to think
about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscing on the telephone from his London office, Islam, now
52, said those last years as Cat Stevens were marked by
half-finished spiritual quests and indecision. The Koran _ a gift
from his brother David _ was the answer. ``I'd had many dreams of
walking away,'' he said. ``But only when I had enough knowledge of
where I wanted to go could I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Demetri Georgiou was born in London's West End, where his
musical interests included Russian choral music, traditional Greek
folk songs, musical theater, the blues and rock 'n' roll. ``All
that formed the tapestry of my background,'' he said. ``But one of
the songs that really stuck out for me was `Up on the Roof.' That
just brought to life what I used to do. We used to climb those
roofs in that part of London. And out came this song, I couldn't
believe it was a direct reflection of my life. And my interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my all-time favorite figures was Ledbelly; he had such
a story to tell. And his words were real. They smacked of reality.
That, I liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dylan came along and started poetically putting in the
ideas of freedom and a new lifestyle, it was just an inspiration.
It all came together at once.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 19 when a record producer signed him up, changed his name
and made him a pop star with ``Matthew and Son'' and ``The First
Cut is the Deepest,'' heavily orchestrated takes on songs he had
written. He opened for Engelbert Humperdinck and Jimi Hendrix,
before a bout with tuberculosis put him in the hospital for a year,
his career all but over.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Stevens re-emerged with ``Mona Bone Jakon,'' an
all-acoustic, introspective set of songs that sounded nothing like
his teen hits. ``I'd just come out of a very dark phase, and that
of course gave me a great understanding that I was not immortal,''
he said, ``that life meant hard knocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming out of that with some kind of sense of my
destiny, but not really knowing exactly which direction it was
going to take. But I had a great optimism, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   With the smash albums ``Tea For the Tillerman'' and ``Teaser and
the Firecat,'' Cat Stevens' new style of what he called ``gentle
folksinging'' crossed the Atlantic; he was the dark-eyed, hypnotic
European equivalent of James Taylor, who came to prominence at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Stevens' songs frequently referred to God and a hunger for
spiritual balance. ``It was just under the surface,'' he said.
``The nature behind the artist is not really changeable. There are
those perceptions, those insights which are privately known and
sometimes come out poetically, and in colors, music and sound, and
in emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're difficult to interpret when you're experiencing them,
but from this perspective now, they're easier to see, and more
clear.'' He points to the songs ``Miles From Nowhere,'' ``On the
Road to Find Out'' and ``Sitting'' as examples.
</P>
<P>
   He tried Buddhism, Taoism and even numerology, changing his
religious convictions as quickly as he took on and discarded
musical styles. ``I was always looking for something different,''
he said. ``And like many people, I used to get bored quickly. And
if I got a little bit tired with myself, or with my clothes, or
with the songs, I'd try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Brazil in the mid-'70s, to escape Britain's
crippling tax laws, and his love of the polyrhythms of South
America gave his music a harder, more syncopated edge. ``I was
balancing between many different demands,'' he explains. ``One was
my artistic expectation of myself, and from that point of view I
was always trying to go past new boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   His audience, however, did not follow, and by the time of the
last Cat Stevens album, 1978's ``Back to Earth,'' his sales had
fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier material remains in demand; this week, MCA Records
will issue re-mastered CDs of ``Mona,'' ``Tea'' and ``Teaser,''
with the rest of the Cat Stevens catalog to follow later in the
year. Islam is helping to assemble a box set for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The father of five children, Islam is the chairman of the
Islamic Schools Trust, which he set up in 1983. He runs the Islamia
primary and secondary schools for boys and girls in London, and
recently issued a children's CD, ``A Is for Allah,'' which blends a
spoken-word explanation of the Islamic alphabet with a capella
singing (Western musical instruments are frowned upon in Islam).
</P>
<P>
   Islam was internationally vilified when he appeared to support
Iran's 1989 fatwa, or sentence of death, on author Salmon Rushdie,
whose book ``Satanic Verses'' Muslim leaders consider blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   He won't discuss the matter any more; however, in a statement
issued at the time, Islam said he'd been misquoted. While he
supports the Muslim idea of supreme punishment for blasphemy, he
said, he didn't think it was right to hunt someone down and kill
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been fairly misunderstood,'' he said. ``And life's
been a struggle to explain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last year or so has he felt comfortable discussing
Cat Stevens again. ``I see the value more these days in the kind of
heritage which I've left in the music and lyrics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can separate in my own mind that which is good and that
which is bad, and not only that, but so many people still gain
value from those songs. I'm always receiving letters from fans and
people who my music has touched. Recently, there was a letter from
someone who said literally they were on the verge of suicide, and
then they listened to one of my songs and it changed them. And
that's really positive.''

UNREASONABLE BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horseshoe crab is a textbook case of an ancient inhabitant
of planet Earth providing a substance of critical importance to a
much later arrival _ human beings. Thirty years ago, a researcher
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute discovered that something
in the horseshoe crab's blood had an uncanny ability to detect
bacterial remains that can be left on medical equipment or in
intravenous solutions, even after sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the great majority of medical-supply companies worldwide
do their testing for bacterial contamination with the Limulus
Amebocyte Lysate made from the blood of the horseshoe crab, which
sells for $1,000 a liter. The animal, whose pedigree goes back to
the dinosaurs and the primitive coelacanth fish, is clearly earning
its keep and deserves close protection. That said, the US Interior
Department should rethink its recent ban on the use for bleeding of
crabs off the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Monomoy National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The real threat is from fishermen who use the crabs for bait,
not from lysate-producing companies like Associates of Cape Cod.
The Falmouth firm, one of four in the field in the United States,
draws about 30 percent of the crabs' blood and then returns them
alive to the waters whence they came. About 60 percent of its crabs
come from the now off-limits areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration did a study
indicating that the mortality rate for crabs that have been bled is
about 10 percent higher than normal. Since then, an official of
Associates of Cape Cod says, the conditions for bleeding crabs have
improved, and the mortality rate could well be lower.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of bleeding and returning crabs has been going on
for 25 years, but the Cape Cod National Seashore now says it must
be stopped because the seashore's enabling legislation prohibits
the removal of wildlife for private commercial gain. That is an
eminently sound rule, but in a case like this, with a clear social
benefit and in which the wildlife are not intentionally killed, it
should be possible for the Interior secretary to justify a special,
limited permit.

LOW-SALT DIET FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS DRUGS AGAINST HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY

<TEXT>
<P>
   A diet low in salt and high in fruits, vegetables and low-fat
dairy products can lower blood pressure as much as medication can,
researchers reported Wednesday, confirming earlier work showing
that diet can help to treat high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers urged that people with hypertension adopt the
diet, and, in a more controversial recommendation, said that
healthy people should follow it, too, to prevent hypertension. The
diet lowered blood pressure in both groups, though the benefit was
greater in those with high blood pressure, who achieved reductions
averaging 11.5/5.7 millimeters of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 million Americans have high blood pressure, defined as
readings consistently higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury, or
130/85 in diabetics. Readings below 120/80 are considered optimal,
and those between 120/80 and 140/90 are called ``high normal.''
Untreated, the condition increases the risk of stroke, heart attack
and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the availability of drugs to lower blood pressure,
hypertension is often ignored or poorly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The diet in the study contained less than half as much salt as
most Americans eat, and subjects had all their meals prepared for
them by dietitians. The researchers said they did not know whether
most people, cooking for themselves and eating in restaurants,
would be able to stick to such a diet. The scientists called on the
food industry to lower the amount of salt in processed foods to
make it easier for people to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Previous calls to limit salt in healthy people have provoked
heated debate, with some scientists arguing that the resulting
blood pressure reductions, if any, were too small to be worth the
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors of the study said their findings proved that
restricting salt was beneficial. The scientists, led by Dr. Frank
Sacks of the Harvard Medical School, announced their findings on
Wednesday in New York at a meeting of the American Society of
Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which supported
the $11.8 million study, issued a statement from its director, Dr.
Claude Lenfant, saying that the study had proved once and for all
that reducing salt in the diet helps everyone, even people who do
not have hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding suggests than an intake below that now recommended
could help many Americans prevent the blood pressure rises that now
occur with advancing age,'' Dr. Lenfant said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called DASH-Sodium, for Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension, included 412 people, aged 22 and older. About 57
percent were female, and 57 percent were black; blacks have a
higher risk of hypertension than whites. About 41 percent had
hypertension, and the rest were ``high-normal,'' above 120/80.
</P>
<P>
   They ate either their normal diet, but with varying amounts of
salt, or a special DASH diet, also with varying amounts of salt and
including five cups of fruits and vegetables and three cups of
low-fat dairy products per day. The sodium levels from the salt
were 1.5 grams, 2.4 grams or 3.3 grams a day. Most Americans eat
3.5 grams a day, the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of table salt.
</P>
<P>
   The DASH diet alone and sodium restriction alone both lowered
blood pressure, but the greatest reduction came when the special
diet was combined with the lowest level of sodium.

PROPOSAL WOULD HELP POOR NATIONS SHOP FOR CHEAPER AIDS DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Brazil caught world health authorities by surprise on
Wednesday by asking them to set up a database of prices of all
anti-AIDS drugs, a move that would allow poor countries to shop for
the best deal worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has upset the world's large pharmaceutical
companies because the database would have to include drugs made in
countries like Brazil, India and Thailand, whose laws disregard
many drug patents. Companies in those countries, and some others,
make generic versions of the most important _ and most expensive _
AIDS drugs and sell them for pennies per dose.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is at the heart of the debate over drug prices. The
major American and European drugmakers argue that they alone should
have the right to manufacture and sell the drugs they invented, and
that any decision to offer lower prices to poor countries should be
theirs, as five companies did last week in a landmark agreement
with the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of public health advocates, advocates for those
with AIDS, Third World governments and Third World pharmaceutical
industries argue that poor nations should be allowed to use clauses
in world trade treaties that let countries facing health
emergencies void the patents on life-saving drugs and make their
own low-cost generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the world's poor nations _ the vast majority of
which lack indigenous drug industries _ the database would make it
easier to import cheap remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil made its request as a surprise amendment to a resolution
before the World Health Assembly, the annual meeting of all the
world's health ministers at the United Nations convention center in
Geneva. It seemed to be getting wide support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason Brazil got so much support is that its
proposal got to the heart of the matter: that countries want to be
able to shop around the world for the best deals,'' said Ellen 't
Hoen, a health policy consultant to Doctors Without Borders, the
medical aid agency. ``That's scary to the pharmaceutical companies,
because it will show that their expensive drugs are sold elsewhere
at tiny fractions of their prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers from Doctors Without Borders and from Act Up, an
American advocacy group for people with AIDS, both of whom strongly
support the Brazilian initiative, said the U.S. delegation
initially fought it, though the Americans denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening in Geneva, it was agreed that a committee
would meet on Friday to draft new amendments based on Brazil's
proposal and some offered later by other countries on blood banks,
traditional medicine and other issues. The committee will include
representatives from countries with large pharmaceutical
industries, as well as countries hit hard by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond opposition from major pharmaceutical companies, creating
and maintaining such a database presents problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   If the Brazilian amendment passed, it could put a huge burden on
the organization, said Dr. Daniel Tarantola, senior policy adviser
to the director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland. Drug prices change
constantly, so a large monitoring staff would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   More important, a database under the aegis of the World Health
Organization, a U.N. agency, could be taken as an endorsement that
all the drugs in it were safe, a representative of the
international pharmaceutical industry said. The World Health
Organization does not now have the money to test them.
</P>
<P>
   A mere database is not controversial, Tarantola said, ``but
we've been asked to do something requiring far more money and
information and staff than we can afford.''

U.S. INVESTMENT FIRM EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER A FAILED JAPANESE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government is expected to announce as early
as Thursday that W.L. Ross &AMP; Co., an investment concern run by the
American bankruptcy specialist Wilbur L. Ross _ together with a
unit of Daiwa Securities _ has been chosen to take over Kofuku
Bank, a regional bank in Osaka that failed in May 1999, people
close to the deal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale signals that contrary to recent speculation, Japan has
not closed the door to potential acquisitions of banks by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has been one of the most committed investors in Asia since
financial crisis shook the region in 1997 and 1998, promoting his
vision of the opportunities that lay in ``vulture investing'' there
_ the purchase of distressed assets.
</P>
<P>
   As senior managing director at Rothschild Ltd., a position he
held before starting his own firm earlier this year, he pledged $1
billion to revive the bankrupt Halla group in South Korea, and
together with Daiwa, he invested in a bankrupt auto parts supplier
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry analysts say that Japanese regional banks badly
need to consolidate and lower costs, but progress has been slow. A
string of smaller banks _ Tokyo Sowa Bank, Kokumin Bank, Niigata
Chuo Bank and Kofuku _ went under last year, in spite of the
availability of public funds dedicated to help faltering financial
institutions. Kofuku failed with 52.3 billion yen _ $428 million at
then-exchange rates _ in excess liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of foreign-backed buyers in the marketplace may
accelerate the pace of change by intensifying competition. There
have been rumors that Ripplewood Holdings LLC of New York, a buyout
firm that was the lead investor in a group that purchased the
insolvent Long-Term Credit Bank last year, is interested in buying
Tokyo Sowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has said previously that he saw merit in cobbling together
a stable of small regional Japanese banks.

DRUGS AND PSYCHOTHERAPY TOGETHER ARE BETTER THAN EACH ALONE, STUDY
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: R.I., Pa., Va.)  By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to treating depression, those who espouse drugs as
the most effective therapy and those who champion psychotherapy
have often been at war.
</P>
<P>
   But a study indicates that at least for patients with chronic
depression, a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy
works significantly better than either treatment alone.
</P>
<P>
   The study, appearing in Thursday's issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine, is the largest to compare drugs and
psychotherapy for chronic depression.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 weeks of treatment, the response among the patients
given only an antidepressant and the patients who received 16 to 20
sessions of psychotherapy was about the same: 55 percent in the
drug group and 52 percent in the psychotherapy group showed
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But the response rates jumped sharply for the subjects given
both the drug and psychotherapy, with 85 percent showing
significant improvement in their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have the combination treatment, the incremental
effect is dramatic,'' said the study's lead investigator, Dr.
Martin B. Keller, Mary Zucker Professor and chairman of psychiatry
at Brown University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 519 patients, at 12 academic medical centers across
the country, completed the course of treatment for the study. As in
other studies, patients taking the antidepressant improved more
quickly during the first few weeks of treatment than those
receiving psychotherapy. But by the 12th and final week, the
researchers found, patients in the psychotherapy group had caught
up.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of Americans, Keller said, suffer from chronic
depression, a condition that can persist for years. On average,
patients in the study reported suffering from some form of
depression for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which
makes Serzone, the antidepressant used in the study. All but one of
the 12 principal authors of the study have consulted for, received
honorariums from or had other financial dealings with the company,
and with other companies that make antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Serzone was used, Keller said, because it appears less likely
than some other drugs to produce sexual dysfunction as a side
effect, and because it aids sleep, an advantage for depressed
patients who often have trouble sleeping. Cognitive behavioral
analysis, the form of psychotherapy used in the study, was
developed by Dr. James P. McCullough, a psychologist at Virginia
Commonwealth University who was a co-author in this research. The
method, the journal's report said, ``teaches patients to focus on
the consequences of their behavior'' and uses a ``social
problem-solving'' approach to interpersonal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. DeRubeis, an associate professor of psychology at
the University of Pennsylvania, said the study was significant,
because it showed the two treatments to be equivalent in
effectiveness and because it demonstrated the additional benefits
of combining them.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that many people were likely to receive one form of
treatment or the other, not both, for a variety of reasons,
including cost considerations, restrictions on insurance coverage,
drug side effects and personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other researchers said the fact that patients receiving
both drugs and psychotherapy were also more likely to have a
complete remission of their symptoms should encourage managed care
companies to foot the bill for combined treatment. Studies indicate
that the more thoroughly a patient recovers from depression, the
less likely a patient will relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even from a cost point of view, I would endorse the combined
treatment approach for chronic depression, especially for the long
run,'' said Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation of the study, the researchers and others said, is
that it did not compare Serzone with placebo pills, leaving it
unclear whether other drugs would perform as well. Similarly,
cognitive behavioral analysis was not compared in the study with
other forms of psychotherapy, or with a treatment involving
emotional support and general morale-boosting but not
psychotherapy.

CLINTON PAINTS GRIM WORLD SCENARIO FOR COAST GUARD GRADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ President Clinton Wednesday presented his
most sweeping argument for how the explosion of technology and the
openness of America's borders pose new challenges and dangers for
the nation, and said it was time for the country to be prepared for
the prospect of biological and chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber and foreboding 34-minute commencement address at the
US Coast Guard Academy, Clinton accused Osama bin Laden, the
Afghanistan-based Islamic militant, of plotting terrorist attacks
against the United States on New Year's Eve and called the ``Love
Bug'' computer virus no accident. He also warned of the dangers of
global warming, noting that nine out of the 10 warmest years since
the 15th century were recorded in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   US officials previously have linked bin Laden to New Year's Eve
bomb plots. Clinton, having largely avoided public statements about
the threat, Wednesday offered his most extensive comments on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last December, working with Jordan, we shut down a plot to
place large bombs at locations where Americans might gather on New
Year's Eve,'' he said. ``We learned this plot was linked to
terrorist camps in Afghanistan, and the organization created by
Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the 1998 bombings of our
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans
and hundreds of Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a US Customs agent in Seattle discovered bomb
materials being smuggled into this country from Canada, the same
material he said was used by bin Laden in other places.
``Thankfully, and thanks to Jordan, New Year's passed without an
attack. But the threat was real, and we had to cooperate with them,
with the Canadians, with others throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called his address to the 190 graduating cadets, their
families, faculty, and friends gathered at Memorial Field on the
sunny west bank of the Thames River ``nostalgic'' because it is the
last one he will deliver as president to a graduating class of a
military service academy.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Clinton announced that he is adding $300
million on top of the $9 billion in funding for counterterrorism
that is contained in his 2001 budget. ``It sounds like a lot of
money,'' he said. ``When you see the evidence of what we're up
against, I think you will support it.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra $300 million would be used for such measures as
tighter surveillance along the US-Canada border, including the
installation of high-resolution cameras and other advanced
monitoring equipment, the White House said. Among the other steps
are stronger efforts to track the financing of terrorist
organizations and increasing the number of Joint Terrorism Task
Forces, which combine the efforts of federal and local agencies, to
37 from 26.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the same technology that gave this country ``the
marvelous possibilities of the Internet also apparently empowered a
student sitting in the Philippines to launch a computer virus that
in just a few hours spread through more than 10 million computers
and caused billions of dollars in damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a satellite malfunction two years ago that disabled
pagers, ATMs, credit-card systems, and TV and radio networks around
the world, he said: ``That was an accident. The Love Bug was not an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central reality of our time is that the advent of
globalization and the revolution in information technology have
magnified both the creative and the destructive potential of every
individual, tribe, and nation on our planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While international terrorism is not new, Clinton said it has
become more sophisticated. ``Terrorist networks communicate on the
World Wide Web, too. Available weapons are becoming more
destructive and more miniaturized, just as the size of cellular
phones and computers is shrinking _ shrinking to the point where a
lot of you with large hands like mine wonder if you'll be able to
work the things before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should understand that the same process of miniaturization
will find its way into the development of biological and chemical,
and maybe, even nuclear weapons. And it is something we have to be
ready for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said climate change could become ``a national
security challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we change course and reverse global greenhouse gas
emissions, most scientists are convinced that storms and droughts
will intensify as the globe continues to warm, crop patterns will
be disrupted, food supplies will be affected, the seas will rise so
high they will swallow islands and coastal area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said the world is threatened by infections
from malaraia, tuberculosis, and AIDS, as well as narco-trafficking
and drugs. And he included his push for permanent trade relations
with China into his warning about global threats, as Congress
prepares to vote next week on whether to give such status to the
world's most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a national security issue for stability in Asia, peace
in the Taiwan Straits, possible cooperation with China to advance
freedom and human rights within the country, and to retard the
proliferation of dangerous weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he disagreed with the notion that the United States
doesn't need to play such an active role in the world since the end
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``America has been called a shining city on a hill;
that doesn't mean our oceans are moats; it doesn't mean our country
is a fortress. If we wait to act until problems come home to
America, problems are far more likely to come to America.''

BRINGING DOWN HOUSES, FROM `MONY MONY' TO OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Ill., Wash., Mass., Ind., Mo., Va., S.C., Wis., Ky.,
Germany)  (For release Sunday, May 21) 
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was basically a product of the pop generation,''
said the lyric tenor Gregory Turay, 27, the latest winner of the
Richard Tucker Award, the fanciest American prize an American
classical singer can win. Back in his teens, as a rocker with his
father's band Time Trax, he would bring the house down with Billy
Idol's ``Mony Mony.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at him now, hair slicked back in the style of his more
recent idol Jussi Bjoerling, singing impeccable Schubert and
Schumann and Faure and Britten in lyric tones that tug gently at
the heartstrings. Or as the final singer in a master class with the
veteran Italian tenor Carlo Bergonzi early this month at the Kaye
Playhouse, giving his all to the smitten Nemorino's love song from
the first act of Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore'': for the first time
during the evening, Bergonzi treats a young singer as a colleague
rather than a novice, not dwelling on the rudiments but going
straight for the fine points.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the big thing in Turay's future was the premiere of
William Bolcom's setting of Arthur Miller's blue-collar classic,
``A View From the Bridge,'' at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Turay
took the part of the illegal immigrant Rodolpho, a blond,
starry-eyed Sicilian who was already a tenor in the play: no
unalloyed blessing. ``You know what they're callin' him now?'' asks
his resentful host. ``Paper Doll they're callin' him, Canary. He's
like a weird. He comes out on the pier, one-two-three, it's a
regular free show.'' (Read ``freak''?)
</P>
<P>
   Turay's colleagues in Chicago were a good deal more supportive.
His first stab at Rodolpho's aria ``New York lights'' in rehearsal
brought a rousing ovation from the rest of the cast. ``Get used to
it,'' said the baritone Kim Josephson, who led the applause. ``He's
going to bring the house down every night.'' And he did.
</P>
<P>
   By a quirk of scheduling not uncommon at so early a stage in a
promising career, Turay's first major American encore has had to
wait until May 21, in a concert performance of Bizet's seldom-heard
``Pecheurs de Perles'' with the Washington Concert Opera. Just
added to his calendar is his San Francisco Opera debut next month,
as Don Ottavio in ``Don Giovanni.'' Then he pretty much vanishes
again, for a summer of study in Europe (punctuated by a Salzburg
Festival debut in Mozart's ``Waisenhaus'' Mass). In the fall,
important American engagements start proliferating: Mendelssohn's
``Elijah'' with the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, and
Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' at the Detroit Opera and the
Metropolitan. Then, in February, comes the coronation: the Richard
Tucker Gala in Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Turay has been getting to know firsthand the
extremes of opera-house practice, European style. His debut with
the Welsh National Opera, as Ferrando in a new ``Cosi Fan Tutte,''
exemplified the made-to-order ensemble approach: six weeks of
sometimes bewildering rehearsal, followed by more than a dozen
shows in seven cities. From there, it was off to Berlin for a
hit-and-run debut in ``Zauberfloete'' at the Deutsche Oper. Six
hours of rehearsal (not bad in the circumstances), three
performances in eight days, three casts, three conductors, dialogue
(not much) in a language Turay does not speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was scary,'' he said during a recent break back home in
New York. ``I didn't meet my Paminas until intermission. I didn't
meet the Sarastros until intermission. There were lots of
transitions I'd never rehearsed. The assistant said: `Don't worry.
You're blindfolded. The supers will whisper to you and lead you
around.' Whisper in German!
</P>
<P>
   ``During the overture, I was sitting on the stage, wrapped in my
costume with my heart racing, wondering, `Why am I here?' I think I
was having an anxiety attack. But in one way it was great. Six
weeks of rehearsal, especially of a piece you've done before, can
get boring. I'm a quick study. I'd prefer two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Turay spent his childhood at the stable his family owned and ran
in Raymond, Wis.; when his mother died, his father, an accountant,
relocated the family in Greendale. Though the younger Turay has no
doubt that music is the career he was meant to have, it is not at
all what he was bargaining for when he enrolled at the University
of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to college to play baseball,'' he disclosed with a
ghost of a smile, as quizzical as it was impish. ``I was a jock.''
A jock planning to major in business. Walking in unannounced to say
he wanted to minor in voice, he was startled to learn that even the
chorus required an audition.
</P>
<P>
   Since he had nothing prepared, the chairman of the voice faculty
suggested the notoriously unsingable ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' and
Turay complied. Next the chairman requested ``Silent Night,'' of
which Turay managed one verse before blanking on the words. The
next thing the young slugger knew, he was being offered a
scholarship to major in voice. As he saw it then, maybe musicals
would be the ticket. But his teacher Everett McCorvey introduced
him to opera and the ``whole classical experience,'' in Turay's
words, and he was on his way. Now it is his wife, Courtney Turay,
who maintains the show-biz connection. She spent last summer in
Fort Atkinson, Wis., as Magnolia in ``Show Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Turay still relies on McCorvey, who, to judge by his star
pupil's progress, has been doing an outstanding job. In 1995, at
23, Turay was named a winner of the Metropolitan Opera National
Council Auditions, the youngest ever. In the fall of 1996, he
entered the Met's young-artists program for three years of
intensive study of languages and repertory and master classes with
the likes of Bergonzi and Renata Scotto, interspersed with
carefully monitored performances at the Met and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he won the Young Concert Artists auditions, which
afforded him expert career guidance and management services,
already superseded by the heavy artillery of Columbia Artists
Management. The list of his prizes _ an ARIA, a Tucker, a George
London, a D'Angelo _ is growing unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   Young as he is in his profession, Turay is already a favorite at
the Opera Theater of St. Louis, where he made his operatic debut in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the panel of the Metropolitan national council
auditions at Butler University, in Indianapolis, in Clowes Memorial
Hall, that great big barn,'' said Charles MacKay, the company's
general director. ``This fresh-faced 21-year-old walked out to sing
the aria from the garden scene in `Faust,' and I thought, `Oh,
sure.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then out came this voice of pure gold. It was the closest
thing to Jussi Bjoerling I'd ever heard: so impeccably phrased, so
poised, such a mature account of the aria. I was dumbstruck.
Fortunately we had one role uncast: a tenor role, Clotarco, in
Haydn's `Armida.' I offered it to him then and there, and he
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the opera is obscure, Turay considered the part ideal for
the occasion, including as it does some ensembles to get you out on
the stage and an aria (just one) to get you noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Turay returned three seasons in a row, as the protagonist in
Monteverdi's ``Orfeo,'' as Ernesto in ``Don Pasquale'' and, last
summer, as Nadir in ``Les Pecheurs de Perles.'' In 1996, he was the
serenading Fenton in Verdi's ``Falstaff'' at Wolf Trap in Virginia.
To date, Turay's assignments at the Met have ranged from supporting
roles in ``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' ``The Makropulos Case,'' ``Romeo et
Juliette,'' ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and ``Moses und Aron'' to the
florid Don Ottavio. Like many singers, Turay classifies Mozart,
along with Bellini and Donizetti, as ``medicine for the voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fan of Janacek,'' he said, with the experience not only
of the Met ``Makropulos'' but also of ``The Excursions of Broucek''
at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., under his belt. ``He
writes for instruments.'' ``Moses und Aron,'' he declared with like
candor, was ``no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights of the tenor repertory are nowhere on Turay's
immediately foreseeable agenda. His concert rendition of the
throbbing verismo chestnut known as ``Il Lamento di Federico'' from
Cilea's otherwise forgotten ``Arlesiana'' once won him an ovation
that knocked the breath out of him, an experience he shows no sign
of forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not turned his head. Even the lighter roles of Verdi
and Puccini _ the Duke in ``Rigoletto,'' Alfredo in ``La Traviata''
and Rodolfo in ``La Boheme'' _ as well as Gounod's Romeo, all of
which he has been offered, will have to wait. For now, Turay plans
to stick with truly lyric repertory. Serious time abroad, with
daily practice in the foreign languages he already articulates with
more finesse than many natives, also remains a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The question is where, in the long run, the fast track will take
him. By voice and temperament, Turay is at least as suited to the
concert stage as to the opera house. In Brahms' ``Liebeslieder
Waltzes'' in James Levine's Met Chamber Ensemble series at Weill
Recital Hall a year and a half ago, his contributions as a member
of the quartet were as expressive and gracious as his natural,
deeply affectionate solos.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Brahms, Levine took Turay along for Haydn's
``Creation'' with the Boston Symphony, and once again, the young
artist proved exceptional, holding his own in a trio with the
soprano Renee Fleming and the bass Rene Pape, both at the top of
their eloquent form. As a recitalist, Turay is impressive, too; his
unobtrusive yet telling gestures lend an extra dimension to the
poetry of music and text.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry sometimes that it might look contrived,'' he said,
``but my personality is such, I can't just stand and sing.''
Frederica von Stade tells the story that at the start of her
career, as she rose on cue at Carnegie Hall, Marilyn Horne leaned
her way with a fierce stage whisper: ``Keep your face in the light.
Keep your face in the light.'' Turay seems to do so by instinct.
``You have to communicate what's in your soul,'' he says simply.
What counts in the end is the light that shines within.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strive for perfection,'' the rising star likes to say.
``Settle for excellence.'' So far, he has seldom been inclined to
settle. His own critiques are apt to be more exacting than the
critics', and also more constructive. His models are the
acknowledged pantheon: Pavarotti in his glory years (``for the
voice and the beauty of the technique''), Nicolai Gedda, Giuseppe
di Stefano, Beniamino Gigli.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Bjoerling. Presented with a Bjoerling rarity not
in his collection _ a lyric passage from a live ``Trovatore'' at
the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, ravishingly yet naturally
sculptured, complete with trill _ Turay breathed deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was that, 1939?'' he asked. ``So he was 28. There's no
sliding, and the tone has such a shimmer. There's such classiness.
I'll never sing that well.''
</P>

EDITORS DIFFER ON FOR-PROFIT RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should scientists profit from companies whose products they
research? The newly named editor-in-chief of the New England
Journal of Medicine and the outgoing editor are sharply split on
that question, one of the most hottest current issues in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, who will take over the top job at the
influential journal this summer, said Wednesday that academic
researchers should be able to own substantial stock in a company or
accept sizable consultant fees and still accept research support _
as long as their studies doesn't involve humans.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen is a member of a Harvard Medical School panel expected to
recommend next week that the school loosen its stringent
restrictions on faculty ties to industry. Harvard's current rules,
Drazen said, are ``a little too restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Dr. Marcia Angell, who will relinquish editorial control
of the New England Journal to Drazen, ``Softening its
conflict-of-interest guidelines is exactly the wrong thing for
Harvard Medical School to do'' at a time when academic institutions
generally are relaxing their rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now considerable evidence that researchers with ties
to drug companies are indeed more likely to report results that are
favorable to the products of those companies,'' Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict of interest issue is popping up with increasing
frequency. The death of an 18-year-old man in a gene therapy trial
at the University of Pennsylvania last September uncovered the fact
that Penn's head of gene therapy, Dr. James Wilson, owns a
substantial stake in Genovo Inc., a company founded to capitalize
on the university's research.
</P>
<P>
   The episode at Penn stimulated a federal review of other gene
therapy experiments, which recently put the spotlight on Boston
cardiologist Jeffrey Isner. He holds an equity interest in a
company that stands to benefit from the results of human
experiments to grow new coronary arteries that Isner is running at
St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston, also a stakeholder in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the issue is not stock ownership, companies are
increasingly pressuring academic researchers to control how
research results are presented in exchange for financial support,
insiders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies want a final say'' in how research reports are
written, said Nikki Zapol, director of corporate-sponsored research
at Massachusetts General Hospital. ``More companies are pushing for
that and more researchers are accepting.'' Up to one-half of all
industry contracts have such clauses, Zapol said, but the MGH
insists they be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal editors' difference of opinion is the
first indication how the Boston-based publication's policy may
differ under Drazen's regime. That will be closely watched, since
the New England Journal is often cited as the world's most
influential medical journal _ the one researchers vie hardest to
get into.
</P>
<P>
   Angell and her predecessors have put in place some of the
strictest conflict-of-interest standards of any medical journal,
although they have sometimes lapsed in enforcing them. But Drazen
said that the issue would not be at the top of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my number one priority,'' he said in an interview.
But he said he would not immediately change the journal's current
policies, which require authors of scientific reports to disclose
industry ties but disqualify authors of editorials and
state-of-the-art review articles if they take company money or own
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen, who has accepted consultant fees, stock, and research
support from at least nine biomedical companies, said he will give
up advisory positions and liquid assets when he takes over the New
England Journal's helm. He will continue to do some basic research,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the journal's policies, Drazen himself will be barred for
two years from writing about research involving companies from
which he accepted support or in which he owned stock.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to disclose the Harvard committee's recommendations,
which are scheduled to be presented to the medical faculty next
week. ``There are people who agree with Marcia that (current rules
are) too liberal and there are those who feel it's still too
restrictive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen said his personal opinion is that researchers should not
be barred from doing laboratory or animal research if they own
stock in or accept support from companies with an interest in the
outcome of their research. At the moment, Harvard Medical School's
6,000 full-time faculty members cannot conduct research for a
company in which they own more than $20,000 in stock or receive
more than $10,000 in fees or royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an academic I want to work with the pharmaceutical industry
to bring forward new treatments to get people better,'' Drazen
said. ``The pharmaceutical industry is a very powerful force. It's
like electricity. It's a wonderful thing, and if I use it right
it's very helpful to me. If it use it wrong, I can get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The new editor, a specialist in pulmonary medicine at Brigham
and Women's Hospital, said cases of potential conflict of interest
should be handled ``on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell warned that medical schools and teaching hospitals risk
losing support if they leave themselves ``open to the charge that
they are for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   As a striking example of how pervasive researchers' industry
entanglements have become, Angell pointed to the lead article in
this week's journal, a study on the most effective way to treat
chronic depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authors' ties with companies that make antidepressant
drugs were so extensive that it would have used too much space to
disclose them fully in the Journal,'' Angell wrote in an editorial
titled ``Is Academic Medicine for Sale?''
</P>
<P>
   The journal referred readers to its web site for full details of
the study authors' drug industry ties. The New England Journal does
not disqualify research papers if their authors take industry
funding, but they must disclose the potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Authors of editorials and review articles, which summarize the
current state of knowledge on a topic, are supposedly disqualified
if they have industry ties. However, last year Angell acknowledged
that the Journal had failed to enforce that requirement in 19 drug
review articles, including one authored by Drazen.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said it was hard to find an unencumbered expert to write
an editorial on the depression study in its current issue because
``very few. . .do not have financial ties to drug companies that
make antidepressants.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the lead author of the depression study, Dr.
Martin B. Keller of Brown University, came under fire last year for
alleged conflict of interest because he accepted more than $500,000
in 1998 from drug companies whose products he touted in medical
journals and at conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Brown University did not consider Keller's unusually large
industry payments to be a conflict of interest and did not report
his payments to federal agencies that also supported his work. The
university said federal regulations did not require any
notification.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Keller Wednesday were unsuccessful. He told
the Associated Press that industry money was necessary to do the
study, which involved 681 patients at 12 medical centers.

DECLINE IN COMPLIANCE WITH DRAFT REGISTRATION IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: all states)   by IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although there is no military draft, young men are
required by law to register for the draft at age 18, but there has
been a steady decline in compliance in recent years, the government
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just 88 percent of young men have registered, with compliance
ranging from 95 percent in New Hampshire to 73 percent in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis C. Brodsky, the draft system's director of public and
congressional affairs, said it was unknown why compliance rates
varied so widely.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that low population density might contribute to
compliance, with New Hampshire and Maine at the top of the
registration chart, but that would not account for the low showing
of other states with low population densities like Kentucky and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that large numbers of immigrants may
contribute to low registration. That holds true for California and
Texas, which have many immigrants and low compliance, but New York
and Florida, also with high immigrant populations, have higher
levels of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference called to announce the start of a campaign
to increase the registration rate, Gil Coronado, the Selective
Service director, stressed that his agency did not provide names to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The government regards registration as an insurance policy of
sorts. If war came, men could be drafted faster if they are
registered.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following are the states the agency gave an A on a report card
of draft registration compliance, with the percentage of eligible
men enrolled:
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire (95), Maine (93), North Dakota (93), Iowa (91),
Nebraska (91) and Minnesota (90).
</P>
<P>
   Those with a B:
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota (89), Vermont (89), West Virginia (89), Arkansas
(88), Indiana (88), Wyoming (88), Idaho (87), Oklahoma (87), Rhode
Island (87), Utah (87), Montana (86), New Jersey (86), Washington
(86), Kansas (85), Ohio (85), Tennessee (85), Wisconsin (85),
Alabama (84), Alaska (84), Colorado (84), Connecticut (84),
District of Columbia (84), Florida (84), Illinois (84),
Massachusetts (84), Missouri (84), Nevada (84), North Carolina
(84), Oregon (84), Virginia (84), Delaware (83), Arizona (82),
Michigan (82), New York (82), Pennsylvania (82), New Mexico (81)
and Maryland (80).
</P>
<P>
   Those with a C:
</P>
<P>
   California (79), Georgia (79), Kentucky (79), Mississippi (79),
South Carolina (79), Texas (77), Louisiana (74) and Hawaii (73).
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bachman, a social psychologist at the Institute for Social
Research at the University of Michigan, who has studied the draft,
said in an interview: ``The idea that it is going down doesn't
surprise me much. It's been going down for a long time. The idea of
registering for the draft, I suppose, is lost on them with
increased distance from the actual use of the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The last draftee was inducted in 1973 and the highest level of
registration since then was 97.7 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado said criminal penalties for not registering were rarely
imposed, the last case being prosecuted in 1985. Men who did not
register would be ineligible for many federal benefits, including
student loans, job training and government jobs, and immigrants
could not become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado said failure to register was probably caused by a
growing lack of awareness of the requirement and that it meant that
there was a risk of ``inadvertently creating a permanent underclass
of men.''

 &HT;    Waffle House motion to move racial bias case denied by judge
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A U.S. District Court judge has denied a motion by
Norcross, Ga. -based Waffle House Inc. to move a racial
discrimination case to South Carolina from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the 24-hour restaurant chain argued that plaintiff
Jesse E. Gantt Jr. lives in South Carolina and that many of the key
witnesses live there and outside the area served by the court in
the Northern District of Georgia. Additionally, the company lawyers
argued that the case should be moved to South Carolina because the
alleged discrimination occurred there.
</P>
<P>
   In denying the request, Judge Willis B. Hunt Jr. said that
regardless of where Gantt lives, he ``clearly maintains at least
some significant ties to this district.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt cited the number of witnesses who work at the company's
Norcross office and documents housed there that might be relevant
to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Gantt claims he was fired for refusing to comply with a
directive from his supervisors to change the racial makeup of his
restaurant staff by firing black employees and replacing them with
whites. ``There are two sides to every story,'' said Waffle House
spokesman Chris Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the evidence presented will speak for itself and
will not support Mr. Gantt's allegations.''

REBEL LEADER'S CAPTURE RAISES HOPE FOR END TO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER AND JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The leader of Sierra Leone's brutal rebel faction
was captured and paraded naked through the capital Wednesday by
raucous mobs hoping his capture would signal a swift end to a
violent insurgency that has shaken the West African nation the past
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, whose forces have killed and maimed thousands of
civilians since 1991, was captured nine days after he disappeared
during a gunfight that killed 19 people outside his Freetown home.
He was reportedly whisked off by British troops to an undisclosed
location, but UN officials said Wednesday they believed he was in
the custody of the national police.
</P>
<P>
   Violence surged in war-battered Sierra Leone when the rebel
Revolutionary United Front killed several UN peacekeepers and took
500 hostage after a dispute over disarmament. More than half remain
in rebel custody. Western diplomats feared their capture, a
violation of peace accord signed last July, would frustrate UN
peace efforts in other African conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials welcomed the news of Sankoh's arrest.
``It is a positive development that he is located and that he can
be dealt with appropriately,'' said Richard Holbrooke, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, ``and that he will not be able to
continue his outrageous agreement-breaking ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so sure that Sankoh's seizure would defuse the
crisis. Although the rebels released another 80 peacekeepers late
Wednesday, UN and regional officials worried that Sankoh's troops
might use the remaining 280 hostages as leverage to secure his
release. The last time Sankoh was arrested, in June 1997, his
troops launched a rebellion that ended in a bloody siege on the
capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes it more difficult _ his arrest now, coupled
with the continuing attack by the Sierra Leone army'' _ to secure
the release of the remaining hostages, said Reginald Goodridge,
spokesman for Liberian President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a close ally of Sankoh's, has been asked by the West
African states to take the lead in getting the detainees released.
On Sunday he won the freedom of 139 of the UN hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Like Angola's Jonas Savimbi, who returned to the bush rather
than play the junior member in a coalition government after decades
of civil war, Sankoh belongs to a class of guerrilla leaders who
have spent their lives chasing power and find political
accommodation an ill-fitting suit. He spent seven years in prison
in the 1970s for plotting a coup. In the early 1990s he launched a
brutal campaign to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was convicted of treason and sentenced to death in 1998,
but escaped execution after his forces rolled into Freetown. Peace
talks followed last July, brokered by the United States and other
Western governments. As a result, the rebel leader was granted
amnesty, named vice president _ an office he still holds _ and
granted control over Sierra Leone's prolific diamond region.
</P>
<P>
   Part Maoist, part Christian fundamentalist, Sankoh orchestrated
shocking atrocities. He slit his soldiers' skin and rubbed cocaine
into the wounds make them high, and then sent them not just to kill
government soldiers, but also to torture and mutilate civilians.
Many of his troops were children.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the current crisis, in which rebels have clashed
with government and British soldiers, the government offered $5,000
bounty, big money in one of the world's poorest countries, for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said it was the government's
responsibility to decide what to do with Sankoh, but Human Rights
Watch urged the UN to play an active role in his prosecution. It
said Sierra Leone's justice system was incapable of trying the
rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   The rekindled crisis in Sierra Leone posed a crucial test for
the UN at a fragile time in the international body's engagement
with Africa. After failing to halt Somalia's slide into ethnic
anarchy in 1993 and Rwanda's genocide in 1994, UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan said two years ago that ``never again should the
international community tolerate such suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, Britain, and other Western governments
refused to stop the carnage in Freetown a year ago, and London only
deployed troops to its former colony in response to the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US drew a line around Sierra Leone and said this one is
not us,'' said Roger Berry, a former congressional aide
specializing in African affairs. ``It is a confusing set of issues,
a localized power struggle with an ethnic base and unpredictable
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sankoh's arrest defuses the crisis in Sierra Leone, analysts
said, it could also restore support for the UN's pending observer
mission another African conflict: the multinational war in Congo.
The UN is due to deploy 5,537 monitors and protection forces to
oversee compliance with an often-violated cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials have previously acknowledged that the organization
may not be adequately prepared for the task in Congo, where as many
as 21 sovereign and guerrilla forces are entangled in overlapping
conflicts.

   ETHIOPIA-ERITREA (Tokombia, Eritrea) _ Ethiopia's drive into
Eritrea intensified Wednesday as dozens of tanks and thousands of
troops streamed north to join a battle for control of the area
around the strategic town of Barentu. For the two years of the war,
the fighting has been confined largely to a sophisticated network
of trenches along the nations' border. But five days after Ethiopia
mounted an offensive, the trenches are empty and the war has
shifted firmly into Eritrean territory. Barentu is about 40 miles
from the Ethiopian border, and about 18 miles from this market
village to the south. By Ian Fisher. (525 words)

   TAIWAN-VICE-PRESIDENT (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Annette Lu says Taiwan

ought to invite the leaders of Taiwan and China to hash out their

two Chinas _ a proposition that outrages Beijing and sends most
officials here into semantic contortions _ she does not miss a

   AIDS-DRUGS-PRICES (Paris) _ Brazil caught world health
authorities by surprise Wednesday by asking them to set up a
database of prices of all anti-AIDS drugs, a move that would allow
poor countries to shop for the best deal worldwide. The proposal
has upset the world's large pharmaceutical companies because the
database would have to include drugs made in countries like Brazil,
India and Thailand, whose laws disregard many drug patents.

CBS FALL SCHEDULE: `CHICAGO HOPE' IS OUT, BETTE IS IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was CBS's turn Wednesday to unveil a new prime-time lineup
for next fall, and the network whose viewers tend to be older than
any other's offered up little in the way of new and different. More
like tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   CBS will debut seven series in the fall _ four dramas and three
comedies, including one starring Bette Midler. Its most inventive
show of last season, ``Now and Again,'' got the ax, along with the
long-running medical drama ``Chicago Hope'' and the comedy
``Cosby'' (which was done with Bill Cosby's blessing).
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of concerns about the casting of minority actors, CBS
renewed ``City of Angels,'' the Steven Bochco-produced medical
drama featuring a predominantly black cast, even though its ratings
(No. 81 for the season) were weaker than those for ``Chicago Hope''
(No. 68).
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' may be helped by its move to 9 p.m. Thursday
(from 8 p.m. Wednesday). Three other long-running series also will
air in new time periods: ``48 Hours'' at 8 p.m. Thursday;
``Diagnosis Murder'' at 10 p.m. Thursday, and ``Walker: Texas
Ranger'' at 9 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of CBS's new fall shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Bette Show. Midler plays a diva with a college-prof husband
(Kevin Dunn), a 13-year-old daughter (Lindsay Lohan) and a best
friend (Joanna Gleason).
</P>
<P>
   C.S.I. Marg Helgenberger (``China Beach'') and William Peterson
(``To Live and Die in L.A.'') do the ``Quincy'' thing, playing
forensic investigators in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The District. Craig T. Nelson (``Coach'') plays Jack Mannion, a
noted crime fighter who is named police commissioner of Washington,
D.C., and sets up a corps of modern-day ``Untouchables'' bent on
keeping the criminal element at bay. Also starring Jayne Brook,
Lynne Thigpen, Roger Aaron Brown and Justin Theroux.
</P>
<P>
   The Fugitive. Tim Daly and Mykelti Williamson revive the 1960s
action series, with Daly as Dr. Richard Kimble and Williamson as
his relentless pursuer, Lt. Gerard.
</P>
<P>
   That's Life. Heather Paige Kent plays ``a thirtyish New Jersey
girl'' who dumps the guy she's engaged to and decides to go back to
college. Also starring Debi Mazar, Kristin Bauer, Kevin Dillon and
Ellen Burstyn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to New York. A TV weatherman (Jim Gaffigan) moves from
Indiana to the Big Apple, and it turns out predicting storms is the
least of his concerns. Christine Baranski (``Cybill'') plays his
supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dear. Two young couples have vastly different views of
parenting. Starring Jean Louisa Kelly, Anthony Clark, Liza Snyder
and Mike O'Malley.

CHINA TRADE VOTE A TEST OF HIGH-TECH LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (Eds: See also CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TRADE-CLINTON) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next week's congressional vote on whether to expand
trade and economic ties with Beijing has high stakes for China and
the Clinton administration, but it is also a test of the political
clout of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, technology companies are playing a leading
role in Washington lobbying over a geopolitical issue. For several
months, executives from Silicon Valley and other technology-rich
areas have been combing the halls of Congress, lobbying for what
they say will be billions of dollars of expanded exports to China
as well as new jobs for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations is going
to be ``the most important vote of this decade,'' said David
McCurdy, a former Democratic congressman who is the president of
Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade association. ``The industry
will support people who support high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen chief executives made the rounds again on
Wednesday. And a few companies have gone a step further: They have
run radio and television advertisements and conducted grass-roots
campaigns, nudging thousands of their employees to write letters
and send electronic messages to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are relative novices in the political arena,
technology concerns are using big business and organized labor as
models for how to press undecided members of Congress to vote for
the China bill. Their deep involvement is in stark contrast to the
detachment they showed three years ago, during the debate on
granting the United States greater trading power.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, high-tech companies lobbied most visibly on narrower
issues, including Internet privacy, data scrambling and
immigration. Microsoft has become a player in Washington's arena of
money and politics, but mostly to protect its interests in the
antitrust battle. In the past, few high-tech companies had large
lobbying presences in the capital. This time around, the industry
has unleashed scores of lobbyists and has banded together in
powerful coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their trade associations are employing the
kind of hardball tactics, including advertising, that have served
other industries well in other lobbying wars, working closely with
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the agriculture sector and companies
like Boeing, all experienced in past fights involving trade with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, welcomed
the help from high-tech companies. ``They've thrown themselves into
this battle in a strong and aggressive way, and I think they are
picking up the game very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an
umbrella group of 300 companies from diverse sectors, said the
China issue has led to ``a massive energizing of the technology
field.'' Their effort, he said, has been especially helpful in the
campaign to sway Democrats, a party with close ties to labor.
</P>
<P>
   These new lobbyists have been effective, lawmakers and others
say. By emphasizing the power of the Internet, lobbyists have been
selling a message that goes beyond their bottom line, stressing
that the products they would export would spread democracy in
China.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike organized labor and big corporations, technology
companies have no firm loyalties and are considered up-for-grabs by
both parties. Their popularity on Capitol Hill has translated into
easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lobbying of high-tech executives pales next to
organized labor's whirlwind approach and its grass-roots army. And
they lag behind their more experienced big business allies. ``They
are catching up,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a technology
booster. ``But anyone juxtaposed to the organization that labor has
put together, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said many of the technology
companies in his district are still not politically engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have a way to go,'' said Meehan, who is undecided on
the bill, referring to the technology industry. ``Labor certainly
knows how to do it more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. has dispatched its chairman, Andy Grove, and Craig
R. Barrett, chief executive, to Capitol Hill. The company has also
run radio and newspaper ads and set up a grass-roots campaign
through the company Web site. Within 48 hours, 5,000 of its
employees sent letters to their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has also plunged money into the battle, running
television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., who is facing a tough re-election
battle, has a host of high-tech companies in his district and has
been courted by the industry, in part because he is a scientist. He
spent one evening taking a technology tour of a New Jersey plant,
where he met with executives from Sony, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Holt remains unconvinced that more trade with China is the
cure-all proponents make it out to be. ``It's as if trade is the
most important thing,'' Holt said. ``And I don't think Americans
necessarily think so.''  &QL;

CMGI'S WETHERELL LOVES LYCOS DEAL, EVEN IF WALL STREET DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Initial investor giddiness over the planned $12.5 billion
takeover of Waltham-based Web portal Lycos Inc. by Spain's leading
phone company gave way to a punishing selloff on Wall Street
Wednesday, with Lycos shares plunging over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the stock-swap deal was announced, Wall Street
betrayed concerns about the risks of owning a foreign stock and
fears that shares of acquirer Terra S.A. may be wildly overvalued.
Lycos sunk by just over $15 a share to $57.609 in Nasdaq trading.
Some 32.8 million Lycos shares changed hands, making it the second
most heavily traded US stock Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But CMGI Inc., an Internet venture capital company in Andover,
Mass. that has seen the $3.8 million it invested in Lycos beginning
in 1995 swell on paper to over $700 million, indicated support for
the deal. CMGI's Lycos stake would be worth nearly $1.2 billion if
the deal goes through at its announced price.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, CMGI and its chairman, David Wetherell, helped
torpedo a planned takeover of Lycos by home shopping concern USA
Networks, charging that the proposed $17 billion combination
undervalued Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Wetherell ``thought it was a very well
architected deal (with Terra), and he has voiced his broad support
for it,'' Wetherell's spokeswoman, Deidre Moore, said Wednesday.
``His general feeling on the deal was it was very positive for both
parties, but he did not say how he was going to vote his shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said CMGI owns just under 12 million shares of Lycos, down
from a reported 16 million last October, and has invested $3.8
million since June 1995. As of Wednesday evening, that stake was
worth about $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is the fourth most popular portal site for Web surfing,
with over 32 million individual visitors in March. By most
accounts, it is the best known Internet company in Massachusetts,
employing more than 600 people at its Waltham headquarters and
Williamstown subsidiaries that are being moved to Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Its planned combination with Terra, a majority-owned unit of
Spanish-based telephone giant Telefonica SA, would create a global
Internet company with over $2 billion in cash and access to the
huge book, music and film content of Bertelesmann AG, Lycos's
German-based Web partner.
</P>
<P>
   Terra Lycos Inc. would have a presence in 37 countries, an
expected 50 million daily visitors and yearly revenues of over $500
million. But analysts noted the combination would be far from
dominant on any continent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's fear Wednesday appeared to be that the Terra stock
Lycos owners would get may plunge in value by the time the deal
closes this fall. That uncertainty lowers the value of owning Lycos
stock now.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was valued initially to give Lycos owners stock in
Terra worth $97.55 per share of Lycos stock, subject to a so-called
collar, capping the maximum Terra stock to be swapped at 2.15
shares for each Lycos share.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that by fall, when the deal is scheduled to close, 2.15
shares of Terra could be worth well under the $97.55 fueled the
Lycos selloff, investors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get shares instead of cash, you have to have a
discount because of that,'' said Brian Grove, a principal with
Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough McCullough LP of Houston, which owns
55,000 Lycos shares.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wallace, a UBS Warburg LLC analyst who cut Lycos from a
buy to a hold rating, said, ``You have people who don't want to own
foreign equities, who won't stick around for the deal.'' Wallace
added that Warburg is advising Lycos owners ``to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch also downgraded its rating on Terra shares, with
analyst Peter Bradshaw stating that ``we expect the premium paid
for Lycos way outweighs the synergies gained'' by combining the
companies. Terra's bid values Lycos at over twice what Lycos was
trading at before takeover talk surfaced last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid trading Wednesday, Terra shares fell 6.2 euros to
55.80, down 60 percent from its record close on Feb. 25. Terra's
US-traded shares fell $6.5625 to $47.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety over Terra's value comes amid an ongoing Internet
meltdown. The Bloomberg index of 300 Internet companies has plunged
45 percent since its record high on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lycos reported better-than-expected profits for its
most recent fiscal quarter, with revenues up 120 percent and
adjusted profits up to $7.9 million from a $1 million loss a year
ago. The 7 cents a share in earnings beat a Wall Street consensus
projection for Lycos of 5 cents, according to First Call/Thomson.

MANAGING EDITOR OF REAL SIMPLE, WOMEN'S MAGAZINE FROM TIME INC.,
QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a management shake-up that shows that even the
most promising publishing team does not always guarantee a smooth
start-up, the managing editor of Real Simple _ a new magazine from
Time Inc. for women who want to simplify their lives _ resigned
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the editor, Susan Wyland, comes after only two
issues of the magazine, both of which have been criticized by some
advertisers as overly spare and unwelcoming. Wyland, a former
editor of Martha Stewart Living, was encouraged to leave by a group
of senior Time Inc. executives headed by Ann S. Moore, the
president of the People division of Time Inc., said Time Inc.
executives. The People group publishes People, People en Espanol,
Teen People and In Style.
</P>
<P>
   Wyland was considered especially ardent as an editor, in part
because she had first brought the idea to Time Inc. Clearly, there
was tension. At one point before publication of the first issue,
she and the magazine's publisher, Alexander Sareyan, were not even
on speaking terms, the executives said. Wyland declined to comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Tuhy, an assistant managing editor at In Style magazine,
will take over as managing editor; it has not yet been decided if
Tuhy will remain on the job permanently. Isolde Motley, the former
managing editor of Life magazine who was named corporate editor of
Time Inc. last week, will oversee the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel issues aside, the failure of the magazine to become an
instant critical hit may reveal more about the success of the
People division than about Real Simple. The last two new magazines
out of the division, In Style and Teen People, have raised
expectations for the division. In Style, which was introduced in
1994, has a circulation of 1.4 million, according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations; Teen People, introduced in 1998, has a
circulation of 1.6 million, and People en Espanol, introduced in
1996, has a circulation of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Inc. executives said that advertisers were shying away
from committing to the fall issues of the magazine because the
magazine lacked warmth and was too self-consciously plain to
attract readers.

PUTIN APPOINTMENTS TOE THE POWER LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Parliament overwhelmingly approved Vladimir V. Putin's
choices Wednesday for prime minister and prosecutor, handing the
newly inaugurated president a political victory less than two weeks
into his term.
</P>
<P>
   But observers said Mikhail Kasyanov, the new prime minister, and
Vladimir Ustinov, who was confirmed as federal prosecutor, have
close ties to a group of powerful tycoons who have for years
wielded strong influence on Kremlin policy. This, the observers
said, raises serious doubts about Putin's ability to deliver on his
campaign promises to stamp out corruption and pursue economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   By a 325-55 vote, the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's
parliament, confirmed Kasyanov as Russia's seventh prime minister
in eight years. Kasyanov's quick approval contrasted sharply with
the drawn-out confirmation fights that marked former president
Boris Yeltsin's relations with the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov, 42, urged the lowering of taxes to reinvigorate the
economy, and said the state must sell off its poorly performing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot ease the pace of reforms, or else we will end up
standing in one place and eventually get mired,'' he said.
``Reforms must be energetic, consistent and balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov, a former finance minister, met later with Putin,
reportedly to discuss Cabinet appointments, which are expected to
be announced in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Since Putin's appointment as acting president in January,
Kasyanov has run the Cabinet's daily affairs. Putin named Kasyanov
acting prime minister after his inauguration as elected president
on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Kasyanov had been Russia's chief foreign debt
negotiator and won a reputation as a tough defender of Russia's
interests. After Russia's financial crisis in August 1998, it was
Kasyanov who told foreign investors that Moscow would not repay
billions of dollars in frozen debt. Earlier this year, he clinched
a deal with creditor nations partially to write off Russia's
Soviet-era debt.
</P>
<P>
   Western investors have praised Kasyanov, who speaks fluent
English, as an intelligent and capable economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is smart, competent and understands Western economics. He
knows how to speak the language of foreign investors,'' said Roland
Nash, chief economist for Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasyanov is also widely believed to have close ties to
oil-and-media tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a politically connected
businessman who wielded enormous influence in Yeltsin's Kremlin.
When companies linked to Berezovsky seized most of Russia's
aluminum industry earlier this year in a deal many here said
violated anti-monopoly laws, Kasyanov defended the move.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov has repeatedly denied close links to Berezovsky. ``I
know a lot of businessmen and well-known entrepreneurs. But I don't
have any concrete ties to any particular financial-industrial
group,'' he said at a news conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts say that Berezovsky and a group of
moguls, known as ``The Family,'' are fighting to establish similar
sway over Putin's administration, and appear to be succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ustinov, another Berezovsky ally, was approved
Wednesday as Russia's top federal prosecutor. As an acting
prosecutor, Ustinov has halted several corruption investigations
initiated by his predecessors against Berezovsky and other Kremlin
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Ustinov's nomination was a surprise to much of Russia's
political establishment. On Tuesday, Moscow was awash with rumors
that Putin would nominate Dmitry Kozak, an attorney from St.
Petersburg and a longtime protege of the president's.
</P>
<P>
   ``All recent appointments point to the fact that the Family is
still very influential and Putin has to play by their rules,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, a Moscow-based political analyst with the Heritage
Foundation.

TREASURY PRICES EASE AS IMPLICATIONS OF RATE HIKE ARE FELT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell Wednesday as the
full scope of the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate
increase and hawkish statement on inflation risks began to sink in
for many investors.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/32, to 100
31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, increased to 6.18 percent from 6.10 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 100 4/32. Its
yield rose to 6.48 percent from 6.42 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trading session, the expected announcement of a
government buyback of up to $2 billion in old bonds Thursday failed
to lift the prices of securities as investors fixated on a tighter
credit environment and the prospect of higher rates to come. The
Federal Open Market Committee's raising of short-term rates had
been fully anticipated by the financial markets, despite the benign
Consumer Price Index report for April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase
Asset Management, ``torrid economic growth in the midst of an
incredibly tight labor market provides the ideal breeding ground
for a pickup in inflation, and with evidence of rising prices and
wages beginning to mount, the Fed clearly felt that a stepped up
pre-emptive strike was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the risks are still weighted toward heightened
inflation pressures in the near future, Fine said that the Fed
stated in stronger-than-usual fashion that increases in demand had
remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven
gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on
resources. The concern is, he said, that this disparity will
continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would
undermine the economy's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, said down the
road, ``Fed uncertainty over how soon consumer spending might slow
might cause the Fed to return to smaller rate hikes at the
remaining FOMC meetings this summer _ June 28 and August 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will, of course, depend on incoming data,'' Cooper said,
adding that the following meeting on Oct. 3 will be seen as too
close to the election to interfere in the marketplace. The Fed will
make an effort to get all of the rate increases out of the way
before then, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Treasury announced that it was selling $10
billion of two-year notes next Wednesday to pay down $15.94 billion
on the federal debt. In when-issued trading ahead of auction the
note was offered at a price to yield 6.87 percent.

FABLED BEACH BECOMES ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLEGROUND
</HEADLINE>
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-TROPEZ, France _ Even on a cold, rainy spring day, the
tourists find their way to the beach that made this resort so
famous. Some of the restaurants perched on the dunes are full,
their tables set below canvas roofs that flap in the blustery
winds. Bleached-blond hunks hustle to park the Jaguar, Mercedes and
Porsche convertibles that roll in.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the familiar scenes of this major French tourist
attraction, a fierce battle is going on for control of Pamplona
beach, which introduced Europe to topless sunbathing in the 1950s
and where Roger Vadim set ``And God Created Woman,'' starring
Brigitte Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy quilt of beach restaurants and loud clubs that sprang
up illegally decades ago and that, some say, give St.-Tropez its
aura of wild mischief and endless partying may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, fed up with what they see as greed so out of
hand that beach strollers are forced to walk in the surf, have gone
to court to clean things up.
</P>
<P>
   They have so far won two rulings proclaiming that Pamplona _
which on a sunny day in July is a writhing sea of greased bodies _
is a ``remarkable natural preserve.'' If the designation sticks,
virtually all construction here will become illegal. A ruling on a
final appeal is expected in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even local officials who want some decorum returned to the beach
do not want things to go that far. Pamplona, which officially
belongs to St.-Tropez's inland neighbor, the village of Ramatuelle,
produces much of the village's budget, provides 5,000 jobs and
draws thousands of tourists to the area each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Quivy, a spokesman for Ramatuelle, said the local councils
would fight the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say to 30,000 visitors a year, `This goes back to
nature?' '' Quivy asked. `` `No toilets. No parking. No food.' The
case is deeply troubling. The environmentalists went too far. ''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant and club owners are equally unhappy. Removing
them from the beach, said one restaurant owner, Patrice de Colmont,
would do no less than destroy ``the image of France.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that sounds pretentious,'' said de Colmont, the owner
of Le Club 55. ``But St.-Tropez is a part of the French image.
St.-Tropez is life _ men and women and all the weaknesses that make
life. It is a strong symbol and one of youth and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36 businesses on the 3-mile stretch of fine white sand run
the gamut from a thatched Vietnamese restaurant to de Colmont's
sprawling yacht-club style dining room to the raucous and
outrageous La Voile Rouge, owned by a former beach attendant, Paul
Tomasselli, who readily admits he is dedicated to ``having fun,
doing what you please.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone involved in the tug of war over the beach agrees
that the free-spirit feeling so long associated with Pamplona beach
should be preserved. Valerie Tronche, leader of the environmental
federation that filed suit, acknowledges there is something magic
about the activity there. She does not want it completely
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   But, she argues, the merchants have never been reigned in. ``A
few bamboo cabins have gotten bigger and bigger,'' she said, ``and
they have sold off to each other, making a fortune. There has been
an anarchy that the local officials have closed their eyes to. No
one asked whether it was legal or not because they were making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   When, in the early 1990s, the village started drawing up plans
with the merchants for even bigger beach projects perched on
concrete platforms along the beach, the environmentalists sprang
into action. Under laws that govern the use of the French
coastline, they challenged the construction of anything permanent
on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent ruling in their favor, by a Marseille court last
December, was immediately appealed. Ramatuelle has continued
leasing out lots on Pamplona, and business has been pretty much as
usual. This year, however, an effort by Ramateulle to do some
self-policing and to close down La Voile Rouge drew the attention
of the director of a federal department that oversees the region,
Daniel Canepa.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that he was annulling all the local annual
contracts for beachfront establishments, saying they were illegal.
But even this has not stopped beach operators from opening.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding not to renew its contract with La Voile Rouge,
Ramateulle called it a nuisance to the community. The possible
demise of this 32-year-old hangout has made headlines all over
France.
</P>
<P>
   The club brings in celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Prince
Albert of Monaco and Michael Douglas. But its noisy improvised
shows, which have included slathering topless women with food and
having a famous customer take over the mike, are not always deemed
in good taste. Quivy said that the village had been flooded with
complaints about noise and that it had concerns about many other
allegations, including drug use and a cash-only policy that many
find suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Tomasselli seems a bit subdued. His lawyer has told
reporters that ``removing restaurants from Pamplona would be like
banning waltzes in Vienna or beer in Munich.'' Tomasselli says the
town wants him out so that a casino soon to be built can get a
piece of the beach. That theory is getting a lot of ink here,
though Quivy says there is no truth to it.
</P>
<P>
   Southern France has such a history of corrupt officials and
quirky deals that no one has much trouble believing there is more
than meets the eye on any municipal decision.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Tomasselli hopes to have Ramatuelle's decision put
aside by the courts so he can join in fighting the environmental
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Canepa wants all parties to negotiate a compromise. With
millions of dollars at stake, he believes that returning the beach
to the wild would be foolish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, the beach restaurants have branched
out aggressively and leave battered buildings and other unsightly
debris around during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he said, the environmentalists will be satisfied if the
restaurants back away from the sea a bit and promise to put up only
temporary structures that can be taken off the beach at season's
end, leaving it ``natural'' in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to find a solution that is lawful,'' Canepa said,
``but takes into account the reality of the thing.''

KRAFT FOODS EXECUTIVE NAMED HEAD OF MATTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Invading the world of Jell-O and Miracle Whip to revive its
battered toy business, Mattel Inc. announced Wednesday that it had
named Robert A. Eckert, the chief executive of Kraft Foods, as its
new chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert, 45, replaces Jill E. Barad, who resigned in February
after failing to turn around a troubled software company that
Mattel bought for $3.8 billion a year ago. Losses from the software
company, the Learning Co., were $183 million in the fourth quarter
of last year and erased earnings for Mattel, which makes toys under
the Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price brand names. As Barad
stepped down, the company, based in El Segundo, Calif., reported a
loss of $82 million, or 21 cents a share, for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barad's repeated promises of improvement for the Learning Co.
hurt Mattel's credibility with investors. The stock price has lost
nearly three-quarters of its value over the last two years, trading
at $11 a share in recent weeks, compared with a high of $45.625 in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street applauded the choice of Eckert, under whose watch
Kraft has grown faster than the rest of the food industry, which
has been in the doldrums. Investors sent Mattel's share price up
$1.50, to $12.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mandate from the board is to build value for the
shareholder,'' Eckert said Wednesday in a telephone interview,
adding that he plans to do that by cutting costs, building brands
and developing managers. ``I learned how to do that at Philip
Morris and Kraft,'' he said, ``and it is challenging to do those
three things simultaneously. But when we do that, the company will
be back on track with the investment community.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert said a close look at Mattel's profit margins and
operating expenses showed room for improvement. ``We will take a
hard look at manufacturing costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he left Kraft for Mattel to run what he called ``one of
the greatest consumer brand names in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the parent company of Kraft, said Eckert, who had
been at Kraft for 23 years, would be replaced by Betsy D. Holden,
44, the executive vice president of Kraft Foods. Both she and
Eckert rose through the ranks at Kraft, with stints in the cheese
division and other packaged-food divisions. A Philip Morris
spokesman, Christopher Kircher, said the company wished Eckert
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing your CEO is not a positive,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ``But this is a company that I think has
pretty deep management and, more importantly, doesn't change
strategy. It's not a stand-alone company without any oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris is widely considered to be among the companies
interested in acquiring Nabisco Group Holdings, which owns 80.4
percent of Nabisco Holdings, the maker of Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins
and other food products. Combining the two companies would create a
monolith with unprecedented power in the marketplace, which many
food manufacturers say is essential to working with supermarket
chains, which have gone through their own wave of consolidation
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   While many executives have announced plans to depart Mattel in
recent months, including Pleasant Rowland, the founder of the
``American Girl'' doll line that Mattel bought in 1998, Eckert said
he was pleased with the management team he would be inheriting.
``They are doing a wonderful job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his management style was, Eckert said: ``I try to be
just another person.'' His decision to leave Kraft, he said, came
because ``it was a time in my life and my career to make a change,
and this came along.'' The prospect of further consolidation in the
food business did not affect his decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after meeting informally with Mattel employees, he
made it his business to quickly read his way through the Harry
Potter books, a highly successful series by J.K. Rowling that sold
licensing rights for toys to Mattel earlier this year. Hasbro,
Mattel's chief competitor, got the rights for trading cards and
other novelties.

CHINA TRADE BILL PASSES TWO MAJOR HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two powerful congressional committees voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to back landmark legislation on trade with
China, giving President Clinton momentum before the sharply divided
House takes up the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important vote that will be cast in this
Congress, and perhaps, in this generation,'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, said
before the panel voted 34-4 in favor of the legislation. The Senate
Finance Committee approved the bill, 19-1.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the package, which would grant permanent normal
trading relations with China, would be a major legislative victory
for Clinton, who has been unable to get much of his legislative
agenda approved by a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   A win on China _ following the 1993 passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement and Thursday's signing of a law
expanding trade ties with Africa and the Caribbean _ would give
Clinton a solid legacy on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the China measure defines the ``New Democrat''
principles Clinton has been pushing during his nearly eight years
in office. And as in the battle over NAFTA, which dropped US trade
barriers with Canada and Mexico, victory in the China trade bill
will require the cooperation of a large block of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Critical of China's poor human rights record, Clinton had argued
for a tough-on-China stance when he campaigned against President
George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But after he was elected president, Clinton altered his
position, contending that the globalization of the economy made it
impossible not to trade freely with China, a growing Asian economic
power with 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Further, engaging China is more likely to encourage democratic
change there than isolating it would, Clinton insists.
</P>
<P>
   The view is at odds with two longtime Democratic Party
constituencies, organized labor and human rights activists. John J.
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, was lobbying relentlessly on
Capitol Hill Wednesday, pleading with members of Congress to vote
no.
</P>
<P>
   Labor union leaders warn that opening markets further with China
would depress the American job market, since US businesses would be
tempted to hire low-wage workers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   US employers ``are going to lay off people because the jobs will
be picked up in China for 13 cents an hour,'' said Representative
Gerald D. Kleczka, Democrat of Wisconsin, unsuccessfully appealing
to his colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to defeat the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, we cannot compete with that,'' added Kleczka, who
represents industrial Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, joined by many Democrats, said the United
States had nothing to lose by granting permanent normal trade
status with China. The bill would end the yearly review of China's
access to US markets, and give Chinese products the same tariff
treatment given to nearly all US trading partners. It would also
ease China's accession into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that freezing out the Asian power would only
deny American firms trading opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Denying China permanent normal trading relations ``would make
for chaos _ perhaps cataclysm _ in our relations,'' said
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigam. ``It is
playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders also agreed Wednesday to
establish a commission that would monitor human rights in China, as
well as strengthen safeguards against surges in imports that could
hurt the US market. Human rights activists complain that the
commission is meaningless, since the US State Department already
does a comprehensive human rights report on China every year.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the commission, however, would give
political cover to some undecided members so they could vote for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   With a House vote scheduled for next week, Clinton is still more
than 40 votes short of the 218 needed for passage. But the
president, who has been personally involved in the White House's
aggressive lobbying effort, appears to be gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that the president is probably feeling pretty
confident, given the numbers today,'' said Representative Richard
E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetets, who was officially undecided
until he cast his ``yea'' vote Wednesday in the Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation still remains fluid, but we do beleive we will
be successful next week,'' US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is gathering an unlikely set of supporters who could
well push it through the House. Previously undecided,
Representative Jose Serrano, Democrat of New York and a longtime
advocate of organized labor, said in an interview Wednesday that he
will vote for the package.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of some other Democrats, Serrano said he
thought his vote would give him more ammunition in his fight to
loosen trade restrictions with Cuba, where human rights violations
have been used to justify the US trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Other undecided Democrats are likely to vote for the bill
because they want to help the president score a legacy-building
victory in his waning months in office, Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Also notable is the absence of a Republican movement to deny
Clinton a victory for its own sake. The president was embarrassed
last year, for example, when the Senate refused to approve a ban on
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the issue of trade with China, pro-business Republicans
are jumping on board with their New Democratic foes. Partisan
politics have not even entered the debate, unusual in this
post-impeachment Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those marvelous moments when we are working
together, hand in hand, for something that is positive for the
world,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   And while that may not represent a permanent rapprochement
between Capitol Hill and the White House, the Republicans are
softening a bit in the last months of the Clinton era, said Neal.
``It's the seven-years, six-months factor that is driving the
psychology of their position,'' he said.

 &HT;    Exhibit showcases Lauder perfume compacts
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The English wag who said ``good things come in small packages''
must have had solid perfume compacts in mind.
</P>
<P>
   These little works of art, which hold concentrated perfume oil
in a wax base, have been made for years by well-known cosmetic and
fashion design houses, including Avon, Revlon, Max Factor, Donna
Karan and St. John.
</P>
<P>
   But the present-day leader, hands down, is Estee Lauder. Since
1968, the cosmetic company has produced 400 of these whimsical
treasures _ filled with such classic Lauder fragrances as
Youth-Dew, Pleasures, Cinnabar, White Linen, Beautiful, Dazzling
Gold and Dazzling Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The first Lauder perfume compact was a golden rope nugget with
faux turquoise and filled with Youth-Dew. Over the years, these
compacts _ hand-crafted by a team of jewelry makers _ have ranged
from traditional cameos to sparkling cats and dogs set with
Austrian crystals to a juicy-looking peach and jewel-encrusted peas
in a pod.
</P>
<P>
   To show the creativity of the designs, the Lauder company has
assembled a traveling exhibit of about 100 of its perfume compacts.
It spans three decades and includes rare pieces from Estee Lauder's
personal collection. You can view the free exhibit through June 5
at Neiman Marcus Lenox Square in Atlanta. ``My mother-in-law
strongly believed that every woman should carry a beautiful compact
in her purse,'' said Evelyn Lauder, senior corporate vice president
of the company during a phone interview. ``She got the idea to put
solid perfume in compacts after learning the Egyptians encased
fragrances in wax as a way of preserving them. `Why don't we do the
same thing?' she asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company releases about 50 designs each year, usually
in October for Christmas giving. All are limited editions. This
means, they are available for one year or until the supply runs
out, then the molds are retired. Many compacts are made exclusively
for such stores as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom
with prices ranging from $50-$100. A few go for $150 (enchanted
butterfly) and even $250 (the carousel).
</P>
<P>
   And the really pricey Golden Millennium 2000 round compact in 14
karat gold _ filled with Beautiful and set with diamonds _ is a
Neiman's exclusive for $2,500. Atlanta received four of the 60 that
were made. But don't expect to buy one. All are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the compacts, both contemporary and vintage,
have become hot collectibles. Gigi Martschinsky of Norcross, Ga.,
has been a collector since 1995, when she bought a Scottie dog for
$65. Now she has 48 compacts displayed in wall cases. Her
collection includes an Easter bonnet, a wagon with toys, a panda, a
teapot and teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I splurge and buy one a season,'' said Martschinsky,
the owner of Baby Warehouse. ``But this year, I went crazy and
bought 12, including the 2000 Millennium compact.'' The oldest
compact in her collection is an early '70s concha pendant on a
chain with squash blossom beads. Her favorite is the carousel. And
she has a Ferris wheel ($475) on order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go for the beauty and the intricacy of the design,'' said
Martschinsky. ``I love carrying a different one in my purse. People
are always intrigued and telling me I smell pretty!''
</P>
<P>
   Solid perfume compacts have become big business. Collectors
wanting to buy or trade compacts look for them at estate sales, in
antique shops and on Internet auction sites including ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women love these compacts because the perfume doesn't leak and
the designs are so ornamental,'' said New Yorker Roselyn Gerson,
the founder of the Compact Collectors Club. ``They decorate their
homes with them. Also, the compacts are affordable and make good
investment pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most highly sought compacts are the look-like-ivory
and wood series of fish, dog, rabbit, duck and cat issued in the
'80s. They originally sold for around $30. Today, the compacts
command prices of $300-$400 in their original boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the elusive, 1981 Imperial Princess filled with the
Cinnabar scent that originally sold for $27.50. ``I know someone
who has offered to pay $8,000 for this compact, in its original
box,'' said Evelyn Lauder, ``if she can ever find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson, who owns about 530 Lauder solid perfume compacts, says
it's never too late to start collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a visually, enjoyable addiction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The exhibit: 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
Saturdays; 12:30-5:30 p.m. Sundays. Through June 5. Neiman Marcus,
Lenox Square. 404-266-8200, Ext. 2270.

 &HT;    What a new cook needs
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congratulations!
</P>
<P>
   Your education's complete, finals are fini, a promising job and
new digs await. The world truly is your oyster.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Unless you're willing to eat that oyster raw every
morning, noon and night, you may have to equip a now-empty kitchen
and _ gasp! _ learn how to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Do not panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing easier than cooking, really. Nothing
mysterious about it,'' claims Julia Child, who's been at it for 55
years. Her advice? ``Just start in and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for her to say _ she's got some of the world's
best-equipped kitchens on both coasts and both sides of the
Atlantic. Knowing there's more to it than a Nike slogan, we asked
Child and other experts for their best advice on how to learn to
cook, choose essential equipment, stock the pantry, shop wisely
and, inevitably, clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell people to start with the family _ any small
recipe from the family mother,'' advises Jacques Pepin. ``... not
only are they familiar with the recipe but with the taste. They
feel comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What if Mom didn't cook?
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have a friend who knows how to cook better than
you,'' Pepin said. ``Go cook with the friend. Tell them, `Look,
I'll do the dishes and all that. Can I come a bit earlier? I want
to cook with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those same friends can advise you on which pieces of equipment
you'll really need, added Child, Pepin's kitchen partner on their
television show and in the companion cookbook, ``Julia &AMP; Jacques:
Cooking at Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't depend on store people _ they want to sell you a
whole set of things and you don't want a set,'' Child said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Pepin also say to get a few good cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin, who has written all kinds, suggests a variety ranging
from those on fine points of technique to those on whipping up
foods you like in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't necessarily preclude the other,'' Pepin said,
noting that lots of people who are rushed through the week find
they enjoy cooking in a leisurely way on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you get the recipe, read it through completely
before beginning to cook. Then read it again.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Chandler, a 1999 Georgia Tech graduate who's been cooking
one year, learned that lesson the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pounding out chicken breasts with the flat end of a meat
mallet. I forgot to reread the recipe before I began, so I failed
to cover the breast in Saran Wrap before pounding. I had tiny bits
of raw chicken all over my kitchen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she also recommends plastic wrap as a must-have, along with
her grandmother's telephone number and the red-check covers of
Better Homes &AMP; Gardens cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't call Grandma with every question, there's no
shortage of cookbooks and Internet sites aimed at a generation of
eaters raised by a generation of noncooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can overestimate how we've become dumbed
down,'' says Marie Rama, co-author of ``Cooking for Dummies'' (IDG
Books, $19.95), which sold more than 300,000 copies and was
followed by an expanded second edition last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a badge of honor today to say `I don't cook,'''
Rama said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no excuse for that kind of thinking or believing that
singles needn't bother to cook, according to Amanda Hesser,
28-year-old New York Times style writer who recently won an
International Association of Culinary Professionals award for her
book ``The Cook and the Gardener'' (W.W. Norton, $32.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most college students gravitate toward things like pasta. They
need to move on,'' said Hesser, who lives alone and cooks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a roast chicken, she said. The next day it becomes
chicken salad, ``and then you can call your mom and ask her how to
make chicken soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered the chicken, the same principles will apply
to other poultry.
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``Dummies'' message, too. Rama said it helps new
cooks master basic techniques so they can branch out to suit their
own tastes. ``That is the goal _ to fly by the seat of their
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes are anticipated here, as they are in some decidedly
more highbrow books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I cook, the less and less I demand perfection from
myself. It's really good for beginners to understand that,'' Rama
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom like that should make even newcomers feel like creative
people in control of what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Cirillo, author of the just published ``The Complete
Idiot's Guide to Cooking With Kids'' (MacMillan USA, $16.95),
encourages fearless experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one night coming home from my first job and making
dinner for myself,'' she said. ``I sauteed some onions and added
chicken breasts to the skillet. I saw some plain yogurt in the
fridge and, spontaneously, I just put some in the pan with some
curry powder. I had a great-tasting dish and without even realizing
it was on my way to discovering Indian food.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree, generally on the most important advice of all:
Relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people to trust themselves and go with their
instincts,'' says Susie Heller, who helped develop ``The French
Laundry Cookbook'' with chef Thomas Keller, winner of this year's
IACP award for book of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a comfort to know that even though Jacques Pepin
has been in professional kitchens for 51 years, he's still
learning. In an interview last month, he said that as he and Julia
Child were working on a show about stuffed cabbage, they were
preparing to blanch the cabbage in boiling water, the traditional
way of making the leaves limp and easy to roll. A producer on the
show told them they could get the same wilted effect by freezing
the whole cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So people have to get into it and they'll be surprised at how
fast they can learn,'' Pepin says. ``They should start with simple
recipes _ just roast chicken, boil a potato. It could be
extraordinarily good if it's done properly, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax and start cooking,'' he says. ``I mean, you're not going
to go to jail or anything like this even if you burn the chicken a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the outcome, never apologize, Brody adds. ``If it
tastes good, that's good enough. If it looks good, that's a
bonus.''

 &HT;    At North Carolina furniture mecca, tradition rules and
large-scale pieces are in demand
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Furniture shoppers look to North Carolina for
setting the tone in new designs much like the fashion forward turn
to Paris and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   And while trends emerging at the world's largest wholesale
furniture market, held twice a year, don't change as quickly as
Versace's hemlines, new collections do make headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of the time. This spring's International Home
Furnishings Market was about as quiet as an upholstery shop on
Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The nation's booming economy. Furniture sales have
never been better, and when times are good, manufacturers play it
safe. They introduce few new lines, trumpet few innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dull show, retailers and interior designers shopping
High Point's 8.5 million-square-feet of trade-only showrooms
couldn't ignore a few new directions and introductions, which
should begin appearing in stores by fall:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Traditional reigns: New contemporary designs have made inroads
the past few years as interiors become more eclectic. But the April
market brought an influx of 18th-century reproductions, including
new collections by Hickory Chair (William E. Poole), Craftique
(Biltmore Estate) and Stickley (Williamsburg Reserve).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bigger is better: As living rooms get larger and ceilings
higher, the demand for large-scale pieces is great. And if your
taste is traditional, that means bigger reproductions, sporting
pediments and other architectural elements, large legs and feet,
sculptural trim.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Branding a name. Licensing, in which a manufacturer is
permitted to produce furniture under the name of a celebrity or
famous place, accounted for $4.7 billion in retail sales last year.
This market saw an expansion of Thomasville's Ernest Hemingway
Collection highlighting the famed author's Paris connections, while
new collections were unveiled by Home &AMP; Garden Television gurus
Chris Madden (for Bassett) and Joe Ruggiero (for Norwalk
Furniture).

 &HT;    Nothing says family like Sunday dinner
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every Sunday afternoon, as many as 20 family members
from Alpharetta, Ga., to Stone Mountain, Ga., descend on Betty
Greene's house in Toco Hills for Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Greene, 87, will fix soup or stew for the four
generations. Other times a roast with gravy. There will be a salad
of raw vegetables or fruit, and a dessert of pie or ice cream and
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer set the table and wash all the dishes. We eat on
paper plates,'' said Greene. ``But it's still Sunday dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as her family is concerned, casual is just fine. For the
joy in the meal comes from the company and the cuisine, not the
china. ``It's good food and good visiting,'' said granddaughter
Dell Schenck, 42, of Stone Mountain. ``And I feel out of kilter if
we miss a Sunday. It's the way I stay in touch with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying in touch has always been the offering of Sunday dinner,
no matter what's served on the plate. When I was a child, it was
the only meal of the week guaranteed to bring everyone to the table
at the same time. We gathered an hour after church, and Mammaw
almost always made fried chicken. I came to believe it was a
biblical command to eat fried chicken after a worship service.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I returned to church after several years of sitting
out. After my first Sunday service, I was so overcome by desire for
fried chicken, I drove directly to the nearest fast food joint for
a two-piece snack box.
</P>
<P>
   The next Sunday, I invited friends over and made fried chicken
to share. It was good, but what really made the meal was pausing to
visit with friends before another busy week began.
</P>
<P>
   So I began to invite neighbors and friends every Sunday I could,
and soon it became my favorite way to ``entertain.'' Unlike a
Saturday-night dinner party, there's no pressure to have a
beautifully set table, a spotless house or a ``gourmet'' menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more relaxed, and I feel like I have more time to
prepare, '' said Ann Addison of Dunwoody, Ga. She and her husband
often invite their grown daughters or close friends over on
Sundays. ``People can come over earlier and they don't stay as
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, make a date with your family or invite a friend or
neighbor over. And though the nutrition police won't allow it every
week, why not serve fried chicken this time? My friend John
Millsaps offered me this delicious version for Sunday dinner once.
Add something green, something sweet and some comforting
conversation, and the Sunday dinner tradition will be revived
again.
</P>
<P>
   Fried Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Wash and pat dry the chicken parts; salt and pepper and toss in
a large bowl. Pour enough milk over the chicken to cover. Halve 2-3
lemons and squeeze the juice over the chicken; then toss the lemon
halves into the bowl. Cover and chill for several hours or
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Dredge the chicken parts in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.
Heat up some shortening and bacon drippings in a large, heavy
skillet _ cast iron works best. Put the chicken in the hot grease,
skin side down. Cover and cook for 12-15 minutes. Then turn the
pieces and leave uncovered for several more minutes, until juices
run clear. The milk makes a delicious gravy (be sure it comes to a
bubbly boil).
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen Conversation appears every other week in the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Armed with good advice, conquer kitchen in the kitchen
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relax, it's easy. If the experts have convinced you to get in
the kitchen, they've followed up by recommending some good starter
recipes. A couple don't even require cooking. And all, from
breakfast casserole to brownies, are good enough to serve to family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marcia Langhenry
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Bacon and Cheese
</P>
<P>
   Strata
</P>
<P>
   Why not start with a weekend breakfast? This substantial dish
also makes a fine dinner, and it's one ``Cooking for Dummies''
co-author Marie Rama readily recommends for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Standing time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Butter for baking dish
</P>
<P>
   1 (8-ounce) loaf seedless Italian bread
</P>
<P>
   5 slices bacon
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups grated Gouda, Gruyere or Italian fontina cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup rinsed, chopped, packed spinach or sorrel leaves
</P>
<P>
   5 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato-based salsa
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Butter the bottom and sides of a shallow, 2 1/2- to 3-quart
baking dish. (Use a rectangular dish that allows the bread slices
to fit snugly in one layer.) Trim and discard about 1 inch off each
end of the loaf of bread and cut the rest into about 16 slices. If
the bread is fresh, dry the slices in a 175-degree oven for about
15 minutes. Arrange the slices in the baking dish, overlapping
edges so the slices fit in the dish. Saute bacon in a large skillet
over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes, or until crisp, turning
occasionally. Drain on paper towels. When it's cool enough to
handle, crumble bacon and sprinkle over bread. Top with cheese and
spinach or sorrel. In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, milk,
salsa, salt and pepper. Pour over the layers of bread, bacon,
cheese and spinach. Using a fork, press the bread slices down to
soak them in the egg mixture. Let stand for about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the strata about 35 minutes or just until the custard
mixture is firm and lightly browned. Do not overbake, or the
custard will be dry. Remove from the oven and serve immediately,

   What could be easier than uncooked, cold soup based on canned
tomatoes? It's a good chance to hone your chopping skills with a
new chef's knife, too.
</P>
<P>
   1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, undrained
</P>
<P>
   1 medium bell pepper, finely chopped, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely chopped cucumber, divided

<P>
   In the bowl of a food processor or blender, place tomatoes, 1/2
cup bell peppers, 1/2 cup cucumber, 1/4 cup onion, 1/2 cup
croutons, the broth, oil, cumin, vinegar, salt and pepper. Cover
and blend on medium speed until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into medium bowl and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Serve
remaining vegetables and croutons as accompaniments. Other good
additions are yogurt or sour cream and chopped hard-cooked egg. _

   Once you learn to roast vegetables, you'll find lots of ways to
use them _ tucked into wraps or tossed with pasta, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 red or yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch

   1 small zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch slices

</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound asparagus, trimmed of thick stems, cut diagonally into
1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, chopped into 1/8-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 jalapeno pepper or small red chile pepper (according to
taste), seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh (or 1 teaspoon dried) basil, marjoram
or thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter carrots over a large roasting pan. Drizzle with 1
tablespoon olive oil; toss to coat. Place uncovered pan on oven
rack closest to heating element; roast for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and add bell pepper, zucchini, squash,
asparagus, onion, garlic and jalapeno. Sprinkle with herb, ginger,
brown sugar (if desired), salt and pepper; drizzle the remaining 1
to 2 tablespoons olive oil over the vegetables, using only enough
to lightly coat them. Toss well, spreading out vegetables in a
single layer.
</P>
<P>
   Return roasting pan to the oven and roast 20 to 25 minutes, or
until tender, turning once with a spatula or wooden spoon after 15
minutes so the vegetables brown evenly. If after 25 minutes the
vegetables are tender but not browned, place them under the broiler
for a minute or two, but watch them carefully so they don't burn. _

   Julia Child includes this skillet variation of the impressive
oven-baked Potatoes Anna in ``The Way to Cook'' (Knopf, 1989). You
need a cast-iron or nonstick frying pan and a lid or flat baking
pan to cover it to achieve the desired crustiness. Add the optional
cheese to turn the dish into a meal.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup clarified (melted, with white solids removed) butter, or
olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into slices 1/8 inch thick and about
1 by 1 1/2 inches across (to make 1 cup), optional
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Peel potatoes and cut into round slices 1 1/4 inches in diameter
and 1/4 inch thick. Drop them into a bowl of cold water. Drain
slices and dry in a towel.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/4 inch clarified butter or olive oil into cast-iron
skillet or nonstick frying pan, set over moderate heat and rapidly
arrange an overlapping layer of potato slices in the pan, shaking
gently from time to time to prevent sticking. Baste with a
sprinkling of butter, then arrange a second layer over the first
and top with cheese, if using. Season third layer of potatoes with
salt, pepper and a speck of nutmeg. Continue filling with potatoes,
optional cheese, salt, black pepper and nutmeg, ending with potato
layer. Shake pan gently and let cook 3 to 5 minutes over
medium-high heat to be sure the bottom is crusting.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the pan and set over low heat for 45 minutes, or until the
potatoes are tender when pierced with a small knife. Make certain
the heat is regulated so the potatoes do not burn. Run a spatula
all around the edge of the pan and underneath the potatoes to
loosen them. Unmold onto a hot serving dish.

   Although there are endless variations for broiled chicken
breasts, some, like this one, are easily committed to memory. It's
terrific with mashed potatoes, but you could also serve the chicken
sliced over a salad or alongside rice and steamed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus additional for the pan
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup maple syrup, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Preheat broiler. Line broiler pan with aluminum foil and lightly
coat the foil with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly rub oil on both sides of the chicken. Press black pepper
into both sides of the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Broil chicken 5 minutes. Carefully remove the pan from the
broiler and brush the chicken generously with some of the maple
syrup. Return to broiler, turning chicken often and basting with
the remaining maple syrup, until the chicken is cooked through,
about 5 more minutes. Serve immediately. _ From: ``The 15-Minute

   ``No muss, no fuss,'' our tester said of this ice cream so easy
you'll be tempted to keep some in the freezer all summer. You don't
need any special equipment, and it truly takes no more than 5

   Some people like their brownies cakey; others like them fudgy.
Lora Brody's easy-to-make version, with its rich, chocolatey
frosting, satisfies both camps and would be perfect to tote to a
potluck.
</P>
<P>
   For the brownies:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) (plus more for the pan) unsalted butter, at
room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 (16-ounce) can (2 cups) chocolate syrup
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, measured after sifting
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
</P>
<P>
   For the Quick Glaze:
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons whole milk
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   For the brownies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees and put rack in
center position. Generously butter or grease 13-by-9-by-2-inch
baking pan. In a medium mixing bowl, using either a spoon or an
electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until completely
blended. Stir in the chocolate syrup and flour, mixing until just
blended; don't overbeat, as it will make the brownies tough. Stir
in pecans, if using. Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool in
the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the Quick Glaze: While the brownies are cooling, place
sugar, milk and butter in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to boil. Boil for 30
seconds without stirring, then remove from the heat and add
chocolate chips. Stir until chocolate melts; the mixture will be
very thin. Pour glaze over the brownies, spreading evenly. Cool at
least 1 hour, then cut into 2-inch squares. Store in airtight
container. _ From: ``The Entertaining Survival Guide''

 &HT;    Cleanup tips
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Plastic (polyethelene) cutting boards are more sanitary
because they are more impervious and you can put them in the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marie Rama, co-author, ``Cooking for Dummies''
</P>
<P>
   2. Sanitize hardwood cutting boards from time to time by heating
in the microwave 60 seconds on high.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What Great Chefs Know That You Don't''
</P>
<P>
   3. When wrapping leftovers, the hardest part is getting the
plastic wrap off the roll in a flat, smooth piece. It helps to
store the box of plastic wrap in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What Great Chefs Know That You Don't''
</P>
<P>
   4. Keep a box of facial tissues near the stove to wipe up small
spills. They are quicker and cheaper than paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diana Sturgis, quoted in ``1,001 Secrets of Great Cooks''
</P>
<P>
   5. If your lasagna spills over onto the oven floor, sprinkle
with salt, lift out what you can with a metal spatula and wipe the
rest with a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Beard, quoted in ``1,001 Secrets of Great Cooks''
</P>
<P>
   6. Small self-closing plastic bags help with cleanup and
storage. Use them to melt butter or chocolate in the microwave.
Remove, knead until mixed, then remove from the bag by snipping a
small opening in one corner and squeezing out. They are also
indispensable for storage of small amounts of leftover tomato paste
or chopped onions or peppers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Clean as you go _ keep sink full of warm, soapy water and
pause once in a while to wash up.
</P>
<P>
   8. If you don't want to keep the sink tied up with soapy water,
wash items individually with one of the detergent-filled brushes.
</P>
<P>
   9. Line roasting pans with aluminum foil for easier cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   10. If your oven is not self-cleaning, try this: Preheat oven to
200 degrees, then turn oven off. Pour 1/2 cup ammonia into a small
bowl and place on the center shelf of the oven. Close door and
allow to remain overnight. Open a window, then open oven door and
air out for 30 minutes. Wipe up the mess with warm, damp paper
towels. _ ``10,001 Food Facts, Chefs' Secrets &AMP; Household Hints''

   Q: I am looking for Marmite, a spicy spread that can be used on
crackers or bread. I know it can be found in England, and in
Florida, but here it is nowhere to be found. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amanda M. Courchene, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Spread this around: Marmite is an extract made from brewer's
yeast and 100 percent vegetarian. We found it at Harry's Farmers
Market, 70 Powers Ferry Road, Marietta (770-578-4400), where a
4.4-ounce bottle is $2.99 and a 2-ounce bottle is $2.19. We also
spotted it at Taste of Britain, 73 S. Peachtree St., Norcross
(770-242-8585). A 4.4-ounce bottle is $4.39, an 8.8-ounce bottle
$8.29. The manufacturer, Britain's CPC, says it's ``delicious when
spread thinly on toast; for a treat, try Marmite on crisp bread
with cottage cheese.'' In addition to yeast, the spread contains
salt, carrot, spice and onion extracts and is enriched with niacin,
riboflavin, folic acid and vitamin B12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Mink hair spray and shampoo. I bought it
years ago. Are they still being made?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kimberly Will, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's good news, bad news. Mink shampoo, said a Gillette
spokesman, has been discontinued due to low sales. However, the
hair spray is sold at Eckerd drugstores. We found Mink Difference
Extra Hold Hair Spray ($3.69) and Mink Difference Anti-Humidity
Formula Hair Spray ($3.69) at the 45 W. Paces Ferry Road N.W.
location (404-261-5538).
</P>
<P>
   According to the bottle, you can have hair that feels as ``soft
and silky as a mink.'' And it can be used on wet hair for styling
or dry hair for finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Malt-O-Meal has always been my favorite hot breakfast cereal,
but I have been unable to find it for the past year or two (Kroger
used to carry it). Can you tell me if it is made anymore? Thank
you!
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Jones, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another cereal query: We have not been able to find a
grocery store that stocks Malt-O-Meal since we moved here in 1998
from New Mexico. In fact, it was easier to find grits in the desert
than Malt-O-Meal in the South!
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiernan Cantergiani, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Like the Malt-O-Meal slogan says, ``It's good stuff,
Maynard.'' The creamy hot cereal is a blend of wheat farina (the
middle portion of the wheat kernel) and toasted barley. It's
available in original, maple and brown sugar, chocolate, and apple
cinnamon flavors. A spokeswoman for the company says the cereal is
``generally not available in Atlanta.'' However, you can order it
over the Internet at www.malt-o-meal.com Or call 1-800-743-3029.
Three 28-ounce boxes are $6.50, including shipping; six boxes are
$21, including shipping. Company will custom-pack flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I saw a Pond's product that was a cucumber eye
treatment. It was supposed to clear up bags under the eyes. I have
not been able to find it lately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle Ferrera, Jonesboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: When you open up a jar of Pond's Soothing Cucumber Eye
Treatments pads, you'd swear they were actual slices of cucumbers.
We found our jar (24 eye pads, $8.99) at CVS Pharmacy, 2929 N.
Druid Hills Road N.E. (404-325-1487). The manufacturer says the
pads are ``pre-moistened with real cucumber and other natural
extracts _ green tea, chamomile, aloe _ to soothe tired eyes and
help to reduce eye puffiness.'' After a long day, remove your eye
makeup and contact lenses, if you wear them. Place one pad over
each eye, lie back and relax. Leave on for 5-15 minutes. For
maximum refreshment, store jar in fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Toilet Duck, a thick liquid bowl cleaner.
It's nontoxic and noncorrosive, and you don't have to wear gloves
to use it. But I heard it was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   _ Damien Cuen, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Quack, quack. Yes, this old cleaning favorite has been
discontinued by manufacturer SC Johnson. However, the Toilet Duck
tank tablets are still available. We found our package (1.7-ounce
blue tablet, $1.49) at Kroger, 2205 LaVista Road N.E.
(404-633-8694). To use, you simply remove the tank cover and, when
water level is low, drop tablet into right side of the tank. The
tablet should be on its side, not sitting up. Then wait 10 minutes
before flushing. When color disappears, you need to replace the
tablet.

   Airheads holding their breath for the French ambient-pop duo's
follow-up to the brilliant 1998 debut ``Moon Safari'' (last year's
``Premiers Symptomes'' was a collection of early singles) will want
to inhale this score for the new Kirsten Dunst drama. Though most
of the tracks sound like moody sketches rather than fully
fleshed-out songs, numbers such as ``Playground Love'' and ``Dark
Messages'' come close to achieving the beautiful mystery of the
first album. Think of it as Air lite. If you just can't get enough
of the movie's tunes, check out a separate ``Music From the Motion
Picture'' soundtrack, on Emperor Norton Records. A collection of
classic rock relics by Heart, Todd Rundgren and others (plus two
Air compositions not included in the score), it plays like a
particularly kickin' super-set on Z93. (B+)

anthology of near-hits and rarities. The yuk-yuk factor is high,
with tracks ranging from the ridiculous (``Whip it,''
``Peek-a-boo'') to the more ridiculous (``Satis-faction,'' ``Secret
Agent Man''). There's even a new tune, ``Words Get Stuck in My
Throat'' (suggested subtitle: ``Tongue Gets Stuck in My Cheek'').
But what's most hilarious here are the dead-serious liner notes
deeming Devo's influence ``firmly embedded in our cultural/social
vocabulary.'' Yeah, right. Just like the Flintstones.

<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   If Jonell Mosser's first album of original material was a movie,
it'd be a chick flick. There's a song asking a lover for
reassurance, a been-done-wrong tune, one about a heartbreaking
breakup, even a lovely tribute to her departed Mom that includes
the lyric ``And though you were like no one else/ I see you
sometimes when I look at myself.'' Mosser, a popular Nashville
session singer and club performer, delivers them in a husky voice
that recalls, at different times, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Aretha
Franklin. The album verifies Don Was' assessment that Mosser has
``a direct link from heart to larynx.'' The songs, co-written with
Johanna and John Hall (Orleans) are well crafted, even if the
lyrics and his production lack the spunk of Mosser's vocals. But
she's a talent to watch _ especially one to hear.

   Womack is country's sweet heir to Dolly Parton. Her soprano is
twangy enough to belt out ``Muleskinner Blues,'' but she uses it
here to smack life into contemporary tunes about raising kids,
being lonely and falling in love in aisle four at the grocery. The
inspirational single, ``I Hope You Dance,'' is getting all the
attention, but the rest of the CD shows that there's room for a
pedal steel and a mandolin in country's mainstream future.

 &HT;    Whitney's 'Greatest Hits'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes Whitney Houston's first collection of hits great is
her. Not the songs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most insultingly simple lines to ever come out of an
incredibly gifted vocalist's mouth _ ``I want to run to
you/Oooh-hoo'' _ have roared out of hers. And yet when the daughter
of Aretha Franklin's back-up singer and cousin of classic song
stylist Dionne Warwick wraps those genes around innocuous lyrics
like ``Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoo be-doop'' they become shimmering
anthems, fleetingly meaningful reflections of our emotions, and
more than 15 times over her 15-year career, No. 1 hits.
</P>
<P>
   On the first CD there's her masterfully manipulated big pop
confections (``I Will Always Love You''), the occasional, really
soulful R&AMP;B tunes (``Saving All My Love for You'') and new
radio-ready duets with Whitney-in-training Deborah Cox and Latin
smolderer Enrique Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
   The second CD of dance remixes is an appropriate nod to an
artist who has held sway over so many genres. But without a gospel
single from ``The Preacher's Wife'' soundtrack _ some of her most
emotive work _ this isn't Whitney at her best.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dinosaur flicks keep stomping
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movies' love affair with dinosaurs began in what could be
called prehistoric times for the cinema. In 1914, venerated
cartoonist Windsor McKay gave us a one-reeler called ``Gertie the
Dinosaur,'' starring a cuddly brontosaurus. Since then, things have
gotten, well, more sophisticated. Consider the $200 million-plus
reportedly spent on this week's new Disney release, ``Dinosaur.''
``Jurassic Park'' _ the original, not the sequel _ remains the best
of the bunch, but everybody knows that one. Here are some more
obscure titles to consider for an evening at home with something
big and scaly (fill in your own spouse joke).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Valley of Gwangi'' (1969): Ray Harryhausen, the master
monster maker who did by hand and by himself what entire computer
departments do these days, created the wonders in this fantasy film
pitting cowboys _ I'm not kidding _ against prehistoric creatures.
A turn-of-the-century circus boss (Richard Carlson) ventures into
Mexico's Forbidden Valley with a cadre of cowboys (led by James
Franciscus). Their mission: to fetch some beasties for his Wild
West show. Roping a little eohippus (the orginal blueprint for the
horse) isn't so hard, but rounding up a flesh-eating allosaurus _
the titular Gwangi _ is something else again. The battle between
Gwangi and an elephant is really quite remarkable and Harryhausen
at his best.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'' (1953): Harryhausen again,
but this time he pits a fictional rhedosaur against the residents
of 1950s New York. After taking Manhattan, the creature proceeds to
Coney Island for an amazing sequence in which it's trapped inside
the amusement park's giant roller coaster. Based on a short story
by Harryhausen's old pal Ray Bradbury, the movie kicked off the
sci-fi cycle of nuclear-generated thingies _ from giant octopuses
to giant grasshoppers _ that inundated the '50s. Look for Lee Van
Cleef, later Clint Eastwood's nemesis in all those spaghetti
westerns, in a small role.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Giant Behemoth'' (1959): Sort of the same story as
``Beast.'' Sort of exactly the same story, since both films were
directed by Eugene Lourie. Only this monster, after being blasted
back to consciousness by atomic tests, heads for the Thames instead
of the Hudson. Bye-bye, Big Ben. The special effects, which don't
really kick in until the movie's second half, were done by Willis
O'Brien, Harryhausen's mentor and the creator of, among other
classics, ``King Kong'' and the original silent version of ``The
Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Baby ... Secret of the Lost Legend'' (1985) and ``The Land
BeforeTime'' (1988): If the lines for ``Dinosaur'' are too long and
you've got a little one clamoring for big lizards, both these films
are good bets. Especially since, like ``Dinosaur,'' they're really
more for tiny tots who think dinosaurs are all colored purple. The
former, a live-action film, is about a family of brontosauruses
discovered in darkest Africa. Sean Young and William Katt are the
good guys trying to protect Baby and her gargantuan folks. Patrick
McGoohan (``Secret Agent'') is the bad-guy archaeologist who wants
Baby for himself. The second title is a pleasant animated tale from
Don Bluth about a quartet of baby dinosaurs on a quest to find the
Great Valley where they'll be safe from the Ice Age or comets or
cigarettes (Gary Larsen's theory) or whatever did the big guys in.
Hmmm ... check this against the plot of ``Dinosaur.'' Sounds
veeeery similar.

 &HT;    Exhibit showcases Lauder perfume compacts
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The English wag who said ``good things come in small packages''
must have had solid perfume compacts in mind.
</P>
<P>
   These little works of art, which hold concentrated perfume oil
in a wax base, have been made for years by well-known cosmetic and
fashion design houses, including Avon, Revlon, Max Factor, Donna
Karan and St. John.
</P>
<P>
   But the present-day leader, hands down, is Estee Lauder. Since
1968, the cosmetic company has produced 400 of these whimsical
treasures _ filled with such classic Lauder fragrances as
Youth-Dew, Pleasures, Cinnabar, White Linen, Beautiful, Dazzling
Gold and Dazzling Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The first Lauder perfume compact was a golden rope nugget with
faux turquoise and filled with Youth-Dew. Over the years, these
compacts _ hand-crafted by a team of jewelry makers _ have ranged
from traditional cameos to sparkling cats and dogs set with
Austrian crystals to a juicy-looking peach and jewel-encrusted peas
in a pod.
</P>
<P>
   To show the creativity of the designs, the Lauder company has
assembled a traveling exhibit of about 100 of its perfume compacts.
It spans three decades and includes rare pieces from Estee Lauder's
personal collection. You can view the free exhibit through June 5
at Neiman Marcus Lenox Square in Atlanta. ``My mother-in-law
strongly believed that every woman should carry a beautiful compact
in her purse,'' said Evelyn Lauder, senior corporate vice president
of the company during a phone interview. ``She got the idea to put
solid perfume in compacts after learning the Egyptians encased
fragrances in wax as a way of preserving them. `Why don't we do the
same thing?' she asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company releases about 50 designs each year, usually
in October for Christmas giving. All are limited editions. This
means, they are available for one year or until the supply runs
out, then the molds are retired. Many compacts are made exclusively
for such stores as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom
with prices ranging from $50-$100. A few go for $150 (enchanted
butterfly) and even $250 (the carousel).
</P>
<P>
   And the really pricey Golden Millennium 2000 round compact in 14
karat gold _ filled with Beautiful and set with diamonds _ is a
Neiman's exclusive for $2,500. Atlanta received four of the 60 that
were made. But don't expect to buy one. All are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the compacts, both contemporary and vintage,
have become hot collectibles. Gigi Martschinsky of Norcross, Ga.,
has been a collector since 1995, when she bought a Scottie dog for
$65. Now she has 48 compacts displayed in wall cases. Her
collection includes an Easter bonnet, a wagon with toys, a panda, a
teapot and teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I splurge and buy one a season,'' said Martschinsky,
the owner of Baby Warehouse. ``But this year, I went crazy and
bought 12, including the 2000 Millennium compact.'' The oldest
compact in her collection is an early '70s concha pendant on a
chain with squash blossom beads. Her favorite is the carousel. And
she has a Ferris wheel ($475) on order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go for the beauty and the intricacy of the design,'' said
Martschinsky. ``I love carrying a different one in my purse. People
are always intrigued and telling me I smell pretty!''
</P>
<P>
   Solid perfume compacts have become big business. Collectors
wanting to buy or trade compacts look for them at estate sales, in
antique shops and on Internet auction sites including ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women love these compacts because the perfume doesn't leak and
the designs are so ornamental,'' said New Yorker Roselyn Gerson,
the founder of the Compact Collectors Club. ``They decorate their
homes with them. Also, the compacts are affordable and make good
investment pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most highly sought compacts are the look-like-ivory
and wood series of fish, dog, rabbit, duck and cat issued in the
'80s. They originally sold for around $30. Today, the compacts
command prices of $300-$400 in their original boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the elusive, 1981 Imperial Princess filled with the
Cinnabar scent that originally sold for $27.50. ``I know someone
who has offered to pay $8,000 for this compact, in its original
box,'' said Evelyn Lauder, ``if she can ever find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson, who owns about 530 Lauder solid perfume compacts, says
it's never too late to start collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a visually, enjoyable addiction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The exhibit: 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
Saturdays; 12:30-5:30 p.m. Sundays. Through June 5. Neiman Marcus,
Lenox Square. 404-266-8200, Ext. 2270.

 &HT;    At North Carolina furniture mecca, tradition rules and
large-scale pieces are in demand
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Furniture shoppers look to North Carolina for
setting the tone in new designs much like the fashion forward turn
to Paris and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   And while trends emerging at the world's largest wholesale
furniture market, held twice a year, don't change as quickly as
Versace's hemlines, new collections do make headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of the time. This spring's International Home
Furnishings Market was about as quiet as an upholstery shop on
Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The nation's booming economy. Furniture sales have
never been better, and when times are good, manufacturers play it
safe. They introduce few new lines, trumpet few innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dull show, retailers and interior designers shopping
High Point's 8.5 million-square-feet of trade-only showrooms
couldn't ignore a few new directions and introductions, which
should begin appearing in stores by fall:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Traditional reigns: New contemporary designs have made inroads
the past few years as interiors become more eclectic. But the April
market brought an influx of 18th-century reproductions, including
new collections by Hickory Chair (William E. Poole), Craftique
(Biltmore Estate) and Stickley (Williamsburg Reserve).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bigger is better: As living rooms get larger and ceilings
higher, the demand for large-scale pieces is great. And if your
taste is traditional, that means bigger reproductions, sporting
pediments and other architectural elements, large legs and feet,
sculptural trim.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Branding a name. Licensing, in which a manufacturer is
permitted to produce furniture under the name of a celebrity or
famous place, accounted for $4.7 billion in retail sales last year.
This market saw an expansion of Thomasville's Ernest Hemingway
Collection highlighting the famed author's Paris connections, while
new collections were unveiled by Home &AMP; Garden Television gurus
Chris Madden (for Bassett) and Joe Ruggiero (for Norwalk
Furniture).

 &HT;    Faulkner's hometown offers books, more
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ The stone Confederate soldier still stands on
the square as a silent memorial to Lafayette County's Civil War
dead, but that's about all that hasn't changed in William
Faulkner's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sleepy community famous only for its literary heritage
and Ole Miss football games, Oxford is rapidly becoming a trendy
urban center for music, art, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   You can still get collards and chicken-fried steak at the Ajax
Diner or Smitty's, but you also can get capuccino, shrimp and grits
and gourmet meals at the City Grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can load up on Ole Miss football souvenirs at
University Sporting Goods on the square, but they also can find
fine art and hand-crafted pottery at the Southside Gallery and
Mississippi Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Named one of the ``100 Best Small Towns'' by USA Today, Oxford
is a walker's _ and shopper's _ paradise. A shady town square built
around the 150-year-old courthouse offers a variety of shops and
restaurants as well as wrought iron-enclosed second-floor balconies
where restaurant patrons can take their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxford is seen as a quaint Southern town,'' says Richard
Howorth, owner of Square Books, ``but it's more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the town's population is around 10,000, the University
of Mississippi adds 11,000. The result is an eclectic mix of
locals, students and tourists who come to shop, soak up the
literary atmosphere at Faulkner's Rowan Oak plantation, or attend
the numerous live music events.
</P>
<P>
   All the extra traffic and influx of new residents have been
great for business, but there's a downside, says Na-Ann Watts,
owner of Na-Ann's New Look, a frame and accessory shop just off the
square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Property values have shot up astronomically,'' says Watts, a
former insurance agent who turned her interior decorating hobby
into a profession. ``You have the parents of students coming to
Oxford and liking the town so much they move here. A lot of folks
are retiring here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who took over an existing picture frame shop, has
upgraded her stock to include a wide assortment of mouldings,
frames, mirrors, lamps and accessories, many of them in a safari
motif.
</P>
<P>
   Around the square, shoppers can find everything: the best
assortment of blues CDs in the South at Uncle Bucks Records; folk
art, antiques and weather vanes at, of course, the Weather Vane;
and hand-thrown pottery, gourmet cookware and kudzu jelly at
Mississippi Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Other shops, such as the Kaleidoscope, sell ``I Love Lucy'' tin
totes, jewelry and exquisitely detailed stuffed animals, while
Occasions offers a selection of Vera Bradley bags and Thomas
Kincaid tapestrys.
</P>
<P>
   Depite the changes and the gentrification of the town, Oxford
hasn't forgotten the man that put it on the map. Situated on a
bench in front of City Hall is a bronze sculpture of Faulkner
wearing a hat with a pipe in his hand. But even in death,
controversy surrounds the author of ``Absalom, Absalom!'' and other
classic novels. Environmentalists were upset over the displacement
of a magnolia tree to make room for the statue. Faulkner fans
complain that the likeness is all wrong. And the writer's relatives
say he would have hated everything about it.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Oxford, Miss., is 332 miles west of Atlanta. If
you're driving, take I-20 west for 148 miles to Birmingham, then
U.S. 78 west for 134 miles to the Natchez Trace Parkway. Go south
four miles to Route 6. Turn west on Route 6 for 46 miles to Oxford.
Visitors going by air can fly to Memphis and take U.S. 78 southeast
to Route 7 to Oxford. It's about a 75-mile drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free and plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most shops are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 1-800-758-9177, Oxford Tourism Council.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   The Oliver-Britt House is a restored manor house a short walk
from the University of Mississippi campus and minutes from Oxford
Square. The house features four guest rooms, all located on the
second floor, with private baths, cable television and central heat
and cooling. $44-$65. 512 Van Buren Ave., 601-234-8043.
</P>
<P>
   The Barksdale-Isom Place near the square originally was built as
a log cabin in 1835. Remodeled in the Greek Revival style, it has
been expanded to include five guest rooms with private baths.
$150-$190. No smoking, no pets. 1003 Jefferson Ave., 800-236-5696.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   The City Grocery is the unlikely name for one of the most
elegant restaurants in Oxford. Located in an old storefront
building on the square, the white-tablecloth restaurant serves New
South cuisine at reasonable prices. Lunch specials include penne
pasta with shrimp for $9, an enormous helping of shrimp and grits
for $12, and smoked beef skirt steak sandwiches for $8. Evening
meals are a little pricier. 152 Courthouse Square, 601-232-8080.
</P>
<P>
   The Downtown Grill is another good choice for a quiet, candlelit
meal. Dinner specials include rainbow trout with lump crab meat for
$20.95 or Mississippi Catfish Lafitte topped with ham and shrimp

   Q: I am looking for Marmite, a spicy spread that can be used on
crackers or bread. I know it can be found in England, and in
Florida, but here it is nowhere to be found. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amanda M. Courchene, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Spread this around: Marmite is an extract made from brewer's
yeast and 100 percent vegetarian. We found it at Harry's Farmers
Market, 70 Powers Ferry Road, Marietta (770-578-4400), where a
4.4-ounce bottle is $2.99 and a 2-ounce bottle is $2.19. We also
spotted it at Taste of Britain, 73 S. Peachtree St., Norcross
(770-242-8585). A 4.4-ounce bottle is $4.39, an 8.8-ounce bottle
$8.29. The manufacturer, Britain's CPC, says it's ``delicious when
spread thinly on toast; for a treat, try Marmite on crisp bread
with cottage cheese.'' In addition to yeast, the spread contains
salt, carrot, spice and onion extracts and is enriched with niacin,
riboflavin, folic acid and vitamin B12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Mink hair spray and shampoo. I bought it
years ago. Are they still being made?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kimberly Will, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's good news, bad news. Mink shampoo, said a Gillette
spokesman, has been discontinued due to low sales. However, the
hair spray is sold at Eckerd drugstores. We found Mink Difference
Extra Hold Hair Spray ($3.69) and Mink Difference Anti-Humidity
Formula Hair Spray ($3.69) at the 45 W. Paces Ferry Road N.W.
location (404-261-5538).
</P>
<P>
   According to the bottle, you can have hair that feels as ``soft
and silky as a mink.'' And it can be used on wet hair for styling
or dry hair for finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Malt-O-Meal has always been my favorite hot breakfast cereal,
but I have been unable to find it for the past year or two (Kroger
used to carry it). Can you tell me if it is made anymore? Thank
you!
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Jones, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another cereal query: We have not been able to find a
grocery store that stocks Malt-O-Meal since we moved here in 1998
from New Mexico. In fact, it was easier to find grits in the desert
than Malt-O-Meal in the South!
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiernan Cantergiani, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Like the Malt-O-Meal slogan says, ``It's good stuff,
Maynard.'' The creamy hot cereal is a blend of wheat farina (the
middle portion of the wheat kernel) and toasted barley. It's
available in original, maple and brown sugar, chocolate, and apple
cinnamon flavors. A spokeswoman for the company says the cereal is
``generally not available in Atlanta.'' However, you can order it
over the Internet at www.malt-o-meal.com Or call 1-800-743-3029.
Three 28-ounce boxes are $6.50, including shipping; six boxes are
$21, including shipping. Company will custom-pack flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I saw a Pond's product that was a cucumber eye
treatment. It was supposed to clear up bags under the eyes. I have
not been able to find it lately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle Ferrera, Jonesboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: When you open up a jar of Pond's Soothing Cucumber Eye
Treatments pads, you'd swear they were actual slices of cucumbers.
We found our jar (24 eye pads, $8.99) at CVS Pharmacy, 2929 N.
Druid Hills Road N.E. (404-325-1487). The manufacturer says the
pads are ``pre-moistened with real cucumber and other natural
extracts _ green tea, chamomile, aloe _ to soothe tired eyes and
help to reduce eye puffiness.'' After a long day, remove your eye
makeup and contact lenses, if you wear them. Place one pad over
each eye, lie back and relax. Leave on for 5-15 minutes. For
maximum refreshment, store jar in fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Toilet Duck, a thick liquid bowl cleaner.
It's nontoxic and noncorrosive, and you don't have to wear gloves
to use it. But I heard it was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   _ Damien Cuen, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Quack, quack. Yes, this old cleaning favorite has been
discontinued by manufacturer SC Johnson. However, the Toilet Duck
tank tablets are still available. We found our package (1.7-ounce
blue tablet, $1.49) at Kroger, 2205 LaVista Road N.E.
(404-633-8694). To use, you simply remove the tank cover and, when
water level is low, drop tablet into right side of the tank. The
tablet should be on its side, not sitting up. Then wait 10 minutes
before flushing. When color disappears, you need to replace the
tablet.

 &HT;    Igniting physical and spiritual passions
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
The movie, starring Ralph Fiennes and Oscar nominee Julianne Moore,
doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, but it also summons
up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion to a higher
power.
</P>
<P>
   `The End of the Affair'

   OTHER RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The World Is Not Enough'' (PG-13) _ Alas, even a game Pierce
Brosnan and a classy director (Michael Apted) aren't enough to save
the 19th 007 movie from being more of the same old same old. Bond
is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence and
Denise Richards is pout-perfect as a nuclear scientist in short
shorts. But it's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond
movie, but they were thinking about something else at the time.
(Priced to buy: $19.98 VHS, $34.98 DVD.) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cradle Will Rock'' (R) _ It doesn't. Tim Robbins' ambitious
and energetic ensemble movie is, on the whole, overdone,
over-cluttered and overly didactic. The movie presents the
collision of art and politics in '30s New York, especially as it
applied to a famous to-hell-with-the-censors staging of Marc
Blitzstein's pro-labor musical, ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' For all
its ambition and good intentions, this is more a rant than a movie.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Felicia's Journey'' (PG-13) _ Bob Hoskins will creep you out
in this unsettling little movie about a lonely eccentric with
serious mommy issues. Elaine Cassidy, a forlorn, unwed, pregnant
Irish teen, comes under his ``protection.'' The film is elliptical,
intellectual and emotionally distant. But Cassidy is very good _
she's a natural survivor for all her naivete. And Hoskins is
amazing. He gives his performance a twisted delicacy worthy of
Peter Lorre in ``M.'' Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dreaming of Joseph Lees'' (unrated) _ Star Samantha Morton
(``Sweet and Lowdown'') is the sole reason to see this brooding
romance, set in small-town 1950s England. She plays a mill worker
torn between a needy guy who loves her, and her dreamy cousin
Joseph (Rupert Graves). At times the plot is part Harlequin
romance, part gothic psychodrama. But Morton, with the intensity
and translucence of her acting, keeps you watching. Grade: C+

CHINA TRADE BILL PASSES TWO MAJOR HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two powerful congressional committees voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to back landmark legislation on trade with
China, giving President Clinton momentum before the sharply divided
House takes up the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important vote that will be cast in this
Congress, and perhaps, in this generation,'' said House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, said
before the panel voted 34-4 in favor of the legislation. The Senate
Finance Committee approved the bill, 19-1.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the package, which would grant permanent normal
trading relations with China, would be a major legislative victory
for Clinton, who has been unable to get much of his legislative
agenda approved by a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   A win on China _ following the 1993 passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement and Thursday's signing of a law
expanding trade ties with Africa and the Caribbean _ would give
Clinton a solid legacy on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the China measure defines the ``New Democrat''
principles Clinton has been pushing during his nearly eight years
in office. And as in the battle over NAFTA, which dropped US trade
barriers with Canada and Mexico, victory in the China trade bill
will require the cooperation of a large block of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Critical of China's poor human rights record, Clinton had argued
for a tough-on-China stance when he campaigned against President
George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But after he was elected president, Clinton altered his
position, contending that the globalization of the economy made it
impossible not to trade freely with China, a growing Asian economic
power with 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Further, engaging China is more likely to encourage democratic
change there than isolating it would, Clinton insists.
</P>
<P>
   The view is at odds with two longtime Democratic Party
constituencies, organized labor and human rights activists. John J.
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, was lobbying relentlessly on
Capitol Hill Wednesday, pleading with members of Congress to vote
no.
</P>
<P>
   Labor union leaders warn that opening markets further with China
would depress the American job market, since US businesses would be
tempted to hire low-wage workers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   US employers ``are going to lay off people because the jobs will
be picked up in China for 13 cents an hour,'' said Representative
Gerald D. Kleczka, Democrat of Wisconsin, unsuccessfully appealing
to his colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to defeat the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, we cannot compete with that,'' added Kleczka, who
represents industrial Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, joined by many Democrats, said the United
States had nothing to lose by granting permanent normal trade
status with China. The bill would end the yearly review of China's
access to US markets, and give Chinese products the same tariff
treatment given to nearly all US trading partners. It would also
ease China's accession into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that freezing out the Asian power would only
deny American firms trading opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Denying China permanent normal trading relations ``would make
for chaos _ perhaps cataclysm _ in our relations,'' said
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigam. ``It is
playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders also agreed Wednesday to
establish a commission that would monitor human rights in China, as
well as strengthen safeguards against surges in imports that could
hurt the US market. Human rights activists complain that the
commission is meaningless, since the US State Department already
does a comprehensive human rights report on China every year.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the commission, however, would give
political cover to some undecided members so they could vote for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   With a House vote scheduled for next week, Clinton is still more
than 40 votes short of the 218 needed for passage. But the
president, who has been personally involved in the White House's
aggressive lobbying effort, appears to be gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that the president is probably feeling pretty
confident, given the numbers today,'' said Representative Richard
E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetets, who was officially undecided
until he cast his ``yea'' vote Wednesday in the Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation still remains fluid, but we do beleive we will
be successful next week,'' US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is gathering an unlikely set of supporters who could
well push it through the House. Previously undecided,
Representative Jose Serrano, Democrat of New York and a longtime
advocate of organized labor, said in an interview Wednesday that he
will vote for the package.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of some other Democrats, Serrano said he
thought his vote would give him more ammunition in his fight to
loosen trade restrictions with Cuba, where human rights violations
have been used to justify the US trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Other undecided Democrats are likely to vote for the bill
because they want to help the president score a legacy-building
victory in his waning months in office, Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Also notable is the absence of a Republican movement to deny
Clinton a victory for its own sake. The president was embarrassed
last year, for example, when the Senate refused to approve a ban on
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the issue of trade with China, pro-business Republicans
are jumping on board with their New Democratic foes. Partisan
politics have not even entered the debate, unusual in this
post-impeachment Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those marvelous moments when we are working
together, hand in hand, for something that is positive for the
world,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   And while that may not represent a permanent rapprochement
between Capitol Hill and the White House, the Republicans are
softening a bit in the last months of the Clinton era, said Neal.
``It's the seven-years, six-months factor that is driving the
psychology of their position,'' he said.

<P>
   The recent film title, ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' captures a
common Western attitude. We tend to see the continent as a mythic
place of romantic dreams _ of exotic adventures, lost ancestors and
awesome creatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, of course, Africans face the same issues of
scarcity and incentives that affect everyone else. The continent's
natural abundance and human poverty simply raise the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, delegates from around the world met to consider
revisions to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species, or CITES, the treaty governing trade in endangered
species. One of the hottest issues was what to do about ivory. Four
southern African nations _ Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and
Zimbabwe _ wanted permission to sell their stockpiles of ivory,
amassed mostly from culling herds of elephants in their national
parks. They would plow the revenue back into conservation programs.
Vehemently opposed by Kenya, the southern African effort failed.
CITES will take up the issue again in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists take two distinct approaches to the problem of
preserving elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Neoclassical analysis starts from the assumption that elephants
are ``open-access resources'' like fish in the ocean _ available to
anyone for the taking. Governments regulate access by locking up
the elephants and forbidding poaching. Neoclassical models take the
legal regime and the incentives of poachers (to make as much money
as possible) more or less for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional approaches, by contrast, emphasize the social and
legal context. They explore how the structure of property rights
might be changed to encourage people to protect elephants. While
institutional economists realize that elephants can't be treated
like cows, they look for ways to make them similarly valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In the March issue of The American Economic Review, Michael
Kremer and Charles Morcom offer an ingenious neoclassical model for
elephant conservation. They start by noting that the ivory from
elephants (or the horn from rhinos) isn't like fish. It can be
stored indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   That means that it is possible to speculate in ivory _ to
stockpile it if you think the price will go up. The result can be a
death spiral for the species. ``If some people go out and poach a
lot of elephants, and everyone thinks that the elephants are going
to be extinct and there's not going to be any more ivory, that can
induce speculation on ivory prices,'' explains Kremer, of Harvard
University and the Brookings Institution. ``And that speculation on
ivory prices can induce more people to go poach. So you get the
possibility of self-reinforcing expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic review's paper offers two policy prescriptions that
might counter the problem. Both use the size of the elephant
population as a trigger. A government can say that if the number of
elephants drops below a certain level, it will crack down on
poachers, presumably with Draconian penalties. Then, says Kremer,
everybody knows that elephants will not become extinct ``and
therefore you don't get into this bad, self-fulfilling trap.''
</P>
<P>
   But if people do not believe the government can stop poachers,
the authorities can block speculation a different way. A government
can build up a large stockpile of ivory and threaten to dump it on
the market if the elephant population drops too low, or if the
price rises too high. That would in theory depress the price and
stop the death spiral. This approach could also be taken by a
nongovernmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   For all its cleverness, this neoclassical scheme does not
consider why people poach or whether elephants must be open-access
resources. Institutional approaches do. They start from two facts:
Elephants are a natural resource, attracting tourists and providing
meat, hides and ivory, and, they are also pests, trampling villages
and destroying crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This philosophy recognizes that poor rural people living with
wild animals have no incentive to conserve them without having
clear user rights and receiving tangible benefits from them,''
write Urs P. Kreuter and Randy T. Simmons in a paper published in
``Elephants and Whales: Resources for Whom?,'' a 1994 collection
edited by Kreuter and Milton M.R. Freeman. Poaching rates, they
observe, ``seem to be a function of the proportion of local
residents receiving benefits from wildlife management.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutional experiments that give local people a financial
stake in wildlife have had some striking successes, particularly in
Zimbabwe. There, the government in the mid-1980s began the Communal
Areas Program for Indigenous Resources, better known as Campfire.
The program gave local districts wildlife-management authority in
communal areas outside the national parks. In some cases, the local
districts devolved control further, down to groups as small as 200
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose ``was to get away from the idea of having these
island preserves, and to try and expand the geographic area over
which we could implement wildlife conservation,'' says Kreuter, a
Zimbabwean now teaching at Texas A&AMP;M University. To do that, he
said, the rural people who faced ruin if elephants wrecked their
grain bins, houses, or crops ``had to have economic income
associated with the wildlife; otherwise they just considered it to
be a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers who reap benefits from wildlife will be less likely to
shoot elephants that threaten their crops and more likely to police
poachers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Campfire, the local authorities worked with outside
experts to determine, for instance, that the area could maintain a
sustainable elephant population by hunting two elephants a year.
Residents would then contract with a safari operator and split the
fee of around $25,000 an elephant paid by the hunter. In most
cases, the villagers also got the meat from the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   But even such innovative economic thinking has its limits. Both
neoclassical and institutional conservation models share an
underlying assumption: that the government respects the rule of law
and the goal of conservation. In Zimbabwe, however, that assumption
has become shaky. Robert Mugabe's increasingly authoritarian rule
is destroying the nation's wildlife programs.
</P>
<P>
   The national government is recentralizing wildlife management,
and the Campfire programs are breaking down. ``They're taking that
authority away from the local community,'' Kreuter said. ``So the
local communities feel, `We're not getting anything out of this, so
why should we tolerate this species? We need to get rid of it.'''

COMMENTARY: DO YOU FEEL LUCKY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, has
been warning for some time that the stock market is dangerously
overvalued, that it's a bubble that is bound to burst, and more
likely sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who strongly favors Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax
cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus,
has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin
that could lead to a recession. He said he sold his own stocks
about two years ago so he would be able ``to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one signal.
</P>
<P>
   The other signal came Monday when Bush told the nation that the
key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow
working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security
taxes in the very same stock market that Lindsey, at the moment,
wants no part of.
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering this can get confusing. It's as difficult in its way
as picking winners in the market, or figuring the odds at the craps
table in Atlantic City or Vegas. Do you feel lucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is
indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a
non-guaranteed, non-indexed system that's based on the luck of the
stock market,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for
America's Future, a progressive policy organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush's bet is right _ that over the next several years
the stock market will do better than most other investments _ there
would still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at
retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, by definition, has winners and losers, even in
the best of times. ``You could have pretty good returns in the
market on average,'' said Hickey, ``but with a large number of
individuals doing very poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also have two people working side by side, making
the same money in a job, and then one retires at a time the stock
market is flush and the other retires a couple of years later when
the stock market is crashing and people are losing their shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Bush's
plan _ the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have
been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers
of Bush and other politicians, just begging them to steer some of
the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their
way.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from
this welfare scheme for the not-so-idle rich.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, the Republicans have had it in for Social Security
since its inception. The historian William Manchester wrote about
the GOP's desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation: ``On
radio spots, actors hired by the Republican National Committee
revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number _
as though there were any other way to to keep track of Social
Security accounts _ and perpetrated the hoax that people would be
fingerprinted.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, party
leaders called for the repeal of Social Security. And nearly four
decades later, Bush's fellow Texan, Sen. Phil Gramm, could be
quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits
for the elderly:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are 80-year-olds. Most people don't have the luxury of
living to be 80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to be a new kind of Republican, a new kind of
conservative, a man who masks his party's traditionally harsh
policies with a winning smile. Oh, he's a charmer.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely at what he is saying: ``First, we must not
change Social Security for those now retired or nearing retirement.
Let me put this plainly. For those on Social Security or close to
receiving it, nothing will change. Government has made a
commitment, and you have made your plans. These promises will be
honored.''
</P>
<P>
   So those who are retired, or close to being retired, are safe.
The rest of you, as far as I can tell, should look out.  &QL;

CELLUCCI PICK FOR STATE ETHICS PANEL QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A member of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission
resigned Wednesday, after the Globe revealed that the commission's
decisions were vulnerable to legal challenge because Governor Paul
Cellucci had appointed too many Republicans to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci acknowledged his staff did not check the party
affiliation of his most recent appointment to the panel, Boston
attorney J. Owen Todd. Todd resigned by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Todd has offered to solve the dilemma and we're going to
reluctantly accept because the statute is pretty clear that we
cannot have a third Republican as one of our appointees to the
commission,'' said a source close to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the legal status of the commission caught
the Cellucci administration off guard and surfaced at a delicate
time for the panel, which has several cases to decide, including a
recently expanded investigation of Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift.
</P>
<P>
   State law says only two of the three gubernatorial appointees to
the five-member commission can be from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci named Todd to the five-member commission in March, and
said his staff assumed Todd was a Democrat, because he was named to
the Superior Court bench in the 1980s by former Democratic Governor
Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone thought he was a Republican but they
should have checked,'' Cellucci said. ``It's a mistake and we've
got to straighten it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Birtwell also said Cellucci regretted having Todd singled out
because of a mistake committed by the gubernatorial staff. ``Judge
Todd has done absolutely nothing wrong and yet this error has
brought attention to him,'' Birtwell said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Globe checked registration records for Cellucci's
appointees, and found that all three were from the GOP, legal
scholars and former commission members said any decisions made by
the commission were open to challenge based on the violation of the
law regarding appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Carlson, spokeswoman for the Ethics Commission, said Todd
took part in a commission meeting April 19. She said
confidentiality requirements did not allow her to say whether Todd
voted on any matters before the commission but conceded that any
votes in which Todd took part may be invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, in place since the late 1970s, enforces the
state's conflict of interest law for state and local officials
across Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission generally meets behind closed doors. But
sources have said that the agency decided to widen a probe of Swift
at about the same time of the April commission meeting in which
Todd took part.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Swift asked the commission to review her use of a
State Police helicopter for personal use. But the Globe reported
last month that the commission had broadened its investigation in
order to scrutinize Swift's use of State House staff to move her
personal residence and perform baby-sitting duties and other
personal chores.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and the secretary of state, who are
Democrats, are also given appointees to the commission. Secretary
of State William F. Galvin has yet to make an appointment; with
Owen's resignation, the panel now has three members.
</P>
<P>
   The members include chairman Augustus F. Wagner Jr. and Stephen
E. Moore, Cellucci's other two Republican appointees, and Edward D.
Rapacki, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment Cellucci faces over the Todd appointment comes
close on the heels of a successful legal malpractice claim against
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Cape Cod jury awarded $1.3 million in penalties and
interest to Judith Meyer, a Centerville woman who convinced a jury
that Wagner was negligent in making sure that her former husband
fulfilled the terms of her 1989 divorce settlment.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci defended Wagner Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malpractice doesn't mean you're not ethical, it means a
mistake might have been made,'' Cellucci said. ``Justice Wagner is
a highly repsected former Superiour Court judge. Nothing I've seen
in this malpractice case that I've seen has any impact on his
credentials as a fair, ethical jurist who's now heading up the
Ethics Commission.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Cuban-Americans plan to outline stance on Elian Gonzalez
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Reemberto Rodriguez is right, a lot of people think
he's a right-wing nut.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and other Cuban-Americans have been unfairly
stereotyped because of their opposition to the government's
handling of the Elian Gonzalez case. He said the rap on Cubans is
that they're extremist with a blind hatred of Fidel Castro who have
created a ``Banana Republic'' in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He and a dozen other metro Atlanta Cuban-Americans want to
dispel the stereotypes and inject what they say is logic into the
debate about Elian. They've formed a group called Concerned
Americans of Cuban Heritage. On Sunday, they plan to outline the
legal reasons they say support the idea that Elian should live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Andino, a founder of the group, said he hopes to persuade
native-born Americans that the Elian Gonzalez case does not _ or
should not _ revolve around parental rights. He invited the public
to a meeting this coming Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put up specific facts,'' he said. ``It's not
that we're nuts. It's not that we're Castro haters. It's not that
we're intolerant.'' Andino, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of
Lawrenceville, left Cuba when he was 3. He said his group has about
a dozen members. Most are middle-aged businessmen, managers and
executives. They left Cuba when they were children or were born in
the United States to Cuban parents. Atlanta's major Cuban
organization, the Cuban Club, is made up mainly of older immigrants
who left Cuba after Castro took power in 1959, said Isabel Frank,
president of the Cuban Club, a social and cultural group that has
not taken a stand on Elian. She said about 7,000 Cubans live in
metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Andino, an engineering manager for an Atlanta pharmaceutical
company, said native-born Americans who say Elian's father should
take him home do not realize how dire life is in Cuba even though
the Cold War focused the national consciousness on the perils of
communism for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like `We won the Cold War. Great. Let's move on.' ''
Sara J. Gonzalez, Cuban immigrant who is president of the Atlanta
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the gulf worries her. So do
finger-wagging Cuban protesters shouting ``Communist!'' to those
who disagree with them. ``There`s no gray areas in their
politics,'' she said.

STUDY SHOWS INCREASE IN TOBACCO ADS AIMED AT CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cigarette makers, reneging on a landmark pledge to
stop targeting children, have drastically increased spending on
magazine ads aimed at youths, according to a study released
Wednesday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Prompting new cries for Congress to crack down on the tobacco
industry and state prosecutors to reopen their historic case
against the cigarette makers, the study indicates the industry has
shifted much of its marketing budget into youth-oriented magazines
after agreeing to no longer promote cigarettes on billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts study compared cigarette advertising
expenditures in magazines before and after the industry's historic
settlement with 46 states, focusing on 19 popular magazines with
more than 15 percent of their readership between the ages of 12 and
17. Fifteen percent was the level used by the Food and Drug
Administration in its efforts to regulate tobacco. Magazines in
that category include Rolling Stone, Glamour, Sports Illustrated
and Motor Trend.
</P>
<P>
   Examples included a Rolling Stone issue with teenage singing
star Brittney Spears on the front cover and a full-page Marlboro ad
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1999, cigarette makers spent $119.9
million on advertising, much of it on brands most popular with
young smokers, in magazines with a significant percentage of teen
readers, the study found. That is almost $30 million more than was
spent in the same magazines in the corresponding period before the
settlement, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see multimillion-dollar increases in magazines with
youth readership, it's disturbing,'' said Timothy J. Shea, chief of
the public protection bureau for state Attorney General Tom Reilly.
``We're going to look at it closely and see how it comports with
the Master Settlement Agreement'' between the states and cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   The state's public health commissioner, Dr. Howard Koh, cited
the study Wednesday in issuing a written request to the major
tobacco companies to adopt ``childproof'' cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have childproof caps on Tylenol and aspirin,'' Connolly
said. ``We should have childproof advertising from the tobacco
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers insisted the study's findings were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that a tobacco company can do that won't
receive criticism from the special interest groups that have their
own political agenda,'' said Mark Smith, a spokesman for the
Kentucky-based Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Williamson has pulled all advertising from magazines
with a significant percentage of readers under 21, Smith said,
basing its decisions on demographic data provided by magazine
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris USA, another tobacco company, carefully researches
publications before choosing to place advertisements where they
reach adult smokers but don't bombard youth, said company spokesman
Tom Ryan. The company, which makes Marlboro, will no longer
advertise on the back cover of any magazine, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, antitobacco activists said the Massachusetts
findings show that cigarette makers are undermining a crucial
provision of the $246 billion settlement they reached with 46
states in 1998. In the pact, the tobacco companies agreed they
would not appeal to minors.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors, in response to the findings, said they were
considering taking the industry back to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of advertising destroys our efforts to protect our
children,'' said Greg Connolly, director of the Massachusetts
Tobacco Control Program, at a news conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said the surge of magazine advertising appears to be geared
increasingly toward black and Hispanic girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Targeting those groups raises very, very serious concerns,''
Connolly said. ``It's almost like a bomb being planted in many
urban communities, where advertising like this will result in
increased smoking rates among ethnic females 10 to 15 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's release coincided with a new push by Senator Edward
M. Kennedy for a law permitting the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate cigarettes as drug-delivery devices. He faces fierce
opposition from Republican leaders, who last year engineered the
defeat of a similar effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new evidence is further proof of how essential it is for
Congress to grant the FDA broad authority to regulate the marketing
of tobacco products,'' Kennedy said. ``If the FDA's rule on tobacco
were in effect today, this behavior by the tobacco companies would
be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate study released Wednesday by the American Legacy
Foundation found more than 70 percent of teenagers in 1999 had seen
cigarette advertisements often enough to notice them and understand
their content.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements for Marlboro, the favorite brand of young
smokers, reached 89 percent of teenagers, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The studies used commercial marketing surveys to assess the
popularity of various magazines among young readers. Cigarette
makers say those numbers don't represent who really reads the
publications.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton used the studies to call on Congress to pass
strict tobacco laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA's hands should not remain tied by Congressional
inaction,'' Clinton said.

ADVERTISING: PROMOTING BUFFALO'S CLIMATE AS JUST RIGHT FOR
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its shrinking population, declining industrial base and
notoriously cold winters, Buffalo has had its share of image
problems. But local officials and civic boosters insist that the
city and its environs do not deserve their unfortunate reputation.
Thursday, they are announcing a major promotional campaign aimed at
proving that the climate upstate is just fine, for people and for
businesses, too.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is sponsored by the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a
not-for-profit economic development marketing consortium founded
last year to encourage businesses to invest in an area comprising
the eight westernmost counties of New York and the Niagara
peninsula of southern Ontario. Nearly 70 participants, including
local municipalities and private businesses like Key Bank, HSBC
Bank, the Buffalo Bills and Moog Inc., an upstate manufacturer of
motion-control components, have joined, as has one Canadian
participant, the Ontario-based Canadian Niagara Power Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their contributions, the money needed for the
first year _ about $5 million _ is already in hand, according to
Tom Kucharski, the president and chief executive of Buffalo
Niagara. That is part of $27 million committed by Buffalo Niagara's
members, three-quarters of it from private companies, according to
Ted M. Levine, chairman of Development Counsellors International,
the public relations firm representing Buffalo Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   That is a large amount to spend on marketing by a community
development organization seeking to create jobs. ``I cannot think
of another community _ especially a moderately sized one _ that has
even come close to raising that kind of sum,'' said Mark
Waterhouse, an economic development consultant who was formerly
chairman of the American Economic Development Council, an
organization for economic development professionals.
</P>
<P>
   With a goal of 50,000 new jobs and $1 billion in new investment
over the next five years, it is also one of the most ambitious
development plans put forward in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to put forward in a focused way all that we
have to offer,'' said Kucharski, who came to Buffalo Niagara from
the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. in eastern
Pennsylvania, where his efforts as president helped attract 18,000
jobs over four years. But the job is bigger in Buffalo-Niagara, he
said, not only because of the greater size of the region _ 2.2
million residents as opposed to Lehigh Valley's 600,000 _ but also
because of the highly negative feelings about the area held by
strangers and natives alike.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do people in general have a ``terrible image of the
Buffalo-Niagara region,'' so do people living in and around the
city, many of whom have ``incredibly low self-esteem,'' said Doug
Bean, a managing partner at Eric Mower &AMP; Associates, the agency
based in Syracuse whose Buffalo team is handling the Buffalo
Niagara account. In addition to aiming at businesses outside the
region, he has made ``internal'' marketing a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people who live here are down on the area, especially
service and hospitality workers, that can have a big impact on
visitors who interact with them,'' he said. ``So we're going to use
this campaign to re-educate our own constituency as well as
anything else we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the recipient, the message Buffalo Niagara will be
delivering will be the same, a simple one that tracks the
campaign's three-word slogan: ``available. productive. people.''
</P>
<P>
   Print ads and broadcast spots will feature residents of the area
extolling local advantages, like the high concentration of college
students, affordable housing, low office rents, and the fact that
the work force in the area is ranked ninth in the country in
production output per wage dollar spent. Not to mention, ``summers
that are just beautiful'' and winters that are ``not nearly as
snowy as people think,'' according to Kucharski (``More sun than
Atlanta, less rain than Raleigh,'' say some of the ads).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will also be aimed at specific industries. Those
include information technology, for which there is already
considerable infrastructure, according to Kucharski; advanced
medical technology, which is already strong in the region, and call
centers and other support services for financial institutions or
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Media buying is to begin later this month, Bean said, with the
rollout of the campaign set for the fall. He anticipates devoting
approximately 85 percent of the $5 million or so first-year budget
to national advertising on cable television aimed at business
viewers on outlets like CNN and CNBC, as well as print ads in The
Wall Street Journal and sponsorship announcements on National
Public Radio. The remaining 15 percent will go to local television
and radio commercials and to billboard, newspaper and transit
advertising in metropolitan Buffalo. There is also a Web site:
www.buffaloniagara.org.
</P>
<P>
   The mix sounds right to Waterhouse, the consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this plan, Buffalo has a chance to become another
renaissance city,'' he said.

<P>
   MACY, Neb. _ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the
Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either. Instead,
the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the
school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first
week of May.
</P>
<P>
   This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate
that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of
the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in
school.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely successful. In the math class taught by
Chessmore, for example, only five of the 36 registered students
were showing up by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a country used to stories about struggling public
schools, many of those in Indian country stand out. Last year, the
average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the
15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half
scored below the 10th percentile. Fewer than half the students in
grades three through 12 came to take the test, Chessmore said. And
while this year's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of
a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students
enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed
in Indian schools around the country. On average, 36 percent to 51
percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to
the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any
ethnic group. Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to
college, and most do not finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest
rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of
entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native
American Scholarship Fund. ``Whatever test you're looking at,
Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th
percentile. The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent.
Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 _ no
geometry, no trig _ and people wonder why they're failing out of
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups
like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing
states and the federal government for more money for academics and
crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support
for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave
them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school
and achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert
itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and
a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos. But
it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
</P>
<P>
   Some reservation schools have done well and others, including
the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago. But
many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian
teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and
overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of
government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the
relationship between being academically rigorous and being
successful on the reservation. These difficulties only compound the
isolation and poverty of reservation life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the future of the tribe,'' said Denine Parker,
an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where
60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed. ``I see too
many kids not getting an education. What happens to them? All you
have to do is walk Main Street and then you know.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, state and federal officials are responding.
President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest
increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs _
$1.2 billion _ which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to
train 1,000 Indian teachers. Currently, most teachers in
reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are
extremely high, and many believe the teachers do not understand
Indian culture and learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   And in August, a task force Clinton created will present plans
to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90
percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is that what the government is doing says
it's OK to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of
external affairs for the American Indian College Fund. ``Before the
philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically
educate him to be a white person. Now there's a recognition that
the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important
to them being good students.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of
Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have schools that are literally falling down around the
heads of Indian children,'' Beaulieu said. ``In the 1990s we had
the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as
existed 20 years before.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state
to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force
to improve state policy. The Legislature passed a bill this session
changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little
taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they
cannot raise the required amount from property taxes. The bill was
vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago
school districts plan to sue the state.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Johanns, said that
while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he
also believed ``it is time for the state and federal government to
step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is
hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education
expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation
communities,'' said Christensen. ``In two of our reservation
schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors, and in
one case those two kids should not be graduating. They are two
18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save
their soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north
of Macy, said ``some parents see formal education as important,
others see just being with the family as education. We have parents
who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a
haircut in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out
of 26 students in her largest class, sent her daughter to sixth
grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa. Recently, her daughter
returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was ``way ahead of the
sixth graders here,'' Parker said. ``If I never would have sent her
away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at Omaha Nation, Chessmore has made many improvements,
from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as
superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help
girls who have babies stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   He started a training program for Indian teachers that will
increase their numbers from 4 to 20, made the curriculum more
culturally relevant, and has applied for money for a social
services center with probation officers and a mental health
counselor. He received a grant for a reading program for elementary
students, which has produced ``fourth graders who are reading
better than half our high school.'' And he is lobbying the
telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students'
families without them.
</P>
<P>
   To build trust, Chessmore, unlike most superintendents and
teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his seven children at
Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students. He and
his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families.
</P>
<P>
   He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell from
31 percent to about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member,
scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school. In a Buick
with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Oldman
visited one boy's father and the trailer where the other boy lived
with his grandmother. He scaled a chalky ridge called Million
Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees,
scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an
algae-choked creek strewn with old tires.. The truants were nowhere
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are smart _ they arrange tree branches so they can
scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,'' Oldman said.
He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were
chronically truant, and the school sometimes tried to get their
welfare benefits cut. ``Some parents are really concerned, but some
of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the
kids to school.''
</P>
<P>
   One chronic truant was Janice &UR;  &LR; Baxter's 16-year-old son. She
would take him to school in the morning, but said that ``in the
afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends.'' Baxter
said he kept ``coming home drunk'' and she sent him to a treatment
center.
</P>
<P>
   Some students show promise but don't follow through. This year,
it looked like Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would
graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to come to school no more,'' said Jason,
18.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been successes.
</P>
<P>
   One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate.
But a few weeks ago, Chessmore refused to let his daughter double
date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate.
She did.
</P>
<P>
   And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and
was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks,
turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her
she would have to help pay the bills if she wasn't in school. Now
she'll graduate and plans to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally realized what I should be doing,'' Adrienne wrote in
a class essay, ``getting my education.''

 &HT;    Deal lets cell phones call up a Coke
 &HT;    By Kathy Brister
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola is betting consumer pockets are as likely to
carry cell phones as coins.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Atlanta-based beverage maker Wednesday signed a
$100 million deal to fit vending machines with modems allowing a
wireless phone user to dial a Coke. The agreement is with Marconi
PLC, a London information-technology firm that employs 30 in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The technology already is in vending machines on some university
campuses and in Hong Kong, but it could be another 18 months before
Atlantans see it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. A thirsty consumer walks up to a Coke
machine. It looks like any other vending machine, although it may
have a screen flashing a Coke ad or the latest sports scores. Using
a number posted on the machine, the consumer dials in, enters a
code and a soda drops out.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, that order goes into a database managed by
Marconi, which sends the information to a bottler that processes
the order and likely sends it on to the consumer's cell phone
carrier. The transaction shows up on next month's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The technology also works with smart cards, but conventional
wisdom is that U.S. consumers will ``leapfrog'' the debit-card-like
technology now popular in Europe and reach right for cell phones,
said Tim Garnett, Coca-Cola's director of engineering development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering consumers a cashless option, the
technology makes inventory easier for bottlers, Garnett said.
Bottlers can connect to a machine remotely to check its stock, its
sales and whether it's working properly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such efficiencies are important to the soft drink business,
which sells about 13 percent of its products through vending
machines, said John Sicher, editor of trade publication Beverage
Digest. But luring consumers is the key, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Trey Paris said the novelty and usefulness of the
machines is designed to draw in consumers and said the company
won't use them to remotely raise soft-drink prices.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the company came under fire from consumers angered
by reports that Coca-Cola was studying ways to remotely change
vending machine prices according to weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has virtually limitless applications, but
Coca-Cola would never apply it in a way that would take advantage
of consumers,'' Paris said.

U.N. DISCUSSES HOW TO TRY SIERRA LEONE'S REBEL LEADER
</HEADLINE>
   (With SIERRA-LEONE) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Discussions began here Wednesday on whether
legal options exist to bring Foday Sankoh, the Sierra Leone rebel
leader, to justice, because no international tribunal has automatic
jurisdiction over him.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front established itself as
one of the most savage guerrilla movements _ chopping off citizens'
limbs and destroying villages _ won a place in the Freetown
government last year in return for an end to his violent campaign
against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. Thus, diplomats said, the
responsibility is on Sierra Leone, which holds the rebel leader
prisoner, to make the first decisions on his future.
</P>
<P>
   Will it try another reconciliation with the warlord, whose
troops control diamond-mining areas, or will Sankoh be declared an
outlaw and turned over to a criminal court?
</P>
<P>
   Key to Sankoh's future may be President Charles Taylor of
Liberia, a beneficiary of diamonds supplied by the Sierra Leone
rebels. Some officials in Sierra Leone say Taylor appears to have
found an alternative to lead the rebels, Sankoh's former field
commander, Sam Bockarie, and could jettison Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting a decision by Kabbah and fearful that threats of
a war crimes trial could endanger more than 200 U.N. hostages held
by rebels, many U.N. officials and human rights groups say Sankoh
should not be absolved in any way.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which was not involved in the peace
agreement signed last year in Lome, Togo, took the unusual step of
distancing itself publicly from the amnesty for Sankoh that was
part of that accord. Secretary- General Kofi Annan has said
repeatedly throughout the current hostage crisis _ in which
Sankoh's forces have held as many as 500 U.N. forces _ that the
rebel leader would have to be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said
governments were obliged to see Sankoh prosecuted. ``Once he is in
international custody,'' Brody said, ``there is a duty under the
Geneva Conventions to bring him to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, who has been active in efforts to try other leaders
outside their countries, including Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile
and Hissen Habre of Chad, said there were four possibilities in
Sankoh's case.

   ``One, probably the best, would be to create an international
tribunal on the order of the tribunals for the former Yugoslavia
and Rwanda,'' he said. The other possibilities are creating a
regional tribunal to handle the case, sending Sankoh to another
country for trial or trying him in Sierra Leone, Brody said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally it is better to try people in the country where their
crimes were committed, where the victims are located, where justice
would ultimately be more meaningful,'' Brody said. ``But given the
unsettled conditions in Sierra Leone and the passions that are
manifesting themselves in the calls by some for mob justice or
lynch justice, it might be better to have him tried by a tribunal
that is perceived to be neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   At the International Peace Academy, a research organization with
close ties to the United Nations, the president, David Malone, said
this is the kind of case for which an International Criminal Court
has been created. But the court, which an international treaty
established two years ago, is bogged down in negotiations over how
it will function, with the United States demanding immunity for its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Leading nations, Malone said, have not made the case against
Sankoh clear enough to be heard in Freetown and among those U.N.
officials, some working in Africa, who are inclined to patch up
relations with the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council has consistently failed telegraph clearly
what its approach to Sankoh on criminal responsibility is going to
be,'' said Malone, a Canadian diplomat. ``The real dilemma is that
there seems to be a split of opinion in United Nations circles on
the Sankoh case. On the one hand, you have people who believe that
somehow the Lome agreement needs to be put back together again and
that in order to do so Foday Sankoh remains a necessary and
legitimate partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree. Foday Sankoh and his senior lieutenants need to be
on notice that their personal responsibility for war crimes isn't
abstract, that there will be practical consequences.''  &QL;

DO CARDINAL RULES APPLY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Stanford is the overwhelming favorite to repeat
as the NCAA women's tennis champion. Yet last year, the Cardinal
traveled to Gainesville, Fla., to face overwhelming favorite
Florida for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal won, even with an injured player.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA expected to reach Florida last year, but the Bruins lost at
home. Pepperdine is this year's host, but the Waves aren't
participating because LSU defeated them last week.
</P>
<P>
   As the championships begin today, everyone wonders if this
year's tournament will offer any new surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, you have to be good and lucky,'' Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Cardinal (27-0) is good. Top singles player
Marissa Irvin, from Harvard-Westlake High School in Los Angeles,
has lost once all season _ in her last match against Fresno State.
Brennan said Irvin's consistency has instilled confidence in her
teammates, so much so that her defeat didn't cause anyone else to
falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls respect her and look up to her and think she walks
on water,'' Brennan said without jest. ``It's interesting how they
revere her.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Laura Granville and Lauren Kalvaria could play
No. 1 singles almost anywhere else. Here, they're depth.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford challenges the rest of the field to pull off something
wild. Northwestern has the first shot , but no one's giving the
Wildcats much of a chance because they upset Tulsa to get here.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves UCLA on Friday, provided the Bruins beat Texas today
at 5 p.m. That's a story in itself. The Bruins were ousted by the
Longhorns in a regional last year at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet UCLA, which defeated Texas 5-4 earlier this season
at Austin, wants to avenge last year's loss !ital!and get another
shot at Stanford, which defeated the Bruins 7-2 this season.
Stanford faces Northwestern today at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every match is tough, and some teams can really get up for
playing the NCAAs when they don't have anything to lose,'' UCLA
coach Stella Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's USC, which almost didn't make it after the Trojans
freshmen struggled to adjust to the pressures of the NCAAs. The
Trojans open at 8 a.m. today against the same LSU team that shocked
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will play a lot more relaxed out there Thursday than we did
(Sunday),'' USC coach Richard Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   The matches begin at 8 a.m. and continue at three-hour intervals
at the Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center and on lower courts around the
campus. The quarterfinals are Friday, the semifinals Saturday, and
the championship match is Sunday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the five-day individual championships begin. The draw
will be held Saturday. Irvin will be favored to win the title
before she embarks on a pro career.
</P>
<P>
   But strange things can happen. Irvin lost in the final last
year. &QL;

   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ Congress on Wednesday took its first
step toward approving a trade bill designed to change the terms of
the United States' relationship with China, as a House and a Senate
committee each resoundingly endorsed the measure in major test
votes. Half a dozen previously uncommitted House Republicans and
Democrats announced they would support the legislation granting
China permanent normal trading privileges. Administration officials
and congressional backers cautiously said they now believe they are
close to havingcollected the 218 votes needed for passage in the
House, but they are still locked in a heated battle to put the
measure over the top. By Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger.

   SIERRA-LEONE (FREETOWN, Sierra Leone) _ Foday Sankoh, the rebel
leader who vanished nine days ago after dealing humiliating blows
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in this West African country, was
captured here Wednesday in a bizarre incident outside his abandoned
house. Sankoh, who was last seen at his house shortly after his
bodyguards killed 19 demonstrators outside the compound last week,
returned in the apparent hope of retrieving some possessions before
turning himself in to the Nigerian Embassy, witnesses said.
Instead, a local man reported Sankoh's presence to an armed
supporter of the government, who shot the rebel leader in the leg
and arrested him, witnesses said. Stripped naked, Sankoh was taken
to a pro-government militia, which quickly turned him over to the
government. By Norimitsu Onishi.

<P>
   The crew of a U.S. Coast Guard cutter has rescued 44 Haitians
and two freelance journalists working for The New York Times from a
sailboat en route to Florida, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Silvia Olvera, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, said the
cutter Forward intercepted the boat on Sunday night about 18 miles
northwest of Tortuga, Haiti. It was trying to sail from Haiti to
the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officers boarded the boat in international waters
and followed it into Bahamian territory. There, officers from the
cutter determined that the 35-foot boat had to be evacuated because
it was slowly sinking, Petty Officer Olvera said.
</P>
<P>
   The 39 Haitian men, five Haitian women and the two American
journalists were offered food, water and medical attention and then
were turned over to Bahamian officials on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Finkel, a reporter, and Chris Anderson, a photographer,
were on assignment for The New York Times Magazine to chronicle the
kind of journey a growing number of Haitians are making to America,

2 MEN INDICTED FOR MURDER IN BIRMINGHAM CHURCH BOMBING CASE

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Nearly 37 years after what may have been the
most heinous attack of the civil rights era, the authorities here
charged two longtime suspects with murder on Wednesday in the 1963
bombing that killed four black girls at Birmingham's 16th Street
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, both of whom were
affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and have been considered suspects
for decades, turned themselves in on Wednesday morning after being
indicted by a state grand jury on Tuesday. They are being held in
the Jefferson County jail here without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has ever been tried in the case,
and that was not until 1977, 14 years after the bombing. He was
convicted of murder, sentenced to life and died in prison in 1985.
Herman Cash, another man named as a suspect in early FBI case
files, died in 1994 without ever being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators reopened their probe of the bombing in
1996, encouraged by recent successful prosecutions of other
decades-old civil rights killings. But they declined on Wednesday
to discuss the evidence they have gathered against Blanton, 61, of
Birmingham, and Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Cherry's relatives, including an ex-wife and a
granddaughter, have said they told grand jurors that Cherry had
boasted of participating in the bombing. But there is little
information about what additional new evidence, if any,
investigators may have found to implicate either Cherry or Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the evidence at a news conference on Wednesday, Doug
Jones, the U.S. attorney here, would only say, ``We expect the
evidence today to be a good bit different than it would have been
36 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some witnesses have died and there have been no reports
of new physical evidence, prosecutors said on Wednesday that they
were optimistic about their chances to win convictions. ``The
witnesses that we have we believe are sufficient to sustain the
charge,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutions of Blanton and Cherry are the latest in a
series of dusty civil rights cases that have been reopened in
recent years as a Southern prosecutors of a new breed have come to
power, as new witnesses have come forward to relieve guilty
consciences, and as changing times and demographics have made it
easier to empanel jurors willing to convict whites for the murders
of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable case was the 1994 conviction of Byron de la
Beckwith for the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, a prominent
NAACP organizer in Mississippi. But there have been numerous others
in several states, and Mississippi officials are now delving again
into the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers _ Andrew
Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham bombing holds a special place in civil rights
history because of the randomness of its violence, the sacredness
of its target and the innocence of its victims. The four girls _
Denise McNair, age 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and
Cynthia Wesley, all 14 _ died in a dressing room in the church
basement when the bomb detonated at 10:19 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 15,
1963. The bomb, apparently hidden under the church steps the night
before, blew the face of Jesus out of a stained glass window. The
bodies of the girls, dressed in white for an annual youth service,
were found beneath the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The church had been a center of civil rights activity in
Birmingham, a city that experienced some of the most violent
resistance of the day. Perhaps as much as any single act, the
bombing aroused public sentiment against Southern segregationists
and emboldened civil rights leaders to redouble their efforts. More
recently, the incident was the subject of Spike Lee's acclaimed
documentary, ``Four Little Girls.''

LAWYER DESCRIBES ASSAULT ON GIRL BY THIRD GRADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE AND MEADOW RUE MERRILL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST BATH, Maine _ The School Committee Wednesday refused to
disclose specifics about the suspension of five third-grade boys
accused of sexual harassment, but an attorney for the parents of
one alleged victim said the girl complained that two boys twice
pinned her to the ground while another boy simulated intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old girl complained to an adult playground supervisor
on each occasion, May 2 and 4, and was told simply to ``stay away
from the boys,'' said the lawyer, Richard Regan of Bath, who
represents the girl's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Regan said the child did not tell her parents of the recess
attacks because the boys had threatened her with ``physical
repercussions.'' He says he believes the parents learned of the
incidents only after West Bath School principal Catherine M. Folan
wrote a letter to third-grade parents May 5 about complaints of
harassment including lewd comments and physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The case raised eyebrows across the region because of the ages
of the children involved and because of the absence of details of
the alleged offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Chet Garrison, chairman of the School Committee, told
about two dozen parents and school staff gathered at a board
meeting that confidentiality laws prevent public release of
specific information about the children in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Folan suspended the boys last week for four to eight days. The
School Committee met privately with a lawyer Monday and is
reportedly considering whether to expel the boys.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged female victim has spoken twice with Sagadahoc County
sheriff's detectives, who are investigating whether the alleged
harassment warrants criminal charges. The girl also is receiving
counseling because of the alleged attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the girl was afraid to tell the parents;
she was threatened in some way,'' Regan said. ``The thing that
compounded it is that she did what she was told: Report anything to
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then it happened again.''
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Bob Young has said the school's investigation
into complaints of harassment found incidents of pinching,
inappropriate touching, and sexual comments. He did not mention the
simulated intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   However, the girl's account of serious harassment on the school
playground appears to have been corroborated by others. One of the
suspended boys, his mother said Wednesday, has admitted seeing a
girl pinned to the ground by four boys while another jumped on her.
The mother said the boy alerted a teacher but was told to ``mind
your own business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information (released to date) has suggested that what
we're talking about is poking . . . and saying a few naughty
words,'' Regan said Wednesday. ``Up until now, (the parents) were
very reluctant to say anything publicly about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan said he does not know exactly what the school found in its
investigation, what the daughter of his clients specifically told
the playground supervisor, and what might occur next.
</P>
<P>
   Folan declined to comment Wednesday. ``This deals with children,
and it is confidential. The whole situation is confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Feldman, an attorney for one of the suspended boys, said
the situation has been sensationalized by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any knowledge that anything terrible has
happened,'' Feldman said. ``If there are problems, address them and
get these boys back in school. The worst thing that could happen is
to leave them at home sitting in front of a television.''

A CAPTAIN, A COUPLE, A LAND DEAL, MURDER MOST FOUL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Italy, Fla, Pa.) By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   NEW YORK _ Capt. John Lau of the
U.S. Army, an officer with the South European Task Force stationed
in Italy, left behind his wife, three young children and the busy
affairs of his foreign posting to make a brisk two-day trip home to
New York four years ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among his reasons for the trip, Lau later told investigators,
were that he hoped to discuss a transfer with a general, deliver an
anniversary gift to some friends and pick up Chinese foods not
available in Vicenza, where he was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   But, investigators say, the most pressing matter that put Lau on
Delta Flight 73 to New York on May 22, 1996, was murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that during his 50-hour visit, Lau met with a
young couple he had defrauded in a land deal, beat them to death
and dumped their bodies into Newtown Creek, a brackish body of
water that divides Brooklyn and Queens. Then, say investigators for
the Brooklyn district attorney's office, he drove to the airport
the next day, boarded a flight to Italy and resumed his work for
the task force that responds to military emergencies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lau, whose discharge from the Army is pending,
returned to New York, this time to face charges in the murder of
the couple, Alexander Barone, 32, and Liane Barone, 29. He is being
held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, where many killings stem from drug dealing and
domestic disputes, investigators said that murders that arise from
white-collar crime are uncommon. A suspect who is a decorated Army
officer accused of committing the crime during a short furlough
from foreign soil is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the defendant and his background, and the
crime and the motive underlying it, makes it more unusual than
most,'' said Barry M. Schreiber, chief of the district attorney
office's homicide bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, 37, whose family lives in Brooklyn, has denied any murder
role. His lawyers have said that after an exhaustive four-year
inquiry, investigators have yet to uncover any eyewitnesses or
physical evidence, like fingerprints, that link Lau to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Gary Villanueva, said the defense would have no
comment until the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the Barones were discovered in the creek at 9 a.m.
on May 24, 1996, the Friday of a Memorial Day weekend. Initially,
the police thought they were robbery victims. Their wallets were
missing, as was any form of identification. They had been beaten
with a blunt instrument and their skulls were fractured.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were not identified for four days. But within a week,
investigators sought to interview Lau, the last person known to
have seen the couple alive. Robbery had become an unlikely motive,
investigators said. Someone had found the victims' wallets and had
mailed them to their address, with credit cards undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Local investigators and the Army's Criminal Investigation
Division began to pursue a new theory: that Lau had killed the
Barones to cover up his role in a Florida real estate deal in which
the Barones and others had been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   The deal dated from 1987, when Lau was in the Reserves and was
making his living as an independent real estate agent. He had
offered to help Barone, a friend from their days in the Reserve
Officers Training Corps at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, buy
a lot in a development known as Deep Creek, near Port Charlotte,
Fla. To help finance the deal, according to court records, Lau told
Barone he would lend him $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Lau never bought the land for the Barones, nor
did he lay out any money on their behalf. Several months later,
when he arranged for the Barones to resell the property to a family
in Queens, that too was a fictional transaction, papered over with
bogus documents that concealed that neither family had ever seen a
deed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Queens family, the Leongs, dutifully sent the Barones a
check for $224 every month as outlined in their installment plan.
Every month, to pay down their debt, the Barones sent a $200 check
of their own to Lau, even after he went on active duty in 1992 and
later was posted to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, the monthly payments continued. But in 1996,
when the Leongs tried to pay off their balance and secure the deed,
they discovered during a title search that the Barones had never
owned the property. They complained to the Barones, who in turn
called Lau in Italy. He promised, investigators say, to come to New
York in a few days to clear things up.
</P>
<P>
   Lau arrived at Kennedy Airport at 3:30 p.m. on May 22. The
following night he met the Barones for dinner and, he said, to drop
off some papers related to the sale. While they were upset at their
real estate problem, the couple were happy. Two days earlier,
Barone had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a
master's degree in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Lau told investigators that instead of going to dinner, they
went to his mother's house for a short time, and then the couple
asked him to accompany them to Shea Stadium to meet a friend in the
parking lot. The friend, whom the captain called Gene, was
preparing to visit Italy and wanted advice from someone who lived
there, recounted, and so they waited for him outside the stadium in
parked cars. But when Gene did not show up after several hours, Lau
said, at 1 a.m. he excused himself and returned to his mother's
house in the borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, who had no previous criminal record or history of violence,
has said someone else must have attacked the Barones after he left.
``Murder is outside of my scope of realm,'' he said at a 1999
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The police version is different. Gene does not exist, they say,
and was invented to explain the missing hours when the murders
occurred. They say that during those hours Lau, possibly acting
with someone else, killed the couple, put their bodies into their
red 1984 Trans Am and drove the car to the Metropolitan Avenue
bridge over Newtown Creek, where he dumped the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The car was found in Manhattan three weeks later, stained with
blood. Inside it was found a 15-inch-long metal ratchet that
investigators say may have been used in the murders. They say the
killings were premeditated, because the person who drove the car
after the crime appears to have been wearing gloves, according to a
forensic analysis of the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   In charging Lau, the office of Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn
district attorney, has cited injuries the captain had when he was
interviewed 12 days after the killings. They included a large
scratch across his back and a scab on his left shoulder that
investigators say are evidence he had been in a struggle. But the
captain said he had scratched his back in the shower and been hit
by falling plaster while making home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence consists of what prosecutors have
characterized as multiple inconsistencies in Lau's statements. He
initially denied that there was fraud in the land deal, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Lau recounted for investigators, he said he
and Mrs. Barone had discussed the Trans Am while waiting for Gene
outside Shea Stadium. The captain recalled complimenting Mrs.
Barone on the car's mint condition, and she had said of her
husband, ``He doesn't ever let me drive this car.'' Investigators
said Mrs. Barone would never have said such a thing, because she
had no driver's license and did not drive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lau was charged in federal court in Brooklyn in
connection with the land fraud, and during that case, Paul
Schoeman, an assistant U.S. attorney, put forward some of the
murder evidence. The captain ultimately pleaded guilty to mail
fraud, but steadfastly denied any role in the murder of the
Barones. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   As part of the captain's defense at a sentencing hearing, his
lawyer, Steven Brounstein, said any inconsistencies were an
insufficient foundation on which to build a murder case. Brounstein
said the lead investigator in the case, Bob Burton of the Brooklyn
district attorney's office, had sent out nearly 400 subpoenas for
evidence, but still there were no fingerprints, fiber evidence or
eyewitnesses to tie his client to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lau, at 5 feet 4 inches, was too small to have killed
both Barones at the same time. He argued that Lau had been caught
cutting corners in real estate deals before, but that when he had
disagreements with people he had merely paid back what he owed. The
$20,000 involved in this case, he said, was not enough to motivate
a murder.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Reena Raggi, who presided over the federal case, said
she did not believe Lau's account and sentenced him to 10 years in
prison, far above the 16 months suggested for mail fraud under
sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining her sentence, she said in court that she had been
persuaded that the captain had probably committed the murders. ``He
had more to lose than money,'' Raggi concluded. ``He had his
career.''

<P>
   Bombarded with pitches for new and different ways to invest
their savings, most people might conclude that the last thing the
world needs is another twist on owning stocks. Steven Wallman is
not one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, while the leaders of the mutual fund industry munch
shrimp and sip chardonnay at their annual gathering in Washington,
Wallman will be 15 miles away in Vienna, Va., plotting to take the
finger food out of their mouths. Wallman, a headstrong former
securities regulator with an appetite for reform, is increasingly
irritated by what he sees as the burdens the typical mutual fund
puts on shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Most funds are not worth owning, Wallman says, because they cost
too much, repeatedly fail to beat the market and frequently stick
shareholders with big tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   Funds set up to track market indexes solve some problems, but
they do not offer investors much choice or control of risk, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Wallman says he has found a better and, in many cases, cheaper
way for investors to create their own, customized baskets of
stocks, which he calls folios, and two months ago he started
selling them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in trying to harness Internet technology to
provide investors an alternative to mutual funds and brokerage
accounts. In San Francisco, a fledgling outfit called eInvesting
plans to introduce ``build your own'' funds by September. ``There
is an enormous opportunity, leveraging the Web, to combine the
convenience and instant diversification of a mutual fund with the
control and direct stock ownership of a brokerage account,'' said
Ben Phillipps, vice president for marketing at eInvesting.
</P>
<P>
   The various fees that funds charge add up to, on average, 1.35
percent of assets. On the median mutual fund investment, about
$32,000, that translates to annual fees of $432, Wallman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people realized it's costing them $500 a year, that's
something they would be really shocked about,'' he said. ``Why
don't funds have to disclose the monthly cost?''
</P>
<P>
   It is bad news for the fund industry that that question is being
raised by Wallman, a man so persistent that he is still pushing for
stocks to be traded in decimals instead of fractions 2{ years after
he left his appointed position on the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Wallman, 46, is an iconoclast who often butted heads
with Arthur Levitt, the commission chairman, and members of the
commission staff. He does not abandon a cause lightly, but he
contends that his latest venture is no quixotic mission.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee of $295 a year, Wallman's company, Folio(fn), will let
investors create three do-it-yourself stock funds containing as
many as 50 stocks each and as much money as they choose. For no
additional charge, they can make changes in their holdings as often
as twice a day through what Wallman hopes will become an efficient
internal trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the world will beat a path to Wallman's home page at
www.foliofn.com is far from certain. He is not the first to try to
tap into investors' growing discomfort with traditional funds, a
restlessness that has spawned several variations.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund companies have begun listing fund shares on the major
exchanges where they can be priced and traded all day. The Vanguard
Group, the leading purveyor of the index funds so popular with
buy-and-hold investors, announced plans last week to list shares of
several of its most popular funds, including the flagship Vanguard
500 Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have created funds that let small investors take
high-risk chances on companies that have not yet been cleared to
sell shares to the public. Merrill Lynch and other brokerage firms
have created baskets of stocks in a given industry that can be
bought at relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of new ideas out there, and some, like
exchange-traded funds, are starting to catch on,'' said John
Rekenthaler, research director for the fund tracking firm
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. The folio concept ``is a pretty big
idea that's going to stick in some form,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be a while before this new breed of investment
product takes a measurable bite out of mutual funds, which have
been the individual's investment of choice for more than a decade.
The Investment Co. Institute, which is holding its annual trade
show this week in Washington, estimates that Americans have more
than $4.4 trillion invested in 4,432 all-stock funds, a tenfold
increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant in Philadelphia, is
dubious about the staying power of individuals' interest in
managing dozens of stocks. ``Will these products be a threat to
funds?'' he said. ``I don't think so. I suspect their popularity
would fade quickly if you had a prolonged bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Folio(fn), whose quirky name, Wallman said, stands for financial
innovation, is taking aim at the bulk of that money, which sits in
funds whose managers are paid to try for a higher return than, say,
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Wallman and his colleagues
say that type of investing is pure folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every study has shown that stock picking by mutual funds has
not been overly successful,'' Wallman said last Friday. ``Unless
you think you can pick the manager who will outperform, why pay
money to throw the dice?''
</P>
<P>
   The standard disclaimer in fund marketing materials that past
performance is no guarantee of future returns should be replaced,
Wallman said, with a warning label that reads: ``Past performance
has absolutely nothing to do with future performance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Point out that he sounds a lot like John C. Bogle, the founder
of Vanguard, who has long been an outspoken proponent of low-cost
index funds, and Wallman grins. Bogle is ``one of my heroes,'' he
said. ``I would love to get Bogle working with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallman acknowledges that his folios are not for everybody. ``If
you've only got $10,000 or $20,000, then you ought to be in
Vanguard 500,'' he said. ``It's a very good buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors with $30,000 or more in folios would pay less than
1 percent of their assets annually and gain the flexibility to
choose the stocks they own and to adjust their holdings frequently
to match their tolerance for risk. To help them get started,
Folio(fn) offers sample folios, like one that contains the 30
stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks of a mouse, an investor can order, say, $6,000
worth of the Dow 30, and get $200 worth of each stock _ fractional
shares in many cases _ in one swoop. A week or two later, that
investor could sell 10 stocks and replace them with 10 others, then
ask Folio(fn) to rebalance the folio to keep the investment spread
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Using a discount brokerage firm, those moves would count as 50
to 100 trades or more. Even at commissions as low as $8 a trade,
that would cost $400 to $900.
</P>
<P>
   Folio(fn)'s pricing structure puzzles some people who have taken
a look at its Web site. ``How are they going to make any money
doing that?'' wondered one broker at Merrill Lynch, which last year
started allowing customers to make unlimited trades for a minimum
annual fee of $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Wallman and his financial backers say that Folio(fn) can be
profitable because it is building a computerized trading system
that will keep most trades in-house, matching customer purchases
and sales of popular stocks without incurring the costs of a
middleman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Allen Morgan, general partner of Mayfield Fund, a venture
capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested about $20
million in the company, says the proprietary trade-matching and
processing system is the key. Once Folio(fn) builds a base of
thousands of customers, he said, its technology-based system could
become very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Until it gets to that point, Folio(fn) is compiling the orders
customers place and sending them to market-making firms in two
daily batches, at 10:15 a.m. and at 2:45 p.m. On those trades it
can match among its customers, Folio(fn) says it will split the
difference, or spread, between the prevailing prices offered to buy
and sell that stock. On trades it sends to other firms, Folio(fn)
will receive payments from them of up to $2 a trade, a form of
kickback that is common in the brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either leave that money with the market maker or you take
it,'' Wallman said. ``That's an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One paradox of Wallman's involvement is that his firm stands to
gain in a couple of ways from Wall Street's foot-dragging on the
switch to trading stocks in increments of pennies, instead of
fractions of a dollar. More than three years after agreeing to make
the change, the managers of the Nasdaq market have asked to put it
off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wallman estimates the delay is costing investors hundreds of
millions of dollars a year, and despite his financial interest, he
is still calling for the SEC, where he was a commissioner from 1994
to 1997, to insist that the New York Stock Exchange switch to
decimals without waiting for the Nasdaq. Meantime, the higher costs
of trading elsewhere could serve as a marketing tool for Folio(fn)
while the company takes in payments for sending orders to other
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Nell Minow, a prominent shareholder activist, says she is a
convert to folios. Minow has known Wallman since he was a partner
in the Washington law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling lobbying for
state laws to stifle corporate raiders.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend she tested Folio(fn)'s service and came away
impressed. ``I have never in my life invested in a share of stock
on my own,'' said Minow, who was a driving force behind Lens
Investment Management, an activist money management firm. ``I
personally can't stand working with money managers at the retail
level because I feel their interests are contrary to mine. I feel
I've had a lot of bad advice over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would move some of her family's savings from mutual
funds to folios to take advantage of the greater flexibility. She
also likes the simple way Folio(fn) has set up to allow investors
to vote their shares for company directors and proxy proposals
electronically. Minow, who considers herself a crusader and Wallman
more of an idealist, said she hoped folio investors would use the
Web site as a forum for sharing views on issues of corporate
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Wallman's idea of using the Internet to help individual
investors communicate and marshal their collective power is a bold
stroke, Minow said. ``Talking to him,'' she said, ``is like driving
on the autobahn: You can go as fast as you want and he'll always
keep up with you and respond to what you're saying. It's delicious
to bat around ideas with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Barbash, a former chief regulator of mutual funds at the
SEC, had a different taste after tangling with Wallman over some
mandatory disclosures that Wallman thought would benefit small
investors. ``When you were done with Steve, you oftentimes felt you
had just completed a prizefight that went the maximum number of
rounds,'' said Barbash, now a partner with the law firm of Shearman
&AMP; Sterling in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This product he's developed is absolutely consistent with the
views he articulated when he was on the commission about the lack
of transparency and high fees,'' Barbash said. ``It is intended to
be something that's anti-establishment. Whatever you think of it,
it's absolutely Steve Wallman.''

GENEVA PANEL SAYS U.S. PRISONER RESTRAINTS AMOUNT TO TORTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Story moved initially Tuesday and was held; It is now
released for publication.) By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Use of electric stun belts and restraint chairs, which
human rights groups say is widespread in the United States, almost
inevitably violates the international treaty against torture,
according to a U.N. monitoring group.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Committee Against Torture, which examines compliance of
118 countries that have ratified the 1984 pact, also cited as
problem areas in the United States police brutality, chain gangs,
sexual assaults of female prisoners by law enforcement officials
and detention of minors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee's panel of 10 human rights experts urged U.S.
officials to ``abolish electroshock stun belts and restraint chairs
as methods of restraining those in custody,'' on the ground that
their use ``almost invariably leads to breaches'' of the treaty,
which the United States ratified in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the administration, whose
representatives received the recommendations on Monday without
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stun belts, which are placed around a prisoner's waist, are
reportedly used in as many as 100 U.S. jurisdictions. The Clinton
administration's top human rights official, Harold H. Koh, argued
that no lawsuits had been brought that substantiate the accusations
of death or serious injuries to prisoners from such restraints.
</P>
<P>
   He said that such devices are used only to transport dangerous
inmates, although Amnesty International asserted that in at least
one case a judge had ordered an electric shock be given to a
prisoner during a public court proceeding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its first review of the U.S. record on torture and other
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the committee
also asked Washington to ``ensure that minors are not held in
prison with the regular prison population.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee's conclusions, which took three pages to list,
came in response to last week's U.S. government report, which is
required for all countries that have ratified the U.N. Convention
Against Torture. The United States was nearly five years late
filing its report, a fact noted by the committee, which also asked
that the United States file its second report in November next
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on many examples provided by Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, the experts closely
questioned State and Justice Department officials last week about
practices that fall under the rubric of torture. The committee has
no independent investigative capacity so it must rely on
information provided by human rights advocates and, in countries
like the United States, uncensored media reports. The expert panel
also has no authority to sanction countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International argued there were numerous instances of
mistreatment by police and custody officials ``disproportionately
directed at racial and ethnic minorities.'' The U.S. report, which
admitted that the U.S. record was not perfect, listed well-known
cases like that of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant sodomized
with a broomstick by New York policemen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Committee experts concluded that ``the number of cases of police
ill-treatment of civilians, and ill-treatment in prisons'' were
matters of concern. This was particularly true, they said, because
``much of this ill-treatment by police and prison guards seems to
be based upon discrimination.''  &QL;

   BEATNIK-ROCK-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Allen Ginsberg, the last
surviving member of the Beat trinity that included Jack Kerouac and
William Burroughs, died three years ago, it was entirely
appropriate that Lou Reed and Patti Smith be prominent among those
participating in the ceremonies honoring Walt Whitman's greatest
poetic descendant. The shock waves of Ginsberg's ``Howl,''
Kerouac's ``On the Road,'' and Burroughs' ``Naked Lunch'' radiated
far beyond the academy. It's clear today that as much as the Beats
helped loosen the academic strait jacket constricting American
literature, they had a far more profound impact on rock culture. By

   VIENNA-ORCHESTRA-MUSIC (Vienna) _ When the Vienna Philharmonic
performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony recently in a former Nazi
concentration camp in Mauthausen, Austria, it was knowingly wading
into deep waters of memory and repression, meaning and association,
hope and delusion. And all of that is to reckon without the
late-breaking international fracas over Joerg Haider and the
Freedom Party, as the orchestra did through most of its four years
of planning. The event was intended as a Janus-headed look
backward, with remorse and a hope for healing, and forward, with
resolve and a hope for renewal. By James R. Oestreich.

   METALLICA-NAPSTER (Undated) _ Metallica is suing Napster with
the stated intention of shutting down piracy, not harassing the
music lovers who legitimately trade music through it. But by
gathering the names of users and asking that they be banned from

band's approach has so angered fans that they are organizing

COMMENTARY: THE BIGGEST VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most far-reaching vote any representative will
cast this year will take place next week. It will be on the bill to
permanently guarantee that Congress will have no economic leverage
to restrain China's internal repression of dissidents or external
aggression against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, architect of the discredited ``strategic
partnership'' with Beijing, is lobbying for H.R. 4444 as part of
his legacy thing. His strange bedfellow is the GOP leadership,
fairly slavering at the prospect of heavy contributions from U.S.
companies that want to profit from building up China's industrial
and electronic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been purchasing Democratic votes one by one. The
latest convert to pulling the U.S. teeth is Charles Rangel of New
York, who was seduced by last week's legislation to benefit African
workers at the expense of Chinese laborers in sweatshops at slave
wages. He is the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means, which Tuesday
voted to send the any-behavior-goes bill to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The president's tactics include frightening Americans with
``dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity'' from angry
China if his appeasement is not passed.
</P>
<P>
   He also divides American farmers from workers with his mantra,
``exports mean jobs.'' Of course they do; in the past decade, our
trade deficit with China has ballooned from $7 billion to $70
billion. That means China's exports to the United States have
created hundreds of thousands of jobs _ in China. Clinton's trade
deficit is certainly not creating net jobs for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His trade negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, has become
increasingly shrill, turning truth on its head this week by telling
Lally Weymouth of The Washington Post that ``organized labor, human
rights advocates and some environmentalists have aligned themselves
with the Chinese army and hard-liners in Beijing who do not want
accession for China.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone in twisting the truth and kowtowing to
Communists, Republican investors and the Asia establishment assure
us that only by abandoning yearly review of China's rights abuses
and diplomatic conduct can we encourage democracy there.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to writing speeches for Richard Nixon assuring
conservatives that trade with China would lead to the evolution of
democratic principles in Beijing. But we've been trading for 30
years now, financing its military-industrial base, enabling it to
buy M-11 missiles from the Russians and advanced computer
technology from us.
</P>
<P>
   Has our strengthening of their regime brought political freedom?
Ask the Falun Gong, jailed by the thousands for daring to organize;
ask the Tibetans, their ancient culture destroyed and nation
colonized; ask the Taiwanese, who face an escalation of the
military threat against them after the U.S. Congress spikes its
cannon of economic retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nixon died, I asked him _ on the record _ if perhaps we
had gone a bit overboard on selling the American public on the
political benefits of increased trade. That old realist, who had
played the China card to exploit the split in the Communist world,
replied with some sadness that he was not as hopeful as he had once
been: ``We may have created a Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   (I was on the verge of correcting him that Dr. Frankenstein was
the creator, and that he meant ``Frankenstein's monster,'' but I
bit my tongue.)
</P>
<P>
   To provide a face-saver for Democrats uncomfortable with forever
removing Scoop Jackson's economic pressure, Clinton's bipartisan
allies have cooked up a toothless substitute: a committee to
cluck-cluck loudly when China cracks down and acts up. We already
have a State Department annual report that does that, to no effect
on a China whose transgressions have always been waived.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates know the smart money in Washington is
betting on the appeasers. Our only hope is that the undecideds in
Congress consider that unemployment in their districts will not
always be under 4 percent, and that when recession or aggression
bites, voters will not forget who threw away economic restraints on
China.

WADING INTO DEPTHS OF MEMORY AND REPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ City of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms,
sundry Strausses, Mahler, Schoenberg, Berg and Webern. City of
Freud, Adler and Reich. A burnished nostalgia crosses paths with a
studied forgetfulness, and myth lurks at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vienna Philharmonic performed Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony recently in the quarry of a former Nazi concentration camp
in Mauthausen, Austria, 120 miles to the west, it knowingly waded
into deep waters of memory and repression, meaning and association,
hope and delusion. And all of that is to reckon without the
late-breaking international fracas over Joerg Haider and the
Freedom Party, as the orchestra did through most of its four years
of planning.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the symbolism of the year 2000, the event was
intended as a Janus-headed look backward, with remorse and a hope
for healing, and forward, with resolve and a hope for renewal.
Crucial to each point was a frank acknowledgment of a shameful
past, the orchestra's and the nation's as a whole, something that
has been slower to emerge here than in Germany. Austria likes to
portray itself as the first victim of Nazi Germany, pointing to the
Anschluss of 1938, despite its widespread embrace of annexation to
the Third Reich. As has often been noted, Austrians figured among
SS forces in concentration camps all out of proportion to their
percentage of the Reich's Germanic population.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the concert raised questions about the uses and
abuses of music. Although some saw the orchestra's venture as
misguided, many considered it a tool for good. Still, any confusion
of aesthetics with morality, the cherished notion that at least the
loftiest music is invariably a force for human edification and
communication, must fall before even the most cursory reflection on
the place of music in the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these themes have, coincidentally, taken on added
resonance with publication of Richard Newman's new book, ``Alma
Rose: Vienna to Auschwitz,'' the story of a noted violinist who
went on to direct a women's orchestra at Auschwitz-Birkenau. To a
lesser extent, it also tells the story of her father, Arnold Rose,
the leader of the celebrated Rose Quartet through several
transformations, a revered concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic
and of its parent Vienna State Opera Orchestra for 57 years, and a
brother-in-law of Mahler. The book encapsulates the plunge from
dizzying heights of Viennese culture to fathomless depths of Nazi
depredation. And through it all, there is every reason to believe,
the Vienna players performed Beethoven brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Beethoven,'' Arnold Rose, a thoroughly assimilated
Romanian-born Jew who identified himself completely with Austrian
culture, liked to call the composer. ``To go to a better world,
take the Beethoven piano sonatas and play them through,'' he
advised his son, Alfred, who had fled to Cincinnati, from his own
exile in London. The elder Rose's unstinting service to Beethoven,
to the orchestra and to society availed him nothing. He was
summarily dismissed from the orchestra at the time of the
Anschluss. A dozen or so other Jewish members quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Rose saw her father safely to London, then, against advice
from friends, traveled to the Netherlands, where she worked to
support herself and her father, never to return. Arnold Rose sank
into loneliness and despair. The Vienna Philharmonic offered to
reinstate him as concertmaster in January 1946, but he was no
longer in any position to accept. He died in that year, at 82.
</P>
<P>
   With this context in mind, it is eerie to return to a familiar
EMI recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by the Vienna
Philharmonic and the Vienna Singverein, which also performed at
Mauthausen, from 1947. The conductor, Herbert von Karajan, and the
soprano soloist, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, it later emerged, had both
been members of the Nazi party. So had half the members of the
orchestra, in the estimate of Werner Resel, a cellist now in the
Philharmonic who, as its president in 1996, set the Mauthausen
project in motion.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1946, Newman writes in a similar vein, Arnold Rose
reported ``an unsubstantiated claim from Vienna that 56 Nazis
remained in the Vienna Philharmonic, as opposed to six in the
Berlin Philharmonic.'' During that year the Vienna Philharmonic
sought permission from American military authorities to tour France
and was turned down. The Americans branded it a ``Nazi orchestra,''
a term that continues to haunt it.
</P>
<P>
   Karajan's recorded Ninth of the next year is rousing, to say the
least. (Does a listener hear or only imagine an almost militaristic
aggression at times?) The orchestra, of course, plays brilliantly,
though the amateur Singverein in no sense rivals it, as that
chorus' latter-day counterpart did in a recent performance of the
work here in the Vienna Musikverein. In the years that followed,
the classical-music world, which had retreated into an ivory tower
of its own by midcentury, proved as adept as Austria in
overlooking, excusing and ultimately forgetting unpleasant historic
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Rose, meanwhile, trapped in the occupied Netherlands,
failed in an attempt to escape to Switzerland. Arrested and
imprisoned in France, she was eventually sent to Auschwitz, where
she took over a scrappy little women's band and, by all accounts,
turned it into a crack orchestra, the pride of Maria Mandel, the SS
commandant of the women's camp at Birkenau. The Nazi murderers,
there is every reason to believe, appreciated the orchestra's
playing just as much as their victims did.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting concerts, the orchestra played marches
for forced-labor contingents leaving the camp in the morning and
returning at night. Newman casts doubt on reports that the
orchestra entertained as trainloads of new prisoners arrived, with
many being immediately ``selected'' for death in the gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Rose was a stern taskmaster, believing that only by
maintaining the highest musical standards could the orchestra
insure its survival and that of its members. Yet she appears to
have acquitted herself with whatever dignity and humanity the
circumstances allowed: more so than depicted in Fania Fenelon's
1977 book about the orchestra, ``Playing for Time,'' and the CBS
film of the same name. The orchestra members, in any case, received
preferential treatment and did buy time. Most, like Fenelon,
survived. Alma Rose herself died in the camp in 1944, at 37,
apparently from botulism.
</P>
<P>
   What role, then, can music, so obviously ambiguous and amoral in
its meanings and so debased by some of its makers and users, or the
Vienna Philharmonic, so compromised in its integrity, play in the
quest for a brighter future? A crucial one, in the view of Leon
Zelman, who first presented the idea for the Mauthausen event to
Resel and the Philharmonic: that of remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that the tragedy in Europe did not
begin with Mauthausen and Auschwitz,'' Zelman said. ``It began with
words, with hatred, with annihilation. The young generation in
Austria after us must be reminded, and music has a power to
translate. It helps us to remember.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zelman, 73, directs the Jewish Welcome Service of Vienna, which
invites refugees to revisit the city they once fled. Born in
Poland, he himself passed through Auschwitz and other camps on his
way to Mauthausen: actually one of its many satellite camps in
Austria, Ebensee, from which he was liberated 55 years ago this
month. He remained in Vienna after the war and eventually developed
friendships with members of the Philharmonic, including Resel and
Clemens Hellsberg, a violinist and the orchestra's current
president and archivist, who himself did much to lay bare the
orchestra's Nazi past in his 1992 history, ``Demokratie der
Koenige'' (``Democracy of Kings''), not yet available in English.
</P>
<P>
   Zelman has no particular connection to music. The references to
music in his touching memoir of 1998, ``After Survival,'' are
mainly to the melancholy songs his mother sang before her
disappearance from the Lodz ghetto in Poland to an unknown but
certain death. He chose Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with its
concluding chorus based on Schiller's ``Ode to Joy,'' he said,
``because it represents the idea of Mauthausen, the vision we had
that when we survived, it would be in a world of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 105,000 prisoners died at Mauthausen in unspeakably
brutal conditions: not only Jews but also non-Jews from Eastern
Europe and elsewhere, homosexuals, Communists and ``antisocials.''
Many others besides Zelman survived, and opposition to the
Mauthausen event arose primarily from them, not from Haider's
Freedom Party. (But Zelman is hardly sanguine on that score; he is
obviously still shaken by the shouts of ``Heil Haider!'' and the
Nazi salutes he encountered at a rally in St. Stephen's Square last
December, before the election.)
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors opposed the very idea of presenting a musical
event on what, they insisted, should be preserved as holy ground.
Some protested the nature of the music: the triumphal ``Ode to
Joy'' in a place of such sorrows. Some objected to the
participation of the Vienna Philharmonic, with its tainted past.
</P>
<P>
   B UT Zelman finds nothing of that past in the current orchestra.
He said he was gratified at its unanimous acceptance of his
proposal and its readiness to waive fees.
</P>
<P>
   For Beethoven, said Simon Rattle, who conducted the Mauthausen
performance, joy was always hard-won and thus aptly symbolic of
this occasion. In the case of the Ninth Symphony, the music
historian Richard Taruskin suggested in a 1989 essay, ``Resisting
the Ninth,'' the joy of the finale has to be pried from the
sublimity that characterizes the first three movements.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Burke ``contrasted the smallness, the lightness and the
pleasurableness of the Beautiful with the vastness, the obscurity,
the painfulness of the Sublime,'' Taruskin writes. ``All the
adjectives Burke applies to the `great' _ vast, rugged, negligent,
dark, gloomy, solid, massive _ suit its first three movements to
perfection, even as the adjectives applied to `beauty' _ small,
smooth, polished, light, delicate _ seem altogether alien to it.''
In the same senses the occasion and the place, in the quarry of
Mauthausen, were truly sublime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having music here is a very good thing,'' said Thomas
Quasthoff, the baritone soloist in the Beethoven Ninth, who pointed
to a personal meaning in the occasion, since, physically deformed
by his mother's use of Thalidomide during pregnancy, he would have
been among the first slain in Nazi times. ``But is it necessary to
have so many speakers? The music is important. Speakers don't
change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelman is surely right that remembrance can no longer be
entrusted merely to survivors, most of whom will soon be gone.
There must be a way for future generations to connect to the events
of the Holocaust on a visceral level, and this is indeed a function
music can serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps open our hearts,'' Zelman said. And it brings to bear
its tremendous power of association, through which the memories of
musical experiences fuse viscerally with extramusical
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing is important, because it gives people
something to attach to,'' said Wolfgang K. Aulitzky, the director
of the medical program of the American Austrian Foundation. ``The
Vienna Philharmonic is accomplishing something the Austrian
government should have done long ago, making Austrians aware of
their history. They should do this concert every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to that notion of joy: to judge from one visit, the
Mauthausen quarry is steadily filled with joyous sounds, the songs
of birds. They must have seemed a cruel mockery to prisoners at the
time, but from this vantage point they seem to speak of natural
renewal. Having learned to destroy more efficiently than nature,
can humans settle for less when it comes to repairing the damage?
Hope and resolve, if not joy, may be the only appropriate
responses.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ``still awakens in us longings for
what we can no longer believe in, but wish we could,'' Taruskin
writes, going on to elaborate on a phrase coined by the
musicologist Joseph Kerman. ``We are still in the valley of the
Ninth. And so there's hope.''

 &HT;    Georgia well positioned at start of NCAA title defense
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia shocked the nation when they came home
with the NCAA Golf Championship last May. But the Bulldogs won't
sneak up on anybody when they begin defense of that title today in
the NCAA East Regional at Glenmaura National Golf Course in Moosic,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing three players from that team, including NCAA
runner-up Ryudi Imada, the fourth-ranked Bulldogs have barely
missed a step in making their fifth consecutive appearance in the
regionals.
</P>
<P>
   With three first-year players in the lineup, they were able to
capture their league-record 23rd SEC Championship _ something they
were unable to do last season _ last month in Florence, Ala., and
won three tournaments, the same number as last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about these guys,'' coach Chris Haack said.
``Every time we go into a tournament, I feel like we have a chance
to win. They've definitely exceeded my expectations. To be ranked
No. 4 going into the NCAAs, I would have taken that walking off the
course after (last year's championship). No matter what happens
from here on, it's been a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Michael Morrison and junior Nick Cassini have assumed the
leadership roles vacated by Imada, Mark Northey and Jeremy Parrott.
Erik Compton and Bryant Odom have proved to be explosive players,
although somewhat inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Compton, a freshman who was one of the top junior players in the
nation in Miami, carded a school-record 13-under-par 203 to win the
Golf World Invitational in Hilton Head in November. Then
junior-college transfer Bubba Watson, a big left-hander from
Bagdad, Fla., matched that score at the Schenkel in March.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini, a junior from Atlanta who started his career at Georgia
Tech, has led the Bulldogs all year in stroke average (71.33),
top-10 finishes (five) and rounds of par or better (17).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very competitive team,'' Cassini said. ``When we
play bad, we finish fourth or fifth; when we play well, we usually
win.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the East Regional, the Bulldogs will be looking just
to survive and advance. Twenty-seven teams, including No. 1 Georgia
Tech and eight other top 20 squads, will be competing for 11 spots
in the NCAA Championships, which will be held May 31-June 3 at The
Lake Course at Grand National Golf Club in Opelika, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Not advancing ``is always a concern,'' Haack said. ``We sat
there last year and watched (top-ranked) Clemson go into a playoff
for the right to go. We'll be a little more conservative and try
not to do anything stupid. Hopefully, we can play well and carry
some momentum into nationals.''

CBS RELIES ON PROVEN NAMES FOR FALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: CBS fall schedule below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employing magician David Copperfield to open CBS's upfront
presentation of its new fall schedule wasn't the only illusion the
network pulled off Wednesday afternoon in New York. CBS Television
President and CEO Les Moonves attempted to sell advertisers on the
notion that despite sitting in third place in the ratings and
ranking low in key viewer demographics, the network was in great
health.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, CBS does well on some of the week's most competitive
viewing nights. But it was telling that, at the outset of the
upfront, Moonves talked up how cable holdings (Nickelodeon, MTV,
Comedy Central) in the CBS-Viacom merger would provide advertisers
with some of the desirable demographics his network has trouble
providing.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, an analysis of CBS's strengths and weaknesses, and how
the new programming figures into the network's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Strong points: CBS's fairly strong showing last season _ it
bolstered its Monday night lineup, remained strong on Sundays and
expanded well on Tuesdays thanks to ``JAG'' and ``Judging Amy,'' _
was sort of lost amidst the hoopla of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and the crasser reality shows. Its fall lineup was
generally strong enough that it was difficult to find holes for its
midseason programming. The network's summer reality series ``Big
Brother'' and ``Survivor'' are already generating huge buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Weak points: That midseason programming was better off stuck on
the shelf, and of last season's new series, only ``Judging Amy''
was a decisive hit. The network's own game show, ``Winning Lines,''
tanked thoroughly, and CBS learned that even doing the right thing
didn't guarantee viewers: Its highly touted, NAACP-pleasing ``City
of Angels'' probably would've been canceled had it not been a
minority-heavy series.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing its mob drama ``Falcone'' as an extended mini-series
virtually ensured that it slept with the fishes. The network also
didn't help its early season sensation ``Now &AMP; Again'' maintain its
momentum. Many of its shows _ ``Diagnosis Murder,'' ``Touched by an
Angel'' and ``Nash Bridges'' _ are as long in the tooth as the
average CBS viewer.
</P>
<P>
   New this fall season: Wednesdays begin with an hour of divas in
media-centric sitcoms. Bette Midler plays herself in ``The Bette
Show,'' a sitcomization of her life. Christine Baranski stars as a
TV executive in ``Welcome to New York,'' from David Letterman's
Worldwide Pants production company, which features Jim Gaffigan as
a very Lettermanesque character _ a former Indiana weatherman who
makes it in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Malley, whose eponymous sitcom was last season's first
casualty, proves nothing succeeds like failure by returning with
Monday's ``Yes, Dear,'' which also stars Anthony Clark (``Boston
Common''). ``Wings''' Tim Daly is the latest ``Fugitive,'' based on
the old TV series and the hit movie about a man framed for murder
and on the lam from the law. It's on Fridays, with William Petersen
and Marg Helgenberger make up ``C.S.I.,'' about Vegas crime-scene
forensic investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday finds Craig T. Nelson as police commissioner of ``The
District,'' set in Washington, D.C., and Heather Paige Kent playing
a 30ish Jersey gal who ditches her fiance and blue-collar life to
re-enter college in ``That's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling changes: ``City of Angels'' moves to Thursdays _ now
opposite ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' gets bumped up an hour on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason replacements: Ellen DeGeneres' comedy/variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Additional programming: Miniseries and more miniseries _
subjects include Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (in competition with
NBC's mini on the Kennedy women), Marilyn Monroe (based on Joyce
Carol Oates' recent novel ``Blonde''), the O.J. trial (with a
script by Norman Mailer) and Elian Gonzales. Jim Henson's company
will create an effects-laden ``Jack and the Beanstalk,'' and
following ``Fail-Safe,'' Julie Andrews will star in a live
production of ``On Golden Pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis: CBS plowed four hours of new programming into Friday
and Saturday nights, when viewing levels aren't high. The good
news: ABC and NBC have opted just to run theatrical films on
Satuday, so CBS's counterprogramming should work there. The bad
news: CBS has a habit of putting cool shows that don't always skew
to the network's usual demographic on Fridays, when those viewers
are even less likely to be home watching CBS (cases in point:
``Picket Fences,'' ``Buddy Faro,'' ``Now &AMP; Again''). ``Fugitive''
and ``C.S.I.'' (which could probably use a more evocative title)
could fall into that trap. Something stronger should have been
placed in ``Family Law's'' 10 p.m. Monday slot.
</P>
<P>
   And the schedule doesn't address the network's perennial problem
(with advertisers, at least) _ its viewers skew older than the
other networks _ which is a tremendous oversight given how many
younger viewers they'll attract over the summer with ``Survivor''
and ``Big Brother.'' Overall, however, even though it's probably
the most conventional lineup of the networks, the new series
generally look promising. &QL;

AS ICO GLOBAL RESCUE IS COMPLETE, MERGER IS ANNOUNCED
</HEADLINE>
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, announced the
completion Wednesday of his investment group's $1.2 billion rescue
of ICO Global Communications Inc., which went bankrupt last summer
developing a satellite telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
   And, as expected, he also announced his intention to merge the
``New ICO'' he brought out of bankruptcy with Teledesic LLC, the
more ambitious satellite network partnership he founded with Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The merged venture, ICO-Teledesic Global Limited, will be
temporarily run by Russell Daggatt, who is chief executive of
Teledesic, based in Bellevue, Wash. But McCaw, who will be
chairman, is seeking a permanent chief executive, according to a
person briefed on his plans. Richard Greco, ICO's chief executive,
resigned Wednesday to pursue other telecommunications work.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization plan for New ICO requires McCaw, who controls
54 percent of New ICO, to files plans with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to allow the minority stockholders to trade
their shares, either publicly or privately, no later than March 31,
2001, said Roger Nyhus, a Teledesic spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The value of both New ICO and Teledesic depends on whether
McCaw's consolidation strategy can restore faith in the satellite
communications market. That faith has been badly shaken by the
collapse of Motorola's Iridium network, ICO's fund-raising problems
and weak demand for the satellite phone service that Globalstar
Communications began offering in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that someone with a demonstrated business sense in
communications is in a position to run things,'' said Roger Rusch,
an industry consultant, referring to McCaw's stellar track record
of building McCaw Cellular into an enterprise that he sold to AT&AMP;T
for $11.5 billion in 1994 and his more recent role in turning
around Nextel Communications, the wireless carrier based in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's no guarantee for success,'' added Rusch, whose
company, Telastra, based in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., advised
ICO Global bondholders during the bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw disclosed his effort to keep ICO afloat last November. The
investment group he organized included both domestic and foreign
investors, including Subhash Chandra, an entrepreneur from India
who initially announced a competing bid for control of ICO Global.
</P>
<P>
   As McCaw's executives examined the troubled company, they
concluded that its technology and marketing connections could be
built into a business that would function as a steppingstone toward
their vision of Teledesic.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued Wednesday, McCaw characterized the
enterprises signed up to market ICO's service as an ``unrivaled
global network of leading telecommunications companies'' and Nyhus
said there had been discussions of possible ``synergies'' between
ICO and Teledesic.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of McCaw executives, ICO has already begun
revamping its ground stations to deliver limited Internet and data
services over its planned 12-satellite network in addition to the
voice traffic it originally envisioned. The work also involves
minor alterations to the satellites under construction by Hughes
Space and Communications and a preliminary agreement for Hughes to
build four spare satellites, according to an executive close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaw denied a report in The Wall Street Journal on
Wednesday that he would expand ICO's network to 20 satellites. The
report said that the consolidation could bring $1 billion in new
business to Hughes, which is being acquired by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ICO Global's first satellite exploded during its launching in
March, but New ICO said it still planned to begin service in 2003.
That would be well in advance of Teledesic, which wants to put a
far greater number of satellites in lower orbits, allowing it to
handle Internet and data services that require hundreds of times
more bandwidth than ICO could handle.
</P>
<P>
   But Teledesic, which was originally envisioned as an
840-satellite network, has been bogged down by design complications
and shifting economic projections. Its latest plan calls for 288
satellites beginning operations in late 2004 at the earliest.
Unlike ICO, its intended market has been stationary users who would
need a satellite dish to send and receive signals.  &QL;

CRUDE MOVIES BOAST A SADLY FORGOTTEN HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids these days. They think they're so grown-up, what with their
dirty movies like ``American Pie'' and ``There's Something About
Mary'' and this new one, ``Road Trip.'' All those jokes about body
fluids and laxatives and abusing baked goods and, occasionally,
actual sex.
</P>
<P>
   It's appalling. It makes me sad for the youth of America.
They're wasting their tender sensibilities on this trash and they
don't know what they're missing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my day, after all, they really knew how to make raunchy
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, once obnoxiously again, boomers can lord it over their
progeny with generally justified, smirking self-satisfaction that
we did something else better _ or, at least, before _ the kids got
around to it. Although it can be argued that the current
Farrelly/Weitz brothers cycle of
``more-disgusting-than-the-last-one'' outrage comedies are better
made and thought-out than the products of a generation earlier,
they really don't step in anything that hasn't been wallowed in
before.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, most campus gross-out farces that have come since
_ from the hormonally slap-happy ``Porky's'' pictures of the early
'80s through ``Pie'' and producer Ivan Reitman's ``Road Trip'' _
owe just about everything to ``National Lampoon's Animal House,''
the 1978 bible of bad movie behavior. ``Trip,'' itself a
full-length riff on a ``House'' sequence, borrows everything from
nauseating food gags to uncomfortable racial confrontations to
wrecking a nerd's borrowed car to doing terrible things with
animals from the earlier Reitman slobfest.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie's main matter, ``Trip's'' females are no more
sexually aggressive than their big ``House'' sisters (though
generally a little smarter about it), the guys no less erotically
obsessed than the frat-rat alums (if slightly more sensitive, the
whippersnappers!) and the depravity just as perverse (though a tad
more explicit; watch out for that sperm bank nurse!).
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much the same comparisons can be made between shock
comedies of the '70s and any of those of the modern era, which
roughly began when Jim Carrey spoke out of a nether orifice in
``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective'' (1994). Basically, filmmakers back
then, in the first, er, flush of freedom following the demise of
Hollywood's censorious Production Code, let their imaginations
wander much too imaginatively in a manner that really hasn't been
matched, depth for depth, since.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the '70s were taboo-breaking times worked in
congress with the new movie freedom to create some of the most
humorously revolting imagery ever committed to film.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pioneers in this noble endeavor were writer Terry
Southern who, after scripting such radical pieces as ``Dr.
Strangelove'' and ``Easy Rider,'' set the waste bar unmatchably low
in the 1969 adaptation of his novel ``The Magic Christian.'' The
climactic scene of that Peter Sellers-Ringo Starr satire depicted a
gaggle of English businessmen diving into a vat filled with urine,
blood and manure to retrieve free money.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the irrepressible John Waters set a different
kind of, yes, taste threshold when he encouraged Divine, the
transvestite star of his trash epic ``Pink Flamingos,'' to ingest
actual dog product on screen.
</P>
<P>
   For pure, concentrated lewd humor, few films have matched the
scope and comprehensiveness of Woody Allen's 1972 ``Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask),'' which
absurdistly addressed every deviation this side of dating your
girlfriend's daughter. As for toilet jokes, is there one modern
movie laxative attack (``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``American Pie'') that
doesn't owe a formal debt to the campfire scene in Mel Brooks' 1974
``Blazing Saddles''?
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of outrageous comedy essentially reached
its baroque peak in ``Monty Python's the Meaning of Life'' (1983),
with its dementedly irreverent ``Every Sperm Is Sacred'' production
number and the planetoid-sized Mr. Creosote's fatal bite of the
wafer-thin mint, which triggered the most extensive incidence of
projectile vomiting in recorded human history.
</P>
<P>
   (A personal note: ``Meaning of Life'' was actually the first
film I saw together with my then-future wife, which perhaps
confirms the widely cherished belief among young men that girls
like these things. Of course, our next date was a French
existential masterpiece by Robert Bresson, and she's avoided going
to the movies with me ever since.)
</P>
<P>
   So many milestones, such limited stomach capacity. To be fair,
the original outrageous comedy cycle spawned its share of _ can you
believe it? _ bad movies: pretty much the whole Cheech &AMP; Chong
stoner cinema and 90 percent of anything made by a ``Saturday Night
Live'' or ``SCTV'' cast member. Then again, the younger crowd has
Pauly Shore to answer for, so some things obviously don't change.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair though, the kids, derivative as their gross output
may be, are doing more interesting things in these movies than just
manufacturing new hair gels. And I don't just mean the creative new
use of live chicken in next month's Carrey/Farrelly collaboration
``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   For one, these techno-savvy youngsters have come up with clever
new electronic methods of voyeurism. John Belushi's old Peeping Tom
on the ladder routine and ``Porky's'' hole drilled through the
girls' shower wall has been replaced by ``American Pie's'' Internet
cam approach to international relations. And the whole crux of
``Road Trip's'' plot is an attempt to retrieve a homemade porn
video accidentally mailed to the male participant's longtime but
long-distance soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a tendency nowadays to make the female objects of
these films more experienced than the males, physically as well as
the more traditional emotionally. This could be the result of a
growing feminist consciousness that's finally taking hold in
Hollywood. Then again, the plethora of gratuitous toplessness in
``Road Trip'' would indicate that it's more a function of the fact
that men are just as immature as ever.
</P>
<P>
   As for the inexplicable interest in defiling grain-based
products (beer and the title dessert in ``American Pie,'' French
toast in ``Road Trip,'' all probably antedated by the whipped
cream-covered nude photos in the transitional, 1984 ``Revenge of
the Nerds'') ... perhaps that's the new generation's coded manner
of expressing their antipathy to purity, as represented by Mom's
apple pie and all that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know, of all the stretched arguments in this piece,
that's the thinnest. But it speaks to the one element that, all
facetiousness aside, doesn't seem to have made the transition from
the '70s to the current run of gross-out wonders: a genuine sense
of subversiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the likes of Southern, Waters, Allen, the Pythons and the
truly commercial-minded Brooks and Reitman wanted their films to be
successful. But they also wanted to make genuinely upsetting
attacks on authority, capitalism, hypocrisy and every institution
they could think of that needed to be confronted with its flaws.
Their films' prime agendas were to be shocking and funny; being
liked was a secondary consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sickest of today's comedies strikes a good-natured,
boys-(or men)-will-be-boys tone. Their main aspiration is to play
at being offensive in such a fundamentally inoffensive manner that
they'll spawn a lucrative franchise of sequels rather than visceral
outrage and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pretty smart strategy on the ``Dumb and Dumber''
crowd's part _ but, also, one that really makes you wonder what the
younger generation's coming to. &QL;

   For one, these techno-savvy youngsters have come up with clever
new electronic methods of voyeurism. John Belushi's old Peeping Tom
on the ladder routine and ``Porky's'' hole drilled through the
girls' shower wall has been replaced by ``American Pie's'' Internet
cam approach to international relations. And the whole crux of
``Road Trip's'' plot is an attempt to retrieve a homemade porn
video accidentally mailed to the male participant's longtime but
long-distance soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a tendency nowadays to make the female objects of
these films more experienced than the males, physically as well as
the more traditional emotionally. This could be the result of a
growing feminist consciousness that's finally taking hold in
Hollywood. Then again, the plethora of gratuitous toplessness in
``Road Trip'' would indicate that it's more a function of the fact
that men are just as immature as ever.
</P>
<P>
   As for the inexplicable interest in defiling grain-based
products (beer and the title dessert in ``American Pie,'' French
toast in ``Road Trip,'' all probably antedated by the whipped
cream-covered nude photos in the transitional, 1984 ``Revenge of
the Nerds'') ... perhaps that's the new generation's coded manner
of expressing their antipathy to purity, as represented by Mom's
apple pie and all that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know, of all the stretched arguments in this piece,
that's the thinnest. But it speaks to the one element that, all
facetiousness aside, doesn't seem to have made the transition from
the '70s to the current run of gross-out wonders: a genuine sense
of subversiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the likes of Southern, Waters, Allen, the Pythons and the
truly commercial-minded Brooks and Reitman wanted their films to be
successful. But they also wanted to make genuinely upsetting
attacks on authority, capitalism, hypocrisy and every institution
they could think of that needed to be confronted with its flaws.
Their films' prime agendas were to be shocking and funny; being
liked was a secondary consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sickest of today's comedies strikes a good-natured,
boys-(or men)-will-be-boys tone. Their main aspiration is to play
at being offensive in such a fundamentally inoffensive manner that
they'll spawn a lucrative franchise of sequels rather than visceral
outrage and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pretty smart strategy on the ``Dumb and Dumber''
crowd's part _ but, also, one that really makes you wonder what the
younger generation's coming to. &QL;

BRAZIL ENCOUNTERS RESISTANCE TO PRIVATIZATION OF BANESPA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Brazil, Germany, Mass.)   (Editors: dOliveira is cq.)  
 By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Over the past six years Brazil has reduced
state ownership of telecommunications, power and mining companies
in what is widely regarded as a highly successful privatization.
But the government is facing unexpectedly tough domestic resistance
to selling one of the biggest state assets, a bank known as
Banespa.
</P>
<P>
   With two months remaining until a scheduled auction of Banespa,
a Sao Paulo court has prohibited potential buyers from looking at
the financial records in Banespa's data room, acting on a lawsuit
from unionized bank employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of financial analysts representing potential buyers
have been encamped in Sao Paulo hotels, hoping the order, the
latest in a series of delays, will be reversed. Even if it is, more
court-ordered delays are expected in the sale of a prize with 600
branches, 3 million customers and 6 percent of the nation's bank
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've stopped predicting the frequency of the delays,'' said
Brent Erensel, director of Latin Bank Equity Research at Deutsche
Bank. ``From the time when the data room opens, the soonest we can
expect an auction is ten weeks later. Until the room opens, you
cannot start the clock ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the potential sale of Banespa, formally known as
Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo illustrates an underlying ambivalence
in Brazil about the benefits of privatization, which began in 1994.
The change has created an investment boom in Brazil and many
foreign companies now do business here. But the job security of
many Brazilians has been threatened as their employers changed from
the government to private owners who want to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Banespa privatization say more than job
security is at stake. The Sao Paulo Bank Employees Union, which is
leading the fight, argues that Banespa is an important driver of
growth in the state of Sao Paulo, providing credit to small farms
and businesses and investing in social and educational projects.
Union officials say Banespa's priorities could change completely
under new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government came out with a study recently that said that
infant mortality in the State of Sao Paulo has tripled,'' said Joao
dOliveira, the union director. ``Why is that? Lack of basic
sanitation. And who invests in those projects? Banespa does.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree, though, that Banespa's sale is inevitable.
``The sale could maybe drag out another two months, but to reverse
the privatization process is practically impossible,'' Eduardo
Guimaraes, the president of Banespa, said in an interview today.
``Once the data room opens, it will be even more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to rebut critics, the government has warned that any
further delay in the sale of Banespa could bring grave economic
consequences to a country still recovering from the currency crisis
of early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government plans to use the proceeds of the sale,
estimated to be as much as $2.3 billion, to pay down public debt,
the Central Bank estimates that a six-month delay would cause the
government to lose more than $100 million in interest payments.
Many economists say the government is exaggerating the economic
dangers. dOliveira, at the union, agrees. ``Their claim of grave
economic consequences is totally ridiculous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Banespa's sale would be an important political achievement
for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Banespa represents the
last of what critics call the bad old days, when government-run
banks were used to finance questionable government projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale of Banespa is a benchmark in terms of the fiscal
reforms that the government has been undertaking over the last few
years,'' said Andre Loes, chief economist at Santander Investment
in Sao Paulo. ``If the bank isn't sold this year, the government
will lose much more in political terms than in revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine banks have expressed interest in buying Banespa, including
Brazil's three largest private banks _ Bradesco, Itau, and
Unibanco. The others include Brazil's Banco Safra as well as
Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, BankBoston, Britain's HSBC, and BSCH
and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria of Spain.

EPA REPORT ON DIOXIN'S CANCER RISKS DRAWS PRAISE AND CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Kan.) By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a draft of a long-awaited report on the health effects of the
pollutant dioxin, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency
say that the chemical is 10 times more likely to cause cancer than
previously estimated. Some environmental groups hailed the draft,
but some scientists questioned its assertions.
</P>
<P>
   People with the highest exposures to the chemical _ those who
are older and eat fatty foods _ may have a one in 100 chance of
getting cancer from the dioxin in their bodies, the report says.
Moreover, it says, dioxin can cause other adverse health effects,
like developmental delays in children and disruptions in hormone
secretions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the report was still being written, and its
conclusions had not been distributed to an EPA Scientific Advisory
Board _ in fact, a board to evaluate the report was only now being
put together. Some scientists said they doubted the report's
conclusions would stand up to a board's scrutiny, and a few were
scathing in their assessment, with one expert in clinical
toxicology calling the report ``an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions of the draft report, but not the need for the
advisory board review, were described on Wednesday in The
Washington Post, sending industry groups and environmentalists
scrambling to respond to a document few had seen.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a revision of one the agency submitted for
assessment by its advisory board in 1994. The board questioned the
conclusions about dioxin's health effects and asked the agency to
repeat its work. The draft is the result of that work.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the EPA said the report's conclusions were based on
scientific evidence that had emerged in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist for the agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because, he said, the agency was not responding to most calls from
reporters on the draft report, said the data came from the agency's
interpretation of studies in Dutch children showing that dioxin
might alter development and that it might affect thyroid hormone
secretions; studies of a group of men called the Ranch Hands, who
flew planes for the Air Force in Vietnam and were exposed to dioxin
while spraying the herbicide Agent Orange; and studies of
industrial workers.
</P>
<P>
   But, the scientist said, while the cancer risk of dioxin might
be much greater than previously estimated, Americans were exposed
to less of the pollutant than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin is formed, for example, when chlorine-containing
chemicals, like plastics or industrial wastes, are burned, or when
pulp and paper are bleached. The chemical can waft through the air
or be carried in dust, settling on plants that are eaten by
animals. Once ingested, dioxin accumulates in the fat. When humans
eat the animals, or when they consume fat-containing dairy products
like milk, dioxin enters their bodies, where it remains, stored in
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, however, strict pollution controls have caused
dioxin levels in the environment to drop. As a result, individuals
have less dioxin in their bodies than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA scientist said that even though many foods contained
dioxin, the food supply itself was safe. Though dioxin gets into
breast milk, he said, the benefits of breast feeding far exceed the
risks from dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's conclusions on dioxin are being met with vigorous
responses from industry and from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EPA has a real dilemma,'' said Dr. Marcie Francis, senior
director of science policy at the Chorine Chemistry Council, an
industry group. ``If the food supply is safe and yet at the same
time dioxin is causing cancer, it's a real contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hind, legislative director of the Greenpeace Toxics
Campaign, said environmental groups like Greenpeace think the
agency did not go far enough. A pesticide would be banned if its
cancer risk was one in a million, he said. So, he asked, why did
the agency tolerate dioxin, with a cancer risk of one in 100?
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer to look largely at the endpoints _ what some call
`blame the victim,' '' Hind said. ``Don't burn trash in your
backyard. Eat a low-fat diet. That's not enough.'' His group wants
a ban on chlorine-containing compounds, like polyvinyl chloride
used in plastics, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists who had reviewed the EPA's previous dioxin
report were skeptical about the new analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Morton Lippmann, a professor of environmental medicine at
New York University School of Medicine, was head of the agency's
advisory board in 1994 and has agreed to head the board being put
together now. He said that while he had not seen the new draft
report, scientific research on dioxin since 1994 ``has been less
than definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Gough, a retired biologist who was on the agency's
scientific advisory board in 1994 and who was chairman of a
committee that evaluated the Ranch Hands data for the Department of
Health and Human Services, said there was no reason to believe the
cancer risk from dioxin is 10 times higher than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no epidemiological study in the last five
years, since their last assessment, that makes that claim any more
credible,'' Gough said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Doull, a clinical toxicologist at the University of
Kansas in Kansas City, also was a member of the EPA's advisory
board that reviewed the previous dioxin report. He said the agency
seemed to have disregarded his group's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their review of the critical dioxin literature is inadequate
and their recommendations appear to me to be unsupported and
arrogant,'' Doull said. ``This action appears to be ill-timed,
political rather than scientific and is an embarrassment to science
and certainly to toxicology.''

AVALANCHE SEEKS BOOST FROM BOURQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ray Bourque slightly eased Colorado's pain of losing
physical defenseman Adam Foote by announcing his return for
tomorrow's Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through practice and it went very well,'' said Bourque,
who last played May 1. ``I'm where I need to be. It's good to go
for Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran defenseman's return comes at a good time for the
Avalanche, who will be without Foote. A high-energy, aggressive
player, Foote almost single-handedly made life miserable for Stars
center] Mike Modano in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, 39, won't match Foote's physical presence, but his
leadership, as well as his return to the power play, will be a
plus. He said he expects to resume playing his usual 30 minutes a
game immediately. He refuted claims that Foote's eye injury is
rushing his return from a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of turned a corner and that's what I was waiting for
over the last week or so, just getting over that hump,'' said
Bourque, who scored seven of his eight regular-season goals with
the Avs on the power play. ``I feel good about my situation and
feel good about playing on Friday. Regardless if Adam was there or
not, you've got to be good enough to go, and that's why I'm
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Aaron Miller, who is playing with a fractured jaw,
teamed with Bourque yesterday in place of Foote. That duo looks to
be the Avs' new top defensive pair. They will likely match up
against the Stars' top line of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get Ray back and going is really big for this club,''
Miller said. ``He's kind of been the symbol for the way we've been
playing, kind of Ray Bourque-style hockey. I think we need to get
back to that. Him coming back will certainly help.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote did not attend the team's practice yesterday. He suffered
blunt trauma to his right eye when the blade of Lehtinen's stick
inadvertently struck him 2] minutes, 42 seconds into Game 2. Blood
flowed into the eye, complicating his return.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 playoff games, Foote _ who played 30 minutes against the
Stars in Game 1 _ had five assists, 18 penalty minutes and a
plus-five rating. It is not known if he will play in Game 4 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pick it up as a team,'' Bourque said. ``We have to
go play physical and play hard and be tenacious and really
desperate. Adam is a big, physical guy that plays with a lot of
emotion, and he'll certainly be missed, but, we've had guys step
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs will pair Sandis Ozolinsh, who will play with what the
team terms a ``bruised foot,'' with Jon Klemm. Martin Skoula will
play with Greg de Vries, who stepped into the lineup when Bourque
was injured in Game 3 against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Foote also puts more pressure on the Avs' forwards
to take care of their defensive responsibilities, as well as to
create enough offense in the Stars' zone to take pressure off the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds more responsibility to everybody,'' Avs winger Dave
Reid said. ``It puts much more emphasis on the forwards to pick up
their games in all parts.''

PRO GOLFERS HAVE IDEAS ON HOW TO IMPROVE JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It seems to be such a perfect job.
</P>
<P>
   The work is on the best golf courses in the world. A workday is
about five to six hours. The workers are catered to. They have
someone carrying their golf bag. If they play well, they are paid
handsomely. They get their golf balls, clothes and clubs free.
They're basically their own boss.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want this job?
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds great. Yet, can any job be perfect, including the
PGA Tour, where anyone who swings a golf club aspires to work? If
the workers could change something to make it better, what could it
possibly be?
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pros who are in the Fort Worth-Dallas area for the
two PGA Tour stops _ the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and the
MasterCard Colonial _ were asked what they'd change, if anything,
if they could be tour commissioner Tim Finchem for a day and have
all-encompassing powers.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for a smiling Nick Faldo to come up with an
answer that probably would get no arguments: ``I'd give everyone
$10 million. We'd all be happy. Equal pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Many others said they couldn't think of a thing they'd change. A
perfect job is a perfect job, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pernice Jr. echoed the sentiments of several pros when he
said, ``I can't think of a thing. As a group, we may not be paying
Tim enough ... I can't say enough about the job he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Watts also couldn't think of anything he would change and
praised Finchem. He said that previous commissioner Deane Beman
should also be praised for the job he did for 20 years before
Finchem succeeded him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Finchem and Deane Beman have done tremendous jobs from A
to Z ... A job that's unbelievable. Tim deserves a lot of credit,
and Deane should get a lot of credit for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were others who would take advantage of a wish to
tweak their perfect world.
</P>
<P>
   Some are taking exception to the trend to lengthen courses in an
attempt to ``Tiger-proof'' them. Others suggested tweaking the
world rankings, altering the pro-ams, reducing the number of
tournaments played, increasing the minimum events a player must
play in and taming the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brooks of Fort Worth is one who believes a reduction in the
number of tournaments would help the remaining tournaments draw ``a
so-called more quality field,'' making more sponsors happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd reduce the schedule by about 10 tournaments,'' he said.
``The problem would be finding 10 that would agree \Rto be
discontinued.\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks extended that wish by also saying: ``I would raise the
minimum number of tournaments we have to play from 15 to 20 for the
players 40 years old and younger,'' he said. That would assure that
more tournaments would get more of the tour's top names, he said.
He said that after the top names play the four majors, the
Mercedes, The Players Championship, the World Cup of Golf and the
Tour Championship, they need only seven more tournaments to fulfill
their obligation to maintain an exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lietzke, a former Nelson and Colonial winner who has been
on the tour since 1975, said he'd do something to control galleries
that ``are scaring me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the gallery etiquette and golf knowledge.
The game is so big and popular now and so many people are coming
out who are more rowdy and are more aggressive seeking
autographs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the heckling at some tournaments is getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing what happened to Colin Montgomerie at the
Ryder Cup,'' Lietzke said of the name-calling and heckling that
Montgomerie had to endure last year when the Europeans played the
Americans at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't have happened 20 years ago,'' Lietzke said.
``We're getting more college-age kids, and there is more drinking
at the events. It's really scary and I think it's separating the
players from the fans more.''
</P>
<P>
   Lietzke suggested that instead of a tournament being shown every
week on TV, that a few shows could be aired about the history of
the game and about the kind of people the game has created.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to educate the people about the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olin Browne, the defending champion at Colonial, is among those
who believes courses are becoming too long. He said lengthening
courses is playing into the hands of the long hitters such as Tiger
Woods. It's only making it more difficult for the shorter hitters.
He believes there are other, more fair ways to toughen golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an average hitter,'' Browne said. ``If I'm hitting a
7-iron, Tiger's hitting a sand wedge. Instead of adding 30 to 40
yards to a hole, there are other ways to make it tougher _ such as
bringing the fairways in and raising the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Henninger said if he had power to make a change, he'd try
improving the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know how I'd do it,'' he said. ``I think Tim
Finchem is trying. The way the world rankings work is not a totally
fair way to judge performance. If you can get into the top 60, it's
hard to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Verplank said he would reducing the pro-ams to three
amateurs and one pro, instead of four amateurs and one pro as many
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make it more fun for everyone,'' he said. ``We'd go
from 5- to 6-hour rounds to 41/2-hour rounds. It would make
everyone happier.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something even the fans could wish for, even in a
perfect world.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This, the Rangers told us this spring, would
be the year of pitching and defense. Thankfully, we didn't ask
their advice on the stock market, too.
</P>
<P>
   Remember just a few weeks ago when Baltimore pitcher Mike
Mussina said ``they don't even look like the same Rangers
anymore?'' That was at the end of April. Since then, a
transformation has taken place. Mussina can rest assured, he'd
recognize them now.
</P>
<P>
   The old bop-'til-you-drop Rangers are back and their offensive
surge has helped fuel an 11-5 record for the first 17 days in May,
including yesterday's 11-6 victory over Tampa Bay in the wind
tunnel known as The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into the season, the Rangers have basically dumped the
pitching and defense approach _ they've had no choice actually _
and resorted to bashing opponents' brains out to the tune of a
league-leading .304 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest reasons for optimism I have,''
manager Johnny Oates said, ``because we are scoring runs and I know
our pitching is going to pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too sure. What if the Rangers _ and every other team in
baseball _ are already pitching as well as they can? What if this
is as good as it gets?
</P>
<P>
   There's ample evidence that the delicate balance between offense
and pitching in baseball has been dramatically and drastically
tipped toward the hitters for a variety of reasons, from juiced
baseballs, to new technology in bat manufacturing, to bulked-up,
iron-pumping hitters, to bandbox ballparks, like Houston's new
Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bad pitching? Sure. But it's not just bad pitchers who are
getting pounded these days. Rangers closer John Wetteland contends
he's throwing the ball every bit as well as last season, but his
earned-run average is a disturbing 5.71 and he has surrendered six
home runs in 17 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly alone. Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw has a 6.75 ERA.
Yankees stopper Mariano Rivera, who normally sets the standard for
all closers, was at 4.12 with two blown saves entering yesterday's
play.
</P>
<P>
   The collective team ERA in the American League is a whopping
5.12. The Rangers' 5.30 team ERA may provoke a sick feeling at the
pit of your stomach, but it ranks seventh in the league. Seven AL
teams are worse.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, what has been happening to Rangers pitchers is
happening all over baseball, sometimes worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When good pitches are being made and the ball is still jumping
off the bat, it makes you wonder,'' Oates said. ``Good pitches
should get hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many good pitches, however, simply aren't being called
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the distant past umpires woke up and screeched
to commissioner Bud Selig, ``Honey, we've shrunk the strike zone.''
It's now about the size of John Rocker's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \Rthe umps\S called the strike zone like it's supposed to
be called, that would take care of 98 percent of it,'' contended
Rangers reliever Tim Crabtree, he of the handsome 8.66 ERA before
giving the Rangers 4 2/3 innings of relief yesterday without
allowing an earned run. ``If they would call a strike a strike, we
would be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is not going to happen, at least not in our
lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, with a 35-mile-per-hour wind whistling into The
Ballpark and right back out again, Chad Curtis became the first
right-handed hitter to ever hit a ball into the Home Run Porch
upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been hard for me to think \Rthe ball is juiced\S,''
Oates said. ``I just don't know. Then I saw our pitchers hit six
out the first time they took batting practice this year and I have
to wonder what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see so many good pitches just jumping off the bat. I'm
talking about a pitcher throwing a nasty 1-2 slider down and away
and the hitter just barely getting the head of the bat to it and
lining it through the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not the ball, though. Maybe it's stronger, bigger
hitters, who lift weights and train year-round. Maybe it's the
ultra-hard bats manufacturers are now supplying. ``Some of them
don't even look like wood,'' Oates said. Maybe it's the new, tiny
ballparks with 370-foot power alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the point is where you become saturated with
so much scoring, so many home runs, that people become bored with
it,'' Oates said. ``The offensive explosion we're seeing now is
kind of like this wind: I keep thinking it'll die down
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Oates said, baseball will know when it's time to act to
restore balance to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the batter will start out with one strike,'' Oates
suggested. ``Or just have two outs an inning. Bring the mound in
six feet. Widen the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe get really radical and actually call the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the old rock-'em, sock-'em Rangers are back,
and maybe just in time.

AYALA SEEMS TO HAVE HIS LIFE TURNED AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Just another typical weekend coming up in
the local jock kingdom. It's a busy combo platter of Rangers in
Arlington against the Orioles, Stars in Denver for Game 3 against
the Avalanche, and, of course, the annual margarita marathon at
Colonial Country Club, where the less-adventurous can also watch
PGA guys play golf for big money.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of an intriguing story line, however, all of
the above pales dramatically when compared to what's going on at
Will Rogers Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ayala Jr. fights in Fort Worth tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has made preliminary inquiries about buying the rights
to the life and times of a former bad guy trying to go good, but
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has come along we're comfortable with,'' said Ayala
yesterday. ``I think for the most part, people are waiting to see
how this story turns out. Do I win a world title, or do I go back
to prison? That seems to be the only two things that matter to
everyone except me.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does matter to maybe the greatest boxing talent ever to
come out of Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Ayala: ``Family. Friends. Money in the bank. Owning a home
that's paid for. And then being able to someday fade into the
sunset and always live happily ever after. I need boxing for some
of that, but I don't need boxing to live a happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   On a wind-blown afternoon at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie,
Ayala was advancing his Friday night fight with a media conference
and public workout.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious question:
</P>
<P>
   Is this just another ex-con skillfully working a master con?
</P>
<P>
   Obvious answer:
</P>
<P>
   Spend 20 minutes or so with Ayala, listen to what he has to say,
and then tell me you don't come away impressed. And a believer.
</P>
<P>
   Some haven't. His parole officer in New Jersey said if Ayala
returned to the boxing world, he would end up back in prison. The
head of the parole board in New Jersey said two years ago that
Ayala was still every bit the danger to society, if not more so,
that he was when he was sentenced to prison in 1983. Parole was
rejected at that time.
</P>
<P>
   No research was needed to dig up what the parole officer or the
prison board chairman had to say about Ayala. Tony tells that
himself, matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala is 37 years old now. Go back 20 years, at age 17, and Tony
Jr. was already a world championship waiting to happen in the
boxing world. Ayala hails from a famous San Antonio family of
fighters. He was the special one, however. Even so, the word was
also on the street that Tony Jr. would never make it. Here was a
bad kid, getting worse all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If none of this had happened in my life, I'd have gone ahead
and won the world title, defended it successfully once, and then
been dead within 12 months,'' Ayala said yesterday. ``I was totally
out of control. Suicidal, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala had a problem, among other things, with booze, heroin and
women. ``But mainly my problem was a lack of self-esteem,'' he
said. Having moved from Texas to New Jersey, Ayala was charged with
raping a 19-year-old neighbor on New Year's Day 1983. The sentence
was 35 years in prison, with a minimum of 15 years before being
eligible for parole. Ayala served 16 hard years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his was a shocking crime for such a high-profile
member of the jock kingdom. But Ayala was a boxer. Only boxers
seemed capable of such behavior. Only boxers seemed to end up in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today's sports page headlines tell a much different story, of
course. Two NFL players currently charged with murder. Another with
raping a 17-year-old. ``Athletes aren't exempt from making bad
mistakes,'' said Ayala. ``We have our problems like anyone else.
The exposure factor in the media is what has changed. But that also
goes all the way to the presidency, doesn't it? No one is protected
anymore when it comes to the media looking the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once released from prison (on April 20, 1999), Ayala was back in
the gym the next day, resuming a boxing career on hold for 17
years. Friday night will be his fifth fight in the comeback
attempt. Eventually, he hopes it leads him to Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison was a lifesaver for me,'' said Ayala. ``I deeply regret
what I did to people. I regret victimizing my victim. I got what I
deserved when I went to prison. I'm thankful, however, for this
second chance. I'm thankful I'm sitting here with a six-figure
income, talking to reporters. How many ex-cons get that kind of
opportunity? I want to talk to anyone who will listen, just to tell
them about how I went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what I've done to myself, being able to box again is
like being in an amusement park. Boxing is important. Winning is
important. Making money is important. But the rest of my life
doesn't depend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   This busy weekend in the local jock kingdom has many different
story angles. But nothing else comes close to where Tony Ayala Jr.
has been, and where he hopes to go.

ROY, STARS IN A CHESS MATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars winger Kirk Muller learned a little
something in his almost four seasons in Montreal with Colorado
goalie Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be careful with Patty,'' Muller said. ``He's pretty
good at making it look like there are some infractions going on
when maybe it's him doing the bumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is definitely bumping, and referees are definitely
noticing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the Western Conference Finals,
one-fourth of the penalties called on the Stars came against Roy.
In Game 1, four of the 10 penalties on Colorado and the Stars were
for bumping or interfering with the goalies.
</P>
<P>
   All the face time prompted the referees to warn players from
both teams before Game 2 that it was OK to look at the goalies,
they just can't touch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Game 2, we were told it was going to be called on both
teams,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said. ``We know they're calling
it, and that doesn't work on Patrick, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Which hasn't stopped them from trying.
</P>
<P>
   Or Roy from taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they purposely go in front of people and get in guys'
ways,'' Stars captain and defenseman Derian Hatcher said. ``If the
guy even touches them, they call it. ... You shake your head, yeah.
That's all you can do. You can argue with the refs all you want,
but it doesn't do you a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Stars leave Roy free to roam?
</P>
<P>
   Only if they want to get beat. Badly.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous isn't an emotion Roy feels even if he gets caught behind
the net with a Stars player swooping in on him. Roy, much like
Stars goalie Ed Belfour, relishes venturing from his net, playing
the puck and starting the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a defenseman,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``If
you rush him, and you force him to make a play he's not comfortable
making, then we're able to feed off that and pick them off along
the boards or along the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does one rush him without bumping him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very carefully,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the invisible line the Stars walk every game. They can't
get too close to Roy. They can't stay too far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a chance to whack his stick or get body position on
him, that's what we're going to do,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. ``What we're not going to do is go out there and
intentionally bump him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean Roy can't make it look as if] they have.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Muller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember during the regular season that goal called back for
interference? They said I got Roy,'' Muller said. ``But Patty, he's
pretty good. I was there, and well, you know ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't exactly know how to say Roy was a good flopper without
saying the word flop, which isn't a compliment in the hockey world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you mean he's a good actor?'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``So is Eddie. They are both very good. They both
have careers post playing.''
</P>
<P>
   All the ice is a stage, and they're just players.

CATALANOTTO HAS QUITE A DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Frank Catalanotto had the kind of game yesterday
that you laugh about later.
</P>
<P>
   Not because it's funny _ five hits in a game is serious stuff.
It's just that some days, it seems as if you can't do anything
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was one of those days for Catalanotto, who used a
fill-in day at first base to collect a career-high five hits in an
11-6 victory against Tampa Bay at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-to-smile Catalanotto, three days removed from the
disabled list, didn't escape some kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teased him about it the last time he got to first,''
first-base coach Bucky Dent said. ``I said, `Cat, you trying?' He
said, `Yeah, I'm trying.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto hita run-scoring single and scored in the first
inning, singled to shortstop in the third inning, singled to center
in the fourth, singled to right-center in the sixth and singled to
right in the eighth. He was flawless in the field, too, receiving
the first two putouts of the game and making the last out with a
backhanded grab and toss to first off a grounder by Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   Just another 1.000 hitting and fielding day for the 26-year-old,
a regular second baseman who in 41 career games at first base is
error-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``At second base you're involved, but at first base, you really
have to concentrate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration began in earnest for Catalanotto about an hour
before yesterday's game, when he learned David Segui would miss his
start at first base because of a virus. Catalanotto moved into
Segui's No. 5 position in the batting order, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel like I was going to get beat,'' he said.
``Even when I had two strikes, I thought I'd be able to hit the
ball and put it in play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first start of the season at first base for
Catalanotto, who came off the disabled list Monday and appeared as
a pinch hitter on Tuesday. He walked in that plate appearance, and
his five hits yesterday gave him eight consecutive _ tying a club
record last accomplished by Ivan Rodriguez in July 1993.
Catalanotto has also reached base 10 consecutive times, moving
within one of the club record.
</P>
<P>
   His batting average, .500 when he was placed on the DL, is now
.586 (17-for-29). Maybe the DL isn't such a bad place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. Some guys come off the DL and they just start off
hot,'' Catalanotto said. ``Maybe the time off helped mentally. The
last three weeks, I've been able to go home and study tapes of
myself hitting and the pitchers I'm going to be facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the crowd of reporters that buzzed around his locker,
Catalanotto leaned back in his chair, folded his hands across his
stomach, and thought about his day. But one more question: ``Did
you do anything different today?''
</P>
<P>
   Another smile leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you what it was, but I can't,'' he said.
``It was just one of those things.''

TRAINER LIKES RED BULLET'S NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Because of the way Fusaichi Pegasus dominated the
Kentucky Derby, the numbers have dwindled at the Preakness Stakes _
19 horses raced in the Derby, and eight are entered in the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, trainer of Preakness entrant Red Bullet, said the
numbers better keep dwindling or Fusaichi Pegasus is in trouble in
Saturday's race at Pimlico Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers Orseno is talking about are the nationally
distributed performance figures formulated by a group of East
Coast-based handicappers. Also known as the ``sheets,'' they assign
a numerical value to a horse's performance. The numbers factor in
considerations such as the running time of the race and how it
compares to other times at similar races. Wind speed, wind
direction and the position a horse raced on the track also are
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the number, the stronger the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno said Fusaichi Pegasus was assigned a 21/2 when he won the
Wood Memorial by four lengths over Red Bullet, who was assigned a
5. Red Bullet skipped the Derby, where Fusaichi Pegasus recorded
another 21/2, according to Orseno, who has read the sheets long
enough to know the amount of times a horse can repeat a superior
number such as 21/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too often,'' he said. ``And to come back and do it two
weeks later will be very hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Orseno said that Fusaichi Pegasus won't be able to get by
with an inferior number to win the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing my horse and where we're at, yeah, he'll have to run a
21/2 or 3 to win,'' Orseno said of Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons Orseno is so confident in Red Bullet. He
said the colt can run better than he did in the Wood, and the five
weeks between the Wood and the Preakness gives him a better chance
at improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't his peak race,'' Orseno said.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno said Red Bullet got tired in the stretch because jockey
Alex Solis made a quick decision to send him after the pacesetter
rather than hold him back in reserve and risk traffic problems
later in the race. But he still had enough to finish 11/2 lengths
ahead of Aptitude, and that should grab some attention. Aptitude,
after all, ran second by 11/2 lengths to Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Red Bullet's challenge against Fusaichi Pegasus look
intriguing. But there's enough history to work against him. A horse
that skipped the Derby hasn't won the Preakness since Deputed
Testimony did it 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno said he and owner Frank Stronach let Red Bullet skip the
Derby because the Wood took a lot out of him. He's at the Preakness
because Orseno and Stronach want him to be selected champion
3-year-old at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody has skipped the Derby with a horse
that has this kind of talent,'' Orseno said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it's over, Orseno said the numbers will bear that out.

 &HT;    Avs' Bourque thankful for run at Cup
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The telephone call followed nearly two months of
agonizing. It came after two months of wondering whether the Boston
Bruins were a hopeless cause and whether the idea that he could
awaken his 39-year-old legs was equally hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque didn't necessarily want to leave Boston after nearly
21 seasons as much as he wondered if there was a life away from the
Charles River. So he made the call.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, the Hall-of-Famer-in-waiting called Bruins general
manager Harry Sinden at the meeting of NHL general managers in
California and uttered the two words few thought possible: Trade
me.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, he got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is,'' Bourque said Wednesday, ``if I
finished the year in Boston, I probably would've called it quits.
But I wanted to be traded for two reasons. I wanted to find out if
I could play at a certain level again, and I wanted to make a good
run at the Cup. Because of the way I've played and the way things
have gone this year, there's a very good possibility I'll be
playing again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque only hopes that when he does retire, he will do so with
a ring on his finger and his name engraved on the Stanley Cup. He
hasn't been this close in awhile. Colorado general manager Pierre
Lacroix acquired Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk, two well-aged
veterans in search of a title, for a significant portion of the
Avalanche's future: Brian Rolston, two top prospects and a
first-round draft choice. Lacroix's mind-set was the same as
Bourque's: Win now.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs mostly have won since the March 6 trade. A skilled but
erratic club before the deal, Colorado went 12-2-1 to close the
season and is 9-3 in the playoffs, including a split of the first
two games against Dallas in the Western Conference finals, which
resume Friday.

<P>
   Bourque has missed the past four games _ the final two of the
Detroit series and the two against the Stars _ because of a knee
injury; the details have been kept quiet. But Wednesday, after
going through a full practice, including he confirmed that he will
be back in the lineup for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For any other player, it might mean a spot shift. For Bourque,
it will mean playing on Colorado's No. 1 defensive pair, anchoring
the power play and killing penalties _ probably 30 minutes of
action. At this point, his return is not merely welcomed but is
almost mandated.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs have lost defenseman Adam Foote with an eye injury for
at least one game. Another defenseman, Sandis Ozolinsh, practiced
despite a ``bruised foot,'' but team officials have followed the
NHL tradition of being misleading about injuries so often that many
people think that he, too, has a knee injury and might not play.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's injury initially was identified as a foot problem and
then changed to a knee. ``I just banged up my knee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is that he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace him,'' Colorado forward Dave Reid said.
``He's such a calming influence back there because of the
experience he brings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bourque trade ``was like a wake-up call for everybody,''
Reid said. ``We weren't playing that great, but when he came,
everybody knew it was time to get serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Hartley said: ``He changed our team totally. I've
never seen a trade where a guy has fit in so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Miller might be paired with Bourque on defense. ``It's not
like he had to carry the team on his shoulders,'' Miller said. ``We
already had a lot of talent here. But he solidified things.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute answer is the Cup. Bourque reached the finals twice
with Boston, in 1988 and 1990. Both times, the Bruins lost to
Edmonton. Because of recent personnel decisions, he knew they
weren't going back any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for a contender again rejuvenated Bourque, who had 14
points, including eight goals, in 14 games with Colorado to close
the regular season. He also turned the team's power play into the
league's best.
</P>
<P>
   But being this close to the finals and sitting out hasn't been
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but I knew the injury was minor, in terms of not
being out for the rest of the playoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque reached icon status in Boston, so it follows that there
are a number of converted Colorado fans along the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there a lot of fans cheering for me in Boston,'' he
said. ``Whenever I call back to Boston and talk to some of my
buddies, they tell me about all of the interest people have.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular jersey in Boston now is a half-Bruins,
half-Avalanche stitch job with Bourque's name and No. 77 on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who made them is from New Hampshire, and he's a Bruins
season-ticket holder,'' Bourque said. ``I met him and signed two
jerseys for him. I thought it was pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the mixed jersey, Bourque had mixed emotions about the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who asked for it,'' he said. ``But when it
happens, you deal with a lot of different emotions. I've never been
through it before.
</P>
<P>
   Being apart from his wife and children has been difficult. But
the journey, Bourque said, has been worth it. After this season, he
will be an unrestricted free agent, but thoughts of the Stanley Cup
take priority. Everybody else seems to know it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's people you'd like to see have a Cup, he's one of
them,'' Dallas' Brett Hull said. ``But we're not going to lay down
for him.''

THESTREET.COM THREATENS TO CANCEL ITS OWN SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When James J. Cramer, the co-founder of
TheStreet.com, went on TheStreet.com's cable television program and
plugged TheStreet.com's own stock, he set off a battle over the
ethics of stock promotion that may result in the cancellation of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual war of news releases Wednesday,
TheStreet.com announced that it was canceling its program, which
appears each weekend on Fox News Channel, a cable channel. Fox
fired back that TheStreet.com had no right to cancel it, and
TheStreet.com said it would keep producing the program for an
undetermined period.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox and TheStreet.com were exchanging salvos, Cramer was
said by his office to be unavailable because he was attending his
daughter's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was set off by a program taped April 14 and
broadcast April 15, the weekend after the Nasdaq stock market
suffered its worst day ever. Cramer, who is a hedge-fund manager as
well as a commentator for TheStreet.com, mentioned a number of
stocks, including American Home Products Corp., which he said was
his biggest stock position and one he was buying.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a commercial, Cramer was asked for another forecast.
He replied, ``Stock that's near and dear to my heart that I own a
lot of is stock called TheStreet.com. I've watched it go from $70
to $5. I think it's done going down because it's got $4.75 in
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox left that in when it broadcast the program, but put a notice
on the screen that Cramer was the largest shareholder and a
co-founder of TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   The comment brought immediate criticism. Dave Kansas, the editor
in chief of TheStreet.com, published a column the next day on
TheStreet.com Web site criticizing Cramer for making the comment
and noting that before the program was taped he had refused to say
what he planned to recommend, as participants usually did. ``I
don't like Cramer or anyone else discussing our stock on the show
or on the site,'' Kansas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 26, The Daily News of New York printed an article
in which an unnamed Fox spokesman criticized Cramer. ``Despite
offering full disclosure of his ownership position, we do not
approve of the touting of stock for personal gain on the air,'' the
spokesman was quoted as saying. The article quoted Cramer as saying
there was no personal gain because he had no intention of selling
any shares.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in announcing that TheStreet.com was canceling the
program, Thomas Clarke, the chief executive of TheStreet.com, said
that amounted to a breach of contract because Fox has unilaterally
changed policies regarding the program.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to The Daily News article as being a statement of
Fox's new policy, which he said went beyond TheStreet.com's policy
of requiring that all participants disclose any interests they have
in stocks they discuss. ``It would be interesting to know if they
had the policy for their other shows, where people come on and talk
about stocks without any disclosure,'' Clarke said in an interview,
speaking of Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Diane Brandi, a Fox News vice president,
replied that it was ``an absurd premise. We do not announce
policies in The Daily News.'' She declined to say just what the
station's policy was, or whether it allowed Cramer to recommend
stocks his hedge fund owns, as he regularly does.
</P>
<P>
   But she did say that Cramer, who has not appeared on the program
since the incident, would be in violation of his contract with Fox
if he did not appear this weekend, since his contract called for a
minimum number of annual appearances. Clarke said that the program
would be taped, as part of an orderly shutdown of the broadcast,
but that Cramer would not appear. Fox has two separate contracts,
one with TheStreet.com to make the program and another with Cramer
providing for him to appear on it and limiting his appearances on
other networks.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other things at work here. In the days after Cramer
recommended the stock on Fox, he appeared on a Cable News Network
program and then on NBC's ``Today'' show. Brandi said those
appearances violated his contract with Fox. Clarke speculated that
Fox's anger over those appearances had led Fox to criticize Cramer
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   One person on the Fox side, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the affair might somehow be related to a Fox refusal in March
to invest more money in TheStreet.com, in which Fox now owns a 1.6
percent stake. Clarke said he had sought a greater strategic
alliance with Fox, but said he had not done so because
TheStreet.com needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   While Cramer was not available for comment, his assistant at his
hedge fund issued a statement saying Cramer ``is totally on board
with TheStreet.com's decision. We were proud of the show, but it
didn't work out as we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Street.com went public last May at $19 a share and traded as
high as $71.25 the first day. But it soon slid, and reached its low
of $5.50 on April 14, the day Cramer made his comments. Wednesday
it rose 87.5 cents, to $7.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. owns a 6.3 percent stake in TheStreet.com
and operates a joint newsroom with it that files articles for the
Web sites of both TheStreet.com and The New York Times.

(Eds: `Dinosaur' review follows) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney's new computer-animated Jurassic jewel of a movie,
``Dinosaur,'' looks so astoundingly real that it seems to have put
the studio's feature animation president, Thomas Schumacher, into a
mild state of denial. Ask Schumacher any sort of question that
compares ``Dinosaur'' with past Disney animated efforts, and the
outgoing executive will wave it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that it's not animated,'' Schumacher says.
``It's a big action film coming from the Walt Disney company. This
is not what people are used to seeing us do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Dinosaur,'' with its jaw-dropping meshing of
computer-generated images and real backgrounds, is a technical
breakthrough, even if its story recycles elements from ``Tarzan,''
``The Lion King'' and the classic John Wayne western ``Red River.''
To create the movie, Disney sank a fortune into turning the old
Lockheed Skunk Works development lab in Burbank (it's where the
stealth bomber was created) into a state-of-the-art digital
facility that the studio is already using on nearly a dozen other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make a movie and build an animation facility at the
same time,'' producer Pam Marsden says. ``We tried not to think
about it that way, though,'' adds co-producer Baker Bloodworth.
``Otherwise, our heads would have popped off.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was plenty of time for that. When Marsden came on
board the project in 1994, the technology to make the movie didn't
even exist. Her job, which began as a six-month assignment and
lasted six-plus years, was to find out if it was even possible to
tell a feature-length story using computer-generated dinosaurs.
(``This was before `Toy Story' came out,'' Marsden says. ``We knew
we could create the images, but we didn't know if we could create
characters that could act.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur's'' days at Disney actually date back to 1988, when
the studio purchased a screenplay by ``Wild Bunch'' writer Walon
Green that was intended to be a ``Godzilla''-style buddy picture.
Director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers'') and stop-motion
genius Phil Tippett were attached for a time, but the project
languished until it moved over to feature animation.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marsden's test proved a success, she took her results to
Disney chairman Michael Eisner. After comparing the digital
dinosaurs against computer-generated backgrounds and miniature
backgrounds, she was certain that the creatures would play best in
photo-real settings. The problem was, in 1996, nobody had ever done
anything like that before.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner OK'd the capital investment in a new digital animation
facility, the Secret Lab (the name is more of a nod to Disney's
legendary furtiveness than to the building's Lockheed roots), a
move he says is designed to continue ``the culture and heritage
which stands for the name Disney.'' Eisner's one demand: The
dinosaurs in the movie had to talk. (The creative team held the
line when it came to singing and dancing, however.)
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers sent crews to Australia, Venezuela, Jordan,
Samoa, Hawaii, the Mojave desert and the Los Angeles Arboretum to
shoot the varied landscapes featured in the movie. From there, the
filmmakers enhanced the backdrops and inserted the dinosaurs, a
painstaking integration process that required some 900 animators,
most of whom had to be trained in the art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We labored over every frame of this movie, making sure the
lighting and the compositing looked as real as possible,'' says
Ralph Zondag, who co-directed the movie with fellow Glendale
resident Eric Leighton. ``In many cases, we were learning as we
went along, and in the five years we spent on the movie, we made
some technological leaps on the computer that made things a lot
easier than when we started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we used will probably be obsolete in two years,''
Leighton says, laughing (ruefully?). ``That's how fast the
technology is moving. Hopefully, though, the movie will hold up
like, say, `King Kong' did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is saying exactly how much money Disney spent building
the studio and making the film. Given the extraordinary start-up
and training costs, ``Dinosaur'' is certainly the most expensive
animated movie in history. One source pegs the cost at $200
million, not including the vast expenditures for the new animation
facility. Suffice it to say, the studio needs to sell a vast number
of tickets to recoup its costs.
</P>
<P>
   This being Disney, that shouldn't be too tall an order. While
other studios struggle to sell their big-ticket animated movies to
audiences (Fox, DreamWorks and Warner Bros. have pretty spotty
track records), Disney continues to enjoy hit after hit. Schumacher
says the studio's formula is pretty simple: It's the story, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are choosing the movie they want to go to, not the
genre they want to see,'' Schumacher says. ``So you can make an
animated movie like `Pokemon' and then you can spend many more
times that making a movie like the one that just came out (`The
Road to El Dorado') and nobody went. Why is one successful and the
other not? The story has got to pull people in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur's'' story is vintage Disney, a mixture of
up-with-people humanism and zany comic schtick. And while the
dinosaurs are pretty realistic, directors Zondag and Leighton admit
they took certain liberties with the main reptilian, an iguanodon
named Aladar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cheated a lot to make him much more bifocal, taking the
mouth and moving it closer to the eyes,'' Leighton says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically dino-horse,'' Zondag adds. ``Because when you
think of a horse, you think of a certain nobility and strength. And
we thought, if we're going to make an herbivore our lead, we've got
to find a shape that symbolically gives the audience a sense of
nobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbivores usually don't receive top billing in dinosaur movies,
playing second fiddle to those flesh-eating tyrannosaur terrors. In
``Dinosaur,'' the T-rex is absent, replaced by a close second
cousin, the carnotaur, who, much like a character in a Tarantino
movie, seems to kill just for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The T-rex has been done to death,'' Leighton says. ``There are
so many dinosaurs to choose from, we wanted to explore some new
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnotaurs' mayhem also brought ``Dinosaur'' into some new
territory for Disney _ PG country. Most of the carnage is implied
rather than seen, but there are enough frights to give some parents
pause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's OK for any child 5 years and older,'' producer
Marsden says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Leighton: ``We didn't want to scare our entire audience out
of the theaters, but at the same time, we're dealing with
realistic-looking dinosaurs and with that, there's the assumption
that you're going to see some aggression. Besides, when you think
of dinosaurs, you think of big teeth. We had to have a little
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher calls the PG rating entirely appropriate, but he
doesn't think ``Dinosaur'' is much more intense than ``Tarzan'' or
``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about your kid,'' Schumacher says. ``(Miramax
co-chairman) Harvey Weinstein went to the premiere of `Tarzan' and
the next day he calls me and says, `Boy, I loved the movie, but it
was too intense for my daughter. You guys went too far with this
one.' And I said, `Harvey, in your movies, you blow people's brains
up all over the windshields.' So, like I said, it depends on your
sensibility.'' &QL;

 By ERIC SCHMITT with DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Committees in the House and the Senate
overwhelmingly endorsed the administration's China trade bill on
Wednesday, contributing to a growing sense that the ardently
contested measure was headed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would permanently grant China normal trading
privileges, also got a plug from Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who renewed his call
on lawmakers to set aside their partisan differences and back the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
warned lawmakers that rejecting the China bill ``invites a future
of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, half a dozen previously uncommitted House
Republicans and Democrats announced they would support the
legislation, a necessary step for American companies to benefit
fully from a market-opening accord that paves the way for China to
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional backers of the
measure said they believe they might be close to the 218 votes
needed for passage in the House when the bill comes to a vote next
week, though they continued their heated campaign for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're looking for insurance votes,'' said one
administration official. But the U.S. Trade Representative,
Charlene Barshefsky, said, ``the situation is still fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's House Ways and Means Committee vote, four
previously undeclared Democrats joined an overwhelming vote, 34-4,
in favor of the measure. Earlier in the day, the Senate Finance
Committee approved the legislation, 18-1. Both committees have
jurisdiction over trade bills, and supporters of the China bill
hailed the lopsided results for building momentum toward next
week's House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and other
administration officials continued to buttonhole wavering members
of Congress on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also said they plan to seek air time from
the major television networks to allow Clinton to address the
nation on Sunday night about the China bill's importance, not only
to American farmers, high-tech companies and manufacturers, but
also for the country's long-term national security. Officials at
CBS, ABC and NBC said Wednesday night that they had not yet been
contacted by the White House with the request.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, critics of the measure downplayed the committee
votes as preordained, and insisted that their campaign to focus on
Beijing's poor record on human rights, religious freedom,
environmental standards and earlier trade accords, was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we value trade, but we will never trade in our
values,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's
chief Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said they would intensify their lobbying of
fence-sitters during the last weekend before the vote. Opponents
cited reports from an official Chinese newspaper Wednesday that
threatened war with Taiwan if the island's president-elect, Chen
Shui-bian, does not commit to a ``one-China'' policy in his
inaugural speech this weekend. One senior Clinton administration
official said this week that ``we're very worried about the
weekend'' because the Chinese ``have a long record of saying just
the wrong thing, or doing something stupid, at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was a day for the China measure's supporters to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   To attract Democrats with heavy union constituencies, the Ways
and Means Committee amended its bill by including a provision of
the final trade accord negotiated last November to protect American
industries from a surge in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow the International Trade Commission,
and then the president, to halt the import of Chinese goods _ from
steel to computers to a range of other products _ if they are being
shipped into the United States ``in such increased quantities or
under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market
disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly
competitive products.''
</P>
<P>
   That provision, coupled with the endorsement by the committee's
ranking Democrat, Charles B. Rangel of New York, seemed to provide
the final push for four committee Democrats who had been undecided
to vote for the bill: Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Karen L.
Thurman of Florida, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Benjamin L. Cardin
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But the new provision may also plant the seeds of new American
tensions with China. The definition of what constitutes a ``surge''
of imports is always a matter of dispute, and China would almost
certainly take any American efforts to limit its imports to the
court of the World Trade Organization for adjudication. Because it
is not a WTO member now, it has not been able to challenge such
rulings, including a recent one blocking imports of Chinese steel.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said Wednesday that she was not worried about such
challenges. ``The Chinese know what they agreed to in November,''
she said, ``and they understood we had to have the ability to stop
import surges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is approved, it will end the need for annual renewal
of China's trading status by Congress, an event that prompted
heated debate over the country's human rights record and its
threats against Taiwan. Every year Congress approved the trade
status, even after the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square. But
opponents of the measure say that by dropping the linkage between
how China treats dissidents and its ability to trade with the
United States, Congress will be giving up leverage over the
government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   To appease some of the opponents, Democrats and Republicans are
finalizing plans for a permanent commission that will review
China's human rights record annually. But labor unions and other
opponents say the commission would be toothless because it only has
the power to make public its findings, something the State
Department does anyway in its annual human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to winning over some wavering Democrats, the White
House picked up the support of three uncommitted Republicans: Rick
Hill of Montana, Tillie Fowler of Florida and Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Some vote-counters had already included Hill and Fowler in their
tallies, but Hyde was a coup because he has consistently voted
against upgrading China's trade status in Congress' annual review.
All the Democrats from Illinois are voting against the pact,
despite heavy lobbying from Barshefsky and Daley, both Chicago
natives.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and their congressional allies said
they now may be less than 10 votes shy of the 218 needed for
passage in the House. Republicans are expected to provide at least
150 of the votes needed for passage, although two administration
officials predicted that they will get more.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters, while sounding upbeat that they could win
70 votes from their ranks, still voiced caution, especially after a
few unexpected defections this week, such as Rep. Bob Clement of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' said Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., a
chief vote-counter for the bill. ``It's getting harder and
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two-thirds of 211 House Democrats are likely to vote
against the measure, but Democratic critics of China's record on
human rights, worker standards and environmental protections were
vastly outnumbered Wednesday in the pro-trade Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the panel's 16 Democrats voted against the measure:
Pete Stark of California, William J. Coyne of Pennsylvania, John
Lewis of Georgia and Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin. A fifth
Democratic foe, Michael R. McNulty of New York, was absent for the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to trade with China,'' Kleczka
said, ``but I don't want to fling open the doors of this country
and never have a review again.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, all members of the Senate Finance Committee,
except Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., voted for the measure. Jeffords
said he was protesting the continued imprisonment of Ngawang
Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar at
Middlebury College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of China, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., voted for
the trade bill, but also introduced a separate bill to monitor
Beijing's proliferation of missile technology and other advanced
weaponry.

   Early on in the crass new gross-fest, ``Road Trip,'' MTV's Tom
Green (an acquired taste if ever there was one) is leading a group
of prospective college students around the campus of New York's
Ithaca College. While on the tour, Green (basically playing
himself), regales the gathering with the story that is ``Road
Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   At the point in the tale where a group of young co-eds are seen
standing topless around a shower area, a woman interrupts Green,
admonishing him that ``girls just don't stand around topless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they do,'' Green shoots back. ``It's my story. And in my
story girls DO stand around topless.''
</P>
<P>
   That basically sums up ``Road Trip,'' which is essentially
another slice of last year's ``American Pie,'' only now the
aimless, partying high school seniors have become aimless, partying
college students. The movie manages to go one better than ``Pie's''
famous baked goods scene, featuring a veritable compendium of lewd
behavior. There are jokes involving anal probes and sperm banks, an
unbelievable restaurant scene featuring some horribly tainted
French toast, a talking dog, a pot-smoking senior citizen, a
rodent-licking man and various digs at the fat and the blind. In
other words, those with delicate sensibilities should stay at home
or go see ``Up at the Villa.''
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who has seen ``Animal House'' a dozen times and
still laughs at the scene where Belushi impersonates a zit, ``Road
Trip'' will probably seem like a journey well worth taking. The
``Animal House'' connection is certainly evident here, both in the
screenplay (credited to director Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong)
and in the fact that ``Animal House'' producer Ivan Reitman is on
board as executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Road Trip'' lifts several scenes straight out of
``Animal House,'' most notably when the boys show up on the
doorstep of an African-American fraternity house. But we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves here. The movie follows Josh (Breckin
Meyer) and his Ithaca buddies as they hurtle from upstate New York
to Austin, Texas, to retrieve a videotape that was inadvertently
mailed to Josh's childhood sweetheart, Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard).
</P>
<P>
   The video features Josh having sex with an Ithaca classmate, the
beautiful Beth (winningly played by Amy Smart from TV's
``Felicity''). Going along for the ride with Josh are the
outrageous E.L. (Seann William Scott, who played Stifler in
``American Pie''), the thoughtful, pot-smoking Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo) and uber-geek Kyle (D.J. Qualls, a true comic find), a
shrinking string bean who's thoughtfully invited along since he
happens to own the car they're taking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at Ithaca, Rubin leaves Green's character, an
eighth-year college student, in charge of feeding his pet boa
constrictor. The boys' misadventures, tasteless as they are, are
carried off with the same breezy, sweet-natured sensibility that
made ``American Pie'' such a hit last summer. Deep down, the boys
all have good hearts, and the girls just want to have sex, a
fantasy world with understandable appeal to young people of both
genders.
</P>
<P>
   Such subtext though tends to get lost in the shuffle somewhere
about the time when Green begins tonguing the mouse. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Committees in the House and the Senate
overwhelmingly endorsed the administration's China trade bill on
Wednesday, contributing to a growing sense that the ardently
contested measure was headed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would permanently grant China normal trading
privileges, also got a plug from Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who renewed his call
on lawmakers to set aside their partisan differences and back the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
warned lawmakers that rejecting the China bill ``invites a future
of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, half a dozen previously uncommitted House
Republicans and Democrats announced they would support the
legislation, a necessary step for American companies to benefit
fully from a market-opening accord that paves the way for China to
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional backers of the
measure said they believe they might be close to the 218 votes
needed for passage in the House when the bill comes to a vote next
week, though they continued their heated campaign for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're looking for insurance votes,'' said one
administration official. But the U.S. Trade Representative,
Charlene Barshefsky, said, ``the situation is still fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's House Ways and Means Committee vote, four
previously undeclared Democrats joined an overwhelming vote, 34-4,
in favor of the measure. Earlier in the day, the Senate Finance
Committee approved the legislation, 18-1. Both committees have
jurisdiction over trade bills, and supporters of the China bill
hailed the lopsided results for building momentum toward next
week's House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and other
administration officials continued to buttonhole wavering members
of Congress on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also said they plan to seek air time from
the major television networks to allow Clinton to address the
nation on Sunday night about the China bill's importance, not only
to American farmers, high-tech companies and manufacturers, but
also for the country's long-term national security. Officials at
CBS, ABC and NBC said Wednesday night that they had not yet been
contacted by the White House with the request.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, critics of the measure downplayed the committee
votes as preordained, and insisted that their campaign to focus on
Beijing's poor record on human rights, religious freedom,
environmental standards and earlier trade accords, was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we value trade, but we will never trade in our
values,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's
chief Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said they would intensify their lobbying of
fence-sitters during the last weekend before the vote. Opponents
cited reports from an official Chinese newspaper Wednesday that
threatened war with Taiwan if the island's president-elect, Chen
Shui-bian, does not commit to a ``one-China'' policy in his
inaugural speech this weekend. One senior Clinton administration
official said this week that ``we're very worried about the
weekend'' because the Chinese ``have a long record of saying just
the wrong thing, or doing something stupid, at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was a day for the China measure's supporters to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   To attract Democrats with heavy union constituencies, the Ways
and Means Committee amended its bill by including a provision of
the final trade accord negotiated last November to protect American
industries from a surge in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow the International Trade Commission,
and then the president, to halt the import of Chinese goods _ from
steel to computers to a range of other products _ if they are being
shipped into the United States ``in such increased quantities or
under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market
disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly
competitive products.''
</P>
<P>
   That provision, coupled with the endorsement by the committee's
ranking Democrat, Charles B. Rangel of New York, seemed to provide
the final push for four committee Democrats who had been undecided
to vote for the bill: Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Karen L.
Thurman of Florida, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Benjamin L. Cardin
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But the new provision may also plant the seeds of new American
tensions with China. The definition of what constitutes a ``surge''
of imports is always a matter of dispute, and China would almost
certainly take any American efforts to limit its imports to the
court of the World Trade Organization for adjudication. Because it
is not a WTO member now, it has not been able to challenge such
rulings, including a recent one blocking imports of Chinese steel.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said Wednesday that she was not worried about such
challenges. ``The Chinese know what they agreed to in November,''
she said, ``and they understood we had to have the ability to stop
import surges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is approved, it will end the need for annual renewal
of China's trading status by Congress, an event that prompted
heated debate over the country's human rights record and its
threats against Taiwan. Every year Congress approved the trade
status, even after the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square. But
opponents of the measure say that by dropping the linkage between
how China treats dissidents and its ability to trade with the
United States, Congress will be giving up leverage over the
government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   To appease some of the opponents, Democrats and Republicans are
finalizing plans for a permanent commission that will review
China's human rights record annually. But labor unions and other
opponents say the commission would be toothless because it only has
the power to make public its findings, something the State
Department does anyway in its annual human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to winning over some wavering Democrats, the White
House picked up the support of three uncommitted Republicans: Rick
Hill of Montana, Tillie Fowler of Florida and Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Some vote-counters had already included Hill and Fowler in their
tallies, but Hyde was a coup because he has consistently voted
against upgrading China's trade status in Congress' annual review.
All the Democrats from Illinois are voting against the pact,
despite heavy lobbying from Barshefsky and Daley, both Chicago
natives.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and their congressional allies said
they now may be less than 10 votes shy of the 218 needed for
passage in the House. Republicans are expected to provide at least
150 of the votes needed for passage, although two administration
officials predicted that they will get more.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters, while sounding upbeat that they could win
70 votes from their ranks, still voiced caution, especially after a
few unexpected defections this week, such as Rep. Bob Clement of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' said Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., a
chief vote-counter for the bill. ``It's getting harder and
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two-thirds of 211 House Democrats are likely to vote
against the measure, but Democratic critics of China's record on
human rights, worker standards and environmental protections were
vastly outnumbered Wednesday in the pro-trade Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the panel's 16 Democrats voted against the measure:
Pete Stark of California, William J. Coyne of Pennsylvania, John
Lewis of Georgia and Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin. A fifth
Democratic foe, Michael R. McNulty of New York, was absent for the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to trade with China,'' Kleczka
said, ``but I don't want to fling open the doors of this country
and never have a review again.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, all members of the Senate Finance Committee,
except Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., voted for the measure. Jeffords
said he was protesting the continued imprisonment of Ngawang
Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar at
Middlebury College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of China, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., voted for
the trade bill, but also introduced a separate bill to monitor
Beijing's proliferation of missile technology and other advanced
weaponry.

WIDESPREAD SELL-OFF CAUSES MARKET GUAGES TO DIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell for the first time in five sessions
Wednesday as investors took some profits from the recent run-up in
prices and re-examined the potential effect of the Federal
Reserve's half-point increase in interest rates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off was widespread, with each of the three main market
gauges falling more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But traders and analysts said the drop was understandable in
light of the market's recent gains and a clear signal from the Fed
that the rate increase _ the sixth since last June _ would probably
not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank signaled its resolve in a tough statement that
accompanied its move to raise the federal funds rate on overnight
loans between banks by 50 basis points, to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read that statement in a couple of years, you would
have no clue that the Fed had already done five tightenings,'' said
Thomas M. McManus, chief equity strategist at the Bank of America.
``So far, there is little evidence that the tightening they have
done to date has slowed the economy appreciably.''
</P>
<P>
   Market gauges opened lower and stayed that way for the entire
session. An announcement by Intel that it again intends to split
its stock and to raise its dividend at the end of July helped lift
the indexes off their lows during the afternoon, but the relief was
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 164.83 points, or 1.51
percent, to 10,769.74. Hewlett-Packard, which dropped more than 9
points; General Motors, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led
the blue-chip index down. Only four of the 30 stocks in the Dow
managed to move higher for the day. Market breadth was
distinctively negative, with declining stocks outnumbering those
advancing, 1,906 to 1,017.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which fell 2 9/16, to 58, led the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index lower. It dropped 18.24 points, or 1.24
percent, to 1,447.80.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index shed 72.61 points, or 1.95 percent,
to 3,644.96, pulled down by stocks like Cisco, Microsoft, Qualcomm
and Nextel. Over the previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained
9.8 percent. So far this year, it is down 10.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, a big winner on Tuesday, was a big loser Wednesday,
perhaps reflecting reluctance by some U.S. investors to own
foreign-controlled companies. Its stock fell 15 1/64 to 57 39/64 in
very heavy trading, after having risen 18 percent on Tuesday, when
the portal agreed to be bought in a stock swap by Terra Networks,
the Internet unit of the Spanish phone giant Telefonica. Terra's
American depository receipts fell 6 9/16, to 47.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks also took a beating. The Russell 2000 index fell
6.32 points, or 1.25 percent, to 499.66.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed remaining on the offensive, ``we will see a
trendless market for a while,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of
listed stock trading at SG Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will continue to take some money out of stocks with
high price-to-earnings multiples and put money into stocks with
reasonable prices,'' he said. ``That will create some stability in
the market, which is what Alan Greenspan really wants.''
</P>
<P>
   While broad sections of the market moved lower, financial
services stocks, widely seen as vulnerable to rising interest
rates, were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, a Dow component, rose 11/16, to 132 5/8. Citigroup
fell 5/8, to 61 1/16. Merrill Lynch gained 1/8, to 108. And Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter closed at 76, up 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's big loser, falling 9 5/16, to 130
11/16. The stock had surged nearly 10 percent over the previous
four trading days.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 13/16, to 38 1/16, after Jack Grubman, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney, lowered his earnings forecast for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco fell 2 9/16, to 58, its first decline in three sessions.
Microsoft dipped 1 13/16, to 67 11/16, after a four-day rally. And
Oracle fell 1, to 78 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel was one of a very few big technology stocks to rise. It
closed at 123 3/16, up 1 5/16. The company announced a 2-for-1
stock split, and said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 33
percent, effective July 31.
</P>
<P>
   McManus, the Bank of America strategist, said he remained
positive about the stock market, but expected the Fed to increase
interest rates again at its next meeting, on June 27-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told people this morning that it was pretty likely the Fed
would bump rates another 50 basis points in June,'' he said. ``But
I am still encouraged that the market is broadening, and that the
S&AMP;P is going up. I expect the market to remain in a trading range,
for technology stocks to continue to correct, and for some of the
other sectors that have underperformed sharply over the last year
to continue to work their way higher.''

 &HT;    Online shoe boutique work of Atlanta firm
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The unique and mystical relationship between women and
shoes has been pondered by artists for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Now an Atlanta company, RichFX, and Dallas-based luxury
department store Neiman Marcus have joined to give women one of the
most unusual virtual shoe-shopping experiences on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus and RichFX have announced a long-term strategic
partnership centered on the couture shoe collection of designer
Manolo Blahnik.
</P>
<P>
   The Blahnik shoe salon will debut this fall as a section of the
Neiman Marcus Web site (www.neimanmarcus.com). The companies will
officially premiere the Web site at the RealNetworks conference in
San Jose, Calif., next week. Financial terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers who visit the Blahnik shoe salon _ the Italian
shoemaker's only online presence _ will see the trademark Nieman
Marcus butterfly taking users into a virtual environment resembling
a scene from the computer game ``Myst,'' complete with search
functions and a shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   The user can walk through the store and select shoes to look at,
then turn them around and put them back on the shelves, just as he
or she would in real life. Shoppers in a hurry, with no time for
icons or virtual worlds, can just search for an item, then purchase
it.
</P>
<P>
   To develop the prototype for Neiman Marcus, RichFX Chief
Executive Tal Kerret and his team used the Lenox Square store as
the model for the first virtual store. But Kerret says the stores
can be customized to represent any city in the world, shown at any
time of day or night, depending on when users log on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is bringing a whole new way of shopping to
the Net,'' says Kerret. ``Most e-commerce Web sites have millions
of pages, but most people only go about three pages deep. Using the
virtual-store technology from RichFX, customers can browse an
entire store using streaming technology and even click on an item
to see closeups of fabric swatches or product labels.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Neiman Marcus could expand into other areas beyond
the Blahnik shoe salon, according to Kerret and Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Tremblay, vice president of Neiman Marcus online, says the
upscale department store first heard of RichFX from its consulting
group. After a presentation, the company started to look for a way
to use the RichFX applications on its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that we've always been on the leading edge
of fashion, and we want to be on the leading edge of technology,''
she says. ``That's what we always think about _ what we can offer
that's new and exciting and different for the customer. This is
just another opportunity to share the Neimans experience with our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay says a number of factors led Neiman Marcus to launch
the Blahnik shoe salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a very high-profile fashion designer because it was
important to us, and that's what we are all about. If we are going
to something wild and unusual and exciting, we wanted it to be with
one of our great partners, and Manolo Blahnik is a great partner.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the store has had great success selling accessories
online and that the notion of enhancing an already successful area
of the Web site seemed like a natural.
</P>
<P>
   RichFX is a new company formed by the merger of the Tel Aviv,
Israel-based WebGlide and Atlanta start-up Blue Rock Inc., which
grew out of the Georgia Tech Advanced Technology Development
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Rock developed a proprietary gift delivery and
personalization technology through its gift mail service, the
Giftmail.com Web site slated to launch this summer. Founded in
January 1999, Blue Rock is working with a number of leading
national retailers to implement the gift mail service on e-commerce
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kerret says it was the combination of the people and the
technology that made the companies decide to team up. Says Vice
President Katherine Kelley, ``We have a common base of customers
and products.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the elegant presence for Manolo Blahnik on the
Neiman Marcus site, the company has developed other applications
that could work for sporting goods stores and even online grocery
stores. Consumers could browse virtual supermarket aisles, select a
box of cereal and even read the nutritional information on the box.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay says the choice of designer shoes is an excellent way
to use this new technology. ``This is shoes as art and art on the
Web,'' she says. ``We wanted to do something that was unusual and
different that would appeal to a Web audience and the Neiman's
shopper as well.''

  All that gore _ and there's a band as well

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Once asked if he liked children, W.C. Fields retorted, ``Yes,
provided they're properly cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent time with a cantankerous 2-year-old
probably can relate to Fields' infanticidal musings. If you can't,
you may need a massive jolt of ``Shockheaded Peter,'' the
invigoratingly malicious Grand Guignol musical that's continuing
its run this week at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Little tykes have seldom been treated with more comic cruelty or
exultant theatricality than in this sly British export by way of
Manhattan. A darkly tuneful parody of those grim children's
cautionary tales that so charmed the Victorian mindset, the show
might well be subtitled, ``When Bad but Laughable Things Happen to
Disobedient Offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   The genius of ``Shockheaded Peter'' lies in its ability to make
you squirm and even flinch at its parade of brilliantly conceived
serial slayings, while giggling over its macabre excesses. In the
course of 90 ghoulishly inventive minutes, fidgety Phil's
predilection for cutlery ends in grisly demise, thumb-sucking
Conrad loses his digits to the scarifying Scissors Man, and young
Harriet the pyromaniac gets summarily flambeed.
</P>
<P>
   It says much for the splendidly primal showmanship of
``Shockheaded Peter's'' five-member creative team, and co-directors
Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch, that each of these macabre coup
de theatres is accomplished with such nuts-and-bolts storytelling
hardware as puppets, trick optical perspectives, ghastly makeup and
cleverly customized costumes (courtesy of Kevin Pollard) that can
sprout spiky hair and hideous talons, or metamorphose into
imaginary infernos of red and yellow fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The equally simple but effective props and backdrops (designed
by Crouch and Graeme Gilmour) slither across the pop-out main set
with the enigmatic creepiness of Terry Gilliam's animated ``Monty
Python'' figures. ``Shockheaded Peter'' simultaneously leaves
nothing and everything to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Structured as three stories in one, the show (which is based on
Heinrich Hoffman's classic 1844 children's book ``Struwwelpeter,''
or ``Slovenly Peter'') is narrated by a bug-eyed, corpselike master
of ceremonies played by Julian Bleach. Bleach gives an expertly
hammy turn as an incompetent, egotistically deluded Victorian
actor-manager presiding over a third-rate traveling theater company
and fighting throughout the evening to hold disaster at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Slinking, strutting, trilling his R's and shamelessly soliciting
applause, he specializes in ludicrously cryptic pronouncements
about the terrors awaiting bad children. His dissonant homilies are
backed by the Tiger Lillies, a spooky trio of squeezebox (Martyn
Jacques), percussionist (Adrian Huge) and bassist (Adrian Stout).
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a bowler hat and cadaverous makeup, singer-songwriter
Jacques delivers the show's dozen minor-key tunes in a squeeky,
officious falsetto that brings to mind a hyper-adrenal Margaret
Thatcher, most Dickensian of modern British prime ministers. His
mock-sympathetic tone builds to a hysterical, reproving bark of
``Dead! Dead! Dead!'' as he recounts the untimely fate of each
aberrant infant.
</P>
<P>
   This spirit of vengeful puritanism is echoed in the show's third
storyline, a melodrama about a morally upstanding couple who bury
their beastly baby, Shockheaded Peter, beneath the floorboards _
only to learn that it's not so easy to disavow one's own flesh and
blood, however flawed.
</P>
<P>
   As the three stories converge, the show sheds its initial
stiffness and becomes something rare and marvelous: a surprisingly
poignant burlesque with the door-slamming energy of a great sex
farce. Like Alice stepping back through the looking glass, you
emerge from ``Shockheaded Peter'' as if from a strange, slightly
terrifying dream, one not easily or willingly forgotten. &QL;

PAUL BARTEL, DIRECTOR AND STAR OF `EATING RAOUL,' DIES AT 61 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Bartel, a director, screenwriter and actor whose taste for
farce, black humor and social satire was reflected in films like
``Eating Raoul,'' ``Death Race 2000'' and ``Scenes From the Class
Struggle in Beverly Hills,'' died on Saturday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 61 and also had a home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not immediately determined, said his father,
William, who added that Bartel had undergone eight hours of surgery
two weeks ago for cancer of the liver ducts.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel, whose love affair with movies began in his childhood,
last appeared as Osric in the filmmaker Michael Almereyda's new
corporate setting of ``Hamlet,'' and at the time of his death was
engaged in discussions with a British producing group about a new
film and had also been asked to write episodes of a new television
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested in theatrics from Day 1,'' his father said
as he traced Bartel's life from childhood marionettes to theater
and film studies and to a long career in directing, writing and
acting, particularly in independent films.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel, in later years a heavyset man with a white beard,
achieved his greatest acclaim in 1982, when his ``Eating Raoul''
was chosen for the 20th New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to be careful not to overstate the case when praising
`Eating Raoul,''' Vincent Canby wrote in his review in The New York
Times. ``One mustn't blunt its pleasures by calling it a laff riot.
It is full of smiles, punctuated here and there by marvelously
unseemly guffaws, but most of the time it works its little wonders
quietly. The comic style is purposely flat, plain and ordinary,
like a piece of Pop art.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartel was not only the director and co-writer of ``Eating
Raoul.'' He was also its co-star, joining Mary Woronov in their
portrayal of a married couple, Paul and Mary Bland, who like nice
things, share a belief that sex is dirty and have the misfortune to
live in a Los Angeles apartment house inhabited mostly by swingers.
</P>
<P>
   The Blands also share a dream. In time, the prissy Paul, who
fancies himself a wine connoisseur, will quit his job in a liquor
store, and the sexually charged Mary will leave her job as a
hospital dietitian and they will open their own restaurant in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   One day when a drunk swinger, looking for an orgy in the
building, invades their apartment and attempts to rape Mary, Paul
hits him over the head with a cast iron skillet and kills him. The
Blands, who have fallen on hard economic times, empty his wallet
and dispose of his body.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly realize they have found a path to fortune:
advertise in the underground press, lure swingers to their
apartment, dispatch them with the skillet, rob them and toss the
bodies in the garbage compactor, all with a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul sees it, the victims are ``horrible, sex-crazed perverts
that nobody will miss anyway.'' But life grows complicated when
Raoul, a young Chicano locksmith with a passion for Mary, attempts
to share in their scheme.
</P>
<P>
   As Bartel recalled afterward, ``I was sitting on the terrace of
the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, sipping a $7 coffee,'' when Richard
Roud, then the director of the New York Film Festival and chairman
of its program committee, ``came strolling down the Croisette,
casually glanced in my direction and turned thumbs up.''
</P>
<P>
   Roud was signaling that Bartel's $500,000 black comedy had been
chosen for the festival, where it was to charm the critics and win
their praise. ``I felt enormous elation and relief.'' Bartel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating Raoul'' was not his first film at the festival. ``The
Secret Cinema,'' a 30-minute film about a New York secretary for
whom everybody's paranoid fantasy becomes a reality, was shown in
1967. Canby called it ``a very funny, completely lunatic
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the films Bartel directed _ and sometimes acted in or
co-wrote _ were ``Cannonball'' (1976), ``Not for Publication''
(1984) and ``Lust in the Dust'' (1985). As an actor he appeared in
everything from ``Eat My Dust'' (1976) and ``Rock 'n' Roll High
School'' (1979) to ``White Dog'' (1982), ``Heart Like a Wheel''
(1983), ``National Lampoon's European Vacation'' (1985), ``Shelf
Life'' (1993), ``The Usual Suspects'' (1995) and ``Basquiat''
(1996).
</P>
<P>
   Bartel, the eldest of the two sons and two daughters of William
and Jesse Bartel, who died five weeks ago, was born in Brooklyn and
grew up in Manhattan and Montclair, N.J. William Bartel said Paul
was 4 or 5 when ``he started out with a marionette show, strung
them and built himself a little stage. He really didn't worry too
much about learning to articulate the marionettes, but he was great
on the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a student at Montclair High School, he had
persuaded his father to buy him a 16-millimeter German-made motion
picture camera and, in the words of his father, ``proceeded to
con'' a teacher into allowing him to devote a semester to making an
animated cartoon, doing the main drawings himself and using the
class to do the ``in-betweens,'' which required 3,000 cels, the
transparent sheets on which the original drawings are traced or
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel, who was fluent in French and Italian, studied theater
and film at UCLA and won a Fulbright scholarship that took him to
Rome and the Cinecitta studio. He fulfilled his military service by
talking his way into the Army Signal Corps Pictorial Center in
Queens and later made films for the U.S. Information Agency. By the
early 1970s, he was making films in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his father, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Bay Head, N.J.,
he is survived by two sisters, Lucy Kizirian of Tallahassee, Fla.,
and Wendy Bartel of Bay Head, N.J., and a brother, Peter of Floyd,
Va.

 &HT;     W.D. McHARDY,   A CREATOR OF NEW ENGLISH BIBLE, DIES AT 88  
 By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.D. McHardy, one of the world's leading Hebrew scholars and an
important member of two teams that translated the Bible into
British English, died on April 9 in Cullen, Scotland. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   McHardy was one of 40 scholars who created the New English
Bible, the first totally new authorized British translation of the
Bible put together by committee since the King James version was
published in 1611. Modern ``authorized'' versions stem from a
consensus of high church officials from several denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to answer for this,'' colleagues would warn
McHardy, the junior member of the group when the project began in
the mid-1940s. ``We'll all be dead by the time this is published.''
</P>
<P>
   When the translation came out in 1961, there were indeed things
to be answered for. The New English Bible was criticized as having
excessively literary language (using ``effulgence'' for
``radiance''; archaic language (``thou'' instead of ``you''), and a
general flatness in tone. T.S. Eliot called the translation
``vulgar,'' ``trivial'' and ``pedantic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also controversy about the interpretations of certain
words. Nonetheless, the New English Bible had its champions, and
went on to sell millions of copies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 McHardy was appointed head of the team that was to
create the Revised English Bible, which was finished in 1989 and
received a much less acrimonious reception.
</P>
<P>
   William Duff McHardy, known as Mac, was born on May 26, 1911, at
Cullen, Banffshire, Scotland. He had polio as a young child and
used crutches and wheelchairs for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He won scholarships and earned four degrees from three different
Universities. He went to Fordyce Academy, Aberdeen University,
Edinburgh University and then to St. John's College, Oxford. In
1945 he became a lecturer in Aramaic and Syriac at London
University. Twelve years later, he was appointed to the prestigious
Regius Chair in Hebrew at Oxford, where he stayed until 1988. In
1990 he was made a Commander of the British Empire, one of the
United Kingdom's highest honors.
</P>
<P>
   His cars were specially adapted so that he could drive despite
his disability. He used a plank of wood, which friends call a ``Mac
plank,'' to get from his wheelchair to his car. He traveled
extensively to Africa during his sabbatical year.
</P>
<P>
   McHardy, an assistant Church of Scotland minister in his local
parish, married the former Vera Kemp in 1941. She died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Alison McHardy, who lives in
England.

CLINTON LINKS BIN LADEN TO MILLENNIUM BOMB PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton said Wednesday that the plot to set off bombs
at millennium celebrations in the United States, which caused
nervous Seattle officials to cancel a public event at the Space
Needle, has been tied to Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In a graduation speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Clinton
made his most elaborate statement to date about bin Laden, a Saudi
exile facing a U.S. charge of conspiracy to kill Americans in
embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited Seattle's own case of alleged terrorism,
which occurred a couple of weeks before New Year's Eve. But he
stopped short of specifically linking Ahmed Ressam, who was
arrested with explosives in his car in Port Angeles, with bin Laden
or the millenium plot.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council said the president
did not intend to tie bin Laden to Ressam. Clinton did, however,
say the suspected explosives Ressam carried and those used by bin
Laden's organization are the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last December, we shut down a plot to place large bombs at
locations where Americans might gather on New Year's Eve,'' Clinton
said in his address in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned this plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Laden, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton immediately added: ``A short time later, a customs agent
in Seattle discovered bomb materials being smuggled into the U.S. _
the same materials used by bin Laden in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Clinton stressed the threats to national and
global security, ranging from bombing plots and computer viruses to
drug trafficking. He proposed spending an additional $300 million
to bolster counterterrorism efforts, including those in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   Among other improvements, Clinton is proposing that the U.S.
border with Canada get better monitoring. That would include secure
communications equipment and high-resolution day-and-night cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Security along the Canadian border has long been a sore point,
especially with members of Congress from northern border states. In
Washington state, a transfer of Border Patrol agents to the
Southwest has created even more concern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reference to bin Laden wasn't extemporaneous. He
brought the Jordanian ambassador to the United States with him to
New London and introduced him. The reason was to underscore the
importance of cooperation between nations to battle terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors in Port Angeles, Wash., arrested Ressam, an
Algerian national, on Dec. 14, after he drove his rental car off a
ferry from Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, 32, faces nine federal charges, including possessing and
transporting explosives and intending to use them to cause damage
or injury. A co-defendant is at large, and the U.S. government has
placed a $5 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Other arrests have been made in the case, including in New York
and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, U.S. Attorney Kate Pflaumer would not discuss
Clinton's remarks. ``We can't comment and don't comment on ongoing
criminal cases,'' said her spokesman, Harold Malkin.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for another of the alleged bombing conspirators,
Mokhtar Haouari, said Clinton's remarks turns up the pressure on
the defendants to cooperate or plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might make Ressam nervous,'' said Montreal lawyer Joseph
Elfassy. ``When a president talks, he doesn't talk for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have accused Haouari of forging travel
documents and ordering another conspirator, Abdel Ghani Meskini, to
travel to Seattle in December to meet Ressam. American prosecutors
are attempting to extradite Haouari from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Elfassy said he is skeptical of Clinton's motives behind the
remarks. ``I understand that the Americans need to justify the
major, major, major money they have put forward to investigate
these charges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't mention Ressam by name. Nor did he mean to
connect Ressam with bin Laden and the millennium plot, said David
Stockwell, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intent in the speech to link the two together,''
Stockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents have alleged that Ressam and others were in a
cell of a violent terrorist group based in Algeria. There has also
been speculation of ties to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. intelligence agencies haven't solidly linked
Ressam and bin Laden, said one government source involved in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The same source also noted that intelligence and law enforcement
experts disagree about whether the alleged explosives Ressam had
are the same as those that bin Laden's organization uses.
</P>
<P>
   Stockwell said Clinton didn't intend to mean that Seattle was a
confirmed millennium bombing target.
</P>
<P>
   A worried Seattle Mayor Paul Schell canceled a public gathering
at the Space Needle on Dec. 31, 1999. Ressam had made motel
reservations close to that spot.
</P>
<P>
   A fireworks display at the Space Needle went off, but with the
public kept well away.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Lilly, Schell's spokesman, said Wednesday that the mayor
did not have contact with the White House before canceling the
event. Schell was also never told that Seattle was a bombing
target, Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office kept in contact with local FBI investigators
and federal prosecutors here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't tell us if Seattle, in fact, was the target or
wasn't the target. They didn't know,'' Lilly said. ``The mayor
erred on the side of caution.''

REBEL LEADER CAPTURED IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs throughout to update; note byline and dateline
change.)  
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader who
vanished nine days ago after dealing humiliating blows to the U.N.
peacekeeping force in this West African country, was captured here
on Wednesday in a bizarre incident outside his abandoned house.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who was last seen at his house shortly after his
bodyguards killed 19 demonstrators outside the compound last week,
returned on Wednesday morning in the apparent hope of retrieving
some possessions before turning himself in to the Nigerian Embassy,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a local man reported Sankoh's presence to an armed
supporter of the government, who shot the rebel leader in the leg
and arrested him, witnesses said. Stripped naked, Sankoh was taken
to a pro-government militia, which quickly turned him over to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Sankoh, whose forces took 500 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage early this month, was in custody of Sierra
Leone's government and was being protected by British paratroopers,
U.N. and British officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While Sankoh's capture ended days of intense speculation about
his whereabouts, it immediately raised the issue of what to do with
him. Sankoh's forces are responsible for a wave of terror in 1998
and 1999 when they killed, raped and hacked off the limbs of
thousands of citizens, but in recent days, the government had said
that the rebel leader could take his place in the country's
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   A peace accord signed in July 1999 had said he would be
permitted to be part of the government in exchange for ending his
violent campaign against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. The accord
also gave him amnesty for any violent acts committed before the
signing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not say on Wednesday what they planned to do with
him. Because the amnesty does not apply to his most recent acts,
many people inside and outside Sierra Leone want Sankoh, who
repeatedly blocked the peace process, to face prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which is trying to negotiate the release of
270 peacekeepers still held hostage by Sankoh's group, the
Revolutionary United Front, reacted cautiously to the news.
President Charles Taylor of Liberia, a longtime ally of Sankoh's,
helped obtain the release of 139 peacekeepers early this week.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations announced on Wednesday night that an
additional 80 had been freed through Taylor's mediation. But it was
not clear whether the release occurred before or after the news of
Sankoh's capture, said David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the U.N.
force here.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers engaged in combat for the first time since
they arrived last week, initially to secure the evacuation of
British citizens. British officials said the paratroopers killed at
least two rebels who launched an overnight attack near the
international airport in Lungi. The British, not part of the U.N.
force, are officially here only to offer technical assistance to
the peacekeepers, but their mission has been interpreted broadly on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the town of Port Loko, about 65 miles from here,
Nigerian peacekeepers and pro-government soldiers fought for two
hours against rebels, Wimhurst said. One Nigerian and six
pro-government soldiers were killed in a firefight after rebels
attacked with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delicate nature of Sankoh's status, neither
government nor U.N. officials gave details on Sankoh's condition or
where he might have been hiding in the last nine days. In late
1998, after the current government sentenced Sankoh to death for
treason, rebels advanced desperately onto the capital, where they
eventually killed and maimed thousands.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses who were interviewed a couple of hours
after Sankoh's capture and corroborated one another's accounts, the
rebel leader showed up before dawn in a shantytown built on a hill
behind Sankoh's house. The house, on a hill in a neighborhood with
other large homes, was looted after Sankoh's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah Sesay, a 36-year-old mason, said he had risen around 5:30
a.m. and gotten out of his house to attend morning prayers, when he
was approached by Sankoh and a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `` `Do you recognize me?''' Sankoh asked Sesay, the mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Sesay, who recalled the events just after he had finished
washing himself in an outdoor spring that local men use as a
communal shower, said: ``They asked me if I could lead them to his
house and find a taxi for him to take him to the Nigerian Embassy.
So I told him, yes, I could do that for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sesay said he then accompanied Sankoh and his bodyguard to the
abandoned house and told them to wait under the stairs while he
called a taxi. Instead, Sesay said he walked back to his shantytown
and awakened a neighbor, Mustafa Kamara, who is a former soldier
loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the leader of a junta that
briefly held power in 1997 and is still the real power behind
Sierra Leone's army.
</P>
<P>
   The two men returned to Sankoh's house. ``I went inside the
compound and I told Foday Sankoh I've brought a taxi,'' Sesay said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sankoh and his bodyguard stepped outside, Kamara, known as
Black Scorpion, confronted them. When the bodyguard raised a gun,
Kamara fired a single bullet that went through the bodyguard and
tore into Sankoh's left calf, Sesay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hero,'' said Kamara, who was greeted with cheers from
his neighbors when he returned to the shantytown around 9 a.m.
``I'm happy, because I've suffered for 10 years,'' he said,
alluding to the length of Sierra Leone's civil war, which began in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Puddles of blood lay near the house on Wednesday morning.
Inside, members of another militia, the Kamajors, were searching
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in the area, two militiamen, Elisha Sheaka, 28,
and Julius Mbayo, 29, said they believed that Sankoh had hidden
diamonds in the house and wanted to retrieve them before turning
himself in at the Nigerian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why were are here on the ground,'' Sheaka said.
``Otherwise, I see no reason why Pa Sankoh left the bush and came
here.'' After his capture, the locals pounced on him and stripped
him of all his clothes, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take everything,'' said Foday Sesay, who said he was a
member of Koroma's force. ``We even took his hair dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sesay then produced a green-and-white hat in the style that
Sankoh usually wore. Others showed a towel and a letter that they
said Sankoh was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Sankoh was then put into a white Land Rover by
Koroma's men and taken to the former junta leader, who had been
allied with Sankoh from 1997 until last year.
</P>
<P>
   A picture taken by a local photographer shows Sankoh, naked from
the waist up, jammed in the Land Rover with several young men. One
man is grabbing Sankoh, whose face is dirtied, by the skin of his
neck. ``He was brought into this compound, naked, because the
public wanted his neck,' said Prince Nicol, Koroma's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   After about half an hour at Koroma's, Sankoh was taken to the
Sierra Leonean army's headquarters. From there, the British took
him in a helicopter to what they described as a secure location.

HARRY J. VOLK, A BANK EXECUTIVE KNOWN FOR INNOVATIONS, DIES AT 94 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.J.)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry J. Volk, a finance executive whose impact was felt as much
in the world of philanthropy as in business, died at his Los
Angeles home on Friday, according to his son Robert. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   During a financial career that spanned more than three decades,
he showed little patience for the idea that the status quo was
right just because it was the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   As a vice president of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America
in the mid-1940s, for example, he helped mastermind the company's
huge decentralization program. The revamping took him to Los
Angeles in 1947, where he opened Prudential's first regional home
office. While he was there, he also introduced the concept of
family life insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as chairman of the Union Bank of California _ a job he
was recruited from Prudential to fill in 1957 _ he helped bring
about new offerings like daily compounding of interest and banking
by mail, which were radical for the time. It was Volk who spotted
the loophole in federal laws that made it possible for banks to
form holding companies, and in 1967 he established the country's
first one-bank holding company, Union Bancorp Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While other banks were trying to broaden their customer base,
Volk successfully steered Union through the recession of the 1970s
by keeping it focused on lending to small and medium-size
businesses. At a time when bankers generally considered marketing
beneath them, Volk marketed Union aggressively to those target
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson that many of his employees spread to other
banks. ``Most bankers had the idea, you sit there and customers
come in and you sort of judge them,'' Carl E. Reichardt, a former
Union Bank executive who was chairman of Wells Fargo from 1983
through 1994, said in 1989. ``Harry said that was all wrong _ that
you had to go out and drag them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Volk's innovations served Union well. He took Union
into insurance and mortgage banking, only to have California
regulators insist that it pull out of those enterprises in 1975.
The bank never quite regained its vibrant growth. Many of its
higher-level executives departed, and many of the bank's business
customers followed them to their new employers. Union Bank was
taken over by Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. of London in 1979. Volk
retired a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Volk never confined his taste for innovation and activism to the
financial world. If it had anything to do with California, it
interested him. He was an active board member of several California
companies, including Western Air Lines, Southern California Gas and
Times Mirror. He was also a trustee of the California Institute of
Technology, a board member of the Los Angeles branch of the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco and president of the Los Angeles
Clearing House Association.
</P>
<P>
   He also plunged into the Los Angeles philanthropic world. He
headed a committee that looked into disputes between the United Way
and some of its recipient charities. Soon after, he created a
system that allowed employers to funnel payroll deductions to
charities designated by individual employees. The system is now
widely used, and, by giving donors more of a say in where their
contributions went, was a linchpin of the United Way's revamped
methods for collecting and distributing money.
</P>
<P>
   Volk was a prime mover in rebuilding Los Angeles' historic
Bunker Hill. And he helped found many Los Angeles cultural
institutions, including the Los Angeles Music Center and the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. While still at Union Bank, he was a
board member of the Southern California Symphony Association, the
Boys Club Foundation and various Boy Scout councils.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from the bank in 1980 he became head of the
Weingart Foundation, a California charitable organization with $155
million in assets. By the time Volk retired from the foundation in
1993, its assets had plumped up to more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when Union Bank became one of the first banks in the
country to offer child care as an employee benefit, it named its
day care center the Volk Center.
</P>
<P>
   Volk's love of all things Californian notwithstanding, he hailed
from the opposite coast. He was born in Trenton, and earned degrees
in business and law from Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Volk's first wife, Marion, whom he married in 1931, died in
1972. He is survived by his second wife, the actress Marjorie Lord;
two sons from his first marriage, Robert, of Los Angeles, and
Richard, of San Francisco; 2 stepchildren; 9 grandchildren; and 12
great-grandchildren.

ANIMATION EVOLVES BIGTIME IN `DINOSAUR'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it is impossible to overpraise the visual splendor of
Disney's first, in-house computer animated feature ``Dinosaur,'' it
is definitely possible to overquibble the film's story points to
something nearing extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is beyond thrilling to experience the film's wordless
opening sequence, in which hundreds of dinosaurs forage for food
and flee from becoming carnivores' meals, while a baby iguanadon,
still in his egg, is transported by predator, rushing water and
flying reptile through perspective shifts and photorealistic
primeval landscapes of breathtaking scope and detail. And it can't
help but disappoint when said hatchling lands in the nurturing lap
of a family of wisecracking lemurs, who go on, ever so Disneylike,
to raise the humongous orphan as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Studio boss Michael Eisner is said to have decreed that the
prehistoric critters talk like good company anthropomorphs should,
no doubt in order to maximize the marketing potential of the
reportedly $200 million production. There are also a lot of basic
Disney cartoon elements to the storyline, a tale of loss and growth
that echoes from last year's ``Tarzan'' through ``The Lion King''
and all the way back to ``Bambi.''
</P>
<P>
   But while these shopworn tropes do exert a cheapening effect
upon this profoundly sensuous movie experience, the story that John
Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs' screenplay tells is, finally, an
apt one. It's a fable of forced evolution distilled into a bracing,
humanistic moral: the discovery of compassion as a survival tool.
</P>
<P>
   And in this situation, the giant saurians and their furry little
friends need all the tools to survive that they can get.
</P>
<P>
   Our featured iguanadon, Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney), grows
up loved but still lonely on his primate family's isolated jungle
isle. This is made touchingly clear as he watches his adoptive
brothers and all the other adolescent lemurs perform their first
mating ritual, a rite he's about 200 times too large to participate
in. This sequence is as exuberant as it is moving, and is followed
by one of awesome terror: a meteor shower that destroys the island
and, presumably, signals the beginning of the end of dinosaur life.
</P>
<P>
   Aladar and a few lemurs escape to the mainland. They soon join
up with a desperate herd of assorted dino-species trekking across a
vast wasteland to a (hopefully) still viably green mating ground.
The herd, which is largely composed of young orphans and aging
invalids, is led by the hard-bitten iguanadon Kron (Samuel E.
Wright), whose not unsound operating principle is to leave the weak
behind for raptor and carnotaur food as the best way to ensure the
safety of the fittest majority.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably Aladar, with his enlightened, mammalian
``all-for-one'' philosophy, becomes a threat to Kron's authority.
An attraction between Kron's sister Neera (Julianna Margulies) and
the sensitive rebel developes, inevitably.
</P>
<P>
   Another point in the story's favor: It ain't hard to follow. And
this is one movie you don't want to waste cognitive power probing
narrative subtleties on. Rather, you'll just want to drink in the
most persuasive computer animation yet put on the big screen. The
idea to set the characters against photographed desert, forest and
mountain backgrounds was a stroke of genius. It utterly obliterates
the sense of taking place inside an Etch-a-Sketch that previous
all-CG productions like ``Toy Story'' evoke.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may have personalities and abilities far beyond
those of real, pea-brained dinosaurs, the movie's creatures are the
most realistically generated yet. Their musculature, skin and
brilliantly individuated movements make for a lifelike complexity
of expressiveness. And despite the Disneyish cutesification, there
is more than enough savage, wild behavior here to convince us that
we're spying on their real world (minus the advanced primates, of
course) of however many million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a story that, at its best, is as primal as the
territorial impulse, ``Dinosaur'' employs superb artistry and
advanced technology to create something very much like a natural
wonder. &QL;

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT TO JUDGE: TWO MICROSOFTS BETTER THAN ONE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government fired an answering salvo Wednesday
night in its legal artillery duel with Microsoft Corp., dismissing
the view that the software giant could comply with the antitrust
laws merely by changing the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
   In asking a federal judge to spurn Microsoft's proposed remedies
and split up the company, the Justice Department and 17 states
reinforced their earlier assertion that a breakup is the only sure
way to bar further illegal behavior by a company already found
guilty of breaking the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``What remedy does Microsoft propose to undo the damage to
</P>
<P>
   competition caused by its past illegal conduct?'' the 70-page
government brief asked. ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's own proposals, the government held, ``offered a
cosmetic remedy that would have virtually no competitive
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company told the court it was willing to stop
displaying the Internet Explorer browser icon on the Windows
desktop and to let computer makers prominently feature any other
software, including products from Microsoft rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the government insisted that only by splitting the company
into two parts _ one to market the Windows operating system and the
other applications such as Word and Internet Explorer _ could the
judicial system ``undo the harm to competition caused by
Microsoft's illegal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In meeting a court-imposed deadline, Justice Department
attorneys worked on their concluding briefs deep into the evening
hours and well past the major market closings.
</P>
<P>
   At end of the day, with all the scheduled remedy briefs in the
historic antitrust case against the world's largest software firm
in the hands of the court, the focus once more returned to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who must weigh the two
starkly different plans.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on April 3 that Microsoft had willfully and
repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, the judge has
still given no hint on when and how he will rule in the final
punishment phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claims it has done no wrong. So, whatever set of
remedies Jackson decides to favor, the company is sure to appeal
the antitrust case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, a
legal process that could consume several years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has either side has ruled out the option of an eventual
out-of-court settlement, the course that Jackson clearly has
favored, so far to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's after-hours government filing also set the stage for
a potentially dramatic hearing on remedies hearing on May 24, when
both sides will argue in open court once more over Microsoft's
future. Jackson is expected to question both sides closely on the
potential impact of their proposals both on Microsoft and its
high-tech rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Jackson must also decide whether to give
Microsoft's legal team up to six more months to defend itself
against what the company regards as a draconian and unwarranted
government breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson blocks efforts by the company's attorneys to win
extra time to prepare their defense for the remedy phase of the
trial, then they are sure to cite the denial as another ground for
their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft had broken the 110-year-old
Sherman Antitrust Act by using its monopoly illegally to harm
customers and thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling prompted the government team to call on Jackson to
cleave Microsoft in half. In their initial April 28 submission, the
plaintiffs also said Microsoft should be required to share its
programming secrets and digital interfaces with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Following the judge's orders to come up with its own proposed
punishment, the company on May 10 proposed a set of internal
controls on its business behavior. But it said even those limited
proposals should be set aside while it appeals Jackson's guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Microsoft traded near its 52-week low, closing
on the major financial markets at $67.69, down $1.81 for the day on
volume of 26,498,100 shares.

remedies Jackson decides to favor, the company is sure to appeal
the antitrust case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, a
legal process that could consume several years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has either side has ruled out the option of an eventual
out-of-court settlement, the course that Jackson clearly has
favored, so far to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's after-hours government filing also set the stage for
a potentially dramatic hearing on remedies hearing on May 24, when
both sides will argue in open court once more over Microsoft's
future. Jackson is expected to question both sides closely on the
potential impact of their proposals both on Microsoft and its
high-tech rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Jackson must also decide whether to give
Microsoft's legal team up to six more months to defend itself
against what the company regards as a draconian and unwarranted
government breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson blocks efforts by the company's attorneys to win
extra time to prepare their defense for the remedy phase of the
trial, then they are sure to cite the denial as another ground for
their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft had broken the 110-year-old
Sherman Antitrust Act by using its monopoly illegally to harm
customers and thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling prompted the government team to call on Jackson to
cleave Microsoft in half. In their initial April 28 submission, the
plaintiffs also said Microsoft should be required to share its
programming secrets and digital interfaces with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Following the judge's orders to come up with its own proposed
punishment, the company on May 10 proposed a set of internal
controls on its business behavior. But it said even those limited
proposals should be set aside while it appeals Jackson's guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Microsoft traded near its 52-week low, closing
on the major financial markets at $67.69, down $1.81 for the day on
volume of 26,498,100 shares.

<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Calling trade relations with China the work of
``13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday urged congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to
support President Clinton and vote to grant China permanent trade
rights. The House is scheduled to vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has long supported free trade, his address here
Wednesday on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of
the few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending
legislation in Congress. He called the question of whether to
extend normal trading privileges to China ``among the most serious
decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ``no
one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the
presidency'' should remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start of this campaign, I have defined some sharp
differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Bush said, a
sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ``But today I want to address an
important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the
Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Bush said.
``It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13
years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be
undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was
one of those presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called
free trade ``a forward strategy for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With his remarks, Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan
cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in
recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his
efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day earlier, he parted company with Senate Republicans,
criticizing a bill that would set a deadline for withdrawing U.S.
ground troops from Kosovo. A spokesman for Bush said he considered
the measure ``legislative overreach on powers of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at
the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is
oriented toward exports and the Pacific rim, nearby Seattle was
also the site of last year's violent protests against the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The
company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number its workers
said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization
would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the local congressman,
Rep. Jack Metcalf, is one of the few undecided Republicans on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has voted Democratic in the past three
presidential elections, but Bush's aides say they are contesting
the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Bush a generally
polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of
workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The measure cleared the House Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday by a larger-than-expected margin of 34-4 as several
undecided members sided with Clinton. The full House, which is
bitterly divided on the issue, is to vote next week on whether to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges.
</P>

<P>
   Clinton, who has made this one of his foreign policy priorities
for the year, has argued for months that Congress must grant China
permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of
U.S. companies and relations with the world's most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote is too close to call. And if the measure passes,
it will do so largely with the support of Republicans. Many
Democrats have sided with organized labor, which is fighting hard
against the measure, arguing that permanent support for China trade
would leave Congress few ways to pressure China to improve its
record on human rights, labor and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has supported the bill, but been less fervent than the
president, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical
Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Clinton on
the China bill than Gore. He argued Wednesday that ``the stakes are
high'' in how the debate is decided and made an impassioned
argument for the House to ratify China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``For businesses and workers and farmers, it will mean lower
trade barriers and important opportunities for U.S. exports and
more work and jobs for United States workers,'' he said. ``For the
people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the
region's major superpower. For the people of China it holds out the
hope of more open contact with the world of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He did however use the occasion to draw distinctions between the
administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said
Clinton and Gore view China as a `'strategic partner'' and said,
``I view China as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in
its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various
high profile battles over trade. ``They failed to obtain `fast
track' trade negotiating authority,'' Bush said, ``I will fight for
it. They mishandled the global trade negotiations here in Seattle.
I will make expanding trade and therefore expanding jobs at home a
consistent priority of my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that while China is not a ``strategic partner,'' it
is not an enemy. ``When I am the president, China will have no
doubts about our power and purpose in the region _ about our strong
commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said. ``But
this is accomplished through confident diplomacy, strong alliances,
and a military to back us. It is not accomplished by hindering free
trade or seeking to isolate China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Bush spoke,
Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with
China because it would result in the loss of U.S. manufacturing
jobs. ``We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ``We
can't compete with somebody who's living in a cardboard box.'' He
said he was a Democrat who would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said he was a
unionized worker who does not ``follow the union line. But he said
he was uncertain about China trade because ``I'm not confident with
China's human rights record.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a dim view of both candidates. ``I'm not going to vote
for Gore _ that's a definite,'' Webb said. ``Vote for Bush? I'd
prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''

STUDY SHOWS A RACIAL DIVIDE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Ga., Mo.)  By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confirming a longstanding trend in crime and society, a new
Justice Department study released on Wednesday shows a sharp drop
in domestic murders, particularly the killings of black men by
their black women partners, which fell 74 percent over the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also underscored how the face of domestic
violence in America has changed. Even as the number of black
victims has fallen, the number of white women killed by their
husbands and boyfriends in fact rose slightly, to 876 in 1998 from
849 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The report itself did not address the reasons for this
discrepancy and many experts expressed puzzlement over it. But some
criminologists and women's advocates said the explanation may be
that black women traditionally were much more likely to be victims
of domestic homicide than white women, so that the legal, social
and economic changes of recent years have helped black women more
than white women. Paradoxically, white women pushed most visibly
for tougher laws against domestic violence and for shelters for
abused women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline, black women in 1998 were still victims of
domestic killings at a rate of 4.5 per 100,000, compared with 1.75
per 100,000 for white women, said James Alan Fox, the Lipman
professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Elizabeth M. Schneider, a professor at
Brooklyn Law School, because men often tend to kill their partners
when their wife or girlfriend is leaving the relationship, ``to the
degree that white women have more acts of separation or
independence, this may trigger more partner violence among white
men.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schneider said, ``I am still surprised that the decrease in
black women as victims of partner homicides is so big,'' since
black women have been more reluctant than their white counterparts
to use the new laws against domestic violence and have their
partners arrested. Schneider is the author of a book on the
subject, ``Battered Women and Feminist Lawmaking,'' to be published
this fall by Yale University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, several criminologists said, is that black men
have been disproportionately jailed and imprisoned, taking them out
of their homes, therefore making it less likely that they will
either kill their partners or be killed in domestic quarrels.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the new report found, the number of people killed by
their intimate partners declined to 1,830 in 1998 from about 3,000
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiary of the decrease was black men, with the
number of black men killed by intimate partners falling 74 percent
in the last two decades. The number of black women killed by their
partners dropped 45 percent in the same period and the number of
white men killed by their partners declined 44 percent. The number
of white women killed by their partners rose 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of white women killed by their partners actually
declined from 1993 to 1997, but rose again in 1998 to help account
for the long term 3 percent increase, said Fox. Whether the 1998
figure was an anomaly or the start of an upward trend is unclear,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in white women killed by their partners was largely
among women living with boyfriends rather than husbands, Fox said.
Because more couples are living together rather than getting
married, this increase could continue he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond killings, the report found, the number of women who were
victims of nonlethal domestic violence dropped by 21 percent from
1993 to 1998, to 876,340 women victims from 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a
branch of the Justice Department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University
of Missouri at St. Louis, said there were several factors behind
the decline in domestic homicide. One is changes in living
arrangements, with fewer people getting and staying married, or
even living together for long periods of time, which means less
opportunity for killing.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor, Rosenfeld said, is the panoply of changes to
help battered women, ranging from new restraining laws, to quicker
police arrests of batterers, to shelters and support groups. Laura
Dugan, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Georgia State
University, said she had found in a large-scale study that as
cities created more legal advocacy services against domestic
violence, fewer men were being killed by their wives, though the
same did not hold true for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we think that legal advocacy gives women access to
the criminal justice system, so women in abusive relationships have
an out, and can get protection and don't need to kill to get out of
a relationship,'' Dugan said. But men, she said, tend to kill in a
fit of rage or jealousy, so the new legal services for women are
not as successful in preventing them from killing their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon
University, put it another way: ``When men kill their partners, it
is probably an unintended escalation of a quarrel. But when a woman
kills her partner, it is more likely she sees it as a last resort
to an unacceptable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A third factor widely cited by experts has been the improved
economic status of women, especially black women, who have more
college education than black men and can find better jobs now, so
they can be more independent and get out of dangerous
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Still another factor, Rosenfeld said, is the enormous
incarceration rate of black men _ four times higher than it was in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of these legal, social and economic changes have been so
powerful that they have reversed the pre-1976 pattern in which
black women actually killed their male partners more often than
black men killed their wives or girlfriends, Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sue Osthoff, the director of the National Clearinghouse for
the Defense of Battered Women in Philadelphia, said she was
concerned that the very progress society has made in giving women
more resources to leave bad relationships ``may have inadvertently
put women at greater risk.'' This might explain why the rate of
white women being killed by their partners has not dropped, she
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand what battering is really about,''
Osthoff said. ``It is about controlling somebody. So when a woman
leaves, that is a threat to the man, and some men say, `If I can't
have her, nobody will.' That makes leaving the most dangerous
time.''

OPPOSITION DECLARES VICTORY IN DOMINICAN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Tantalizingly close to an
outright majority, Hipolito Mejia declared himself the winner of
Tuesday's presidential elections, vowing to ensure that the
Dominican Republic's poorest residents no longer remain bystanders
to the economic boom of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   His exuberant declaration, which came while the electoral
council was still tallying the vote that had so far given him 49.9
percent of the ballots by early Wednesday, sent thousands of
cheering supporters to the streets waving the party's white banner
as they danced to a symphony of honking horns.
</P>
<P>
   In a gleeful jab at their rout of the ruling Dominican
Liberation Party, whose policies of privatization and modernization
have been slow to benefit many of the country's poor, Mejia's
supporters triumphantly brandished straw brooms, cutting the air
like sabre-waving conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, an agronomist, businessman and cabinet official in the
late 1970s, insisted that the government had to increase spending
on health, education and housing, as well as find ways to help
beleaguered farmers. He said the time had come to make sure that
the country's phenomenal economic growth of approximately 8 percent
in recent years provided tangible benefits to the majority of its
citizens. He also invoked the memory of the late Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez, who had been his party's beloved leader for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we will do will be for the benefit of the hungry masses
of the country,'' he said at an early morning meeting with his
party's leadership. ``What Pena wanted, we will fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   The premature celebrations were criticized by supporters of the
Dominican Liberation Party, who had wanted their candidate, Danilo
Medina, to face Mejia in a runoff. While Mejia's supporters had
taken to the streets, the final tally was delayed for much of the
day as exhausted members of the electoral council took a five-hour
break to sleep. The PLD and the Social Christian Reformist Party of
the country's longtime former president, Joaquin Balaguer, each had
garned about 24.7 percent of the vote by early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mejia's supporters said their candidate's wide margin should
be acknowledged by their opponents as a de facto victory and that
they spare the country the time and expense of a June 30 runoff by
conceding defeat. By late Wednesday, PLD supporters were still
waiting for a final tally before making any announcement about
their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Several times throughout the day, Mejia insisted that he would
reach out to his opponents' supporters and include them in his
government. But in a televised interview, Mejia also said his
background put him in a good position to reassess the effects of
the current government's economic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to confront the corruption and lack of planning,'' he
said. ``My strength is in finance and management and the reordering
of public affairs. I expect to be an institutional president who
will not go outside of the legal framework. I will properly manage
the finances of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some officials of the opposing parties said the vote
was affected by mismanagement by electoral officials who had
misdirected voters to incorrect polling places, teams of
international observers said they had not detected any
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dominican economy was the fastest growing in Latin
America last year, the policies of the current president, Leonel
Fernandez, had alienated many voters who felt they were being
harmed. Supporters of Medina acknowledged that the benefits of
Fernandez's policies have trickled down slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government process of privatization was necessary,'' said
Felix Rodriguez, an elementary school teacher and PLD supporter.
``But it affected hundreds of families who were not able to find a
place in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Medina was also hurt by his own perceived colorlessness,
failing to inspire enthusiasm among some members of his own party,
who would have preferred another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is an economy that under Leonel Fernandez grew to be an
example for Latin America, so why did the government's candidate
not rise higher?'' said Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican
ambassador to the United States. ``When Danilo spoke, he did not
excite the people. His speeches were more like he was talking to
the Chamber of Commerce about foreign investment and
macroeconomics, and the masses did not want to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   What mattered most to Mejia's supporters was the sorry state of
their personal economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich say there is economic growth,'' said Felix Bonilla, a
chauffeur. ``But the only thing growing are their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most jubilant of Mejia's many supporters were women
and homemakers, many of whom had turned out in large numbers on
election day to put an end to what they said were years of high
food prices and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Juana Espinosa, a nurse who said she could not find a hospital
job, sat outside her beverage stand a few feet away from Mejia's
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people wanted a real government to bring them work, not
just pretty words,'' she said. ``The women have seen how there has
been inflation in the kitchen and in caring for their children. We
deal with that and we saw we were on the precipice. If you do not
have enough to feed your children, there is nothing you can change.
But you can change the government.''

 &HT;    Pair held in Atlanta bank heists
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Free Al-Amin!''
</P>
<P>
   The shout came from one of two robbers during the April 25
holdup of a SouthTrust Bank in Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, federal authorities said they arrested the two men
after another robbery, this time of a Wachovia Bank in north Fulton
County. The men were caught after they tried to hit officers with a
red Chevy Blazer, authorities said. Police fired at them and chased
them onto I-285, boxing them in.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents say it was the third time in 22 days the pair had
robbed a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Agents say they have no evidence that any bank robbery money was
going to help Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, who is accused of killing one
Fulton County deputy and seriously injuring another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to show a tie between these people and
Al-Amin,'' said Mark Giuliano, the FBI supervisory agent in charge
of the bureau's Atlanta bank robbery squad. ``However, we will
continue to investigate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta residents Adrian Grove, aka Ishmael Adbullah, 25; and
Michael Angel Soto Jr., aka Miguel, 33; were charged with
aggravated assault and armed robbery in Wednesday's holdup.
</P>
<P>
   The two men told police they were homeless, but had stayed at
the Community Mosque in Atlanta's West End neighborhood. Al-Amin is
the imam, or prayer leader, of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Grove's father, Donnie Grove, said his son called him recently
to talk about Al-Amin, the black militant formerly called H. Rap
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, 'Dad, did you know of H. Rap Brown?' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``He got framed,'' Donnie Grove remembered his son saying.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Grove, 55, who lives in Denver, said his son had never
been arrested before. ``He wasn't raised that way for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosque member Ibrahim Abdul Salaam said he does not know the
bank robbery suspects. He said Al-Amin's supporters recently
stopped collecting money for Al-Amin's defense fund. He said they
had not raised enough to pay for the printing of fliers. Taxpayers
are paying for Al-Amin's court-appointed lawyers, Jack Martin and
Bruce Harvey. Martin had no comment about the bank robbery
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in Wednesday's holdup. Police found all the
money. It was stained by an exploding dye package. Fulton County
police Maj. Wenda Phifer would not say how much money had been
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano said the men are suspects in the Smyrna holdup and the
May 5 robbery of a Bank of America branch in Marietta, Ga. A red
Blazer was connected to both holdups, he said. After the first
robbery, the FBI received reports of paint-stained money being fed
into change machines at metro car washes. A red Blazer showed up on
a videotape from a car wash, Giuliano said.

ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM'S FLAW WAS COVERED UP, CRITIC SAYS  
 (EXCLUSIVE) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prominent anti-missile critic has found what he says is a
major flaw in the Pentagon's anti-missile plan and is calling on
the White House to appoint a high-level scientific panel to
investigate what he says were fraudulent efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   If he is correct, the flaw may cripple or even kill the proposed
weapon system, the cost of which is estimated at up to $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The critic is Dr. Theodore A. Postol, professor of science and
national security studies at MIT, author of many reports on
anti-missile systems and in the 1980s a science adviser to the
chief of naval operations on ballistic missile technologies and
potential weapons against them. He made his new charges in a May 11
letter to John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, after
reviewing Pentagon data gathered by an anti-missile whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Postol's critique centers on the hardest part of the missile
defense challenge: distinguishing incoming weapons from decoys and
destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, a copy of which he gave to The New York Times,
Postol said Pentagon sensor data he had obtained from the first
anti-missile test flight in June 1997 showed that the ground-based
interceptor was inherently unable to make the distinction and that
the Pentagon and its contractors had attempted to hide this
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The cover-up, he said, was ``like rolling a pair of dice and
throwing away all outcomes that did not give snake eyes.'' An
inability to tell cheap decoys from costly warheads in theory could
force a defender to fire interceptors at every threatening object,
which as a practical matter could make the system useless.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said the White House was carefully weighing Postol's appeal but was
unlikely to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say this merits an outside review,'' Crowley
said. ``We have to let the Department of Defense complete its
deployment readiness review,'' which starts in late June and lasts
a month.
</P>
<P>
   A senior federal official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that if a scheduled anti-missile flight test
failed, that would tend to bolster concerns about the system and
probably help prompt an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Postol's charges are based partly on an anti-missile criticism
by Dr. Nira Schwartz, a former senior engineer at TRW, a top
military contractor. In a suit against TRW, Schwartz has charged
the company with faking anti-missile tests and evaluations of
computer programs for the interceptor's sensor and then firing her
when she protested. Through her litigation and a Pentagon inquiry,
Schwartz obtained many anti-missile reports and data, some of which
she has shared with Postol.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force, a spokesman for the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said a detailed
written response was being prepared for Postol and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take allegations of fraud very seriously,'' Lehner said.
``We have looked at many of these allegations in the past, and have
found nothing which supports either the scientific criticisms or
any fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard L. Garwin, a top federal science adviser who has
expressed doubts about some aspects of the missile defense idea,
said he had seen Postol's letter and considered his technical
points ``very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent New York Times/CBS poll, 58 percent of the
respondents said they favored trying to build an anti-missile
defense. But that figure dropped to 25 percent, the poll found,
when respondents were asked what their opinion would be ``if many
scientists conclude it is unlikely that such a system will ever
work.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Testing of the would-be anti-missile weapon has not gone
smoothly. The first two flight experiments simply gathered sensor
data on mock warheads and decoys. The most elaborate of these, in
June 1997, is the subject of Postol's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed the first intercept try as a
success but later conceded that the interceptor had initially
drifted off course and picked out the decoy balloon rather than the
warhead. In a January test, a sensor coolant leak caused the
interceptor to miss the target altogether.
</P>
<P>
   A third intercept test is set for late June. President Clinton
is expected to decide afterward whether the United States should
build a limited defense against missile attacks by rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   To date, targets in the interception tests have consisted of a
single mock warhead and a single decoy balloon. The Pentagon says
it plans to increase decoy complexity in future tests.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the White House, Postol said the Pentagon's
analysis of the more elaborate June 1997 sensor test ``urgently
needs to be investigated by a team of scientists who are recognized
for their scientific accomplishments and independence from the
Pentagon.'' His three-page letter had four detailed attachments
meant to back up his claims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A nuclear engineer by training, Postol in his analysis of the
Pentagon reports goes beyond questions of computer analysis of data
from incoming targets. In fact, he said, the test showed that
warheads and decoys appear so similar that sensors might never be
able to tell them apart. He also says the Pentagon conspired to
cover up this sensor problem.
</P>
<P>
   The brightness readings from the mock warhead and decoys, he
told the White House, ``fluctuated in a varied and totally
unpredictable way,'' revealing no feature ``that could be used to
distinguish one object from the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this upset, Postal continued, the analytical team
arbitrarily rejected and selected data to create an ``elaborate
hoax'' that was then hidden in reports by the use of ``misleading,
confusing, and self-contradictory language.''

MANY EMPLOYERS FOUND TO VIOLATE LAW ON PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH
COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional investigators say thousands of
employers are violating a federal law that requires similar levels
of insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law has produced few of the benefits intended for
people who need mental health care and does not appear to have
increased access to such care, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, from the General Accounting Office, will
present their findings on Thursday at a Senate hearing requested by
lawmakers hoping to expand the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the Mental Health Parity Act, group health plans
may not set annual or lifetime dollar limits on a person's mental
health care that are lower than the limits for general medical and
surgical services.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office surveyed employers in 26 states
and found that 14 percent were not complying with the federal
standards. Most of these companies, by their own account, had
lifetime limits on mental health benefits of $100,000 or less, but
set higher ceilings for medical and surgical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO estimated that 9,000 to 13,000 employers in the 26
states were violating the federal standards, but it did not name
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in these states ``have often seen only minor changes
in their health benefits, resulting in little or no increase in
their access to mental health services,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Even employers that complied with the law found ways to restrict
access to mental health care, by setting limits on the number of
office visits or days of hospital care for which they would pay. By
such techniques, the report said, most health plans that comply
with the law _ 87 percent _ ``restrict mental health benefits to a
greater extent than medical and surgical benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said it ``did not find significant
differences in the rate of employer noncompliance based on
characteristics such as employer size, industry or geographic
region.'' In other words, investigators found compliance problems
among employers of all types.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law does not apply to health plans sponsored by an
employer with 50 or fewer employees. It applies to employers that
serve as their own insurers, paying claims from company assets, as
well as to companies that buy health insurance on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said: ``Some employers seem to be
living up to the letter of the law, but not its spirit. I believe
these practices will have to be examined in more detail as we
proceed with reauthorization of the Mental Health Parity Act.'' The
law expires on Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is being held by the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions, of which Jeffords is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the 1996 law, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., cited the findings to support their
contention that Congress should broaden the law to prohibit
disparities in coverage for mental and physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would be ``a major step toward ending the persistent
discrimination against people who suffer from mental illness,''
Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, has advocated
``full parity'' in insurance coverage, and Gore sometimes promotes
the idea in presidential campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Thursday, the Clinton administration will
officially embrace the concept for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony prepared for the hearing, Dr. Steven E. Hyman,
director of the National Institute of Mental Health, says there is
``no reason based on biomedical or behavioral science why mental
disorders should be treated differently from any other medical
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, Hyman said, no scientific reason that a health plan
should cover Parkinson's disease but not schizophrenia, for both
are ``chronic and not yet curable diseases that affect dopamine
systems in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said the 1996 law had had ``a
negligible effect'' on health insurance costs and premiums. A more
comprehensive law requiring full parity could lead to ``cost
increases of about 2 percent to 4 percent,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   E. Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at the National
Association of Manufacturers, said, ``To the extent that an
employer is not in compliance, it may be because of confusion over
the application of the law or perhaps a continued struggle to hold
health cost increases in check.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. Klein, president of the Association of Private Pension
and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500
companies, said he was surprised to hear that some companies were
not complying. ``I don't have any evidence to dispute that,'' Klein
said, ``but our members tend to have very high compliance because
they track these requirements closely.''

ANOTHER HEDGE FUND MANAGER WILL LEAVE HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Shopkorn said Wednesday that he would leave his job as
chief stock picker at Moore Capital, a $10 billion investment
management business.
</P>
<P>
   But Shopkorn, 57, added that he was not permanently retiring.
```My son's graduating from college and my daughter from graduate
school,'' he said. ``I'm going to take some time off. I've done
this for 32 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As prominent managers of hedge funds leave the business in a
wave, Shopkorn joins Julian H. Robertson Jr., who said he was
shuttering his Tiger Management hedge fund empire in late March,
and George Soros' top money managers, Stanley F. Druckenmiller and
S. Nicholas Roditi, who said they would retire in April.
</P>
<P>
   Soros and Robertson have suffered steep losses this year because
of stock market volatility, but Moore has held up better. The
firm's flagship funds, Moore Global Investment and Remington, have
declined 4 percent to 5 percent this year, and their combined
assets have shrunk from $9 billion at the beginning of the year to
$8.3 billion last week. About half that shrinkage stemmed from
investors asking for redemptions, with the firm choosing to return
the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Soros' Quantum Fund has dropped 20 percent this
year, while its assets have shrunk from $10.4 billion at the
beginning of the year to $7.1 billion last week, both from market
performance and shareholder redemptions. When announcing his
management changes, Soros said he would remodel Quantum on a more
conservative frame. The fund now has 80 percent to 90 percent in
cash, according to someone close to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkorn, too, has apparently steered a more conservative course
of late. He said he has trimmed his technology holdings in
particular and equities overall, though he declined to provide
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known figure on Wall Street, Shopkorn was once vice
chairman and chief of equities trading at the brokerage firm
Salomon Brothers. In the early '90s, he left Salomon to start a
hedge fund. After some publicized struggles, he closed that fund
and, in 1996, was hired by Louis Moore Bacon, Moore's chief
executive, to run its equity operations.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's top stock holdings, at the end of March, included
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, the Internet security company
Verisign and News Corp, according to regulatory filings. Shopkorn
said he had sharply reduced his funds' technology positions in late
March and April, mitigating the damage from April's correction in
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to shareholders this week, Bacon said that Shopkorn
had signed on for five years and was now ready to leave ``with the
goal of simplifying his life.''

AUSTRALIAN BREAKS WOMEN'S BUTTERFLY   RECORD SET IN '81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., Ga.)  By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The oldest record in swimming, in the
women's 200-meter butterfly, was broken here Wednesday night at the
Australian national championships after 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Susie O'Neill, a 26-year-old who has been pursuing the record
for several years, clocked a time of 2 minutes 5.81 seconds,
breaking the mark of 2:05.96 set by Mary T. Meagher of the United
States in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one I am after,'' O'Neill said before the race
here at the Sydney Aquatic Center, which will be the venue for the
Summer Olympic Games swimming. She won the event at the Atlanta
Games in 1996, and on several occasions had come tantalizing close
to Meagher's mark. Wednesday night, cheered by a crowd of 10,000,
she accomplished the goal and surpassed the swimmer she had
idolized since getting Meagher's autograph as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I did it,'' O'Neill gasped in a poolside TV interview
after hugging her coach, Scott Volkers. ``Over the last few yards I
felt strong. The crowd helped me get to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go faster, and with record pressure gone, I'll be
more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, swimming records rarely lasted more than a year or
two, so Meagher's mark, set almost two decades ago, had become a
unique target. It had held up against the best efforts of strong
East German and Chinese swimming teams the past two decades, and in
the swimming world it was viewed with the same reverence as Bob
Beamon's long jump record, which stood for 23 years, was in track
and field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's achievement, reaching across two generations of
champions, won her a matching share of the world swimming spotlight
currently focused on her compatriot Ian Thorpe, who set world
records three times this week. Wednesday night's mark was set in a
race at the midpoint of a week of national qualifiers for the
Olympic events, which are scheduled here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, O'Neill, holder of 34 Australian free and fly
titles and records, launched a long-planned challenge to Meagher's
elusive mark at the Pan Pacific championships here but failed then
by 64-hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, O'Neill, a veteran among her many teen-age
teammates, was almost one second ahead of the world pace at 100
meters and 150 meters. Over the last few strokes, with the crowd
and commentators shouting her on, she slowed slightly but just
managed to reach the finish line in record time.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's rewriting of part of a long-closed page of the record
book came more than a decade after her first title, in the 50-meter
butterfly in the 1989 nationals when she was a 15-year-old still in
junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher was 16 years old when she set the previous record on
Aug. 13, 1981, at Brown Deer, Wis. She now uses her married name,
Mary Plant, and lives in Peachtree City, Ga., with her husband and
two children. She praised O'Neill's perseverance.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``She missed it a few times but kept her head down and kept
working and finally did it, so all the credit goes to her,'' she
told The Associated Press. ``I couldn't ask for a better way to
have that door in my life closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sadness, a sentimentality that my name is no longer
in the record books.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mahnaz Samadi spent four years in Tehran's notorious
Evin Prison for her efforts to liberate her native Iran from what
she regards as the repressive rule of the mullahs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Samadi sits in the Etowah County Jail in Gadsden, Ala.,
accused by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service of the
same offense _ trying to ``liberate Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has incensed metro Iranians, who say Samadi, a human
rights activist, has fallen victim to politics. They claim she has
been imprisoned as part of the U.S. administration's decision to
seek closer relations with the current government of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   If Samadi is deported, said Javad Mirzai, an Iranian who lives
in suburban Atlanta, she would face certain death.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will kill her,'' Mirzai said. ``They won't even give her
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Anderson, the acting deputy district director of the INS,
said Samadi is in no way a victim of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's being held solely on the grounds that she's a
terrorist,'' Anderson said. ``And we have evidence to support
that.'' He declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled Friday in Atlanta on Samadi's request for
a change of venue to Arlington, Va., near Washington, where her
friends and lawyers are.
</P>
<P>
   But one of her lawyers, Michael Maggio, said the venue will
affect the ability of her lawyers to see her, and of witnesses,
some of whom are congressional aides, to appear on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really the issue on Friday is whether this lady is going to
get a fair hearing,'' Maggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the INS wants the case heard here because it has
adequate detention facilities in this area and it has no evidence
that Samadi lives in Virginia. Samadi, 35, said in a telephone
interview from jail that she was tortured in prison in Iran from
1982 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger brother, Amir, had already been executed at age 18,
she said. Samadi said she was forced to witness the torture of her
older brother, Manouchehr, who was in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hung him from the ceiling and started flogging him on the
back with a very thick cable. . . .'' she said. ``They put a needle
under his fingernails. And they would pick up the needle to put
more pressure on him. He was shouting, and they forced me to open
my eyes and look at this horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, prison guards bound her hand and foot and beat
the soles of her feet while forcing her brother to watch.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to force her to abandon her opposition to the
Iranian government, she said. Manouchehr was later executed; Samadi
was eventually released.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she made her way to the United States. The next year,
she was granted asylum. She lived in the United States for six
years without incident, meeting U.N. officials and lobbying members
of Congress about human rights abuses in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Her immigration troubles began last November, when she visited
friends and relatives in Ottawa. She was arrested in Canada for not
having a valid visa.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, on her return from Canada, Samadi was arrested by
INS agents. She was notified that she was subject to deportation
because she had failed to acknowledge in her application for asylum
that she had been a member of an organization called the National
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   She was a commander, wrote Michael J. McLaughlin, the INS acting
district director in Buffalo, N.Y., ``and in that capacity you . .
. prepared units under your command for coordinated attacks to
liberate Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggio, Samadi's lawyer, said the asylum questionnaire asks
applicants to what organizations they belonged in their ``home
country'' _ and Samadi was in the NLA in Iraq, not Iran. She is no
longer a member, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the NLA was declared a ``foreign terrorist
organization'' by the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Maggio said, Samadi cannot legally be deported
because of the likelihood she would be tortured. Thus, he said, the
INS action could lead to Samadi's indefinite imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi was jailed first in Decatur and then in Union City before
being transferred _ chained hand and foot, she said _ to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Being in jail is difficult, Samadi said, partly because of what
she endured in jail in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``My condition is not good at all,'' she said. She is one of
three women in a cell with two beds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that I have become a victim in a political game,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer agrees. ``It certainly does look like that she's a
victim of politics,'' Maggio said. ``Because at the moment the
United States is, quite incredibly, cuddling up to the Iranian
regime because so-called moderates are emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn the attention of international human rights
organizations and several congressmen, including U.S. Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.). Barr has written to Attorney General Janet Reno praising
Samadi as ``a prominent human rights activist'' and saying ``her
release would be justified.''
</P>
<P>
   And local Iranians, who number in the thousands, said simple
fairness demands it. They're circulating a petition and contacting
local churches and congressmen on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranian people see freedom and democracy as their basic
right,'' said Mike Dolati, an Atlanta businessman. They want to
resist the Iranian regime, he said, ``the same way as the U.S.
Revolution.''

PLAYERS RAVE ABOUT CHANGES TO COLONIAL COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH, CHARLES CLINES AND TROY PHILLIPS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tom Kite, a Senior Tour participant playing
in his 28th Colonial, said off-season course tweaks represent
``probably the best redesign of a classic golf course that I've
ever seen.'' Kite praised several new bunker placements and said
the new greens, while rolling true, tend to dry out more quickly
than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Kite, might prevent the event from turning into a
putting showdown envisioned by some members and participants. In
addition, Kite said: ``Some of us with long-term memories of the
course are going to be fooled, because the greens do break a little
different than they did in the past. We're probably going to
misread a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink said the Colonial greens ranks as ``some of the
best we've seen this year.'' Stuart Appleby, the player in the
field with the best career scoring average at Colonial (69.0), said
the rebuilt greens ``are good, but I think they're really young and
need to settle down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brooks, who has been critical of how firm the Colonial
fairways had become in past tournaments, liked conditions yesterday
during the pro-am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in great shape,'' he said of the course. ``It's
softer _ the fairways _ and the new greens are putting much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how they \RColonial officials\S can't be happy
with what they've done to the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've heard is positive,'' Love said. ``Those who
are thinking about redesigning their courses should come and look
at this one. It just needed a new coat of paint and some new
plumbing \Rand not a major renovation\S,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty impressed,'' Mickelson said of the changes. He
especially believes the par-5 No. 11 hole has been improved by
moving the bunkers closer to the fairway and making the driving
area smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bunkers were up the hill before and really weren't in
play,'' he said.  &QL; 
Another tree lost
</P>
<P>
   One of Colonial's old pecan trees near the No. 7 green cracked
during play yesterday and was pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   The tree probably was more noticeable to players than to
spectators because part of the tree hung over the right side of the
green, protecting a right pin placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guessing it was a 100- to 125-year-old pecan tree,'' said
course superintendent Scott Johnson, who decided to pull the tree
down after it cracked in the high wind that buffeted the course
during yesterday's pro-am.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Y-shaped tree, and one side of it had been cut off at
least six years ago,'' he said. ``It was very one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   After it cracked, Johnson said it was wavering like a flag in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   He said to prevent it from falling on the green and causing
damage, or falling and injuring someone, he decided to have it
yanked down.
</P>
<P>
   With ropes tied to a front-end loader, the tree was pulled down
and fell into the right-front bunker and slightly on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to put just six plugs of grass \Rin the green\S where
the tree landed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tree was then chopped up and removed. With the tree gone,
Johnson said it opens the possibility for a pin placement farther
right on the green that was previously possible.
</P>
<P>
   With the tree falling, it marks the loss of another significant
tree at Colonial. The large pecan tree that once spread partially
over the 18th fairway, fell in 1998 after heavy rains, and the big
tree on 17, nicknamed Big Annie, was felled by lightning in 1986.  &QL; 
Allergies hamper Duval
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the No. 2 player in the world golf rankings,
scratched himself from yesterday's pro-am because of allergies.
Duval remains in the tournament and is scheduled to tee off at 1
p.m. in today's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate also skipped the pro-am but remains in the
tournament. Mediate has a 12:50 p.m. tee time today. Replacements
for Duval and Mediate in yesterday's pro-am were Billy Mayfair and
Chris DiMarco, respectively. Brian Watts replaced Dudley Hart, who
withdrew Tuesday from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute withdrawals, 111 competitors are scheduled
for today's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   The final field shows Colonial with 38 of the top 50 players on
the season money list, the same as at last week's GTE Byron Nelson
Classic. The difference: Nelson officials landed the top three
players on the list _ Tiger Woods, Hal Sutton and Jesper Parnevik.
The season's biggest money winner competing at Colonial is Phil
Mickelson (No. 4, $1,761,264).  &QL; 
Errant Emmitt
</P>
<P>
   During yesterday's pro-am, players on the practice range were
interrupted when a drive from the second tee box smacked the roof
of a golf cart and ricocheted toward them. Moments later, Cowboys
running back Emmitt Smith sheepishly approached the range and said,
``Sorry, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman retrieved Smith's ball and tossed it back in play.
Smith chipped but landed nowhere near the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Emmitt. I gave you a bad drop,'' Sluman said.  &QL; 
Ace for Brooks' team
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baldwin, a Columbus, Ohio, resident, and one of the amateurs
in Mark Brooks' group, aced the 16th hole in yesterday's pro-am
with a wedge from 129 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my second hole-in-one,'' Baldwin said. ``And it was a
good swing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Brooks has had an amateur score an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's happened at least a couple of times,'' said Brooks,
whose team finished at 9 under par.  &QL; 
Greats had fun
</P>
<P>
   Two of sport's greatest players in their respective games, Hank
Aaron and Bobby Orr, helped Justin Leonard's team to a 14-under 56
in yesterday's pro-am. Both agreed that hitting a stationary white
ball is a lot harder than blasting a baseball over fences or hockey
puck into a net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest game I've played,'' said Orr, a hockey
Hall of Fame member who said he has lowered his handicap to a 6 in
the past 15 years. ``Hitting a hockey puck, for me, was a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My game's not that good,'' said Aaron, a Baseball Hall of Fame
member, who was sporting a 21 handicap. ``But I just enjoy playing.
I'm never going to be invited to play in the Masters, so it's just
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said he never played golf during his career, because ``I
had to worry about the big white ball instead of the little white
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr didn't play much during his career, either, but said he has
been hooked and playing steadily for the past 12 to 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell how much I play now,'' he said with a
laugh. ``Too much.''  &QL; 
Disappointments spur them on
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III said they're ready to play
this week after losing in a playoff to Jesper Parnevik at the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Love and Mickelson believe they let the victory slip out of
their grasps. Love had a two-shot lead after 10 holes on the final
day, and Mickelson had a shot lead before bogeying the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes me more intent on playing well the next week
because I didn't get the result I wanted,'' said Mickelson after
his pro-am round yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Love said. ``I would rather be playing when I'm
playing good than when I'm not. And I'm confident with the way I'm
hitting the ball. If I can get my short game working for four days
like I had it for 21/2 \Rin Irving\S, then I should play well.''  &QL; 
Texas Exes honor Leonard
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard was one of four recipients Tuesday night at the
Fort Worth Club of the Outstanding Young Texas Ex Award, first
given in 1980 by the Texas Ex-Students Association.
</P>
<P>
   Given in conjunction with the UT Distinguished Alumnus Award,
the Young Texas Ex Award each year goes to four distinguished
alumni 45 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard joined fellow PGA pro Ben Crenshaw (1980), former NFL
running back Earl Campbell (1984), New York Yankees pitcher Roger
Clemens (1988), Dallas mayor Ron Kirk (1996), Dell Computers
founder Michael Dell (1991) and actor Matthew McConaughey (1997)
and CNN reporter Catherine J. Crier (1990) as one of the
75,000-member association's more notable honorees.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the award is presented at UT's commencement, but the
Texas Exes held a special dinner for Leonard in Fort Worth because
of his commitment to Colonial.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Reigning CART champion Juan Montoya topped
the speed chart at the conclusion of a rain-shortened practice at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway yesterday, Day 5 of hot-lapping
leading to Pole Day on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, an Indy 500 rookie, toured the 2.5-mile oval in 221.566
mph in the No. 9 G Force/Oldsmobile entered by Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray, the reigning Indy Racing League champion, was
sixth-fastest yesterday at 219.674 mph in the No. 1 Conseco
Dallara/Aurora entered by Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sharp still owns the top speed of the week at 223.936 mph
in his backup No. 8 Delphi Dallara/Olds. Sharp ran that lap
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put four of those laps together,'' Sharp said,
referring to qualifying. ``The pole run might have a couple of 223s
in it, but it's going to have a couple of 222s, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams typically crank out their fastest practice laps late on
Friday afternoon. But more rain is forecast for today and tomorrow,
leading into the annual draw for qualifying position.  &QL; 
Speculating on Petty wreck
</P>
<P>
   Speculation as to the cause of the crash that killed teen-ager
Adam Petty at New Hampshire International Speedway on Friday
centers around a possible hung throttle.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup star Mark Martin says a driver's first
reaction to a hung throttle is to flip off the ignition switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just can't reach over and shut the switch off at every
racetrack every time,'' Martin said, ``based on how much time you
have between where you've figured out the throttle was hung and
your wall impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets right down to the turn-in point of a corner of a
place like New Hampshire _ he lets off the gas and it stays going _
all you really do and all you'll ever really do is grab two hands
full of steering wheel and hold on tight before you hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the most common cause of a hung throttle is the
accelerator linkage catching onto the air-cleaner base that lays
over the top of the carburetor.  &QL; 
NHRA readies `Expo'
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled appearances by reigning NHRA Funny Car champion John
Force and Top Fuel title-holder Tony Schumacher, and a Top Fuel
engine demonstration, will highlight activities of the eighth
annual Dallas Motorsports Expo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A prelude to the Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in
Ennis on May 25-28, the Expo will run from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the
historic West End district downtown. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Top Fuel engine demonstrations, courtesy of Team Kalitta, are
scheduled for noon and 7 p.m. A Jr. Dragster demonstration is set
for the same time slots.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 50 race cars and motorcycles will be on display.
For driver appearance updates and ticket information, check the
track's Web site (www.texasmotorplex.com).  &QL; 
Andretti ties Big Al
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti's victory in CART's rain-delayed Firehawk 500
in Japan on Sunday was his 39th, extending his career Championship
Auto Racing Teams record and allowing him to tie Al Unser for
third-place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Only Michael's father, Mario, with 52 victories, and Texan A.J.
Foyt with 69, stand ahead of Mikey and the elder Unser in all-time
Champ Car victories. Andretti now has won at least one race for a
record 13 seasons, breaking a tie with three-time series champion
Rick Mears.

FORCE'S IMPENDING RECORD TAKES BACK SEAT TO TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Nine-time NHRA Funny Car champion John Force
could reach one of drag racing's milestones in Englishtown, N.J.,
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But if Force does match Bob Glidden's 85 career national-event
victories by winning the Matco Tools Spring SuperNationals, expect
a scaled-down celebration. The father of four daughters _ including
two teen-agers and a pre-teen _ Force said he was blindsided by the
death of fourth-generation NASCAR driver Adam Petty in a crash at
Loudon, N.H., last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a heartbreaker,'' Force said]. ``Puts a downer on
everything and makes you realize the value of just being here every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Force said he met Petty, 19, somewhere during his whirlwind
travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read that this young kid was chasing his dreams,'' a
subdued Force said Tuesday. ``I know that's a great bunch of racers
over there, people that have dedicated their whole lives to the
sport. And to have this happen, it makes you want to go home and
grab your children and hide 'em and not let 'em go out into the
world. I don't think it's fair. My heart cries out to that family
because they had a lot of dreams in that kid. And I'm really sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I win, I wish I could trade it for that kid, you know
what I'm saying? To give him time to chase his dream. I've had a
lot of my dreams. It's just a bummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Force never has made a huge deal of catching and
passing Glidden. The retired Pro Stock champion and Ford loyalist,
Glidden won a record 10 Winston Drag Racing Series championships,
another number also within Force's grasp this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You strive in life to get somewhere and when you get there you
jump to the next goal,'' said Force, driver of the Castrol GTX Ford
Mustang. ``The bottom line is I'd like to get it over with and get
focused on the championship. Even though I never raced Bob Glidden,
he was a great athlete in the sport and I'd like to be a part of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, 51, has notched back-to-back victories in Richmond, Va.,
and Commerce, Ga., to pull into second place in National Hot Rod
Association Funny Car points, 30 behind surprise leader Jerry
Tolliver of the WWF Racing stable.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Brute'' Force prevails this weekend, he could pass Glidden
with a victory in the fourth annual Castrol Nationals at the Texas
Motorplex in Ennis on May 25-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a real love for Texas,'' Force said. ``You can attack
the Motorplex, because it'll take everything you throw at it. Texas
is kinda my deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, who began his Funny Car career in 1978, lost nine
consecutive finals before earning his first career victory, at
Montreal in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time I thought I never would win. Now going on 85,
it's something,'' Force said. ``I never looked at 85 wins or 10
championships. I'd like the 85 wins to say I did something in
history that's big. I want it. It's just a hard time to jump up and
down and say, `Look at me'... after an individual has lost his
life, and the people around him.''

STEWART'S STYLE A PERFECT FIT FOR THE WINSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Promoter extraordinaire H.A. ``Humpy''
Wheeler has tapped Dale Earnhardt Jr. to win the 16th edition of
The Winston, the all-star race of NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, at
Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's a solid selection, despite Little E's status as Winston Cup
rookie. Earnhardt Jr. is the series' only repeat winner through 11
starts, including the recent night race at Richmond, Va., on May 6.
Earnhardt Jr. also posted the fastest speed among 14 teams testing
at the 1.5-mile LMS trioval in Concord, N.C., last week.
</P>
<P>
   Little E's breakthrough Cup victory, of course, was scored last
month at Texas Motor Speedway, a sister 1.5-mile facility to the
former Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Humpy annually studies all this stuff, and then makes up the
rest, which is his prerogative as racetrack president/promoter
extraordinaire. For the record, Humpy is batting eight-for-12 as
chief prognosticator for this made-for-TV drama covering 70 laps in
three segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-holds-barred, stand-on-the-gas race that fits
perfectly with his mentality and his driving style,'' Wheeler said
of Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Humpy could just as easily have been sizing up Tony Stewart,
whose motivation for victory in Saturday's nonpoints race goes
beyond the record $500,000 winner's purse. For all its hype, the
Winston is out-of-the-ordinary emotional. Traditionally, tempers
flare, sparks fly and shiny special paint schemes are wadded-up
during the macho final 10-lap segment.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Stewart, who is mad at himself _ and mad at the world _
after a stumbling start to his sophomore Cup season. The series'
runaway Rookie of the Year in 1999 after winning a record three
races and finishing fourth in points, Stewart stands 11th in the
driver's standings, 27 lousy points behind Terry Labonte. You could
make a case that Stewart hasn't had any fun since he and Robby
Gordon got into their celebrated shoving match in the garage area
at the Daytona International Speedway in February.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Stewart visibly was upset as he exited the pits
after that night race at Richmond International Raceway. Recall
that a pit-road incident involving Little E slashed Stewart's left
rear tire as he returned to the track, knocking him out of the lead
of a race he was in position to win.
</P>
<P>
   Tony was ticked, and did nothing to sugarcoat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got out of the car and I wasn't upset about what
happened, I wouldn't be driving in Winston Cup,'' said Stewart,
driver of the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix owned by Joe
Gibbs. ``Nobody would want me in their race car. Whether it's
politically correct or not _ it's probably not. But at the same
time, I think people deserve to see true emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that you don't have to like me. I've never
asked anybody or told anybody that they have to like me, but just
respect what I do and respect the fact that I have an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs knows that Stewart's short fuse has made him a ready
target for criticism from some fans and media members. But Gibbs
has found working with Stewart absolutely exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he'll blow up,'' said Gibbs, who dealt with all manner of
temperaments as head coach of the NFL's Washington Redskins. ``Yes,
he'll get in your face. I walked up to him after a race, and I'm
going to congratulate him on finishing in the top 10. And when he
saw me, he turned around and vented for about five minutes. He
said, `I'm sick and tired ...' and he went off and chewed me out,
half the people in our program out and everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't get excited about that. I got excited because I
know finishing 10th to him stunk. You don't want to finish 10th. He
wants to win a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who will turn 29 on Saturday, said he and crew chief
Greg Zipadelli realistically began the season expecting to at least
match the stats from their ``dream'' rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had unbelievable fortune last year,'' Gibbs said. ``But I
go to the racetrack each week _ and I honestly mean this _ I go
expecting the 20 car to win every single race.''
</P>
<P>
   Including The Winston, a no-holds-barred, stand-on-the-gas race
that despite Humpy's hype, has Tony Stewart's style written all
over it.

KITE OUT TO CONTEND WITH YOUNGER SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Where his golf game was concerned, turning
50 wasn't a raw deal for Tom Kite.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching 50 was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of miserable on the golf course,'' said Kite, who
tees up tomorrow at his 28th consecutive MasterCard Colonial. ``I
had a ratty attitude. I was just an unhappy person.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed one year ago, when in the twilight of his days as a
regular PGA Tour member, Kite referred to making his
tournament-record 27th Colonial cut as ``just another check.'' He
tied for 47th and was uncharacteristically surly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, Kite had no top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour,
his first years without top-10 finishes since his rookie season of
1972. The subject most often broached during his 21 tour
appearances in 1999 was his 50th birthday, Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to the Senior PGA Tour with a game that appeared shot
wasn't how Kite envisioned going out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a real sense of urgency to get my game back,'' Kite
said. ``I got in shape by working out in the off-season, got a new
teacher \RDave Phillips of Baltimore\S and started enjoying the
game again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite said being among the Senior Tour's latest class of freshmen
that included Tom Watson and Lanny Wadkins has energized him. He
has survived cuts at both regular PGA Tour events he has played in
this season, The Players Championship (tied for 66th) and the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic (tied for 61st).
</P>
<P>
   This week, he will again put his perfect earnings record at
Colonial on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a clip from the Senior Tour about Ray Floyd being the
first to win on both tours in the same year \R1992\S,'' tour member
Davis Love III said. ``I thought, `Well, Tom's going to do that,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senior Tour, Kite is 11th in total earnings ($468,920).
One week after making the cut at The Players Championship, Kite
notched his first Senior Tour victory at The Countrywide Tradition
in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Players Championship gave me a confidence boost,'' Kite
said. ``I'm hitting significantly better than a year ago. If I can
come out here and make cuts and add something to the tournaments
where I've had success and good followings, I'll come out. But I
don't plan to come out and just take someone's spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite's 10-year exempt status on the PGA Tour as the 1992 U.S.
Open winner expires after 2002. This week, Kite said Colonial
serves as strategic preparation for the June 15-18 U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach, because he'll miss next week's Senior Tour event due
to his daughter Stephanie's high school graduation. That leaves two
weeks of preparation on the Senior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference out here is the courses are a little
longer,'' Love III said. ``It's the same thing. I think Tom and
some of those other Senior guys can still win out here. They shoot
low scores over there, get the putter working and come back here
more confident. I'd come back if I was them.''

GORE SAYS BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN COULD HURT CURRENT
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Stepping up his criticism of Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest some of their Social
Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore told a convention of older
Americans on Wednesday that the plan could jeopardize the
retirement benefits even of current recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Injecting a sense of urgency into his dire warnings about Bush's
plan, Gore argued that the proposal could have an almost immediate
impact by destabilizing the Social Security system, weakening the
economy and reducing government resources for other programs,
including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your
retirement savings in the Social Security program,'' Gore told
several thousand people at a convention of AARP, formerly known as
the American Association of Retired People. ``You shouldn't be left
without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to
foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because
some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also seized on remarks Bush made Tuesday, when the
Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be
just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of
their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if people make poor choices?'' asked Gore, the Democratic
Party's presumptive presidential nominee. ``What if the stock mark
dips right before an individual retires? Are individuals stuck with
nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future
benefit cuts, Gore added, ``I don't think your Social Security
should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush has not filled in many details of his proposal, its
broad outline calls for allowing workers to invest a portion of the
12.5 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits in
the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The governor argues that allowing people to take advantage of
Wall Street's strong returns could reduce the cost of retirement
benefits and help extend the solvency of the system. Under current
projections, Social Security will become insolvent by 2037, as more
baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to
use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and
then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he
claims, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until
2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic
boom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush argues that the Gore proposal, by failing to address Social
Security's underlying problems, would inevitably lead to tax
increases or benefit cuts to close future shortfalls in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sought to turn the Social Security debate into a
broader issue of leadership style, asserting that Bush's
``irresponsible'' plan demonstrates that he would be an incompetent
steward of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character
as about policy, arguing that Gore has shown himself to lack
credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again Wednesday,
releasing material from a White House Web site in which Gore is
said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton
administration to invest some Social Security money ``to achieve
higher returns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore proposed allowing the federal government to invest in
the stock market to save Social Security and now he's denying it,''
said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``Whether
the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now
Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for
political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides contend that the administration's proposal involved
less risk than Bush's. And Gore himself says he grew wary of the
plan after hearing debate on it.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP,
said the organization, which represents 34 million people, has not
taken a position on either candidate's plan. But he said AARP would
almost certainly oppose any proposal that called for allowing
workers to invest all of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What privatization means to me is that the risk is shifted
entirely on to the individual instead of being shared broadly,''
Rother said. ``The whole point of Social Security is that it be
something you can count on, where you are not at risk.''

SHUTTLE ATLANTIS, CREW GETTING READY FOR FRIDAY LAUNCH  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Ground teams relaxed the pace of their
work on Wednesday as they readied the shuttle Atlantis for its
weather-delayed mission to the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, with a crew of seven astronauts, is scheduled to blast
off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Friday at 5:12 a.m. CDT, a
day later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's liftoff was bumped to Friday when the inaugural
launching of a commercial Atlas III rocket from the neighboring
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was postponed Tuesday because of
high winds.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle and the Atlas III rely on the same ground-based Air
Force radar tracking equipment. The commercial rocket lost its
priority for use of the equipment on Wednesday when a third launch
attempt was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of electronic and sensor problems halted the
countdown and could not be resolved before Wednesday's launch
period ended. The Atlas III will not be scheduled again for launch
until after Atlantis lifts off.
</P>
<P>
   Postponements are nothing new to Atlantis commander Jim Halsell,
pilot Scott Horowitz and the remainder of the crew, Jeff Williams,
Jim Voss, Susan Helms, Mary Ellen Weber and Russian cosmonaut Yuri
Usachev.
</P>
<P>
   Their flight was postponed three times last month by winds at
the shuttle's emergency runways in Florida, Spain and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   This time, near ideal weather conditions are forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Once aloft, the shuttle crew will dock late Saturday with the
uninhabited first components of the international space station.
Williams and Voss will begin a lengthy spacewalk late Sunday to
re-secure a wobbly cargo crane on the station's exterior.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the shuttle crew will enter the station to begin
replacement of failing power storage batteries, repairs to a
communications system and other maintenance chores.
</P>
<P>
   The activities will prepare the orbital outpost for the arrival
of the Russian crew module in July and the first resident crew of
astronauts and cosmonauts late this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian financial ills and problems with the country's Proton
rocket stalled the start of station assembly. The crew module
itself is more than two years tardy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the shuttle crew members depart the station next week,
they will use the shuttle's steering thrusters to gently raise the
altitude of the orbital outpost by more than 20 miles. The boost
will position the station for its automated rendezvous with the
crew module in July.

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Nearly 37 years after a bombing that
horrified the nation, the authorities here charged two longtime
suspects with murder on Wednesday in the the deaths of four black
girls in the explosion at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, both of whom were
affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and have been considered suspects
for decades in the 1963 bombing, turned themselves in on Wednesday
morning after being indicted by a state grand jury on Tuesday. They
are being held in the Jefferson County jail here without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has ever been tried in the case,
and that was not until 1977, 14 years after the bombing. He was
convicted of murder, sentenced to life and died in prison in 1985.
Herman Cash, another man named as a suspect in early FBI case
files, died in 1994 without ever being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities reopened their investigation of the bombing
in 1996, encouraged by recent successful prosecutions of other
decades-old killings in civil rights cases. But they declined on
Wednesday to discuss the evidence they have gathered against
Blanton, 61, of Birmingham, and Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Several of Cherry's relatives, including an ex-wife and a
granddaughter, have said they told grand jurors that Cherry had
boasted of taking part in the bombing. But there is little
information about what additional new evidence, if any,
investigators may have found to implicate either Cherry or Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the evidence at a news conference on Wednesday, Doug
Jones, the U.S. attorney here, would only say, ``We expect the
evidence today to be a good bit different than it would have been
36 years ago.'' The evidence lent itself better to a prosecution
under state charges rather than federal ones, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Though some witnesses have died and there have been no reports
of new physical evidence, prosecutors said on Wednesday that they
were optimistic about their chances to win convictions. ``The
witnesses that we have, we believe, are sufficient to sustain the
charge,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were each charged with eight counts of murder
_ two counts for each of the four girls. The counts cover
intentional murder and ``universal malice'' because the bomb could
have killed many more people.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutions of Blanton and Cherry are the latest in a
series of dusty civil rights cases that have been reopened in
recent years as a new breed of Southern prosecutors have come to
power, as new witnesses have come forward to relieve guilty
consciences, and as changing times and demographics have made it
easier to impanel jurors willing to convict whites for the murders
of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable case was the 1994 conviction of Byron de la
Beckwith for the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, a prominent
organizer with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, in Mississippi. But there have been numerous others
in several states, and Mississippi officials are now delving again
into the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers _ Andrew
Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham bombing holds a special place in civil rights
history because of the randomness of its violence, the sacredness
of its target and the innocence of its victims. The four girls _
Denise McNair, 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and
Cynthia Wesley, all 14 _ died in a dressing room in the church
basement when the bomb detonated at 10:19 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 15,
1963. The bomb, apparently hidden under the church steps the night
before, blew the face of Jesus out of a stained glass window. The
bodies of the girls, dressed in white for an annual youth service,
were found beneath the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The church had been a center of civil rights activity in
Birmingham, a city that experienced some of the most violent
resistance of the day. Perhaps as much as any single act, the
bombing aroused public sentiment against Southern segregationists
and emboldened civil rights leaders to redouble their efforts. More
recently, the incident was the subject of Spike Lee's acclaimed
documentary, ``Four Little Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual circumstance, the cases brought on Wednesday will
be tried in the state courts here even though the FBI and federal
prosecutors have led the re-examination of the bombing. Jones said
that his ability to prosecute the case in the federal courts was
hindered by jurisdictional issues and by the statute of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to address comments made by one of Cherry's lawyers
in published reports that he had offered Cherry a light sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea on federal charges of interstate
transportation of dynamite. In cases where the dynamite causes a
death, that charge is not subject to the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statute of limitations for murder in Alabama. If the
case goes to trial, Jones and one of his assistants will be
deputized as state prosecutors and will join a deputy district
attorney in the courtroom.

 BIRMINGHAM, Ala.: the courtroom. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Barber, the district attorney here, said he would not
pursue the death penalty against Blanton and Cherry. He said they
would have to be tried under the death penalty statute that existed
in 1963, a statute that has since been changed because of
constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Blanton nor Cherry made any public comment on Wednesday
as they were brought to jail by their lawyers. Blanton arrived
first, at about 7:30 a.m., and Cherry showed up shortly before
noon, chauffeured by his lawyers in a silver Lexus bearing the
license tag: N OCENT.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both men said their clients would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has maintained his innocence for 37 years,'' said David S.
Luker, Blanton's attorney. ``You just wonder what information they
possess now that they didn't possess for the last 37 years.
People's memories don't get better with time, just worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Johnson, one of Cherry's lawyers, said he was trying to
soothe his client, who has suffered two heart attacks. ``We're
trying to keep him somewhat positive in his outlook,'' he said.
``He's an old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blanton, who has had made few comments about the bombing
over the years, Cherry has proclaimed his innocence in frequent
interviews and news conferences. While he has acknowledged his past
membership in the Klan, he has maintained he was at his Birmingham
home watching wrestling on television the night the bomb was
planted. A recent report in the Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss.,
disclosed that there were no wrestling programs on television in
Birmingham that night.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry has been in Alabama since May 4, when he was extradited
from Texas on charges that he sexually abused his former
stepdaughter when she was a child. That charge emerged as the
stepdaughter and other relatives were called to testify before a
grand jury about the bombing case.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine McNair, the only parent of a victim who could be reached
on Wednesday, said that she and her husband, a longtime county
commissioner here, had decided not to comment about the
indictments. ``It's an interesting day, I'll put it that way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Birmingham residents and others with stark memories of
the bombing clearly saw the day's events as an important step in
this city's efforts to salve its racial wounds. Several said they
were gratified to see the federal government leading the way,
particularly given The New York Times' disclosure two decades ago
that former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had shelved the
investigation in the 1960s despite the optimism of his subordinates
in Birmingham that it could be successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tragedy of just absolute monumental proportions,''
Jones said. ``It has scarred the city of Birmingham for almost 37
years. There needs to be some kind of closure, one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. John H. Cross, the pastor of 16th Street Baptist at the
time, recalled Sept. 15 of that year as ``a terrible day, a day
that never ended.'' Wednesday's indictments, he said, ``will help
to ease the temper of the city.''

 &HT;    2 indicted in '63 Birmingham bombing
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. John H. Cross shed tears of joy at home in
Decatur, Ga., on Wednesday afternoon as 37 years of history _ and,
he hopes, justice _ swept over him.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., an explosion from a dynamite
bomb ripped through the 16th Street Baptist Church that Cross
pastored in Birmingham. The blast killed four black school girls.
</P>
<P>
   Cross and Birmingham have been healing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Birmingham _ once called the nation's ``most
segregated big city'' by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. _ officials
jailed two longtime church bombing suspects after a state grand
jury returned murder charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Just months after the nation watched Birmingham Police
Commissioner Bull Connor turn attack dogs and fire hoses on civil
rights demonstrators, the explosion hardened the city's nickname _
Bombingham _ and helped draw silent, moderate whites into the
struggle for racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion damaged Alabama's largest city in its competitive
race with Atlanta for business supremacy of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   The detonation has continued to flash, almost daily, through the
church pastor's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly every day. Day and night,'' Cross said Wednesday in an
interview. ``The sound of the dynamite going off and hearing a
building crumble down. But today, it's kind of a happy feeling that
brings tears to my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of the bombing, Cross stood in the church sanctuary,
observing an adult Sunday school class. At first, he thought the
church's gas water heater had blown up, shaking the red brick
walls. Then he caught a whiff of ignited powder and evacuated the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, he found the bodies of 11-year-old Denise
McNair and 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and
Cynthia Wesley in the basement. They had been preparing to provide
music and act as ushers for Youth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Wednesday, reliving the smoke, death and rubble was
too much for Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you'll never forget,'' said his wife,
Almetia, who stood as a buffer between her husband, the curious
media and a flood of bad memories. ``You never think someone will
plant a bomb in a church.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what the state grand jury has accused two former Ku
Klux Klan members of doing 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry were each indicted
on eight counts of first-degree murder, two different counts for
each slain child. Blanton is in his early 60s; Cherry is 69.
</P>
<P>
   Through attorneys, the men said they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants the world to know his story, and he thinks he'll be
vindicated,'' said Cherry's attorney, Mickey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, they could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation in the 1970s resulted in the murder conviction
of Robert Edward Chambliss, who died in prison in 1985 while
serving a life term. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The case was reopened in 1980 and again in 1988, with no
additional charges filed. It was reopened again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The roles the suspects are believed to have played in the
bombing have been publicly speculated about for years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the lasting effect of the bombing on the community
and beyond has been debated for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This continues a process of healing that can never be
completed but still has some pretty rough edges that can be
smoothed with further actions,'' said Edward LaMonte, president of
the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, located across the street
from the rebuilt church. From 1947 to 1963, the Birmingham area
suffered 41 racially motivated bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Birmingham had known for a long time that there were
innocent lives being taken by brutal Klansmen, but it had (mostly)
been on dusty country roads and rural areas,'' said LaMonte, once a
chief aide to Richard Arrington, Birmingham's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, immortalized in
Spike Lee's movie ``4 Little Girls,'' stunned the nation. President
John F. Kennedy expressed ``outrage and grief.'' The FBI promised
its most intense investigation since the manhunt for John Dillinger
in the 1920s. The first conviction took 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 16th Street bombing left an indelible image all over the
world of what Birmingham was like,'' said Wayne Flynt, a historian
at Auburn University. ``It established once and for all an
international reputation for Birmingham as a city that was never
too busy to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the tragedy pushed blacks and whites to work harder at
integration _ especially white moderates who had been silently
tolerant of measures to quash attempts by blacks to achieve
equality.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral of the four girls marked the first time many whites
in Birmingham had attended a predominantly black gathering. A
strange unity began to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the bombing, The Birmingham News editorialized
that the city ``began drawing tight its belt of courage, trying,
once more _ once more _ to meet the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This city's people _ and it is no cliche _ in vast majority
respect law, believe in brotherhood,'' the newspaper said.
``Nothing that has happened diminishes that, though blame for an
inadequacy is denied with difficulty. The decent people of this
city, so many thousands, yet have reserves of mental, moral and
physical strength. Once again they muster for new efforts at civic
sanity.''

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AIG SAYS HE WILL CONSIDER CHANGING MAKE-UP OF
BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fending off questions from shareholders at the annual
meeting of the American International Group on Wednesday, Maurice
R. Greenberg, its chief executive, said he would consider reversing
the insider dominance of his board. But he would not budge on his
designation of his son, Evan, as his eventual successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has approved Evan Greenberg as the CEO of the
company, period,'' Greenberg, 75, said. ``That's been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg announced the succession plan for AIG, one of the
world's largest insurance companies, earlier this year while on a
trip to China with his son, but he has said he has no plans to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than two-hour-long meeting, Greenberg said that
until last year, when two insiders were added to the board as the
result of an acquisition, independents had been in the majority and
that that balance might well be restored ``at an appropriate
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Brandon J. Rees, a researcher for the AFL-CIO, asked
Greenberg why the company did not simply endorse the AFL-CIO's
proxy proposal seeking an independent majority on the board,
Greenberg replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the board will decide at the appropriate time. We're not
going to act on your proposal. We'll act when the board believes it
should act.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the proxy proposal, Greenberg added: ``This is a
democratic vote. If you get a majority vote, something will happen.
If you don't, that's what won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now 10 AIG employees, including Greenberg and his son
on the board. Two other board members are AIG consultants and six
are independent. In 1998, AIG had 17 board members; nine of those
were not employees, but two of them were consultants.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Greenberg said it was ``an insult'' to
suggest that directors who had consulting contracts with AIG might
vote along with management on issues that they did not personally
endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Other shareholders raised questions about executive
compensation, AIG's policies on employment opportunities and
investments in projects in impoverished communities. But most of
the several hundred shareholders _ many of them employees _ who
crowded into AIG's Wall Street cafeteria for the meeting, clearly
sided with Greenberg, who reported an 18.1 percent increase in
earnings for last year and announced a 3-for-1 stock split as well
as an 11 percent increase in the annual stock dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't another insurance company that has outperformed
us,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of executive pay, Greenberg, who received $6
million in salary and bonuses last year plus stock options that
compensation experts say are now worth about $4.5 million, said
that of the 800 best-paid chief executives, he ranked 176th, while
AIG ranked 17th among the companies in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Without directly engaging on investments in poor communities,
Greenberg said that the Starr Foundation, named for AIG's founder,
C.V. Starr, and headed by Greenberg, had made significant
contributions ``in areas you discussed.'' As for employment
practices, Greenberg said: ``We hire people on the basis of the
best qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the meeting, Greenberg announced that the
AFL-CIO proposal had received the support of 27 percent of the
shareholders. A proposal by the Presbyterian Church (USA) to
establish an independent nominating committee for the board
received a little more than 26 percent of the vote, up about 2
percentage points from the vote on the same question at last year's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   American International, which was founded in Shanghai, has
pioneered the reopening of the insurance and financial services
businesses in China. And Greenberg has been campaigning for
congressional approval of permanent normal trading relations with
China. He bristled when a shareholder raised the question of human
rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have you been to China, my friend?'' Greenberg
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero,'' his questioner replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going to China since 1975, several times a year,''
Greenberg said. ``The changes taking place in that country that
affect human rights and rights in general are nothing short of
astounding. It is like going to a new planet. People are living
better today in China than at anytime in their 5,000-year
history.''
</P>
<P>
   One shareholder, who characterized Greenberg as ``a super guy,''
and said he would ``make you a five-star general'' if he had the
authority, called for a salute to both father and son and the
audience rose in a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on the choice of Evan Greenberg, 45, as his
successor, Greenberg said that while he had recommended his son,
the board had made the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evan Greenberg is a 25-year veteran in AIG and I can tell you
that that decision was the right decision,'' the elder Greenberg
said. ``My best interest is what's best for the company. And if I
thought that it was Evan or Timbuktu or somebody from Buck Rogers,
that's the person I would recommend.''

BRIEF FAULTS MICROSOFT'S ALTERNATIVE BREAKUP PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: May be updated.) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defending its plan to break up the Microsoft Corp.,
the government filed documents with a federal judge Wednesday night
that disparaged Microsoft's alternative proposal as ``a cosmetic
remedy that would have virtually no competitive significance.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief, from the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys
general, is the last written filing in the case before remedy
hearings begin on May 24. It is a response to the brief Microsoft
filed last week in which the company proposed several narrow
restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate
remedies than breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the government brief said Microsoft's proposal ``does not
address some of the most important violations found by the court,''
including the finding that the company had illegally tied its Web
browser to the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The document also belittled Microsoft's contention that
interaction between its product groups was crucial for continued
innovation. It cited several recent instances when company leaders,
including its chairman, Bill Gates, said exactly the opposite _
that clear divisions between groups was important for the company's
success.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Microsoft said, ``The government filing is long on
rhetoric but short on economic analysis or factual support for its
overreaching proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft
was in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws, and a
few days later he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to
complete the penalty phase of the case quickly _ preferably within
60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 20, the federal and state governments proposed
breaking Microsoft in two and imposing restrictions on the
company's behavior while the breakup was being carried out. Two
states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to go along with the others,
saying a breakup was too extreme a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government plan, one company would hold the Windows
operating system and the other would keep everything else,
including the Office package of applications programs that includes
Word, the word processor, and Excel, the spreadsheet program.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief last week, Microsoft decried the idea of a breakup
and said ``cross-pollination between engineers working on different
products such as Windows and Office has led to numerous
innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's government brief says: ``The story Microsoft now
tells of dependency between the operating systems and applications
is, at the very least, greatly exaggerated.'' It then goes on to
quote company leaders who appear to support that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail last year in which two company executives, Ben
Slivka and Brad Silverberg, were discussing a forthcoming corporate
reorganization, Silverberg wrote that Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's
president, ``needs to do something so that the company ends up with
an organization that essentially is a separate company within the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be free to do what it thinks best,'' he continued,
because ``the company is so wrapped up in its shorts that it can't
get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also quotes from the 1996 book ``Microsoft Secrets''
by Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Shelby, which quotes the
company's chairman, saying, ``Bill Gates insisted to us that
Microsoft's `dominant organizational theme is by products,'''
adding that Gates wanted ``product architectures that reduce
interdependencies among teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also quotes from another 1996 book, ``The Microsoft
Way'' by Randall E. Stross, in which Microsoft managers are quoted
as saying, ``Whenever they studied the patterns of actual
face-to-face communications'' between developer groups, ``they
invariably discovered that developers never seemed to venture more
than a few feet from their own offices. The daily
cross-fertilization of ideas among groups was not evident.''
</P>
<P>
   In an online column the same year, quoted in the brief, Gates
wrote: ``I gain confidence about a potential reorganization when I
see that it makes clear what every group is supposed to do'' and
``minimizes the dependencies and overlap between groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the government said, Microsoft's objections to its
remedy proposal are ``unfounded and based almost entirely on
tortured readings and mischaracterizations of the language of the
proposed remedy.'' In several places, the brief says, Microsoft
objected to a portion of the government's proposed remedy while
failing to mention another portion that addressed the company's
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in its brief filed last week, insisted that it would
need six months to prepare for remedy hearings should the judge
decide to consider the government's breakup plan. That would push
the end of the trial well into the next presidential
administration. And though Microsoft denies it, many analysts say
they think the company hopes a Republican administration will drop
the breakup idea. Gov. George W. Bush has already suggested he
opposes a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the government on Wednesday said the remedy phase
could be concluded quickly and called Microsoft's proposed schedule
``a transparent effort to delay the determination and
implementation of a remedy for its illegal acts as long as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief does not offer a specific alternate timetable, but
government officials have said the remedy phase could be completed
within a few weeks and the company's request ``for substantial
delays should be denied.'' &QL;

as much money as they choose spread among as many as 50 stocks.

INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE NOT UP TO THE JOB, CONGRESSIONAL REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also being filed in `w' category.) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poor organization, inadequate funding and a lack of
aggressive leadership have eroded the ability of the U.S.
intelligence community to face new threats, according to a
congressional report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that the effects made the intelligence community
more prone to serious errors like the bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing survey of the Central Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency and the other elements of the intelligence
community, the report by the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence found that ``the United States is placing undue risks
on its armed forces and its national security interests by not
redressing the many crucial problems facing the intelligence
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued in conjunction with the committee's proposed
intelligence budget for fiscal 2001, argued that broad, systemic
problems are behind a series of costly mistakes, from the CIA's
failure to predict that India would test a nuclear bomb to the
mistaken embassy bombing in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Resources are increasingly being drawn off to meet day-to-day
tactical requirements, meaning that broader, strategic intelligence
has suffered, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the CIA had no comment on the House report.
</P>
<P>
   The report charged that ``human intelligence'' _ espionage by
spies operating overseas _ is now stretched too thin by demands
from policy-makers to provide support for military operations and
other emergencies in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contingency operations'' have taken money from CIA espionage,
``limiting our efforts to rebuild our eyes and ears around the
globe,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Technical intelligence programs, from spy satellites to
eavesdropping and code-breaking operations, also came in for tough
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that the government has failed to develop
advanced computer systems to adequately process and analyze photos
produced by the nation's latest spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that imagery intelligence still suffers from
``totally inadequate systems planning and investment,'' and that
``unanticipated technical problems'' with some new satellite
programs will ``likely cause scheduling delays and cost
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Agency, the super-secret eavesdropping and
code-breaking arm of the U.S. intelligence community, was also
cited for its inability to keep up with the rapid advances in
communications technology.
</P>
<P>
   A highly-publicized crash of the NSA's computer systems in
January was not caused by hackers or foreign spies, the report
said, but resulted from the NSA's ``lack of resources for new
infrastructure needs, the mismanagement of outdated information
technology resources, and the lack of sufficient acquisition
processes and expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The NSA, the report concluded, ``is seemingly incapable of
responding in an integrated fashion'' to the challenges posed by
the spread of new global networks that tie together radio,
satellite microwave, cellular and cable traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming increasingly difficult for NSA to penetrate and
then sift through the flood of e-mail, cell phone calls and other
new forms of communications to find the few bits of secret
information from other countries that the U.S. government might
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``NSA's modernization must result in a highly integrated system,
and will require a very sophisticated systems engineering and
program management capability, the like of which NSA has not
experienced in a very long time, if ever,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel also expressed anger at the handling of a series
of security breaches at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Among other matters, the report noted that the State Department
delayed notifying the FBI of the recent disappearance of a laptop
computer containing classified material for up to two months,
hindering the bureau's ability to conduct an effective
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the congressional oversight committees
were not notified of the potential loss of classified material
until after the laptop's disappearance was reported in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel had concerns about the scope and enforcement of
a new State Department policy restricting unescorted visitors to
the department's headquarters building, the report added. The FBI
has reported that foreign spies have frequently taken advantage of
the State Department's lax policy on visitors, and that some spies
obtained access to the department by posing as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lax security at the State Department has infuriated Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, prompting her to transfer responsibility
for the handling of highly classified material from the State
Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research to the Diplomatic
Security service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were intelligence information not so important for the State
Department for the conduct of informed foreign policy, the
Committee would likely be advocating drastic measures cutting off
access to highly classified materials,'' the report said. The
report added that the House intelligence committee is launching its
own in-depth investigation of security at the State Department.

PARTISAN ACIDITY FILLS SENATE AMID A SYMBOLIC GUN VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to prod Republicans on gun control,
Democrats forced a symbolic vote Wednesday on a stalled bill to
combat juvenile crime after tangling up the Senate with arcane
parliamentary devices for two days and unleashing deep acrimony
between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which does not carry the weight of law, passed
by a hair-thin margin of 50-49. It urged Republicans to immediately
pass the crime bill and an accompanying amendment that would
require all sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks on
buyers. Both have been stuck in the congressional pipeline for
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to stay silent on the issue, Republicans offered their
own resolution, which accused the Clinton administration of failing
to enforce existing gun laws and defended the rights of a ``citizen
to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose.'' That passed by a
vote of 69-30.
</P>
<P>
   Although the resolutions were pure symbolism, nothing more than
for-the-record suggestions, the action Wednesday comes at a
politically opportune time for Democrats, who are pushing for
stricter gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people rallied on the Mall
to voice support for gun control and, in a sign that the issue
remains potent on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush tried to
fend off criticism that he is soft on guns by announcing a plan to
provide trigger locks to gun owners in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing vulnerability, Republicans are reluctant to face another
vote, no matter how symbolic, on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But the real war of words today took place immediately after the
votes, when a fuming Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, attacked Democrats for accusing him of trying to stifle
debate and for what he said was deliberately trying to thwart his
efforts to move important appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said that Democrats clogged up the Senate with countless
unrelated measures, then ``they criticize us for not getting the
work done.'' He added, sputtering with anger, ``That's smart, real
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, was
able to force the gun issue on to the Senate floor by using a
loophole in new Senate rules. Republicans voted to close that
loophole Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Lott spoke, Daschle asserted that Democrats were relegated
to using parliamentary maneuvers to talk about gun control and
other issues because they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Then, arms flailing, he accused Lott of carrying out ``a version
of dictatorship on the Senate floor'' and running the Senate, where
debate is deliberately long and loosely structured, as if it were
the House. Lott's real motive, he said, was keeping politically
difficult issues from coming to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Senate is being run is wrong,'' Daschle said. ``No
majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate debate
as aggressively as Senator Lott has attempted to do. He is trying
to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also threatened to make future trouble for Lott by
further slowing down Senate proceedings if the majority leader did
not permit Democrats more leeway.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the crime bill last May, with Vice President
Al Gore casting a tiebreaking vote on the gun show amendment. But
the the House passed a crime bill that left out the gun show
measure.

GORE SAYS BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN COULD HURT CURRENT
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 5th graf to fix typo in `market'; subs 7th graf to
recast.) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Stepping up his criticism of Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest some of their Social
Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore told a convention of older
Americans on Wednesday that the plan could jeopardize the
retirement benefits even of current recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Injecting a sense of urgency into his dire warnings about Bush's
plan, Gore argued that the proposal could have an almost immediate
impact by destabilizing the Social Security system, weakening the
economy and reducing government resources for other programs,
including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your
retirement savings in the Social Security program,'' Gore told
several thousand people at a convention of AARP, formerly known as
the American Association of Retired People. ``You shouldn't be left
without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to
foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because
some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also seized on remarks Bush made Tuesday, when the
Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be
just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of
their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if people make poor choices?'' asked Gore, the Democratic
Party's presumptive presidential nominee. ``What if the stock
market dips right before an individual retires? Are individuals
stuck with nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future
benefit cuts, Gore added, ``I don't think your Social Security
should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush has not filled in many details of his proposal, its
broad outline calls for allowing workers to invest in the markets a
portion of the 12.5 percent payroll tax that finances Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor argues that allowing people to take advantage of
Wall Street's strong returns could reduce the cost of retirement
benefits and help extend the solvency of the system. Under current
projections, Social Security will become insolvent by 2037, as more
baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to
use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and
then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he
claims, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until
2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic
boom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush argues that the Gore proposal, by failing to address Social
Security's underlying problems, would inevitably lead to tax
increases or benefit cuts to close future shortfalls in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sought to turn the Social Security debate into a
broader issue of leadership style, asserting that Bush's
``irresponsible'' plan demonstrates that he would be an incompetent
steward of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character
as about policy, arguing that Gore has shown himself to lack
credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again Wednesday,
releasing material from a White House Web site in which Gore is
said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton
administration to invest some Social Security money ``to achieve
higher returns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore proposed allowing the federal government to invest in
the stock market to save Social Security and now he's denying it,''
said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``Whether
the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now
Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for
political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides contend that the administration's proposal involved
less risk than Bush's. And Gore himself says he grew wary of the
plan after hearing debate on it.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP,
said the organization, which represents 34 million people, has not
taken a position on either candidate's plan. But he said AARP would
almost certainly oppose any proposal that called for allowing
workers to invest all of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What privatization means to me is that the risk is shifted
entirely on to the individual instead of being shared broadly,''
Rother said. ``The whole point of Social Security is that it be
something you can count on, where you are not at risk.''

TRIAL OPENS FOR IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL CAUGHT IN STING OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A trusted veteran U.S. Immigration official betrayed his
country when he passed on a government secret to a wealthy friend
who plans to do business in Cuba after President Fidel Castro's
death, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday in his opening statement
in the official's espionage trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, a Cuban-American who has worked for immigration
since 1970, is charged with violating the Espionage Act by leaking
classified information during an FBI sting operation, and by lying
about meeting with agents of the Cuban Interest Section.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to decide which side Faget is on,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dick Gregorie told the 12 members of the
federal jury here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward O'Donnell, a lawyer for Faget, said his client did
nothing to warrant charges under the Espionage Act, and did nothing
to betray his country or jeopardize national security.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, who rose steadily up the ranks to become acting
district deputy director of immigration's office in Miami, has been
held without bond since his arrest in February.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorie said that federal agents suspicious of Faget, who has a
high security clearance and has access to classified information,
showed him a phony document about the impending defection of a
Cuban official.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 minutes later, he used his private cellular telephone to
call Pedro Font, his boyhood friend and business associate, and
told him about it.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he did not intend for the information to be used by
Cuban spies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Faget and Font are on the board of directors of a company
called America-Cuba, formed to do business in post-Castro Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregorie said Faget and others established a Panamanian
company as a way to get around the U.S. embargo of Cuba. The
company would buy land for cemeteries in Cuba, and ultimately
transport the bodies of Cuban exiles in the United States back to
Cuba for burial, for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Faget used his government connections and information to help
his business associates, said Gregorie. He said that Faget met in a
Miami bar with Jose Imperatori, a Cuban diplomat, even though under
the guidelines of his own agency, he is not supposed to meet with
agents of a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell in his opening statement described Faget as a longtime
public servant with an unblemished record.
</P>
<P>
   Faget faces as much as five years in prison if convicted.

   Sporadic clashes between young Palestinians and Israeli troops

GORE USES STUDY TO PAN BUSH'S PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore's presidential campaign has seized on a
study of private retirement programs run by three Texas counties to
illustrate risks Gore says are inherent in Gov. George W. Bush's
proposal to add private investment options to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would allow workers to put a portion of their Social
Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts that
could include stock market participation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign says the study of the Texas counties shows that
such a system might leave some seniors with lower retirement income
than they would get under the present Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Government Accounting Office analyzed the
benefits of county workers in Galveston, Brazoria and Matagorda
counties who have opted out of Social Security and invested all of
their retirement funds in selected stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that low- and moderate-income employees who
worked for 35 years and retired in 1998 would have qualified for
higher benefits had they remained in the Social Security system.
However, higher-income workers fared better under the private
market system, according to the analysis of the privatization
program begun in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The lower-income workers would have done better by remaining in
the federal system, the study found, because Social Security is
``tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage workers
and the benefits are fully indexed to protect against inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study noted that under Social Security the
workers' spouses would have been eligible for additional benefits
that were not included in the private investment system.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore, who has opposed privatization efforts, are
pointing to the study to bolster their claims that private
retirement accounts would produce vast inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is empirical evidence in the governor's home state that
taking away a guaranteed benefit that Social Security represents
and replacing with investments in the market is inherently risky,''
said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have spent much of this week promoting dueling
plans for keeping Social Security solvent after 2037, when the
retirement system will not have enough income to pay out benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed keeping the Social Security system fiscally
sound by adding funds from the projected federal budget surplus and
savings from paying down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday to members of the influential senior citizens
group AARP in Orlando, Fla., Gore said, ``You shouldn't have to
play stock market roulette with your retirement savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans already proposed in Congress, which Bush aides have said
might serve as models for his proposal, allow but do not require
stock market investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Washington state, issued a statement
accusing Gore of employing ``the same old tired rhetoric on Social
Security _ this vice president is willing to try and scare the
elderly and frighten people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer defended the private Social
Security accounts. ``The broader point is people want to have more
control over their retirement nest eggs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that it was not fair to compare the Texas
experience with what the governor is proposing, in part because the
counties require conservative ``fixed rate investments'' of
retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that county workers must pay taxes on the income
on their investments when they retire, which is not the case with
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even the GAO report warns that ``it is important to note that
the Alternate Plans' performance is not necessarily indicative of
how well a proposed system of individual accounts within Social
Security might perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has only provided a vague outline of his privatization plan
and it is far from clear that it would resemble the Galveston,
Brazoria, Matagorda retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
   The programs were launched two decades ago by officials of the
three Texas counties who withdrew from Social Security because they
believed that the federal system faced probable tax increases.
County workers voted heavily in favor of withdrawing from the
federal system, and now about 3,000 employees participate in the
new programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, state and local governments were allowed to opt out
of Social Security, an exemption that was eliminated in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``Alternative Plan,'' the counties still collect the
payroll tax but now turn the money over to professional managers
who are only allowed to invest in conservative funds such as
government bonds, corporate bonds and preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retirement, employees can receive their money in one lump
sum or can purchase annuities that allow them to stretch out
payments for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO study found that low-wage workers who retired in 1998
received monthly benefits of about $617. Under Social Security
those workers would qualify for $750. High-income workers, however,
who received $1,848 a month under the privatization plan, would
have qualified for $1,283 under Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis also said that county workers who will retire in
the future may do better under the privatization plan because the
stock market has performed better in recent years.

POLL FINDS AMERICANS FEEL THEY HAVE LITTLE SAY IN PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have little sense of power over the presidential
nominating process, with only a fifth of them saying that voters in
the primaries chose Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President
Al Gore as the presidential nominees, the latest New York Times/CBS
News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of the 947 adults interviewed last week said
they would prefer a single national primary to the present system,
where they feel early states have too much influence. Seventy-five
percent favored a national primary, while 20 percent said the
present system was preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fifths of the public called the campaign dull,
rather than interesting. Republicans, perhaps because three-fourths
of them expect to win the White House in November, were less
critical. They divided evenly on the question.
</P>
<P>
   But overall interest in the campaign has dropped sharply in the
two months since the nominations were decided. Only 15 percent said
they had discussed the campaign in the past day. In mid-March, 49
percent told pollsters for Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy that they had talked about the
campaign that day.
</P>
<P>
   While respondents agreed that voters had little influence over
either party's choice, they had different explanations of who made
the Republican and Democratic decisions. For Bush, the public
thought campaign money was most important, while for Gore, they
said it was the backing of party leaders. Both judgments reflected
the attention those strengths drew during the nomination contests.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent said the voters had the most influence in
picking Bush, while 26 percent said party leaders were decisive,
and 44 percent credited his success to ``people who contributed
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent said the voters were decisive for Gore, while 48
percent said party leaders had the most say and 24 percent said
contributors called the tune. The telephone poll had a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The public support for a national primary in the poll, which was
conducted May 10-13, was not unusual. The Gallup Poll has found
comparable majorities for the idea since the 1950s.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Respondents who were asked to amplify their reasons for
supporting a national primary generally argued that it would make
the process shorter, neater and, surprisingly, cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Scott, a nurse's assistant from Miami who is a Democrat,
said, ``A single primary day would eliminate the money spent
digging up dirt on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Tager, a homemaker in Lexington, S.C., who is a
Republican, said, ``With one day, they would spend less money, and
people wouldn't have to listen to so much negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of the support for the concept was not tested
because the poll did not pose the arguments against such a plan
that would be raised if the political parties or Congress seriously
considered a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said
Wednesday that politicians and academics are generally hostile to a
one-day national primary because they feel it would require
tremendous resources available only to someone already perceived as
a front-runner. And he said, ``It removes any real opportunity for
a sequential testing for the candidates and a learning process for
the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are considering a third option, with small
states voting first and the biggest states holding their primaries
last. They argue that this is the only way to forestall the
national primary they see developing as states seek political
influence by seizing the earliest possible dates. But this plan,
which was also presented without arguments pro or con, did not
impress the respondents. Thirty-six percent said it would be better
than the present system, but 49 percent said it would be worse.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the public said it was satisfied with the
candidates who emerged, while half said they wanted more choices.
People who said they would vote for Bush were slightly more
content; 58 percent of them said they were satisfied with the
choices now, compared to 52 percent of Gore's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions tapped, quite deeply, into traditional
reservoirs of hostility or at least skepticism about the system.
For example, 33 percent agreed with the statement: ``It makes no
real difference who is elected president _ things go on as they did
before.'' Findings at about that level were typical in 1996. But 20
years earlier, in 1976, only 19 percent agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 64 percent of the public said people like themselves
had ``not much'' to say about what government does. Since the
Times/CBS News Poll first asked the question in 1990, only once was
a higher number recorded. And this February, at the peak of the
primary season, just 48 percent expressed that sort of
powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The dismay came through in some of the follow-up interviews.
Jane Marawar, a homemaker in Austin, Texas, said, ``I think it's
important to vote, but money seems to be running the election
process.'' Marawar, a Democrat, said she did not vote in the Texas
primary on March 14, a week after Gore was credited with wrapping
up the nomination. By then, she said, ``The die was cast.'' She
said, ``people think `the nomination is already decided, why should
I bother, why should I get involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the Miami Democrat, said ``I didn't feel I had much of a
say. It just seems whomever the party sent out, we were expected to
accept. It wasn't as if there were a variety of people to choose
from. It just seems like the candidate was prepackaged, endorsed by
the party and that's the way it is, take it or leave it.''

WEAK DEMAND PROMPTS FORD TO PRODUCE FEWER EXCURSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that it would
produce fewer Ford Excursion sport utility vehicles during the 2001
model year, but attributed the cutback to weak consumer demand for
the vehicle rather than the company's concerns about its safety and
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a Ford spokesman, said that the automaker would
cut its production rate for the Excursion to 52,000 a year this
summer, from 69,000 a year now. By building 17,000 fewer
Excursions, Ford will be able to build 35,000 more Ford Super Duty
pickup trucks, which are produced on the same assembly line in
Louisville, Ky., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had only a 45-day supply of Super Duty pickups at the end
of April, compared with a 100-day backlog of Excursions. Automakers
like to have a 60-day supply of vehicles on dealership lots and in
transit to dealerships at any given time, so that each dealer can
offer a selection of vehicles in different colors and with
different equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a company that our No. 1 goal is to shove sport
utilities down the throats of consumers'' by offering deep
discounts, Pipas said. Because the $40,000 Excursion and $30,000
Super Duty share the same engines and transmissions and have
similar fuel economy, the shift in production will have little if
any effect on the environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Taller than Michael Jordan and weighing as much as three Honda
Civics, the Excursion gets only 10 miles to the gallon in the city
and 13 on the highway, making it the target of heavy criticism from
environmentalists. In a ``corporate citizenship report'' released
last Thursday in Atlanta at Ford's annual shareholders' meeting,
the automaker acknowledged the criticism and quoted the Sierra
Club's condemnation of the vehicle as ``a rolling monument to
environmental destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, said in an interview
at the meeting that the company planned to continue making the
vehicle because a halt in production would prompt the introduction
of similar vehicles by rival automakers with less commitment to
safety and the environment. Ford voluntarily builds the Excursion
to emit less pollution than regulations allow for sport utilities.
The Excursion is also equipped with impact-absorbing steel bars
below the bumpers.

 By ERIC SCHMITT with DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Committees in the House and the Senate
overwhelmingly endorsed the administration's China trade bill on
Wednesday, contributing to a growing sense among its backers that
the ardently contested measure was headed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would permanently grant China normal trading
privileges, also got a plug from Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who renewed his call
on lawmakers to set aside their partisan differences and back the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
warned lawmakers that rejecting the China bill ``invites a future
of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, half a dozen previously uncommitted House
Republicans and Democrats announced they would support the
legislation, a necessary step for American companies to benefit
fully from a market-opening accord that paves the way for China to
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional backers of the
measure said they believe they might be close to the 218 votes
needed for passage in the House when the bill comes to a vote next
week, though they continued their heated campaign for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're looking for insurance votes,'' said one
administration official. But the U.S. Trade Representative,
Charlene Barshefsky, said, ``the situation is still fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's House Ways and Means Committee vote, four
previously undeclared Democrats joined an overwhelming vote, 34-4,
in favor of the measure. Earlier in the day, the Senate Finance
Committee approved the legislation, 18-1. Both committees have
jurisdiction over trade bills, and supporters of the China bill
hailed the lopsided results for building momentum toward next
week's House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and other
administration officials continued to buttonhole wavering members
of Congress on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also said they plan to seek air time from
the major television networks to allow Clinton to address the
nation on Sunday night about the China bill's importance, not only
to American farmers, high-tech companies and manufacturers, but
also for the country's long-term national security. Officials at
CBS, ABC and NBC said Wednesday night that they had not yet been
contacted by the White House with the request.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, critics of the measure downplayed the committee
votes as preordained, and insisted that their campaign to focus on
Beijing's poor record on human rights, religious freedom,
environmental standards and earlier trade accords, was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Americans, we value trade, but we will never trade in our
values,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's
chief Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said they would intensify their lobbying of
fence-sitters during the last weekend before the vote. Opponents
cited reports from an official Chinese newspaper Wednesday that
threatened war with Taiwan if the island's president-elect, Chen
Shui-bian, does not commit to a ``one-China'' policy in his
inaugural speech this weekend. One senior Clinton administration
official said this week that ``we're very worried about the
weekend'' because the Chinese ``have a long record of saying just
the wrong thing, or doing something stupid, at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was a day for the China measure's supporters to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   To attract Democrats with heavy union constituencies, the Ways
and Means Committee amended its bill by including a provision of
the final trade accord negotiated last November to protect American
industries from a surge in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would allow the International Trade Commission,
and then the president, to halt the import of Chinese goods _ from
steel to computers to a range of other products _ if they are being
shipped into the United States ``in such increased quantities or
under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market
disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly
competitive products.''
</P>
<P>
   That provision, coupled with the endorsement by the committee's
ranking Democrat, Charles B. Rangel of New York, seemed to provide
the final push for four committee Democrats who had been undecided
to vote for the bill: Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Karen L.
Thurman of Florida, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Benjamin L. Cardin
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But the new provision may also plant the seeds of new American
tensions with China. The definition of what constitutes a ``surge''
of imports is always a matter of dispute, and China would almost
certainly take any American efforts to limit its imports to the
court of the World Trade Organization for adjudication. Because it
is not a WTO member now, it has not been able to challenge such
rulings, including a recent one blocking imports of Chinese steel.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said Wednesday that she was not worried about such
challenges. ``The Chinese know what they agreed to in November,''
she said, ``and they understood we had to have the ability to stop
import surges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is approved, it will end the need for annual renewal
of China's trading status by Congress, an event that prompted
heated debate over the country's human rights record and its
threats against Taiwan. Every year Congress approved the trade
status, even after the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square. But
opponents of the measure say that by dropping the linkage between
how China treats dissidents and its ability to trade with the
United States, Congress will be giving up leverage over the
government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   To appease some of the opponents, Democrats and Republicans are
finalizing plans for a permanent commission that will review
China's human rights record annually. But labor unions and other
opponents say the commission would be toothless because it only has
the power to make public its findings, something the State
Department does anyway in its annual human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to winning over some wavering Democrats, the White
House picked up the support of three uncommitted Republicans: Rick
Hill of Montana, Tillie Fowler of Florida and Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Some vote-counters had already included Hill and Fowler in their
tallies, but Hyde was a coup because he has consistently voted
against upgrading China's trade status in Congress' annual review.
All the Democrats from Illinois are voting against the pact,
despite heavy lobbying from Barshefsky and Daley, both Chicago
natives.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and their congressional allies said
they now may be less than 10 votes shy of the 218 needed for
passage in the House. Republicans are expected to provide at least
150 of the votes needed for passage, although two administration
officials predicted that they will get more.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters, while sounding upbeat that they could win
70 votes from their ranks, still voiced caution, especially after a
few unexpected defections this week, such as Rep. Bob Clement of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' said Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., a
chief vote-counter for the bill. ``It's getting harder and
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two-thirds of 211 House Democrats are likely to vote
against the measure, but Democratic critics of China's record on
human rights, worker standards and environmental protections were
vastly outnumbered Wednesday in the pro-trade Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the panel's 16 Democrats voted against the measure:
Pete Stark of California, William J. Coyne of Pennsylvania, John
Lewis of Georgia and Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin. A fifth
Democratic foe, Michael R. McNulty of New York, was absent for the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to trade with China,'' Kleczka
said, ``but I don't want to fling open the doors of this country
and never have a review again.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, all members of the Senate Finance Committee,
except Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., voted for the measure. Jeffords
said he was protesting the continued imprisonment of Ngawang
Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar at
Middlebury College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of China, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., voted for
the trade bill, but also introduced a separate bill to monitor
Beijing's proliferation of missile technology and other advanced
weaponry.

TEXAS PANEL DELAYS VOTE ON VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State environmental commissioners put off a
scheduled vote Wednesday on whether new vehicles sold in the state
must meet California's emissions standard.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise two-week delay was prompted by a last-minute sales
pitch from automakers and U.S. officials, who argued in favor of an
alternate federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two months the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission has postponed deciding on the issue, which
it has studied for months.
</P>
<P>
   If the three commissioners do not adopt the California rules,
new cars and trucks sold in Texas after 2003 would have to meet the
federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are relying on major cuts in automotive
pollution _ regardless of which standard accomplishes them _ to
meet a federal smog-reduction deadline in 2007 for the Houston and
Dallas regions.
</P>
<P>
   Both the California and federal standards would require new
vehicles to emit much less pollution than current models. Officials
estimate roughly equivalent price increases in each case _ about
$200 on average.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that the California approach would yield
more sweeping cuts in automotive emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush hinted last year that he preferred the
California option, as he urged the commissioners to study it
closely. Another Republican governor, New York's George Pataki,
recently chose the California standard for his state.
</P>
<P>
   But in letters sent Tuesday, major car companies and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency sought to allay concerns raised by
two commissioners _ Chairman Robert Huston and Ralph Marquez _
about whether the federal standard is tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to postpone the vote, Huston said the letters from
Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler were ``a very important
development'' that could produce a decision to stick with the
federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   He had wanted a pledge that models sold in Texas, even though
built to the U.S. standard, will meet a stricter California limit
for smog-forming chemical gases.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually identical language, the three companies' letters
offered that promise. Huston said if legal details can be worked
out in the next two weeks, he will favor the federal approach
because it would then offer virtually as much pollution reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists continued to argue, however, that only the
California standard will require large numbers of extremely clean
``alternative vehicles'' _ electric-gasoline hybrid models and
fuel-cell designs _ to be readily available in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some hybrids are already being advertised nationally, but cannot
be found in Texas showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to the commissioners Tuesday, the EPA and the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said the federal standard also
will result in ready availability of such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez said these messages still did not offer as much
assurance as he wants that alternative models will be marketed
widely in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners originally planned to choose a vehicle
standard for the entire state last month when they adopted a
smog-reduction plan for the Dallas-Fort Worth region.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez said that even if they decide in two weeks against the
California standard, they may change that stance later this year
when they adopt a plan for the Houston area, which has a far worse
smog problem than Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It ``will take everything we can muster'' to achieve enough
pollution cuts in Houston in order to meet the federal cleanup
deadline in 2007, he said.

ONE ROYAL RIDE FOR USC'S SAFAROVA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC senior Veronika Safarova might not ever be
labeled queen of the tennis court, but she is literally a princess
off it.
</P>
<P>
   While her teammates played in the Pacific-10 singles
championships two weeks ago in Ojai, Safarova was receiving a far
different honor. She was selected to represent her native Czech
Republic as its ``princess'' at the International Azalea Festival
in Norfolk, Va., which honors the 19 member nations of NATO and is
annually attended by more than 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Safarova was chosen by her country's ambassador to the United
States, and the festivities were a far cry from her usual routine
of spending hours on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to do something completely different than
tennis. I had never done anything like it,'' Safarova said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first-time experiences was riding a parade float
through Norfolk and walking down a runway in a formal dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I said, `No way. I'm not a model.' The worst thing
was I had to wear a bridesmaid dress,'' Safarova said.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to walk in public in high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh no.' These are the shoes I usually wear,''
Safarova said, pointing to her comfortable tennis sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   These were all minor complaints, however, for the 22-year-old,
who came to USC four years ago after growing up in Brno, a large
city about 2 hours from Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, I'd like to have her at Ojai, but it's
a long year and a little rest is not a bad idea. This is an amazing
memory she's going to keep,'' USC coach Richard Gallien said. ``I
would have been more hesitant if I thought she would be on the
bubble for NCAAs, but she already qualified. Down the road, she'll
tell her daughter she was a princess.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a whirlwind of memories lately for Safarova.
Besides the Azalea Festival, she participated in graduation
ceremonies at USC last Friday, then helped the Trojans win
opening-round NCAA matches Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she leads the 12th-ranked Trojans in an NCAA round of 16
match against Louisiana State at Pepperdine. Following the team
competition, she will take part in the singles competition as one
of only two Trojans to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``A senior in women's collegiate tennis has so much more miles
on her than a volleyball or basketball player. She's been playing
in tournaments since she was 9,'' Gallien said. ``So it takes a lot
of character in your last semester of your senior year, knowing you
won't go on, to give it your all.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be excusable for Safarova to suffer from burnout, since
she honed her tennis skills when the communist government was in
control of what was then Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 12 years of her life, being in a communist
environment, tennis almost wasn't able to be fun,'' Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   But Safarova has flourished her senior season, moving from USC's
No. 4 singles player to No. 2. She credits a new outlook toward
tennis as the reason for her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I've played so well is because I decided to
appreciate it and I've been relaxed,'' Safarova said. ``I knew it
was the last season of my career. I see things differently on the
court now. I'm not stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   This year she is 26-8 in match play and has even surprised her
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, toward the end, she didn't play as well as she
wanted,'' said fellow senior Jacqui Boyd. ``It's made a big
difference for us because she's won a lot of good matches.''
</P>
<P>
   What inspires Gallien is Safarova's demeanor. He can rarely tell
if she's winning or losing a match just by looking at her, because
her emotions are always the same on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her background was so much more serious in a way than some of
the American kids. She's above the pettiness you typically see,''
Gallien said. ``The world is not full of people like Veronika. It's
full of people who are lazy and make excuses and underachieve.''
</P>
<P>
   That description would probably embarrass Safarova, who winces
when she gives presentations in her business classes because she
thinks her English could improve, although she speaks the language
fluently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with her in classes and she's very nervous,'' Boyd
said. ``That's understandable. I couldn't give a presentation in
another language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Safarova is also enjoying life in Los Angeles. When she left
the Czech Republic four years ago, she was certain she would return
immediately after graduating. Now, she would like to stay a few
years and see what happens as she tries to get a job in sports
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that by the time I would graduate I would
adapt to the American culture the way I did,'' she wrote in a
recent essay. ``I am no longer the shy naive girl that barely
speaks English and doesn't know what she wants to do with her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And for a few days, she even got to be a princess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to get a chance to be a princess of the Czech
Republic again,'' Safarova said. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Defending its plan to break up the Microsoft Corp.,

   The brief, from the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys
general, is the last written filing in the case before remedy
hearings begin on May 24. It is a response to the brief Microsoft
filed last week in which the company proposed several narrow
restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate
remedies than breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the government brief said Microsoft's proposal ``does not
address some of the most important violations found by the court,''
including the finding that the company had illegally tied its Web
browser to the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The document also belittled Microsoft's contention that
interaction between its product groups was crucial for continued
innovation. It cited several recent instances when company leaders,
including its chairman, Bill Gates, said exactly the opposite _
that clear divisions between groups was important for the company's
success.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Microsoft said, ``The government filing is long on
rhetoric but short on economic analysis or factual support for its
overreaching proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft
was in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws, and a
few days later he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to
complete the penalty phase of the case quickly _ preferably within
60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 20, the federal and state governments proposed
breaking Microsoft in two and imposing restrictions on the
company's behavior while the breakup was being carried out. Two
states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to go along with the others,
saying a breakup was too extreme a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government plan, one company would hold the Windows
operating system and the other would keep everything else,
including the Office package of applications programs that includes
Word, the word processor, and Excel, the spreadsheet program.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief last week, Microsoft decried the idea of a breakup
and said ``cross-pollination between engineers working on different
products such as Windows and Office has led to numerous
innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's government brief says: ``The story Microsoft now
tells of dependency between the operating systems and applications
is, at the very least, greatly exaggerated.'' It then goes on to
quote company leaders who appear to support that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail last year in which two company executives, Ben
Slivka and Brad Silverberg, were discussing a forthcoming corporate
reorganization, Silverberg wrote that Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's
president, ``needs to do something so that the company ends up with
an organization that essentially is a separate company within the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be free to do what it thinks best,'' he continued,
because ``the company is so wrapped up in its shorts that it can't
get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also quotes from the 1996 book ``Microsoft Secrets''
by Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Shelby, which quotes the
company's chairman, saying, ``Bill Gates insisted to us that
Microsoft's `dominant organizational theme is by products,'''
adding that Gates wanted ``product architectures that reduce
interdependencies among teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also quotes from another 1996 book, ``The Microsoft
Way'' by Randall E. Stross, in which Microsoft managers are quoted
as saying, ``Whenever they studied the patterns of actual
face-to-face communications'' between developer groups, ``they
invariably discovered that developers never seemed to venture more
than a few feet from their own offices. The daily
cross-fertilization of ideas among groups was not evident.''
</P>
<P>
   In an online column the same year, quoted in the brief, Gates
wrote: ``I gain confidence about a potential reorganization when I
see that it makes clear what every group is supposed to do'' and
``minimizes the dependencies and overlap between groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's spokesman, Mark Murray, said the government was
referring to ``a handful of Microsoft statements talking about the
need for clear lines of authority in an American business.'' He
added that the government was ``euphemistically calling the
unprecedented break up proposal merely a reorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the government said, Microsoft's objections to its
remedy proposal are ``unfounded and based almost entirely on
tortured readings and mischaracterizations of the language of the
proposed remedy.'' In several places, the brief says, Microsoft
objected to a portion of the government's proposed remedy while
failing to mention another portion that addressed the company's
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in its brief filed last week, insisted that it would
need six months to prepare for remedy hearings should the judge
decide to consider the government's breakup plan. That would push
the end of the trial well into the next presidential
administration. And though Microsoft denies it, many analysts say
they think the company hopes a Republican administration will drop
the breakup idea. Gov. George W. Bush has already suggested he
opposes a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the government on Wednesday said the remedy phase
could be concluded quickly and called Microsoft's proposed schedule
``a transparent effort to delay the determination and
implementation of a remedy for its illegal acts as long as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief does not offer a specific alternate timetable, but
government officials have said the remedy phase could be completed
within a few weeks and the company's request ``for substantial
delays should be denied.'' &QL;

ON HOCKEY: ROUGH STUFF EQUALS GOOD STUFF
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday, a fan
wearing a Philadelphia Flyers jersey began pummeling a fan wearing
a New Jersey Devils jersey in the seats of the First Union Center
in Philadelphia. Although the Devils were on their way to a 4-1
victory, the Philadelphia spectators cheered. It was the wildest of
several fights among fans.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the arena issued stern warnings for the next
two days that such things are forbidden and would result in swift
punishment. They said so in news releases, on the scoreboard and on
cards passed out to ticket holders entering the arena for Game 2 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the nonverbal message had already been delivered. In Game 2,
a 4-3 Flyers victory, the rough stuff increased, but it stayed on
the icy side of the glass, among the athletes. There were lots of
cheap shots, a couple of bloody cuts, a few exchanges of nasty
words, one double-spearing incident, a fist fight between two big
forwards and a concussion from a thundering body check.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, two referees called a total of only 26 penalty
minutes. Although the Devils dished out as much as they absorbed,
the style favored the Flyers, who evened the best-of-7 series at
one victory apiece.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 3 in the Meadowlands Thursday night, it is hoped by
most that there will be no retaliation from spectators representing
the northern end of the road in this Battle of the Turnpike. As for
players, the Flyers hope things continue just as they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what it's going to take for us to win, we're going
to have to bear down and stick together,'' said Dan McGillis, a
Flyers' defenseman. ``I definitely think the refs were letting us
play it out there. It's good to see. It's good to watch. It's good,
clean hockey. That's what the game's all about. It's nice to play
it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game on Tuesday, McGillis hit Sergei Brylin not once
but twice from behind in succession and rapped his head into the
boards. This knocked off Brylin's helmet and opened a cut above
Brylin's right eye. He showed it to the officials, who shrugged it
off. Afterward, McGillis suggested that Brylin might have cut
himself on his own helmet visor. When this was relayed to Brylin,
he wrinkled his nose as if a sudden, sour odor had entered the
room.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that the Devils are all passive victims.
Randy McKay, the veteran right wing, got the best of Keith Primeau
when the Flyers' recent concussion victim challenged McKay to
fight. This was before Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, put
Philadelphia's Daymond Langkow out of the game with a hard shoulder
check that left Langkow with a cut and a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau got even later by putting New Jersey's John Madden out
of the game with a knee-to-knee hit that left Madden writhing in
pain and limping out of the building. And Stevens responded to that
by upending Primeau with a low check in the knee area and glowering
down at him.
</P>
<P>
   While some of this is inevitable in the playoffs, Stevens
expressed concern about his teammates being drawn into too many
post-whistle scrums, with pushing and pulling and gloves rubbing
across faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philly's a dump-and-grind team, let's not kid ourselves,''
Stevens said. ``At times, we lost our focus, getting into scuffles
and stuff like that, which is uncharacteristic of our team.'' This
hurts the deeper Devils, Stevens said, who ``use more people'' than
the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to their advantage if there's a scrum and a delay of
game,'' Stevens said, referring to the Flyers. ``We want to keep
the game rolling. It's more beneficial to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' counterpart, the Philadelphia captain Eric Desjardins,
is also a veteran defenseman. He agreed. ``We're that kind of
team,'' Desjardins said. ``We like to play physical. It's our
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson, the coach of the Devils, said: ``You get tired
of getting elbowed in the head and punched in the face. We just
have to get away from it and let the officials do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Flyers best scrummers is Rick Tocchet, who scored
twice and speared Claude Lemieux. ``We've got to stay in their
face,'' Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring specifically to Lemieux, Tocchet said: ``Lemieux's
going to be yapping. I just yap back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Game 3, Tocchet predicted: ``They're not going to come out
and try to hammer us. They're going to play disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils do not, that would please Keith Jones, another
agitator among the Philly forwards. ``Good, clean hockey,'' Jones
said of Game 2, echoing McGillis. ``It was a big win for us. Where
it takes us, we'll find out. When you win those games, it can
really carry over. It was a fantastic win for us, the type of
victory that can carry you through a series.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Flyers, he praised Primeau for picking a fight despite
a recent concussion, calling him a ``warrior.'' Primeau, who
assisted on one of Tocchet's goals, said, ``We kind of settled more
into our style. I didn't want to come off the ice. I wanted to stay
out there. These games are so much fun. That's old-time playoff
hockey. It doesn't get any better than that.''

FOR GIULIANI, OUT-OF-STATE DONATIONS ARE BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mich.)   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Weighing in the balance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
decision on whether to stay in the Senate race are the millions of
dollars he has raised in his effort to defeat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the $19 million has been donated by out-of-state
voters, many of whom answered solicitations because they despise
his opponent. Yet under federal law, Giuliani may squirrel away
every cent of the more than $9 million he has not spent _ even if
he drops out.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect irritates Michael Ross, a St. Louis banker, who
contributed as much as federal law allows to Giuliani's Senate
race. Sure, he admires Giuliani and wishes him well. But the $2,000
in checks he wrote to the Friends of Giuliani account were for one
purpose, he said: keeping Clinton out of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put Mickey Mouse in there and I would give him
money,'' Ross said. ``If he drops out, the money should go to his
successor. Any other course would look bad and it would ultimately
help Hillary out.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's most likely substitute, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, could certainly use the assistance, said state Republican
leaders. Lazio has little name recognition outside the New York
City region and no statewide campaign infrastructure in place. He
has about $3.5 million in the bank, for his re-election bid. But if
he stepped into the most expensive and high profile Senate race in
the nation, he would need to raise $10 million to $15 million more,
political consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who announced in the last three weeks that he has
prostate cancer, is separating from his wife and is having a
relationship with another woman, again Wednesday offered no
concrete hints on what was in his political future or what he would
do with his campaign war chest if he dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His campaign staff continued its work unabated, with two aides
dispatched to Buffalo to help select the music, lighting and stage
design for the Republican nominating convention on May 30. The
mayor had no public appearances, but he indicated Wednesday that he
was still struggling to decide on a treatment regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to think about it,'' Giuliani said, on his way out
of 17 Murray Street, a restaurant near City Hall, where he had
walked to lunch after a morning of meetings with some of his
closest advisers, including his campaign manager, Bruce J.
Teitelbaum, and a friend, Elliot Cuker. ``The decision-making
process is fine. I am not going to comment on it today.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But it has become clear in recent days that if Giuliani does
back out, he risks alienating some of his approximately 200,000
campaign donors. As of the end of March, Giuliani had spent $10.1
million starting up his campaign against Clinton, leaving $9.2
million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not allow Giuliani to give his money directly
to Lazio or another replacement candidate, but the mayor could
transfer it to a state or national Republican Party committee that
could spend it on Lazio's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani could also donate some or all of the money to charity,
said Kenneth A. Gross, a Washington-based election law expert and
former head of enforcement at the Federal Election Commission.
Finally, he could follow the lead of Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey. As of earlier this year, she had returned about half of the
$2.2 million she had raised, after she bowed out of a New Jersey
race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But several political consultants and campaign finance experts
said that Giuliani, if he pulled out, would most likely not rely on
any of those options for the majority of his remaining cash.
Instead, he would save it for a future run for governor or some
other office, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would surprise me if he does not hang on to the lion's
share of it,'' said Jay Severin, a New York-based Republican
consultant who has worked on 100 campaigns since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant who has worked on more
than 160 races, said, ``He has no incentive to give most of the
money away.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin and Mahoney, as well as several Democratic political
consultants, agreed that the mayor would most likely give at least
a share of his $9 million to a Republican Party committee that
would assist his successor in the Senate race. To keep every cent
would offend the party, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors said that Giuliani should give up all of the
out-of-state contributions, given that so many were motivated by an
anti-Clinton sentiment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Yes, the money was for Rudy, but the investment I made was in
the Senate race,'' said Andrew J. Futey, a government relations
consultant from Cleveland who contributed $1,000 to Giuliani's
campaign. ``The main goal here is making sure there is somebody
else besides Hillary. I would like to see my money stay in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   For a replacement to make up the difference in the next several
months would be very difficult, many said. By the end of March,
Clinton had $6.6 million in the bank of the $12.8 million she had
raised.
</P>
<P>
   By following the advice of Ross and Futey, the mayor would risk
alienating other Republicans who said in interviews that they were
not so sure they wanted to see their money go to Lazio. Giuliani,
though a Republican, has stands on several issues traditionally
associated with Democrats, such as his support of abortion rights
and gun control. Lazio's record is not as consistently moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell A. Peterson of Ida, Mich., said he considered himself a
liberal Republican, and that though he could not control what
Giuliani did with his $500 donation, he would be disappointed if it
ended up being spent to elect Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in politics with Republicans like Rockefeller of New
York,'' he said, referring to Nelson A. Rockefeller, the New York
governor from 1959 to 1973. ``I view Mr. Giuliani as a Republican
in that tradition, and that was the primary reason I gave money to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio caused a rustle of attention Wednesday night when he
arrived at a Conservative Party dinner, wearing a tuxedo. He said
repeatedly that he was waiting for Giuliani to make a decision and
did not want to interfere during the mayor's difficult time. ``I
think right now it would probably be unseemly for me to make any
overt gestures that could be exploiting this time he's choosing to
make his decision,'' Lazio said. &QL;

WORTH THE WAIT AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the game plan counts as much as the game, maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   College of the Canyons golf coach Gary Peterson produced his
second state team titlist in seven seasons last week, when his
Cougars capped a 59-1 campaign with a 19-stroke victory in the
eight-team California Community College Championship at Glendora
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson prevailed with a team that began the season with
redshirts filling three of six starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of our top five waited a year to play,'' he said. ``I
think that's been one of the strengths of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiting period, Peterson said, helps with maturity and
improvement, giving incoming players _ many of whom have been stars
in high school _ a more realistic idea of what it takes to succeed
at the college level. Peterson's competitive qualifying process
increases the focus. Each spring, all Cougars play 15 rounds, with
the top six scoring averages earning starting berths.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the COC qualifying produced four rounds of 68 and a
school record of 7-under-par 353 by the top five in a match at
Buena Ventura GC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids come in with high expectations, then realize there's only
six spots,'' Peterson said. ``A lot of them want to spend that year
wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   That combined decision made this year's Cougars practice
sessions impressive for more than the ability of starters Mike
Applegate (a team-leading 73.25 average), Travis Matye (74.25),
Matias Gil (74.50), Pat Kelly (74.75), Mike Scott (75) and UCLA
transfer Charlie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   While they were honing the skills that would produce the most
wins in school history, 20 other players were working through their
own redshirt seasons, aware that Applegate was one of them just a
season earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The waiters could have plenty of positions to shoot for next
year, when Peterson expects five and maybe all six of this year's
starters could be playing at four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Peterson continues to enjoy the glow of an
almost perfect season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew early that this was a deep team and that they were
extremely focused,'' he said. ``They set goals. I don't think it
was winning state, but it was hammering conference and going far.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and assistant Mark Savage contributed their contrasting
coaching input to the mix _ Savage as tactician, Peterson as
motivator _ and the Cougars wound up dominating the Western State
Conference as intended, and as past COC teams have done often in
winning eight WSC titles.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson knew the best of plans and best of talent don't
always work out: The Cougars took a 50-0 team into the postseason
two years ago and were eliminated in the first round. Six previous
COC squads had reached the 36-hole state tournament with only one
champion coming out of it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the meld of talent and focus was perfect.
The Cougars led by 13 strokes after the first 18 holes at state and
Peterson was actually able to enjoy the stretch run without
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won in '93, it was with calculator in hand,'' he said.
``We didn't know until the end. With this team, it was relax, sit
back and watch and appreciate the moment. Travis (COC leader at
state and second overall at 2-over-par 142) told me he played the
last three holes with goosebumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson thinks the success of this redshirt-led team was an
endorsement of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think when you stick around awhile, you become a
better golfer. With our qualifying system, you've got to suck up
that bad round and focus. You've got to learn how to score when
you're not striking the ball well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good competition breeds good golf. You know you've got to
bring your best game every day.''
</P>

VENUS WILLIAMS IS BACK, AND SHE INTENDS TO STAY
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Sporting less muscle and hardly any beads, Venus Williams
returned to the scene of one of her most important victories
Wednesday and made it clear that, despite her father Richard's
suggestions to the contrary, she always intended to return to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she said about retirement. ``I would have been back
a lot sooner if it wasn't for the tendinitis in my wrists. It just
took a long time to heal. I used to have tendinitis in my knee. I
could play with that. It was different. But you can't do it without
your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing sore wrists, Williams missed the first four months of
this season, withdrawing from five tournaments, including the
year's first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open. During her
layoff, she said she followed the game on television and the
Internet and took a course in fashion illustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing tennis more,'' she said. ``Studying is a real
job.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to competition two weeks ago in Hamburg, Germany,
beating Irina Spirlea in three often unsightly sets and then losing
in straight sets to Amanda Coetzer, a player she once dominated
consistently. But Wednesday, on the same court where she won the
last Italian Open title, she bore a closer resemblance to the power
player her opponents remember.
</P>
<P>
   Against Coetzer in Hamburg, she had made unforced errors in
bunches and often looked off balance. In Wednesday's 6-1, 6-2
victory over Chanda Rubin, she covered court very well, kept her
aggressive groundstrokes more consistently in play and finished off
the inconsistent Rubin with her fifth ace of the match, five more
than she hit against Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really starting to play better now,'' said Williams, who
spent the last nine days training in Rome. ``Starting last week in
Hamburg, I was a little iffy. It was just tough. I was not
practicing very much, and I just had to learn a tough lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been the most trying period yet in the 19-year-old
Williams' short but compelling career. In an interview after the
match, conducted with her tiny Yorkshire terrier Pete sitting
comfortably on her lap, Williams said she had first felt a twinge
in her left wrist here while warming up on center court for a match
in Rome last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pay much attention to it,'' she said. ``You use your
whole body. Sometimes you feel different things, but they go away.
But I can tell you that I sure didn't know it was going to come out
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a right-hander with a two-handed backhand, taped her
wrist for matches occasionally throughout the summer: reaching the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the semifinals at the U.S. Open,
where her younger sister, Serena, won the singles title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrist just got steadily worse over the season,'' said
their mother and co-coach, Oracene. ``Venus was playing hurt and
not telling anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Venus said that it was only after reaching the Chase
semifinals in November that the pain became too intense for her to
practice or play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December, I was home really training and trying hard to get
ready for the Australian Open, and I just couldn't do it,'' she
said. ``Between January and April, I would say I had a total of
maybe three weeks of practice at the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone to tournaments, but I just don't know how
good it would have been to take the risk of losing matches because
I was a little bit injured or having to retire from matches. I just
thought it would be wiser to stay home until it was healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus, whose two-handed backhand is her best shot, even
experimented with switching to a one-handed backhand in an attempt
to accelerate her comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was hitting one-handed with slice,'' Oracene said. `And we
just told her, `Venus that's not your game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Venus said, ``All it did was end up hurting my right wrist.''
But I'm better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus said she tried a variety of treatments, including
acupuncture, but the only remedy that really helped was time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed tennis, but I had a lot to do,'' she said. ``Every
day was packed, and it was like I was the one at home, so I did
everything. I became the businesswomen. I did things for Serena,
things for my mom, things for my dad, things for myself. Everyone's
affairs, I handled.''
</P>
<P>
   In March during the Ericsson Open, her father said that he
believed it was very likely that Venus would retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus was shocked when she heard it,'' Oracene said of her
husband's comments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``So what can I say?'' Venus said Wednesday. ``I was just an
innocent bystander. I was just watching the story, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Venus declared herself ``pain free,'' she played
Wednesday with her left wrist taped, which she had not done in
Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' she said. ``I'm feeling real good. If it wasn't
good, I would just be shipped home. It's not holding me back from
my regular shots.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, she is not hitting her first serve as
consistently hard as before her layoff. She has clearly lost muscle
definition, if not weight, in her legs and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, he wanted me to do a lot of fitness work,'' she said,
``but I usually found a way to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she might not feel she had maximized her talent
until she, too, had won a Grand Slam singles title, she said:
``There's no one out here who doesn't want to win a Slam. I know I
have the capability. We'll see if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a relapse, she will get her next opportunity at the
French Open, which begins on May 29. Serena, who has struggled with
her game of late, is currently in Florida because of a sore knee
and is spending her time moving into her and Venus' recently
completed new home.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracene and Venus both expect Serena to play at Roland
Garros. The other contenders are well aware that, unlike most of
them, the sisters do not necessarily need many matches to reach
cruising speed. &QL;

LOUISE TANNER, AUTHOR OF `BANNISTER'S GIRLS,' DIES AT 78 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louise Tanner, a writer whose work often mirrored her Social
Register upbringing, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of Edward Everett Tanner III, who, as Patrick Dennis,
wrote ``Auntie Mame,'' Tanner was herself the author of five books,
including the novel ``Bannister's Girls,'' inspired by her
experiences as a student at Chapin's, a New York finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   Born Louise Frith Stickney, Tanner grew up in what she called
``Edwardian opulence'' on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She
demonstrated her writing talent at an early age by winning Vogue
magazine's Prix de Paris. After graduating from Vassar in 1944 she
met Tanner; they were married four years later, preventing her, she
once remarked, from having ``wound up a very embittered
ex-debutante.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wry, wisecracking persona made her the perfect counterpart
to her husband, who based one of the main characters in his 1962
best seller, ``Genius,'' on his wife. He also cast her in the role
of Pixie Portnoy in his 1961 novel, ``Little Me,'' which was made
into a Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two social histories, ``Here Today'' (1959) and
``All the Things We Were'' (1968), Tanner wrote two novels for
young adults, ``Reggie and Nilma'' and ``Dr. IRT.'' She is survived
by a son, Michael; a daughter, Betsy; and a grandchild, all of New
York.

MILLS RETURNING TO FINER FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Security was increased near the Los Angeles Dodgers'
bullpen to ensure no repeat performance of Tuesday night's ugly
melee.
</P>
<P>
   All was serene Wednesday, both around the bullpen and in it. The
doldrums with the bullpen that made Phoenix a lost city at the
beginning of the road trip are long gone. And, lo and behold,
struggling Alan Mills might be hitting his mark.
</P>
<P>
   Mills threw one pitch in the eighth inning against the Chicago
Cubs, got Damon Buford to ground into a double play and recorded
his second win in less than 24 hours when the Dodgers rallied for
three runs in the ninth for an 8-6 win.
</P>
<P>
   A forgotten man who has pitched in mop-up roles much of the
season, Mills (2-1) suddenly finds himself pitching in tight games
again. And being successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-pitch wins are pretty sweet,'' said Jeff Shaw, who closed
the game for the Dodgers. ``He's throwing the ball much better. As
tough as it was early for him, instead of panicking he kept the
steady pace and it's turning for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, consistently the subject of trade talks, thought he was
throwing better when he pitched three scoreless innings of relief
in a blowout loss at Arizona to begin the trip. He pitched another
scoreless inning Tuesday and of an inning in the latest win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw one pitch,'' said Mills, whose ERA has fallen from
5.93 to 4.42. ``Everybody threw the ball well. I get credit for the
win, but it's a team thing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Perez sentencing: Carlos Perez was sentenced to 12 months
probation, had his driver's license suspended for six months and
must attend and complete a class on driving under the influence of
alcohol as part of his plea Wednesday stemming from a March 11
arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol in Vero Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who did not attend the proceedings at Indian River County
Court, entered an absentia plea of no contest. He was also fined
$500, ordered to pay $288 in court costs, must contribute $50 to
the television ad fund against drunk driving and pay $35 for costs
incurred by the Vero Beach Police Department during the process,
Perez's attorney, Norman Green, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's probation can be cut short if he completes the other
portions of his sentencing, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the plea of no contest was put in ``to allow Carlos
to put this incident behind him and provide closure.''

WEB SITE WITH INSPECTIONS OF RESTAURANT KITCHENS IS OVERWHELMED
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS J. LUECK and NEIL MacFARQUHAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's Department of Health created an instant
sensation among food-crazed New Yorkers on Wednesday by
inaugurating a Web site listing every blemish noted by inspectors
at all licensed restaurants in the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of city residents who treat jockeying for
restaurant reservations like a blood sport, the site quickly
clogged, unable to sustain the average 23,000 hits an hour it was
getting by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks of the mouse, users could call up the latest
inspections of the most expensive, most coveted tables in the city
_ places like Le Bernardin or La Caravelle where a dinner for one
is in the $70 range _ and read that they were cited for ``vermin or
other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation or service
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In general, restaurateurs supported the idea that the public had
a right to know such details, but the one-size-fits-all categories
prompted Gallic cries of dismay from numerous kitchens. Some chefs
and owners at the city's elite restaurants expressed horror at the
idea that what they called picayune infractions would be lumped
together with problems at the corner greasy spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found ``mice droppings in a single bag of flour,''
said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin, which has been
consistently rated by food bibles like Zagat as the best restaurant
in New York. ``When we got that inspection we acknowledged it and
we talked to our purveyor right away and they changed all the
flour. I don't believe we have a mouse in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripert said that the restaurant's regular customers were
unlikely to be deterred by the December 1999 inspection report,
especially since the kitchens are open for visits by any customer
who so desires. But he and other restaurateurs are concerned that
the listings are not thorough or specific enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said that the
information on the site would provide a snapshot of health
conditions in each of the city's more than 18,000 restaurants. But
he also acknowledged that the information was limited and
potentially misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to interpret any inspection report as a
final grade for a restaurant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, on the Health Department Web site, if a restaurant
is cited for vermin or some other infraction, the word is
highlighted so that clicking on it produces a glossary of the
misdeeds. Vermin, for one, is defined as ``insect or small animal
that is destructive, annoying, or harmful to health. Includes
cockroaches, flies, and rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Jammet, who with her husband, Andre, owns La Caravelle,
says she was shocked by the word vermin from their July 1999
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very scary word; you see the word vermin and you think
of all sorts of nasty animals crawling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspector found a fly!'' Jammet added, noting that her
restaurant is scrupulous about cleanliness. ``It was July. It was
New York. It's the summer. Our food preparation areas are in the
basement which we share with a hotel. There was construction. I am
not trying to make excuses, but this is the reality of living in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Jammet, like many others, suggested that the Health Department
might want to adjust the wording so it would not seem quite so
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my idea of a glamorous description, but in general I
think it is a good thing they are doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen of the Health Department said the Web site would provide
better consumer safeguards and a new incentive for restaurants to
improve health standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this ease of access to information by the public,
restaurant owners will no doubt aspire to even higher standards of
public health safety and cleanliness,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   City rules require an unannounced inspection once each year,
with more frequent visits where serious problems are found and not
immediately corrected. The Web site lists only the latest
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site (http://207.127.96.244/webfood/search.htm) allows
users to search for restaurants either by name or location,
clicking on a map of each of the five boroughs.  &QL;

CAMPBELL SOUP POSTS DROP OF 14% IN QUARTERLY PROFIT
</HEADLINE>
  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With sales of its signature soups on the wane, the
Campbell Soup Co. said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings
fell 14 percent, and warned that the rest of its fiscal year, which
ends in July, was unlikely to be much better.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting with analysts in New York, Campbell's
president and chief executive, David Johnson, acknowledged the
company's dismal performance, but insisted that it could fix the
problems. ``We are not paralyzed; we are moving forward,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came out of retirement to replace Dale F. Morrison, who
resigned in March after less than three years in Campbell's top
job. Under Morrison, Campbell struggled to improve its soup
business, which accounts for half of the company's earnings. At the
same time, sales of its Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers
boomed, and a new product, V8 Splash, enjoyed brisk sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent quarter, however, soup was not the only
culprit. The company said on Wednesday that Pepperidge Farm's
earnings declined in the quarter, mainly because of marketing for
its Goldfish crackers. V8 Splash also declined, pulling down
earnings in the company's beverage division. Sales of Pace salsa
also fell, the company said. For the quarter, earnings fell to $139
million, or 32 cents a diluted share, from $162 million, or 37
cents, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few bright spots came from one of the company's
smallest divisions _ Godiva Chocolatier, which had solid sales
because of Valentine's Day and Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts have said that soup sales are down because
people these days do not have the time or inclination to prepare
it, a theory Campbell's executives have gone to great lengths to
counter. At the meeting, Johnson announced plans to build up
Campbell's soup business by bringing out new products and
repackaging some old ones. These include putting pull-off lids on
soups that are marketed as ``ready to serve'' to make the cans
easier to open, and making some additional flavors in the
ready-to-serve package, including minestrone.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst voiced concern about how the new products would
affect the company's profits. ``It will make the packaging more
expensive, and they said they are not going to raise prices,'' said
Nomi Ghez, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, who estimated the additional
cost at 2 cents to 3 cents a can. She added that putting more kinds
of Campbell's soup on the grocery shelf might draw business away
from existing Campbell's products. ``It is likely to be
cannibalistic,'' she said, ``and the ready-to-serve soups are
lower-margin than the condensed soups.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said the company would pursue strategic
initiatives, including acquisitions, to improve sales. ``He said he
won't just combine with someone to get synergies,'' Ghez said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave no details about which companies Campbell might be
considering. But one possibility is H.J. Heinz, which makes
private-label soup that competes with Campbell's brands.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking strength in scale, many large food companies are
considering partnerships of various kinds, with Nabisco Group
Holdings on the block and Unilever actively courting Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot going on in the back room, but when they get to
the front room, they can't talk about it,'' said John R. McMillin,
a Prudential Securities analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is respected by Wall Street for his record at Campbell,
where he was president for seven years before turning the reins
over to Morrison. In the old days, Johnson would don a cape and
call himself Souperman to inspire his employees. On Wednesday, he
appeared subdued and serious, but insisted that Campbell could
resolve its issues and improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meeting, it became clear that next year is going to be
a transition year and not great, either,'' said Ghez, who reduced
her earnings expectations for 2001 by 5 cents, to $1.75, which is
scant improvement on the $1.65 expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are addressing the big brands with some innovation, and
with good management, at least the precipitous decline of the
business can be stemmed,'' she added. ``The question is, can they
get it to grow?''

BUSH URGES CONGRESS TO BACK CLINTON ON CHINA TRADE

congressmen)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Calling trade relations with China the work of
``13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday urged congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to
support President Clinton and vote to grant China permanent trade
rights. The House is scheduled to vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has long supported free trade, his address here
Wednesday on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of
the few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending
legislation in Congress. He called the question of whether to
extend normal trading privileges to China ``among the most serious
decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ``no
one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the
presidency'' should remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start of this campaign, I have defined some sharp
differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Bush said, a
sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ``But today I want to address an
important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the
Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Bush said.
``It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13
years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be
undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was
one of those presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called
free trade ``a forward strategy for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With his remarks, Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan
cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in
recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his
efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day earlier, he parted company with Senate Republicans,
criticizing a bill that would set a deadline for withdrawing U.S.
ground troops from Kosovo. A spokesman for Bush said he considered
the measure ``legislative overreach on powers of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at
the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is
oriented toward exports and the Pacific rim, nearby Seattle was
also the site of last year's violent protests against the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The
company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number its workers
said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization
would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the local congressman,
Rep. Jack Metcalf, is one of the few undecided Republicans on the
issue. Bush, on his campaign plane this afternoon, said that he had
made no telephone calls to wavering house members, but would do so
if Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, asked for his help.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has voted Democratic in the past three
presidential elections, but Bush's aides say they are contesting
the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Bush a generally
polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of
workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The measure cleared the House Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday by a larger-than-expected margin of 34-4 as several
undecided members sided with Clinton. The full House, which is
bitterly divided on the issue, is to vote next week on whether to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made this one of his foreign policy priorities
for the year, has argued for months that Congress must grant China
permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of
U.S. companies and relations with the world's most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote is too close to call. And if the measure passes,
it will do so largely with the support of Republicans. Many
Democrats have sided with organized labor, which is fighting hard
against the measure, arguing that permanent support for China trade
would leave Congress few ways to pressure China to improve its
record on human rights, labor and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has supported the bill, but been less fervent than the
president, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical
Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Clinton on
the China bill than Gore. He argued Wednesday that ``the stakes are
high'' in how the debate is decided and made an impassioned
argument for the House to ratify China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``For businesses and workers and farmers, it will mean lower
trade barriers and important opportunities for U.S. exports and
more work and jobs for United States workers,'' he said. ``For the
people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the
region's major superpower. For the people of China it holds out the
hope of more open contact with the world of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He did however use the occasion to draw distinctions between the
administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said
Clinton and Gore view China as a `'strategic partner'' and said,
``I view China as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in
its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various
high profile battles over trade. ``They failed to obtain `fast
track' trade negotiating authority,'' Bush said, ``I will fight for
it. They mishandled the global trade negotiations here in Seattle.
I will make expanding trade and therefore expanding jobs at home a
consistent priority of my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that while China is not a ``strategic partner,'' it
is not an enemy. ``When I am the president, China will have no
doubts about our power and purpose in the region _ about our strong
commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said. ``But
this is accomplished through confident diplomacy, strong alliances,
and a military to back us. It is not accomplished by hindering free
trade or seeking to isolate China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Bush spoke,
Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with
China because it would result in the loss of U.S. manufacturing
jobs. ``We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ``We
can't compete with somebody who's living in a cardboard box.'' He
said he was a Democrat who would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said he was a
unionized worker who does not ``follow the union line. But he said
he was uncertain about China trade because ``I'm not confident with
China's human rights record.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a dim view of both candidates. ``I'm not going to vote
for Gore _ that's a definite,'' Webb said. ``Vote for Bush? I'd
prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''

TEXAS INMATE SAYS HE WILL NOT FACE EXECUTION QUIETLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ Gary Graham's sixth execution date is little
more than a month away, but unlike the others, it is all but
certain that a lethal dose of drugs will finally silence him.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 22 is certainly on my mind. At the same time, I have
tremendous faith in the brothers and sisters in the community,''
Graham said in an interview Wednesday at the Charles Terrell Unit
in Livingston. ``We have had execution countdowns before. Once
again, the eyes of the world are on Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his
latest appeal, clearing the way for the man who has been on death
row for 19 years to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who has begun using the name Shaka Sankofa, still
maintains he did not murder Bobby Lambert in Houston and that he
will physically resist being executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not willing to pay a debt I do not owe. I cannot and will
not cooperate with this lynching,'' Graham said. ``They are going
to do what they have to do. That's why I'm willing to accept gas
(pepper spray).''
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald confirmed that guards used
pepper spray on Graham after his third refusal to voluntarily move
to another cell. Fitzgerald said it is policy to move inmates when
they get an execution date.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. We did gas him. We'll probably gas him again if
he continues to refuse to cooperate,'' Fitzgerald said. ``That's
the way the penitentiary works.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said prison officials are aware of Graham's
statements to resist execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's indicated he's not going to cooperate. We will be
prepared for it. We will carry out the orders of the court,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was 17 when he was sentenced to death for the May 1981
murder of Lambert, 53, outside a Houston supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   His case has sparked interest on both sides of the death penalty
debate.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a cause for Hollywood celebrities and a rallying
point for death penalty foes. Death penalty advocates say it's an
example of how inmates manipulate the system.
</P>
<P>
   Different aspects of Graham's case have been reviewed by state
and federal courts more than 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal lawyers contend there are witnesses that they've
found after the trial who can eliminate him as a suspect. They say
those witnesses haven't had a chance to be heard in a court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the date looming, Graham supporters have stepped
up their public protest.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Graham supporters demonstrated outside the
Prairie View A&AMP;M University graduation ceremony where Gov. George
W. Bush was the speaker. A mass rally is planned for May 31 and a
Muslim minister, Robert Muhammad, has called for a fast starting
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Freddie of the Gary Graham/Shaka Sankofa Coalition for
Justice said the group is circulating a petition and encouraging
supporters to flood Bush and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
with e-mails, phone calls, letters and faxes asking for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as critical as it can get when you get to the point
where there is no federal jurisdiction to have to step in,''
Freddie said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lawyer, Jack Zimmermann, said he is following leads on
other suspects. He said he is checking into Lambert's background to
determine if anyone had reason to kill him. He still plans to file
a petition for clemency by June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're getting down to the end here. This is
extremely difficult 19 years later. But we can't throw our hands up
in the air and quit because it's hard,'' Zimmermann said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of client privilege, Zimmermann declined to comment on
any advice he may have given Graham concerning his pledge to resist
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very frustrated having lived in a cage for 19 years,''
Zimmermann said.

LEVY IS CHANCELLOR ON 7-0 VOTE; 2-YEAR CONTRACT EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After voting unanimously to make Harold O. Levy the
first businessman and noneducator to be named chancellor of the New
York City school system in its 102-year history, Board of Education
officials said Wednesday that they expected to award Levy a
two-year contract to manage the country's largest school system.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Levy is likely to remain chancellor until at
least the summer of 2002, well after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
leaves office, whether or not the mayor runs for or wins a seat in
the U.S. Senate. Giuliani, who opposed Levy's appointment to the
interim post in January, reversed course on Tuesday and endorsed
him.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that among his first priorities as permanent
chancellor would be to deliver a plan to overhaul the Board of
Education's sprawling bureaucracy and to create partnerships in the
community among school employees, parents, businesses, other
educational institutions and political leaders, aimed at improving
the schools. He also announced that Judith A. Rizzo _ the deputy
chancellor of instruction under Rudy Crew when he was chancellor,
who had been recently thinking about leaving the board _ would
remain as his chief education deputy.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the board after his election, Levy said: ``I
come to the job as a business person but also as somebody who loves
education and is very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute
to what I believe is the most important function in our society
today. The system that I begin to lead now is a system that has had
enormous successes and has proven beyond any possible doubt that it
is capable of creating greatness. That is a greatness that I want
to achieve again.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Levy received lukewarm support from Ninfa
Segarra, one of Giuliani's two representatives on the board, who
said her vote reflected a show of support for a chancellor who
already had the promised votes of a majority of the board. In that,
she echoed the mayor, saying that many areas of disagreement remain
between the Board of Education and City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a positive thing for the system if he walked
in with a split vote,'' Segarra said, referring to Levy. ``We
wanted to show that the mayor is willing to work with the new
chancellor. That's an important indicator for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education conducted a nationwide search for a
chancellor, producing scores of applicants but no one who was
willing to compete directly against Levy, who took over as interim
chancellor in January. One speaker at Wednesday's session, Michael
Meyers of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, sharply criticized
the board for failing to find any qualified minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Levy's selection is, in my considered judgment, the
triumph of cronyism,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But other speakers, including Cynthia Cummins, a member of a
South Bronx parents group, supported Levy. Cummins said she
believed that he could help to change ``the persistent educational
failure'' in many Bronx schools.
</P>
<P>
   Levy will receive a salary of $245,000 a year, plus other
benefits that remain to be determined. Among them are likely to be
a housing allowance as the board prepares to study the sale of the
Brooklyn brownstone bought several years ago to serve as the
chancellor's residence.

WIZARDS EXPECTED TO OFFER HEAD COACHING JOB TO JARVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Michael Jordan's coaching search is apparently nearing
an end. Jordan, the Washington Wizards' head of basketball
operations, is expected to offer the head coaching job to St.
John's coach Mike Jarvis within the next two days, a person
familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis' agent, Rob Ades, traveled to New York on Wednesday
afternoon to meet with his client regarding the possibility of
filling the coaching position, the person said. Jarvis was expected
to receive a formal offer from Jordan in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Ades could not be reached for comment, but a spokesman from his
Washington-based office confirmed he was in New York on business.
But with Jordan's desire to fill the position in time for Sunday's
National Basketball Association draft lottery, and with his other
candidate fading from the landscape quickly, Jarvis could be named
the Wizards' next coach as early as Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only other remaining candidate among those who have been
mentioned publicly is Lenny Wilkens, who recently resigned from
Atlanta. John Paxson, Jordan's former Chicago Bulls teammate,
declined an offer to join the organization. Darrell Walker, the
interim coach for the last 38 games of the season, was hired as
director of player personnel earlier this week. The Golden State
assistant Rod Higgins, another candidate for the coaching position,
was appointed assistant general manager
</P>
<P>
   The moves eliminated Walker and Higgins from Jordan's coaching
pool. Wilkens, the NBA's career leader in coaching victories,
indicated last week that Jordan had offered him the job, but later
clarified his position and said simply that his interview with
Jordan had gone well.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has an escape clause that allows him to get out of his
contract with St. John's at any time, but it is not a guarantee he
will accept an initial offer from the Wizards. With the Nets job
still vacant and several other positions unfilled _ the Clippers,
Vancouver and the Atlanta Hawks _ the feeling among several
coaching candidates around the league is that there is not a
tremendous upside to taking the Wizards job.  &QL;

PEGASUS RECEIVING KID-GLOVE TREATMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The conservative and protective nature of trainer
Neil Drysdale was evident when Fusaichi Pegasus arrived yesterday
in Baltimore after a flight from Louisville, Ky. Drysdale has him
stabled on the backstretch in Barn 7 at Pimlico, the opposite side
of the track from the stakes barn, where most of the horses for the
Preakness are stabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quieter over here,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale also decided to unload him at the back of the barn away
from the racetrack where horses were ready to start the next race
on yesterday's card. He unloaded the colt directly into the barn so
he didn't have to step on the concrete surrounding the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said Fusaichi Pegasus probably will be saddled in the
inside paddock at Pimlico that's used on a daily basis, rather than
on the infield turf course where the horses for the Preakness are
saddled every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun is beating down. Why not go someplace where it's
cool?'' Drysdale asked.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Pimilico oddsmaker Clem Florio said the morning-line odds of 3-5
on Fusaichi Pegasus is the lowest he has set for the favorite at
the Preakness in his 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Citing his allegiance to longtime friend and Indiana basketball
coach Bobby Knight, trainer D. Wayne Lukas said he won't grant
interviews to CNN//SI or any of the network's affiliates for an
unspecified period because the cable network aired a videotape of
Knight choking former Hoosiers player Neil Reed. ``I thought CNN
started the whole damn thing,'' Lukas said.

RANGERS GET EVEN AFTER WOBBLY START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A quarter of a season has passed and the
Rangers find themselves no better than a .500 team.
</P>
<P>
   Considering where they've been, they'll gladly take that for
now.
</P>
<P>
   The usual flogging of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' pitching staff
and a gritty relief performance by Tim Crabtree allowed the Rangers
to reach that mark with an 11-6 victory yesterday afternoon at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, led by Frank Catalanotto's five-hit performance,
pounded out an 8-1 lead after three innings. But, after Fred
McGriff's grand slam made it 8-5, Crabtree had to rescue struggling
starter Doug Davis in the fifth and pitch 4 2/3 innings to preserve
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after an 8-15 start, have now won 12 of 17, putting
them at the .500 mark (20-20) for the first time since they were
6-6 on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where we started, going through that bad streak, to be
able to come back from that is good,'' designated hitter Rafael
Palmeiro said. ``Our team is going to get better. We made a lot of
changes and when you do that, it's hard to expect that you're not
going to miss a beat. Nobody likes to struggle, but sometimes you
have to struggle to get better. I think we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense has done much to get the Rangers back. They had 16
hits yesterday, raising the club average to .304, the highest it
has ever been after 40 games in a season. Catalanotto led the way,
but Ivan Rodriguez added to his latest tear by going 3-for-4 and
Luis Alicea, Chad Curtis and Mike Lamb had two hits each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team can hit,'' Crabtree said. ``They can flat-out hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had hoped the bullpen would be just as good as their
offense. It hasn't been. But yesterday it was and it was all
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates went with him much earlier than usual
because of the Devil Rays' predominantly right-handed hitting.
Oates was hoping Crabtree could at least get the Rangers through
the seventh. He got much more, all at Crabtree's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first brought him in, I told him I needed eight or nine
outs,'' Oates said. ``When he came in after the seventh, he said,
`I've got at least another inning in me.' After the eighth, he
said, `I'd really like to finish this thing.' I asked him if he'd
ever thrown 50 pitches in a game before. He said `It doesn't really
matter. I feel really good. I think I've got one more in me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree threw a season-high 61 pitches, and the 4 2/3 innings
made it the longest outing of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain ourselves each and every day,'' Crabtree said.''Me
and \RJeff Zimmerman\S, we throw 40-45 pitches every day in batting
practice. I felt strong in the ninth inning. It's almost like a
starting pitcher when you get into a rhythm. It's just a matter of
maintaining your stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree finished strong. Five of the first 10 hitters he faced
reached base on three singles, a walk and an error, which led to an
unearned run in the sixth. But he retired the final eight hitters
and gave much credit to the strong wind that was blowing toward the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was awesome,'' Crabtree said. ``It gave my fastball
some major sinkage. I couldn't have thrown a better sinker. I had
the perfect arm slot. I just need to build on that and stay with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers know about sinking. They almost sank themselves out
of a division race in April. Now that they're back at .500, their
division title hopes seem afloat again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back where we can see out of the foxhole,'' Oates said.
``Hopefully now we can get out of the foxhole.''

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers are bringing Triple-A pitcher Dan
Kolb to Arlington today and are expected to send pitcher Doug Davis
back to the minor leagues. The Rangers are concerned about running
short of pitching after Tim Crabtree pitched 4 2/3 innings
yesterday and Kenny Rogers still being doubtful for Sunday's start
because of a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait until \Rtoday\S and then visit,'' general manager
Doug Melvin said. ``We want to make sure everybody is healthy
before we make a determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis continues to impress the Rangers and frustrate them. He
took a 8-1 lead into the fifth yesterday but had to come out after
Fred McGriff's grand slam. In the fourth, Davis walked the first
three batters he faced, then left the bases loaded by striking out
the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to pitch regularly,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``There's no doubt in my mind he can get major-league hitters out.
But there are times when he's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb was 4-1 with an 0.98 earned-run average and four saves with
the Oklahoma RedHawks.  &QL; 
Greer's return delayed
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rusty Greer has recovered from ankle surgery and his
pulled hamstring muscle is no longer a problem. But his return from
the disabled list, planned for today, has been delayed by a sore
left shoulder, the result of having to make an excessive number of
throws while playing for the Tulsa Drillers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been throwing every other day, but throwing in a game is
different,'' Greer said. ``Last night I had to make quite a number
of throws and I felt some pain and discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer has been found to have inflammation, and the Rangers are
still hoping he can return to the lineup before the end of the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Other injury news:
</P>
<P>
   First baseman David Segui was scratched from yesterday's lineup
with a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gabe Kapler said he's hoping to test his strained hip
flexor by running the bases today. If that goes well, he could go
out on medical rehabilitation assignment on Saturday and be
activated next week in Kansas City.  &QL; 
Curtis hits second deck
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis' first-inning home run landed in the first row of
the upper deck in right field. That blast gave him the honor being
the first right-handed hitter to ever hit one into the upper deck
of the Home Run Porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of surprised nobody else has done it,'' Curtis said.
``Guys like Juan Gonzalez and Dean Palmer, they've had some guys
here with power and opposite-field power. I'm sure the wind had
something to do with it, and I hit it solid. I'll take it.''  &QL; 
Orioles watch
</P>
<P>
   News flashes from the Baltimore Orioles, who open a four-game
series with the Rangers tonight at The Ballpark in Arlington:
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Will Clark, on the disabled list with a strained
hamstring, is expected to be activated for tonight's game and
return to the lineup. If so, it will be his first appearance at The
Ballpark since leaving the Rangers as a free agent after the 1998
season. He was on the disabled list last season when the Orioles
came to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, taking advantage of an off-day, are giving
struggling pitcher Mike Mussina an extra day of rest. Mussina, who
pitched Sunday, is being pushed back to Saturday instead of
pitching Friday on his normal four days of rest. Jason Johnson, the
Orioles' fifth starter who was skipped in his last start, is being
reinserted into the rotation on Friday.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland will be honored before tonight's game for his
300th save, which he earned on Friday at Anaheim. Former Rangers
closer Tom Henke, who has 311 career saves, will take part in the
ceremony.

AUSTRALIANS THRIVING ON TEXAS TOUR

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The koala population in Tarrant County is
limited to the confines of the Fort Worth Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Crocodiles don't run rampant around the banks of the Trinity
River, and there's no barrier reef in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas, to some Australians playing on the PGA Tour, feels
like home.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Australians thrive in the Texas heat, wind and
course conditions. Six Australians _ Stuart Appleby, Steve
Elkington, Robert Allenby, Greg Chalmers, Bradley Hughes and Craig
Parry _ will compete in the MasterCard Colonial starting today,
each hoping to become the fourth player from their country to win
the event and the second to win in Texas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Aussies' game just seems to fit Texas perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wind,'' Parry said last week during a day of 38-mph
gusts at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic. ``This is a pretty normal
day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind does seem to be a friend of Australians. Allenby won this
year's Shell Houston Open less than a month ago. Appleby won the
event last year.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's success is not confined to South Texas though. He has
played the Colonial three times and owns the lowest career stroke
average at Hogan's Alley, tied with Peter Jordan at 69.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``It resembles Australia,'' Appleby said. ``The firmness of the
place, the wind, the style of the course. Obviously I feel
comfortable here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainly the firmness of the fairways and the wind.
Ninety-nine percent of our tournaments are played on really soft
fairways and greens. The U.S. Open gets dry and firm, the Western
Open gets firm, and here it's always firm. But that's about it. In
Australia it plays firm every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby and Appleby aren't the first Aussies to succeed in
Texas. Ian Baker-Finch won the Colonial in 1989, while countrymen
Bruce Crampton and Bruce Devlin won in 1965 and '66, respectively.
Crampton and Devlin also combined for three victories in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The next trick, Australian players hope, is getting at least one
member of the group into the band of PGA Tour superstars. Elkington
was once there and has twice finished a season in the top 10 of the
money list _ including a No. 5 finish in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But only one Australian has sat atop the PGA Tour, that being
Greg Norman when he won Vardon Trophy (lowest tour scoring average)
in 1988, '89 and '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I was coming up through the junior ranks I really
looked up to him,'' Allenby said. ``Greg Norman is such a big part
of Australian golf. We owe him a lot because we all wanted to turn
out being like Greg Norman.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman hopes to see another Australian reach that level as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see that for Australia,'' Norman said during the
week of the Masters. ``We always need a Tiger Woods; we always need
a Jack Nicklaus or Seve Ballesteros. We always need somebody with
that type of charisma to keep the game going.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, for its depth of golfing talent, doesn't have a
player at that level, but it might be close. Allenby and Appleby
are ranked Nos. 6 and 27, respectively, on the tour's all-around
rankings. Both are in the top 25 of the money list (Allenby No. 14,
Appleby No. 24) with more than $1.6 million combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of very good young players,'' Parry said.
``We're getting back to the stage we were eight or nine years ago
when we had a dozen or so players around the world winning
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   While Allenby and Appleby are thriving now, people all around
the PGA Tour can't stop talking about 19-year-old amateur Aaron
Baddeley.
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley won the 1999 Australian Open and played in this year's
Masters. He's playing throughout the United States and Canada this
year on sponsor's exemptions to determine if he's ready to turn
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good player,'' Chalmers said. ``For his age, he's
a fantastic player. Everyone is expecting big things of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured, Baddeley is not the last one. Appleby said
golf in Australia _ thanks to year-round playing conditions and the
inexpensive nature of the game compared with the cost in the United
States _ will just continue to grow. He also said the group of
young stars goes far beyond Baddeley, and that within the decade,
his country's tour success could stretch far outside the Texas
borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning already to feel old,'' Appleby, 29, said. ``Only
a few years ago I was the young guy on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to keep punching them out. By the end of
2010, you're going to see a bunch of world-class players.'' nn

   Half a dozen previously uncommitted House Republicans and
Democrats said they would support the legislation granting China
permanent normal trading privileges. Administration officials and
congressional backers said they now think they are close to having
collected the 218 votes needed for passage in the House, but they
are still locked in a battle to put the measure over the top.  &QL;

DEMOCRATS' UNITY ENDS IN ASSEMBLY OVERTHROW ATTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The State Assembly suddenly dissolved into open
warfare Wednesday, as the second-ranking member, Michael J.
Bragman, announced he would try to overthrow Speaker Sheldon Silver
in a showdown vote Monday. The speaker retaliated by stripping
Bragman of his title of majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary turn of events _ the last overt attempt to
topple a speaker was in the 1960s _ left Democrats agog. Coming the
day after the party displayed a united front at its state
convention in nominating Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate,
this fight extends far beyond the walls of the Assembly chamber to
gubernatorial and regional politics.
</P>
<P>
   Silver may have hurt himself by trying to undermine State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall's undeclared candidacy for governor in
2002 and promoting Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban
development. McCall has wide support among elected officials, and
he demonstrated his popularity Tuesday with a speech at the
Democratic convention that brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the election of Bragman, whose district is
near Syracuse, would be a seismic shift in tradition that has
dictated for generations that when the Democrats control the
Assembly, the speaker must be from New York City. Silver's defeat
would leave the Capitol's ruling troika, the governor and the
leaders of the Assembly and Senate, without a member from New York
City for the first time since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats frantically conducted head counts Wednesday, with many
acknowledging that their tallies were barely more accurate than a
reading of tea leaves, as fence sitters nervously tried to decide
which side to embrace. Most Democrats interviewed predicted that
Silver would survive, but few ruled out Bragman's chances,
especially if he won the support of the Republican minority in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said Bragman had hurt his chances by reaching out
to Republicans, an alliance many Democrats, including those with no
love for Silver, recoil from. At an impromptu news conference,
Bragman denied conspiring with Republicans or making them any
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he had the support of most Democrats, who have a
98-to-52 advantage in the Assembly. ``We will call for a vote to
replace the speaker and to elect a new speaker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver loyalists insisted that the speaker held control.
``The notion that the Democrats are dissatisfied with Shelly Silver
is hallucinatory,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a
Westchester County Democrat. ``There's no rationale for the
candidacy, and no votes for it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bragman can force a leadership vote _ a question in some
doubt _ it will be partly a referendum on Silver's ruling style,
which has been criticized as secretive and inclined to hoarding
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt for a long time that I am not as productive as I
could be, that whatever intelligence I may have, whatever talent I
may have, whatever energy I may have, is not being used
appropriately,'' said Assemblyman Martin A. Luster, a Democrat from
Ithaca who was one of the few to speak openly in favor of Bragman.
``More often than not, I feel more like an ornament standing around
at the speaker's press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver does not socialize much with the Assembly members, a fact
that produces some grumbling, while Bragman does. But Bragman is
not well liked either, having gained a reputation for hardball
tactics bordering on meanness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are wary of Bragman, but he's perceived to be someone
you go to when you have a problem, you need a favor, you need
something to get fixed,'' said an Assembly member from New York
City who described himself as a fence sitter, leaning toward
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not just about being liked. This is also about
promises that are being made, about committee chairmanships, about
young careers getting fast-tracked, about pork spending in
individual districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said Bragman set the coup attempt in motion on
Tuesday, at the convention, perhaps emboldened by McCall's showing
and by Silver's being so wrapped up in organizing the event.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing was odd, and it perplexed many Assembly
members. Speakers are elected at the start of each two-year term,
and in some respects it is more difficult to replace one midterm.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a speaker is chosen by the majority party's conference
in an informal closed session. When a candidate emerges with a
majority _ in this case, 50 of the 98 Democratic votes _ the
Assembly is convened and the entire party conference unites behind
that candidate in a formal vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman introduced a motion Wednesday to change the Assembly
rules to allow the removal of a speaker at any time. He said that
if the motion passed, he would then make a motion to remove Silver.
Silver's allies insisted he might be able to prevent a vote on the
rules change.
</P>
<P>
   Each motion requires 76 votes, a simple majority of the State
Assembly. Many Republicans, whose distaste for Silver is intense,
would surely go along. But relying heavily on Republican votes
could leave Bragman ruling through a rump Democratic faction, and
beholden to the Republicans.

BUSH URGES CONGRESS TO BACK CLINTON ON CHINA TRADE

<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Calling trade relations with China the work of
``13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush on
Wednesday urged congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to
support President Clinton and vote to grant China permanent trade
rights. The House is scheduled to vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has long supported free trade, his address here
Wednesday on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of
the few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending
legislation in Congress. He called the question of whether to
extend normal trading privileges to China ``among the most serious
decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ``no
one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the
presidency'' should remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start of this campaign, I have defined some sharp
differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Bush said, a
sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ``But today I want to address an
important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the
Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Bush said.
``It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13
years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be
undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was
one of those presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called
free trade ``a forward strategy for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With his remarks, Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan
cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in
recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his
efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day earlier, he parted company with Senate Republicans,
criticizing a bill that would set a deadline for withdrawing U.S.
ground troops from Kosovo. A spokesman for Bush said he considered
the measure ``legislative overreach on powers of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at
the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is
oriented toward exports and the Pacific rim, nearby Seattle was
also the site of last year's violent protests against the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The
company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number its workers
said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization
would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the local congressman,
Rep. Jack Metcalf, is one of the few undecided Republicans on the
issue. Bush, on his campaign plane this afternoon, said that he had
made no telephone calls to wavering house members, but would do so
if Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, asked for his help.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has voted Democratic in the past three
presidential elections, but Bush's aides say they are contesting
the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Bush a generally
polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of
workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The measure cleared the House Ways and Means Committee on
Wednesday by a larger-than-expected margin of 34-4 as several
undecided members sided with Clinton. The full House, which is
bitterly divided on the issue, is to vote next week on whether to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made this one of his foreign policy priorities
for the year, has argued for months that Congress must grant China
permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of
U.S. companies and relations with the world's most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote is too close to call. And if the measure passes,
it will do so largely with the support of Republicans. Many
Democrats have sided with organized labor, which is fighting hard
against the measure, arguing that permanent support for China trade
would leave Congress few ways to pressure China to improve its
record on human rights, labor and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has supported the bill, but been less fervent than the
president, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical
Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Clinton on
the China bill than Gore. He argued Wednesday that ``the stakes are
high'' in how the debate is decided and made an impassioned
argument for the House to ratify China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``For businesses and workers and farmers, it will mean lower
trade barriers and important opportunities for U.S. exports and
more work and jobs for United States workers,'' he said. ``For the
people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the
region's major superpower. For the people of China it holds out the
hope of more open contact with the world of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He did however use the occasion to draw distinctions between the
administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said
Clinton and Gore view China as a `'strategic partner'' and said,
``I view China as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in
its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various
high profile battles over trade. ``They failed to obtain `fast
track' trade negotiating authority,'' Bush said, ``I will fight for
it. They mishandled the global trade negotiations here in Seattle.
I will make expanding trade and therefore expanding jobs at home a
consistent priority of my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that while China is not a ``strategic partner,'' it
is not an enemy. ``When I am the president, China will have no
doubts about our power and purpose in the region _ about our strong
commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said. ``But
this is accomplished through confident diplomacy, strong alliances,
and a military to back us. It is not accomplished by hindering free
trade or seeking to isolate China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Bush spoke,
Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with
China because it would result in the loss of U.S. manufacturing
jobs. ``We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ``We
can't compete with somebody who's living in a cardboard box.'' He
said he was a Democrat who would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said he was a
unionized worker who does not ``follow the union line. But he said
he was uncertain about China trade because ``I'm not confident with
China's human rights record.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a dim view of both candidates. ``I'm not going to vote
for Gore _ that's a definite,'' Webb said. ``Vote for Bush? I'd
prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''

WILLIAMS EXPLODES FOR TWO HOMERS AS YANKEES DOWN WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams was still in his T-shirt and long
underwear when Chuck Knoblauch shouted across the clubhouse to tell
the cleanup hitter that he was batting second Wednesday night.
Williams did a double take, skipped a few steps to peek at the
lineup card posted on the clubhouse door and softly said, ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was happy to be hitting second for the first time this
season after Joe Torre juggled the lineup to try to spark a
moribund offense and find a suitable replacement for the injured
Derek Jeter. Torre decided that Williams could mimic Jeter and
moved him up in the batting order. The manager might consider
leaving Williams in that cozy spot for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Williams hammered two homers, including a
grand slam, hitting one homer from each side of the plate, to help
the Yankees cruise to a 9-4 victory over the White Sox and end a
five-game losing streak. After managing 11 runs in their last five
games and not winning since Jeter left last Thursday's game with a
strained abdominal muscle, the Yankees erupted for almost as many
runs in one night, possibly pacifying the ever-antsy George
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't work one way, you got to try another way,''
Williams said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did try another way and they could exhale after
finally ending their longest losing streak since last May. Roger
Clemens pitched like a stopper on a night on which he did not have
to be so dominating, holding the White Sox to two runs and four
hits in seven innings, while striking out nine, walking none and
tossing a tidy 87 pitches. But even if Clemens had pitched a
shutout, the focus was on the disappointing offense cranking for
one fun night.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was ``playing with things'' by moving Williams up
in the order, inserting Shane Spencer into the cleanup spot,
batting Jorge Posada fifth and using Tino Martinez in the sixth
position. Torre had toyed with moving Williams behind Chuck
Knoblauch and liked how Spencer had been swinging, so he tinkered
with the lineup against the left-handed Jim Parque and, presto, the
Yankees responded.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who now has eight career grand slams, homered from
both sides of the plate for the sixth time in his career. Spencer
stroked three singles and Posada reached base three times.
Knoblauch and Paul O'Neill, who remained in their usual spots, also
played key roles. Knoblauch had two hits, scored twice and studied
plenty of pitches, and O'Neill had two doubles and also scored two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is one big inning,'' Knoblauch said before the
game. ``A few bloop hits. Something has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something did happen for the Yankees in the first
inning, and Knoblauch started it. He lashed a liner off first
baseman Paul Konerko's glove and raced to third with a tainted
triple as the ball rattled around right fielder Magglio Ordonez. It
was New York's first extra-base hit in 28 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lined out to shortstop, but O'Neill slapped a double
past first base and into the seats along the right-field line.
Spencer, the cleanup man for the second time this season, punched a
single to right and Posada knocked in the second run with a
sacrifice fly to center. O'Neill doubled in the third, Posada
walked and they both scored when Chris Singleton misplayed Jim
Leyritz's liner to center field, putting the Yankees ahead, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was firing fastballs, getting ahead of hitters and doing
what the Yankees want and need him to do. Even after plunking Jose
Valentin in the first, which might have been payback for Clay
Bellinger getting hit on Monday, Clemens stranded him at second by
retiring Frank Thomas on a groundout and striking out Ordonez with
a split-finger fastball. He did not face more than four batters in
any inning and was bruised only by homers from Ordonez and Greg
Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Williams belted his first homer to left field off Parque in the
fourth to give Clemens a 5-0 edge and he followed that with a
towering grand slam to right field off Tanyon Sturtze in the fifth.
The Yankees had a 9-1 cushion, there were smiles in every corner of
the Stadium and Williams even jumped out of the dugout for a
curtain call. For Williams, that was cool. Just like batting
second.  &QL;

LAKERS VS. PORTLAND MATCHUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS &QL; 
LAKERS vs. PORTLAND
</P>
<P>
   __ Centers: Portland's Arvydas Sabonis has a 7-foot-3, 290-pound
frame to bang against Shaquille O'Neal, and more importantly, he
has plenty of help. MVP O'Neal averaged just 20.5 points (9 below
his average) against Portland this season as he fought through
crowds of Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, Jermaine O'Neal and Brian
Grant. It's unlikely O'Neal will get loose for 37 points a night,
as he did for the first three games against Phoenix. Sabonis has
creaky knees but can get physical and has a nice outside jumper. He
averaged 10.8 points and 7.0 rebounds against the Lakers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forwards: As usual, this is an uphill battle for the Lakers.
Portland's Rasheed Wallace is younger, quicker and stronger than
the A.C. Green-Robert Horry tandem, and he averaged 17 points and
9.3 rebounds against them this season. Horry and Green's job will
be simply to slow him down and, in Horry's case, make some outside
shots to keep Wallace from doubling O'Neal. Glen Rice has held up
well defending Scottie Pippen (14.5 points vs. Lakers). Rice shot
just 33.3 percent and averaged 11.8 points against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guards: The Blazers' Damon Stoudamire is one of the speediest
playmaker-scorers in the league, and Kobe Bryant will have his
hands full _ and an oxygen tank standing by. But the Lakers can
also exploit the matchup when the 5-10 Stoudamire guards the 6-7
Bryant. After missing the first two games against Portland, Bryant
averaged a team-best 24.3 points and 55.6 percent shooting in the
final two meetings. Steve Smith scored 27 points in the Blazers'
Jan. 22 win at Staples, but he shot just 38.2 percent in the season
series. Ron Harper will probably have ex-teammate Pippen draped on
him to slow the Lakers offense.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: No one has a deeper, more experienced group than
Portland. Guard Greg Anthony and forward Detlef Schrempf are
veterans who could start for other teams. Forward Brian Grant
brings the kind ofrebounding and energy the Lakers sometimes lack.
And youngsters Bonzi Wells and Jermaine O'Neal are potential
budding stars. The Lakers will expect the usual from Robert Horry,
Brian Shaw and Rick Fox _ play tough defense, grab some rebounds,
get the ball to Shaq and Kobe and hit the open jumper now and then.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach: Phil Jackson's steadiness has characterized the
Lakers' postseason, and his players have followed his lead. They
pushed past two losses to Sacramento to win in the first round,
then overcame a horribly embarrassing rout at the hands of Phoenix
to close out the Suns, with hardly a flinch from Jackson, the NBA's
all-time winningest coach. Mike Dunleavy coached the Blazers to the
league's second-best record (59-23), and after struggling through
March, Portland has regained a dominant look in the playoffs. A
footnote: Dunleavy coached the Lakers in their 1991 Finals loss to
Jackson's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Overall: These teams split the regular-season series, and
each won on the other's home court. Every meeting has been a
defensive struggle _ neither team scored more than 100 points in
any game and theyaveraged 89 points each. The Lakers won the
biggest of the four meetings _ a 90-87 victory at the Rose Garden
on Feb. 29 that sent the Blazers into a tailspin and propelled the
Lakers to the league's best record. Portland's athleticism, youth
and depth will provide the Lakers their greatest test of the
season, but the Lakers should squeak by on the strength of Kobe,
Shaq and home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Prediction: Lakers, 4-3. &QL;

 SAN FRANCISCO TOURISTS SPENDING HAPPILY  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco likes to call itself ``everybody's
favorite city,'' and the latest tourist numbers seem to bear this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to San Francisco spent a record $6.55 billion in the
city last year, according to a new report from the San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau, which sliced and diced the city's
biggest industry into an impressive statistical salad:
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   -- 16.8 million visitors came to San Francisco last year, 1.6
percent more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -- An average of 146,000 visitors spent $17.9 million a day in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   -- 35.1 percent of visitors stay at local hotels and spend an
average of $233 a day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hotel occupancy was 80.7 percent in San Francisco last year,
13 percent ahead of the national average, according to PKF
Consulting. (Only Las Vegas and New York have higher occupancy
rates.)
</P>
<P>
   -- In the first quarter 2000, hotel occupancy was 7.6 percent
ahead of the same period last year, and average daily room rates
are up 12.2 percent to more than $155 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism in San Francisco is at an all-time high,'' said John
Marks, president of the convention and visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the city has an enviable well-balanced mix of
visitors: 37.6 percent are leisure travelers, 32.4 percent attend
convention or group meetings and 30 percent come for other
business.
</P>
<P>
   The best news, said Marks, is that 81 percent of 2,745 recently
surveyed guests to the city are repeat visitors, and 94 percent
said they would definitely come back. Five percent of respondents
said they didn't know if they would come back, and only 1 percent
said they would not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ideal customer profile,'' added convention and
visitors bureau research manager David Bratton. ``Our average guest
is affluent, likes to spend, is satisfied and plans to return.''
</P>
<P>
   International travel to San Francisco increased 8 percent, to
2.9 million visitors, last year and accounted for 24 percent of all
San Francisco hotel guests. Only New York; Los Angeles; Miami; and
Orlando, Fla., receive more foreign travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent survey, the bureau asked visitors what they liked
and didn't like about San Francisco. Marks said the remarks were
not tabulated because they were similar to responses in previous
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``To no one's surprise, everyone liked the ambience, the scenic
beauty, the dining, the cultural diversity,'' he said. ``What they
didn't like was street people, panhandlers, traffic and parking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists contacted at random by The Chronicle at the Cable Car
turnaround at Powell and Market streets Wednesday confirmed the
bureau's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors said they were having a good time but 13 of 20 (or
65 percent) said they were bothered by panhandlers and homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cuskley, who works for American Express Travel Services in
New York, complained that panhandlers are even more aggressive here
than in Manhattan. He said he offered $1 to one Tuesday night and
``the guy negotiated me up to $3.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Tobler, who is visiting with her family from near Zurich,
Switzerland, said the homeless scene was ``a shock.'' And Steyn
Arild from Bergen, Norway, said he was appalled by the huge gap in
American society between ``the lowest of the low and all the people
at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few tourists who took the street people in stride was
Reg Smith, a psychiatrist who works at a hospital for the
criminally insane in Adelaide, Australia. Although Smith said his
wife and elderly parents were intimidated by local panhandlers, he
said philosophically, ``There are schizophrenics everywhere.''

 BRONX SLAYING OF CABDRIVER IS NYC'S 10th FOR THIS YEAR  
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young Cambodian immigrant who had just begun using
his car as a taxi was fatally shot early Wednesday morning in the
Bronx, becoming the 10th cabby to be slain while on duty in the
city this year.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the latest victim, Kim Hong Tim, 20, was driving his
black Acura Legend for the Preferred Luxury Car Service shortly
after midnight when the car crashed into a parked car at East 215th
Street and Barnes Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who called 911 at first said that Tim, who was found
lying on the pavement near the car, had been struck by the vehicle
and was having trouble breathing. Emergency workers later found
that he had been shot in the back and robbed, apparently before
stumbling from the driver's seat. He was pronounced dead at 12:35
a.m. at Montefiore Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tim, of the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, immigrated with
his parents and five siblings to the United States in 1982 from the
Cambodian city of Battambang, and grew up in the Bronx. He dropped
out of high school two years ago to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Tim's family said Wednesday that he had been laid off as a
security guard within the last week and had converted the family
car to a taxi to support his 2-year-old daughter, Aleena, and his
wife, Gia Lee Tim, who is six months pregnant. His car did not have
a bulletproof partition.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His father, Sovann Tim, 56, said he did not know his son had
begun working as a cabby until he learned of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me he was driving,'' he said. ``I feel like I
want to die. I want to die with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim's wife was inconsolable Wednesday when news of his death
reached her. ``She almost fainted,'' said Jenny Tim, 27, her
sister-in-law. ``She was crying uncontrollably until this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Tim was the latest in a series of attacks against
cabdrivers in the city. The deaths have prompted the city to
underwrite the purchase of bulletproof partitions for all livery
cabs, and the Police Department to deploy hundreds of extra
officers each night on cabby-protection assignments.
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities said Wednesday that Tim was not licensed
as a cabdriver, and his Acura was not registered with the city's
Taxi and Limousine Commission, he clearly was working as a cabby.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nestor Rodriguez, a dispatcher at the Preferred Luxury Car
Service at 1067 White Plains Road, said Tim started a shift Tuesday
evening and spent the night ferrying passengers in the
neighborhood. His last call, which came about 11:30 p.m., was to
pick up a man on East 167th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Tim was not heard from again until 12:02 a.m., when the 911
caller reported the accident at East 215th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the investigation was continuing, and declined to
discuss a report that a gang member had been involved. Sgt. Brian
Burke, a police spokesman, said detectives were looking for the
passenger Tim picked up at East 167th Street, and hoped to question
him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Tim had been robbed of cash, his jewelry and a
two-way radio. Detectives also found a shell casing from a .380
semiautomatic pistol at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of
Taxi Drivers, said he spent part of the morning with Tim's family.
He said that Tim was working in the taxi industry illegally and out
of desperation, trying to support his family, and fell victim to
the same sort of crime that had spread fear through the ranks of
livery cabbies this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the person who did this meant to kill a livery cab
driver,'' Mateo said. ``There is no doubt about it.''

 ONLINE SALES BLOOMED FOR MOTHER'S DAY  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beset by admonitions that it's time to pull up
their socks, clean up their act and make something of themselves,
e-tailers this month found support and solace from the one person
who really cares: Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Online sales for Mother's Day soared to $190 million, up from
$14 million last year, according to BizRate.com. That's more than
double the $80 million that BizRate had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The rating service, which tracks about 60 percent of e-commerce
sites, uses a methodology similar to political exit polls. It
surveys shoppers right after they've completed an online purchase,
then extrapolates results from that data.
</P>
<P>
   From May 1 to May 12, shoppers placed 2.9 million online orders,
up from 250,000 last year, with an average purchase price of $66,
BizRate said.
</P>
<P>
   The news gives the e-commerce segment validation after weeks of
battering in Wall Street and the press, and appears to show that
many consumers who first shopped on the Internet over Christmas
were satisfied enough to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call for a lot of people, especially people
in the press, who've been bad-mouthing e-commerce,'' said Barry
Parr, director of consumer e-commerce research at IDC in Mountain
View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lot of hype and market overcrowding, online sales to
consumers are a huge market, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year consumers will spend $42 billion on the Internet
versus $26 billion last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, chocolates, jewelry, gifts and online greeting cards
were the most popular Mother's Day categories online.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to five top flower sites (1800flowers.com, Ftd.com,
Proflowers.com, PCFlowers.com and Virtualflowers.com) hit almost a
quarter of a million on Thursday, May 11, close to double from a
week before, according to Nielsen/NetRatings in Milpitas, Calif.
The firm measures Web-site traffic, not actual purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Flower-site traffic was significantly higher than for
Valentine's Day, even adjusting for a growth in Internet usage
between the two holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mom is more likely to live far away'' than your spouse or
sweetheart, said Lisa Strand, an Internet analyst with
Nielsen/NetRatings. While you might buy a bouquet from the local
flower shop for Valentine's Day, ``if you're not going to see the
actual bouquet for mom, you might as well buy it online because at
least you'll see a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ken Young, a spokesman for 1800flowers.com in Westbury,
N.Y., said, ``this is the busiest two-week period in the year.''
The company averaged 120,000 orders a day for the three days before
Mother's Day weekend, more than half of them online. That's almost
triple the online percentage from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites had few problems handling the deluge of visitors,
according to San Mateo, Calif.'s Keynote Systems, which measures
Web site performance and availability.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote measured a dozen chocolate, flower and greeting card
sites and found that all had good performance, loading a page in
4.1 seconds or less, except for Proflowers.com (6.26 seconds) and
Chocoholic.com (43.85 seconds). The sites were available at least
96 percent of the time, except for Hallmark (91.1 percent),
Proflowers (91.7 percent) and Chocoholic (83.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Greeting card site traffic spiked on Mother's Day, when it was
too late to order anything else in time. ``If you're so lazy you
can't even go out and send a real card, you can cop out and go
online for an electronic card,'' said Gene Shklar, vice president
of public services at Keynote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that only works if your mom is wired.

   BUCHANAN RESIGNATION SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party leaders in Colorado and Georgia have called on Pat
Buchanan, the leading contender for the Reform presidential
nomination, to resign from the party on the ground that he has been
spreading hate and intolerance and ignoring the party procedures.
At a meeting last Saturday, the executive committee of the party in
Colorado passed a resolution saying that Buchanan was ``promoting
discrimination, intolerance and hatred against various groups of
law-abiding American citizens.'' In addition, it condemned remarks
attributed to Buchanan in which homosexuality was called a
disorder. ``We just don't have any room for intolerance,'' Victor
Good, the party chairman, said. The Reform Party in Georgia called
for Buchanan's resignation after he invited state residents to a
May 21 state convention that party leaders said was scheduled
illegally. Jim Mangia, secretary of the national Reform Party,
predicted that more states would move against Buchanan. Bay
Buchanan, Buchanan's sister and chief strategist, called the
Colorado and Georgia moves ``much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ENDORSED AS REAGAN'S HEIR
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president
Wednesday, claiming him as an heir to the conservative political
tradition of her husband, former President Ronald Reagan. ``His
agenda of tax cuts, smaller government and a strong national
defense will build pride in America just as it did when my husband
was president,'' Reagan said. ``This is a candidate Ronnie would be
proud of.'' Reagan, 89, has Alzheimer's disease and no longer makes
public appearances or statements. Nancy Reagan has offered her
endorsement of every Republican presidential candidate since her
husband left office in 1988. Bush proudly embraced the Reagan
mantle. ``I thank her for her endorsement and pledge an optimistic,
positive campaign, in the Reagan tradition, to renew America's
spirit and encourage a new era of personal responsibility and
freedom,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTE IS IN THE MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Unable to affect the presidential nominating contests at this
late point, Oregon voters used Tuesday's vote-by-mail primary, the
nation's first, to reject ballot proposals calling for a new
gasoline tax and limits on damages in personal-injury lawsuits.
Oregon residents have voted by mail in local elections and special
statewide elections since the early 1980s, but they had never
before voted entirely by mail in a regularly scheduled election. A
footnote: Vice President Al Gore and Bush won going away, as
expected, not that it made any difference in the nominating
contests. And the turnout? The secretary of state's office put it
at 47 percent, the highest since the 1992 primary, when turnout hit
49.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FINANCING LOOPHOLE
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation Wednesday
to close a loophole in federal tax and election law that allows
nonprofit groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on
political campaigns with virtually no disclosure. Organizations
like the Sierra Club and the Republicans for Clean Air have taken
advantage of the provision, Section 527 of the Internal Revenue
Code, to raise and spend millions of dollars on behalf of
candidates. They can run television advertisements and conduct
telephone campaigns as long as they do not explicitly advocate the
election or defeat of a candidate. The proposed legislation,
similar to a bill already before the House, would require that such
groups register with the Federal Election Commission and comply
with federal election laws. It also would require that they
disclose their existence to the Internal Revenue Service and that
they reveal their large contributors and expenditures. One of the
sponsors of the Senate bill, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said
that passage of the measure would ``remove 527s from the shadows
and expose their activities to the light of public scrutiny.'' Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., another sponsor and longtime advocate of
campaign finance reform, called the proliferation of 527
organizations ``a pernicious evil'' that has helped bring U.S.
politics to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   LIBYAN INNUENDO
</P>
<P>
   With an uphill battle to keep Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., from
winning a third term, Brian Schweitzer, a Democratic challenger,
has found another obstacle to overcome. Schweitzer said this week
that the same phone bank company that made negative calls against
McCain before the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina
was making calls to Montana on behalf of Burns. Schweitzer said a
Houston firm, Voter Consumer Research, asked Montana voters if they
had been aware that Schweitzer had once worked in Libya, ``a known
terrorist state.'' Yes, he did once work in Libya, Schweitzer said,
in 1980, as an importer of U.S.-made farm equipment for farms being
worked by Americans. And if there was something wrong with that, he
went on, ``whoever is paying for this dirty trick push poll needs a
civics lesson.'' Well, it was not the Burns campaign, said Tricia
Pearson, the campaign coordinator. ``We're not doing it,'' she
said. ``We don't know anything about it.''THURSDAY'S SCHEDULES

<P>
   (Undated) Expect change. Don't be afraid of it. Adapt to it.
Enjoy it. And, sometimes, seek it out.
</P>
<P>
   Astute readers of Who Moved My Cheese? will recognize the plot
line. That's it. That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, you'd expect more from one of the best-selling
motivational books of the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The little _ and I mean little _ book by Spencer Johnson is
subtitled An A-Mazing Way to Deal With Change in Your Work and in
Your Life. In it, four characters _ two mice and two inexplicably
mouse-size ``littlepeople'' _ react to the loss of their
longstanding storehouse of cheese in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one mostly fails to react except to grouse about it.
The three others (in one case after an agonizingly prolonged and
self-reflective effort) manage to find new cheese somewhere else in
their maze.
</P>
<P>
   The book's blurbs and foreword helpfully emphasize that
``cheese'' is a metaphor for whatever you want to have in life. No
doubt the metaphor has clubbed you till it hurts already.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tiny story's hammering simplicity has made the $19.95,
94-page hardback fly off the bookshelves. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Not even a gracious and heartfelt introduction by business
motivational speaker Ken Blanchard, who previously co-wrote The One
Minute Manager with Johnson, convinces me that Who Moved My Cheese
deserves its moment of fame.
</P>
<P>
   The slim volume is slim pickings. It's a lot like the equally
best-selling bit of nonfiction Tuesdays With Morrie, which to my
mind is a crass exploitation of a good man's final days by someone
who came late to the human decency party.
</P>
<P>
   Are they popular because they're short and people are desperate
for quick fixes to whatever ails them?
</P>
<P>
   Are they popular because they give permission to be responsible
for yourself and your own attitude in a ``woe is me, the poor and
powerless victim'' world?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Cheese's book jacket and flyleaves are padded with testimonials
from business titans. A few say it helped them accept and deal with
change. Most of them, though, say they're giving the book to others
_ family, friends, work teams, management teams, subordinates and
so forth _ to help them cope. Funny how that works.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years on the workplace beat, I've attended a
lot of motivational and training seminars. I've heard the big names
in the American success industry _ Covey, Peters, Nelson,
Blanchard, Ziglar and more _ share their ``secrets'' for
prospering.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what their particular shtick, there are two common
themes at their presentations.
</P>
<P>
   One: An attendee always stands up and says, ``I get it, but how
do I get my boss (or my company) to get it?'' To which the speaker
always responds something like: ``You can't change your boss (or
your company). You can only change your reactions to
him//her//them//it.''
</P>
<P>
   And two: The speaker always, always, always says something to
the effect of, ``Expect change. Don't be afraid of it. Adapt to it.
Enjoy it. And, sometimes, seek it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There. You just saved $19.95.

 MEDIA BYTES: A BULL MARKET FOR BUSINESS JOURNALISTS  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know it's a hot market for technology
journalists when the Wall Street Journal can't keep people.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal _ the nation's most prestigious business publication
_ has lost a spate of talent lately, including a rash of defections
from its San Francisco bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Among the movers: Pulitzer Prize-winner George Anders, a 22-year
veteran, headed to Fast Company as a senior editor setting up its
West Coast bureau; Dean Takahashi, who covers computer games and
chips, is off to Red Herring; and biotech writer Ralph King ``got
the 10-year itch'' and is joining former bureau chief Greg Hill at
the new Time Inc. magazine eCompany Now. Also missing from the
bureau is David Bank, who is on leave writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   The departed join Quentin Hardy, who left the bureau last year
for Forbes, and a number of other more recent (and nontech beat)
defectors from New York and other bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaving the San Francisco office are not merely cashing in
on the greatest bull market for business journalists ever seen, in
which magazines are throwing around almost unmatchable salary
offers. They also cite a desire to spend more time writing fewer
stories, rather than cranking out small items that fit the
Journal's paper-of-record approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go from writing 150 stories a year to a half-dozen or
10,'' Takahashi said. ``I'm hoping the quality of my stories goes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders says he won't have to write ``4- to 5-inch stories on
eBay outages and Network Associates earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders is also seizing an opportunity to write long stories, as
well as shape the publication by joining its management team. He
also respects Fast Company founders Bill Taylor and Alan Webber,
and the way they've grown the magazine to more than 500,000 in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   King was lured not only by the prospects of covering the
e-commerce revolution central to Silicon Valley, but also to
reunite with his old boss, Hill, and to launch a new magazine on a
``clean slate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those leaving say they weren't swayed by any disaffection for
the Journal itself, which has had its share of rocky employee
relations in recent years over issues such as pensions and profit
sharing. They had mostly good things to say about the Journal, a
paper known generally for treating its employees well and
encouraging high-quality writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I had always dreamed of working,'' King said.
``ECompany Now was a bolt out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco bureau chief Steve Yoder says the current turnover
is no worse than its been in the past. Not counting Hill _ who
reported directly to New York, rather than to Yoder _ he says four
of the bureau's 20 staffers have left in the past year. ``We've
been increasing our staff by leaps and bounds, so the probability
of people leaving goes up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoder has already hired Mylene Mangalindan from Bloomberg News
to take over Internet reportage once handled by Kara Swisher, who
is now writing a weekly column. He's also brought in reinforcements
from New York, including Rebecca Buckman to cover Microsoft and
Pui-Wing Tam to cover Apple, Palm and wireless applications. He
also snagged Lisa Bransten from the Journal's Interactive Edition,
and has ``other people in the pipeline I can't tell you about.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves represent a big switch from the old days _ as recently
as a year or two ago _ when it was so prestigious to write for the
Journal's 1.8 million readers that reporters would forgo other
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all the big business publications, including Forbes,
Fortune and Business Week, have to work to keep their talent from
jumping to upstarts like Red Herring and the Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The upstarts are not making it easy, because hiring away writers
from the major-league publications gives them a big credibility
boost. In going to Red Herring, Takahashi will receive a signing
bonus, stock options and a pay raise, and will be able to work out
of his garage in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said Journalists seem to be following the advice they read
in the paper and see on its billboards. ``I saw a billboard that
said, `The Wall ``I Work for a Company Called Me'' Street Journal,'
and I thought, `Maybe they're right,' '' Hardy said. ``They were
writing about a workplace where everyone is looking out for their
own career, and it's happening at a time where there's an unusually
strong sellers' market for journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   EURO-WIRED? Keep an eye on what becomes of San Francisco's Wired
Digital in the wake of this week's announcement that Web portal
Lycos will be acquired by Spain's Telefonica. Lycos, you'll recall,
owns Wired Digital _ Web properties that include Wired News,
Hotbot, WebMonkey and Suck _ but not Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired News has been seeking expansion permission from the
Lycostians for many months, and now may have a chance to take its
franchise overseas. Editor George Shirk headed to Massachusetts on
Wednesday to scope out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   E'S COMPANY: It's too soon to judge the journalistic content of
eCompany Now, which has put out only one issue, but they sure throw
a great party. A thousand people turned out at Pac Bell Park last
Thursday night, mingling on the field and dancing to the pop band
Barenaked Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Was it ominous, though, that the first song from the Barenaked
Ladies was their hit, ``It's All Been Done''? That, after all, will
be eCompany's challenge _ selling a new-economy magazine in a
crowded marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ECompany President and Editor Ned Desmond said his plan is to
give the magazine more of a mass-market appeal than his
inside-baseball rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard question for me is, is the general business
readership in America ready for eCompany now?'' Desmond said.
``That's the question that keeps me up at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is quite reminiscent of eCompany's parent,
Fortune. Fortune staffer Joe Nocera contributes a profile of Schwab
CEO David Pottruck; Fortune columnists David Kirkpatrick and
Stewart Alsop also make appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But as eCompany aims at Fortune readers, such staff-sharing will
stop. ``Things are getting testy with Fortune'' already, Desmond
said. ``They don't see our story list and we don't see theirs. The
wall will get thicker and higher each month because we'll be
competing with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the greatest criticism of eCompany has been its name _
especially the precious ``now'' tacked on at the end. Desmond is
sanguine, almost cryptic, in defending the name, and the ``now.''
``Great magazines transcend their name, whatever their name happens
to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``now''? ``It is what it is,'' is all he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY'S NOT KIDDING: Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin came to San
Francisco to kick off the eCompany party. In a brief preparty
interview in the umpires' dressing room at the ballpark, Levin
defended both his company's pending merger with America Online and
its recent dispute with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The two subjects are not unrelated, as Disney is telling federal
regulators that Time Warner's bullying _ in blacking out
Disney-owned ABC from its cable customers for a couple of days this
month _ is reason to block its merger with AOL. With no apparent
irony, Disney _ a huge media company _ fears the even huger media
company in the offing, AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Have no fear, Levin said, looking like a grandfatherly sort in a
corduroy jacket. AOL Time Warner will do business with everyone: It
will sell its content to other distributors, and it will distribute
other companies' content.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with Disney was only over ``a relatively obscure
provision in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney and others need not fear AOL Time Warner's online
omnipotence, he said. ``In this day, the notion that anyone can
exercise any control over the Internet is belied by reality,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So big media won't be bad? ``This is a company that cares about
society,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   I feel much better now.
</P>
<P>
   FISHING IN THE TALENT POOL: It's well established that many of
Silicon Valley's mergers are motivated by companies' needs to
acquire engineering talent. What about media mergers?
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring Communications this week bought StockMaster.com, and
one of the prime motivations was to acquire its engineers,
according to Herring CEO Chris Alden. ``Publishing on the Internet
is basically ... print put online, but it's not going to be in the
future,'' Alden said. ``We have to build portfolio-tracking,
customization, personalization. In order to do it as a media
company, you have to be an engineering company.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of StockMaster's 60 employees are engineers,
Alden said, and they'll remain in their Cupertino, Calif., offices.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also gives Red Herring the ability to put
portfolio management and other types of financial information on
its site, putting it more directly into competition with sites like
MarketWatch.com and TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Alden wouldn't put a dollar figure on the deal, saying it was a
stock swap between private companies.
</P>
<P>
   NO RINGER: The whispers had already started in the
photojournalism community when former Chronicle staffer Steve
Ringman won the $1 million grand prize in a PhotoPoint.com contest.
Bill Haines, assistant photo editor of the Fresno Bee, e-mailed an
online discussion group of news photographers, ``It seems that a
bunch of the judges for this contest either had worked with or in
the same community as Ringman and would have been very familiar
with the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, judges included former San Francisco Examiner
photographers Kim Komenich and John Storey, and other current and
former Bay Area photographers. But five of the 10 people judging
the contest disqualified themselves from scoring Ringman's photo
because of that familiarity, according to PhotoPoint community
director Dave Dornlas.
</P>
<P>
   Ringman's 1983 photo of schoolgirls getting buffeted by the wind
was so highly rated by the remaining five judges that it took the
top prize. (The Chronicle, which retained rights to the photo, is
letting Ringman keep 90 percent of the prize money and will donate
its own share to charity.)
</P>
<P>
   Ringman was relieved that his colleagues had pulled out of the
judging, as he said he has done when he's judged other contests.
``It's kind of a small world, the whole photography crowd,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haines, too, was pleased that PhotoPoint had kept the contest on
a firm ethical plane.
</P>
<P>
   LOGROLLING: I'm sure we all got warm and fuzzy feelings seeing
Kevin O'Brien, general manager of Channel 2 KTVU, say a few words
in support of beleaguered Examiner Publisher Tim White in an on-air
editorial. But shouldn't O'Brien have disclosed his personal and
professional relationship with White and the Ex?
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner and the local Fox affiliate have a promotional
agreement, O'Brien said in an interview. And although O'Brien
initially said ``darn right, I am'' a friend of White's, he later
qualified that statement, noting, ``I've never been to his home.
He's never been to my home. We've never had dinner together. I've
met him two times socially and two times professionally. That's the
entire extent of my relationship with the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say: O'Brien believes his personal feelings and
professional dealings with White and the Examiner had nothing to do
with his editorial, and needed no disclosure.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: SORTING LISTS IS EASY AS ABC  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Is it possible to sort a list of song titles or other names
alphabetically in Microsoft Word?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It is. First, make sure each item on your list constitutes its
own paragraph _ in other words, hit the Enter key after each entry.
Now, go to the Table menu in Word and choose Sort. This will
automatically select your list and present you with a Sort Text
dialog box. To sort the list alphabetically, simply choose OK.
Easy, eh?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Muting Your Modem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: We use America Online to connect to the Internet. How can we get
the modem inside the computer to be silent during the connection
process?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: What's the matter? You don't like listening to high-pitched
screeching every time you go online? Can't blame you. The noise
emitted by modems is one of the most irritating sounds on the
planet, next only to the singing of Christina Aguilara. So I want
to help you if I can.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple things you can do: In the AOL sign-on window
choose Setup. Then in the Setup window click Expert Setup. Now tab
over to Devices, select your modem and choose Edit. In the box
labeled Speaker volume, which should be set to Normal, choose Off.
Then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't solve the problem, try this: Click the Windows
Start button, point to Settings and click Control Panel. In the
Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon. Select your modem (if
you have just one modem, it will select itself) and choose
Properties. Then use your mouse to slide the Speaker volume pointer
to Off.
</P>
<P>
   That procedure was designed to work regardless of which Internet
service provider you use. So if you ever switch from AOL to another
ISP, keep it in mind. But here's something else to keep in mind: It
doesn't always work. People have told me that no matter what they
do, their modem refuses to shut up. But at least it's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
How to Cover Your Tracks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have been asking different sources this question and have had
zero results. On Netscape, how do I delete the list of addresses
that appear when I click the down arrow on the Address bar? Boy oh
boy, will I ever be thankful for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: This question crops up frequently. Mostly, I suspect, from
people who have been visiting sites they'd rather keep secret from
their significant other (I'm not casting aspersions here, just
making an observation).
</P>
<P>
   You can erase the list, but it takes a few minutes. Here's how:
First open up WordPad, the simple word processor that you'll find
in Windows' Programs/Accessories menu. Choose Open from the File
menu, and using the Look in: function navigate to C: Program
FilesNetscapeUsers. In that folder you should see a folder named
after you _ your user folder. Inside that folder is a file named
prefs.js. Open it up into WordPad.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the file is a warning not to edit it. Disregard
that. Now find the list of URL entries, which correspond to the
sites on your address list. Each entry will begin like this:
userpref(``browser.urlhistory.URL. Select all of these entries and
press the Delete key. Now save the file and quit the program. The
next time you start Netscape, your address bar should be clean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cutting Your Cookies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What are the pros and cons of just deleting cookies out of their
folder periodically?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Cookies, for those who still don't know, are very small files
that Web sites put in your computer so they can keep information
about you. For instance, when you sign up for an online account,
your user ID and password may be stored in a cookie. Other cookies
contain personal information and buying preferences for online
shopping sites that you have used.
</P>
<P>
   If you browse with Internet Explorer, your cookies are stored in
the Cookies folder inside the Windows folder. With Netscape,
cookies are in a file called Cookies.txt. You can go into those
files and delete cookies without causing damage to your system, but
it's a good idea to leave the ones associated with automatic
sign-ons. (You should be able to spot them because cookies
generally carry their sender's identity.)
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: Want to take a look at several Word documents
without actually having to open them up in Word? Go to Windows
Explorer (right-click the Start button and choose Explore) and open
the My Documents folder. Then simply right-click any Word file and
choose Quick View. The document will open instantly in a nifty
little window, complete with special formatting. If you then want
to edit the document, click the Word icon on the window's toolbar.

JURY BEGINS DELIBERATIONS IN MATURINO RESENDIZ CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A jury deliberated eight hours before being
sequestered Wednesday in the capital murder trial of Angel Maturino
Resendiz, who has admitted to killing nine people in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will resume deliberations Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, charged with killing Dr. Claudia Benton
on Dec. 17, 1998, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity,
claiming ``evil forces'' had drawn him to her West University home
near Houston and told him it was God's will that he kill her.
</P>
<P>
   While deliberating, the panel asked to review all the physical
evidence, including letters Maturino Resendiz wrote after he was
arrested. They were given the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   They also asked to review all the testimony from an FBI
profiler, but Harmon said they could be given only the specific
part that is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment phase will begin after the verdict is reached,
with at least two days of testimony expected. Maturino Resendiz
could be sentenced to death by injection or get life in prison with
no parole for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As proceedings began Wednesday, Maturino Resendiz, who has shown
no emotion through most of the trial, turned to his mother in the
audience and smiled thinly.
</P>
<P>
   The defense conceded the drifter from Mexico had killed all nine
people, but argued that he had been driven by paranoid
schizophrenia and a delusion that he is ``half angel, half man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant's mind is twisted,'' defense attorney Allen
Tanner told jurors. ``He is a sick, sick man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two defense experts, a psychiatrist and a psychologist,
diagnosed schizophrenia after Maturino Resendiz surrendered to a
Texas Ranger at the Mexican border in July.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Maturino Resendiz testified that her newborn son landed
on his head when she stood up during delivery. As a child, she
said, his head was also damaged in a fight and in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up without a father, the defense said. He also suffered
brain damage from years of drug abuse, mostly sniffing
industrial-strength glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what happened to Angel Resendiz that made him
turn out what he became,'' Tanner said. ``We don't know where the
hatred comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said it was during a prison stay in 1979 _ after Maturino
Resendiz was convicted of breaking into a man's home and beating
him _ that he began reading the Bible, came to believe he had a
special relationship with God and developed an intense hatred for
abortionists and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming more delusional, he began thinking of himself as an
``angel of wrath,'' able to cause floods, earthquakes and evade
police by becoming invisible, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he developed a sense for detecting evil and that drew him
to his victims, Tanner said. In Benton's case, he imagined he saw
pictures of fetuses on her computer and inferred that she was
experimenting on babies.
</P>
<P>
   In the crime scene photos, the computer screen displays only a
report that Benton, a pediatric geneticist, was working on.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz said he used a statue he found in the house to
bludgeon her because he thought she worshipped idols.
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist testified that Benton fought for her life while
being beaten and stabbed. She was raped as she lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   Before surrendering last summer, Tanner said, Maturino Resendiz
told his brother to turn him in because he ``couldn't be
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was sick,'' Tanner said. ``He knew what he was
doing was illegal ... but he was answering to a higher power. In
his mind he thought what he was doing was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But two prosecution experts said Maturino Resendiz suffers only
from depression, though he has personality disorders and some weird
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, a jail psychiatrist, found Maturino Resendiz showed
no signs of delusions until he was moved into the general jail
population. There, he was given anti-psychotic drugs, which he
still takes. The doctor said a paranoid schizophrenic's symptoms
would take much longer to control with drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing, prosecutor Lyn McClellan countered that Tanner
was simply playing on words with the argument ``that illegal is not
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, jurors can only find someone insane if they believe
that at the time of the crime the person suffered a severe mental
disease or defect that prevented him from knowing the actions were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use your common sense,'' McClellan said. ``Anti-social
behavior is not a mental disease. ... He was motivated by anger, by
power, by a desire for sex. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant does suffer from one delusion, and the delusion
he has is that he will be able to convince one of you he's
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan also reminded jurors that while imprisoned in Florida
in 1990, Maturino Resendiz wrote insanity arguments for other
inmates to use in trying to overturn their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   And, McClellan stressed, Maturino Resendiz didn't start killing
until after he had been sent to jail by the testimony of two
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned don't ever leave them alive because they can come
back and identify you,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. was the last to speak to
jurors. ``Please don't let this man deceive again,'' he implored
them. ``He's a cold-blooded killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes told the jury that many people have mental diseases but
don't turn to crime, and that insanity is a legal term, not a
medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Virginia,'' he said, ``there are mean people in this
world who aren't crazy.''

 SCOUR EXPANDS NAPSTER'S CONCEPT BEYOND SWAPPING MUSIC  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster's huge underground success has unleashed
the maverick concept of creating a shared online library of free
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new program called Scour Exchange takes the Napster
concept and extends it to photos, videos and feature-length films.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to downloading hits by Metallica and Dr. Dre,
both of whom have sued Napster, Scour Exchange will give users
access to bootlegged versions of recent movies like ``American
Beauty'' and ``Romeo Must Die.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scour ( &LR; www.scour.com &LR; ), the Beverly Hills, Calif., company
that produced Scour Exchange, is trying to steer clear of digital
pirates and does offer a large array of legally licensed
downloadable music, music videos, movie trailers and photos.
</P>
<P>
   The company is instead hoping to gain long-term commercial
success by landing legitimate licensing and syndication deals with
the same entertainment industry giants that consider San Mateo,
Calif.,'s Napster public enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Napster, Scour already has the backing of one of the
biggest names in the world of entertainment _ Hollywood super agent
and onetime top Disney executive Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to take an antagonistic approach with the
industry,'' said Dan Rodrigues, Scour's 24-year-old president and
co-founder. ``In the long term, we have to make it work for the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working really closely with the record labels, using
licensed content to showcase a lot of legitimate uses of this
technology,'' he said. ``What we're going to do is try to find a
model that makes all sides happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In just four weeks since its beta version was released in April,
the free Scour Exchange search program has been downloaded by about
500,000 people who are sharing about 1 million files, Rodrigues
said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Tuesday night, there were 7,150 Scour users logged
on sharing 2.77 terabytes worth of files. That's comparable to the
number of files Napster users have at their disposal at any one
time. While there are far more Napster users, Napster routes its
members through different servers, while Scour users have access to
the files of all Scour members who are logged on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Napster and Scour Exchange are similar because the programs
allow members to quickly search for downloadable files stored on
the hard drives of other members. The files can then be transferred
directly from computer to computer.
</P>
<P>
   Scour Exchange, though, can also search for other multimedia
files. During a test, a Chronicle reporter was able download and
watch the Jet Li flick ``Romeo Must Die'' converted into the
Windows Media Technologies format. The video was jumpy but
watchable, although the movie took about three hours to download
using a high-speed cable modem and ate up about 500 MB of hard disk
space.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodrigues said Scour is trying to discourage piracy, saying
the company is being ``more diligent'' about giving the boot to
Scour users who are offering files that infringe on copyright laws.
Scour has a ``three strikes'' policy designed to permanently ban
repeat offenders, although only a handful have been banned.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodrigues said Scour has rounded up partnerships with other
online music companies, such as MP3.com and EMusic.com, and
expanded its offerings to include Internet radio broadcasts ``so we
can be the one-stop aggregator of content.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company is courting record and film industry
executives to use Scour's search program and Web site as a
promotional tool and, eventually, a new method to distribute
licensed entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Scour recently scored a deal with Dimension Films, a division of
Miramax Films, to become the exclusive Internet distributor for the
promotional trailer to the upcoming thriller movie spoof ``Scary
Movie.'' More than 30,000 copies of the ``Scary Movie'' trailer
have been downloaded since late April.
</P>
<P>
   By Hollywood standards, the Dimension Films deal was small
potatoes, but it was a big deal for the small company once called
Scour.Net, which was founded in December 1997 by Rodrigues and four
other University of California at Los Angeles computer science
students.
</P>
<P>
   With the MP3 search engine they designed, the students moved
from the dorms to a small two-bedroom apartment near the campus. By
the end of 1998, the Scour.Net Web site was getting 1 million
unique visitors per month, and that traffic doubled in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the founders met Ovitz, the onetime president of
the Walt Disney Co., who was looking to make investments in
Internet companies through his venture capital firm the Yucaipa
Cos., which invested $4 million to gain a 51 percent stake in
Scour.
</P>
<P>
   Besides allowing Scour to move out of the apartment and into a
real office, Rodrigues said Ovitz is helping open doors in the
entertainment industry. ``He's talking to a lot of people for us,''
Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get entertainment companies to test the water,''
Rodrigues said. ``Napster has shown the viral power of sharing
entertainment. The next step is to transition to a model where
everybody has the incentive to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Scour is able to find that model is unclear. But a new
study by online research firm Webnoize showed 42 percent of college
students who use Napster would be willing to pay a $15 per month
subscription to use a fully sanctioned version of the program.
</P>
<P>
   And the survey showed students who spent $50 a month on music
were just as likely to use Napster as students who spent $10 a
month, said Ric Dube, an analyst for Webnoize.
</P>
<P>
   The data points to a potentially ripe market of music fans who
would pay for legal, downloadable music or other entertainment
through subscriptions or other means that have yet to be tried,
Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Scour is the sleeper company, the one that comes from
behind to lead the charge for file swapping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Malcolm Maclachlan of International Data Corp. was less
optimistic that the traditional record companies will embrace a
so-called ``legal Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't fit neatly into the traditional record industry way
of doing things,'' Maclachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues isn't expecting an immediate sea change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This revolution that's going on in entertainment is a very
empowering thing,'' Rodrigues said. But, he added, ``It's going to
be a long process. I don't think it's going to happen overnight.''

 E-MAIL SAYS `HELLO BUDDY _ READ THIS ADVERTISEMENT'  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advertisements lurk everywhere _ inside public
rest-room stalls and on ATM screens. Even motorists are shown
commercials while they're pumping gas.
</P>
<P>
   So why not turn each e-mail you send into a billboard?
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about the unsolicited spam that lands in your
e-mail box, promising that you can ``MAKEMONEYATHOME!!'' We're
talking about that message you just fired off to your mom thanking
her for the cookies she sent you. Using a new service offered by
several Web startups, you could have ended that note with a banner
ad suggesting that next time, mom tries Ghirardelli chocolate chips
from Cooking.com.
</P>
<P>
   These new companies, such as Denver's Epidemic and New York's
Favemail, are banking that people will turn relationships into
money-making opportunities by inserting ads _ full-color images
with links to Web pages _ into e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of online retailers, from OfficeMax.com to CDNow, have
joined in. But the practice raises concerns about ethics and online
etiquette, and begs the question: Just how much of your personal
life is for sale?
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, maybe the more important question is: What's
my cut? If you send that Cooking.com ad to your mom using Epidemic
and she ends up buying the chocolate chips (or anything else), you
would get 10 percent of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   This scheme is a new twist on the concept of affiliate
marketing, one of the cheapest and most popular ways for Internet
companies to get new customers. In regular affiliate or associate
programs, anyone with a Web page can make money by posting a banner
ad linking to an online retailer, say Amazon.com, which says it has
400,000 associate sites. Then if any of the Web site's visitors
clicks on the ad and ends up buying something at Amazon.com, the
page owner gets 5 percent of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   These marketing companies are seeking to harness people's
relationships to get a foot in the door of your e-mail box, so to
speak. As the world _ especially the online world _ becomes more
crowded with advertising, promotional e-mails have little chance of
being read without a friend's name attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research estimates that by 2004, marketers will be
sending consumers more than 200 billion e-mails a year. To be
noticed in that ocean of advertising, e-mail marketers have been
forced to get creative.
</P>
<P>
   And since legitimate online marketers say they would never send
e-mail without the recipient's prior consent (most e-tailers ask
for and receive permission when you register at their Web site),
using friends as spokespeople is one of the only acceptable ways a
company can e-mail a potential customer.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling Internet retailers have already been trying hard to
get customers to market to their acquaintances through ``draft a
friend'' programs. For example, online grocer Webvan is offering a
$15 coupon to any customer who recruits another customer. To make
the process easier, Webvan even writes a polite form letter that
the customer can forward to a friend. It starts out, ``(Your name)
has visited Webvan ... and has asked us to send this message to you
so that you can experience the benefits of Webvan yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell whether these companies will be a hit with
consumers because they are very new: Epidemic, Favemail and two
similar companies called Tomeo and SuperSig were all founded in
1999. But online advertisers like using ``word of mail'' promotions
like this because it's a cheap and effective way to acquire new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's always known word of mouth is the most powerful
form of advertising,'' said Jim Nail, a senior analyst with
Forrester Research. ``The endorsement of someone you know and
respect carries a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   And ideally, someone would send an ad or promotion for mountain
climbing gear only to fellow mountaineers _ giving the advertiser
access to just the kind of person it is trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   By attaching their ads to e-mail, Epidemic and Favemail are also
promoting their own companies. Their hope is that when someone gets
an e-mail with an ad in it, they will like the idea so much that
they will sign up to embed ads in their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of self-propagating promotion, called ``viral
marketing,'' was very successful for Hotmail, the free e-mail
provider that ends each message its users send with a single line
of text: ``Get Your Private, Free E-mail at
http://www.hotmail.com.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Epidemic's idea is just the grandchild of Hotmail, but
a flamboyant grandchild that's bound to cause much more commotion
if it becomes popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draft a friend'' programs are already controversial, and
e-mail-borne advertising is bound to be even more divisive. Home
furnishings chain Ikea withdrew such a program promoting the
opening of its Emeryville location after just a few days because
customers expressed concern that their friends would get stuck on
Ikea's mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern is that giving people incentives to spread a
commercial message by e-mail will lead to uninhibited spamming,
(sending unsolicited mail to people you don't know). Sending an
advertising-laden message to a list of 5,000 people is about as
easy as forwarding it to five close pals.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent spamming, most of the sites limit the number of
people one can recruit for credit. Webvan sets the limit at 20.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemic and its ilk insist that it's more than a money-making
ploy and that banner ads can serve as a vehicle for
self-expression, allowing people to proclaim to the world that they
truly loved reading ``Angela's Ashes,'' which just happens to be on
sale at Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sites also offer non-advertising images that can
be incorporated into e-mail, so people can advertise their hobby or
a favorite nonprofit organization. Tomeo, another e-mail banner ad
company, is so sure that people will use its ads for
self-expression that it doesn't even pay its users commissions.
Instead, the Israeli company lets users donate profits to charity
or offer friends a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Rushkoff, author of ``Coercion,'' a book about how
marketing has been woven into almost every aspect of life, said the
new e-mail advertising, like ``draft-a-friend'' programs, is just
another way that companies are changing their relationship with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Rushkoff said, consumers are encouraged to act as if
they work for a company and become personally involved in
advocating brands. It's a small step from wearing a big Nike swoosh
on your shirt to including a Nike ad in each e-mail you send,
Rushkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That people are now willing to brand their correspondence
means that they are willing to interact with that brand like they
never have before,'' Rushkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of e-mail abuse are divided on whether ad-bearing
e-mails are acceptable or just a Trojan-horse brand of spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any friend of mine who sends me advertising to make money, as
opposed to sending it out of a sincere belief that I was interested
in the subject matter, would become a former friend quickly and
find his mail blocked at my server,'' said Cliff Sharp of Chicago,
who helped found a group called the Forum for Responsible and
Ethical E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Crossland of Muncie, Ind., another spam enemy, said he would
only consider ads in e-mail a ``minor annoyance'' and not as bad as
ordinary spam.
</P>
<P>
   But is any commission worth risking alienating one's friends?
E-mail marketing expert Dan Janal likens the situation to
encountering a friend who is always trying to recruit you to join a
pyramid marketing scheme: ``You want to avoid that guy!'' Janal
laughed. ``I think people who see their friends as customers are
not going to have either.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Shea, author of ``Netiquette,'' a guide to online
manners, wrinkled her nose at the concept of turning one's address
book into a list of sales leads.
</P>
<P>
   While she allowed that if one's friends were into that kind of
thing, they might grant you permission to advertise to them, Shea
concluded, ``Sending personal mail with advertising in it is just
not good netiquette.''

LEITER, PLAYING THE ROLE OF ACE, MOVES TO 5-0 AS METS TOP ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter never quite fit as the New York Mets' ace
last season, and he seemed to know it. He had moments _ beating the
Yankees in a critical game in June, shutting out the Reds in
October to clinch a playoff berth _ but when the Mets acquired Mike
Hampton last winter, it relieved Leiter of a burden.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out this is the season in which the ace tag fits.
Hampton is pitching better lately, and he is unquestioned as the
Mets' No. 1 starter. But whenever Leiter has pitched, the Mets have
won, and they did it again Wednesday night by beating the Colorado
Rockies, 4-2, at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's confidence is soaring now. Through eight starts, he is
5-0 with a 3.24 earned run average. He was overpowering at times
Wednesday night, recording at least one strikeout in seven of his
eight innings. He allowed five hits and two runs, walking two with
nine strikeouts. John Franco pitched a scoreless ninth for his
second save.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's first eight starts were much different last season: he
had an 0-4 record and a 6.12 ERA. He had just been rewarded with a
four-year, $32 million contract, and he pressed, letting one bad
start affect his next outing and his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's something wrong with you physically, it's
between the ears,'' Leiter said last week, referring to last
season. ``Even though we get paid for what we do, players lose
confidence, your self-esteem drops, and before you know it, you're
playing accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said he could not remember much about
Leiter's struggles early last season, and he would not make a
comparison to his performance this year. But he did refer to
Leiter's mind-set in explaining his recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going out with confidence and throwing all of his
pitches,'' Valentine said before Wednesday night's game. ``He's
very relaxed out of the stretch as well as out of the windup.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has been especially effective this year pitching out of
the stretch. Coming into the game, he had allowed opponents only
seven hits in 47 at-bats with runners in scoring position, a .149
average.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter squelched a two-out rally in the second by getting Neifi
Perez to pop out with runners on first and second. But in the
third, the Rockies put together consecutive hits with men in
scoring position to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter swiped at the dirt on the mound after issuing a walk to
Brian Hunter with one out in that inning. Hunter does not walk
often but is dangerous when he gets on base. But it was the next
hitter, Mike Lansing, who stole second after reaching on a
fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing reached by grounding to first baseman Todd Zeile, who
fired wide of second base in an attempt to force Hunter. Shortstop
Rey Ordonez stretched to his right for the catch, falling to the
ground and bobbling it before securing it for the force. But there
was no time for a double play, and the next hitter, Jeff Cirillo,
looped a cutter into the left-field corner for a run-scoring
double.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rockies a 1-0 lead. They increased it to 2-0 one
batter later, when Jeffrey Hammonds lined a single to left. Lansing
scored from first when Benny Agbayani's throw bounced twice before
reaching catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, were having trouble converting scoring
chances off Colorado's Rolando Arrojo. In the third inning,
Agbayani, Ordonez and Joe McEwing all singled off Arrojo the
opposite way, to right field, producing the Mets' first run. Derek
Bell walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up the middle of the Mets' order, with a chance to
overcome the 2-1 deficit. But Edgardo Alfonzo struck, and after
getting ahead 3-0, Piazza popped to right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets left runners in scoring position in each of the next
four innings, but one big hit gave them the lead in the fifth. With
two out, Alfonzo walked and Piazza singled, bringing up Robin
Ventura, who had lined out to first two times.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura pulled it again this time, but he lifted the ball,
knocking it into the right-field corner. Two runs scored _
including Piazza from first, standing _ and the Mets had a 3-2 lead
and all the runs Leiter needed. &QL;

SOTHEBY'S CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION TOPS EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the elevator at Sotheby's after Wednesday night's sale of
contemporary art, two collectors were bemoaning all the things they
didn't buy last year. While prices just six months ago may have
seemed too expensive, compared to Wednesday's prices they were a
veritable bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on contemporary art of all periods, tastes and styles
was fast and furious, often exceeding the heady prices of the 1980s
art boom. The sale totaled $46 million, above its high estimate of
$41 million. Of the 70 works offered, only three failed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   How long until the bubble bursts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep asking ourselves that,'' said Diane Upright, a former
head of contemporary art at Christie's who is now a private dealer
in Manhattan. ``This sale showed both sides of the contemporary-art
market: it's not just young blood going after young art, but what
Alan Greenspan calls irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale set records for 17 artists, including modern masters
like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bruce Nauman.
</P>
<P>
   By far the star of the evening, however, was Rothko's ``Yellow
Over Purple'' (1956), one of the artist's abstract canvases. It was
being sold from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection, having
been on exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in
1980 and 1981. Sotheby's had offered the Neumann family a
guarantee, an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house
promises the seller regardless of the sale's outcome. After three
telephone bidders vied for it, the painting sold to an unidentified
collector for $14.3 million, sailing above its high estimate of $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale featured eight Warhols, of which three were in the top
10 selling works. Two of the eight were being sold by S. I.
Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best was Mr. Newhouse's ``Natalie Wood,'' a 1963
overlapping grid of images of the movie star. Three bidders tried
for it, and the painting finally sold for $2.7 million, nearly
twice its high estimate of $1.5 million, to an unidentified German
bidder standing in the back of the salesroom. A Warhol watercolor
also sold by Mr. Newhouse, ``One Dollar'' (1961), also nearly
doubled its high estimate, selling to an unidentified telephone
bidder for $489,750.
</P>
<P>
   Far more expensive were ``Mona Lisa-Four Times,'' a 1978
silkscreen that brought $830,700, just over its high estimate of
$800,000, and one of the artist's classic ``Flowers'' silkscreens.
This one, from 1964, was being sold by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg
of New Jersey. It went to an unidentified telephone bidder for
$830,750, far above its high estimate of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the
first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000, and 10 percent of
any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable artists like the 1980s art star Jeff Koons were also
represented. Mr. Koons' ``Yorkshire Terriers,'' a 1991 wood
sculpture, was expected to sell for $120,000 to $180,000; an
unidentified bidder bought it for $258,750. But the other work by
Mr. Koons offered did not fare so well. ``Wall Relief With Bird''
(1991), a sculpture of candy-colored flowers from the artist's
``Made in Heaven'' series, was expected to fetch $500,000 to
$700,000; Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer, bought it for
$610,750.

HOSPITAL, INSTITUTE JOIN TOGETHER FOR RESEARCH ON CHILDREN'S

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Children's Mercy Hospital and the Midwest
Research Institute on Wednesday announced sweeping plans to
collaborate on children's health research.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new partnership, called the Research Alliance for
Children's Health, or REACH, the institutions will share
facilities, bid jointly for government grants and private industry
contracts and provide new training opportunities for students and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   They also will work together on commercial development of drugs
and other medical products they discover.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have technology we'll never develop here, and we can
provide clinical experience they don't have,'' said Ralph Kauffman,
director of medical research at Children's Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration is the most recent step taken by Kansas City
area research institutions and civic leaders to make the region a
center for life-sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   The endeavor has been spurred by development of the richly
endowed Stowers Institute for Medical Research next to the
University of Missouri-Kansas City campus.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1944, Midwest Research conducts a broad range of
applied research on agriculture, energy and health for government
and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy has bolstered its research capabilities for the
past decade in such areas as genetics, immunology and pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital and the institute have collaborated in the past,
but on an ad hoc basis, said James Spigarelli, Midwest Research
president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, institute computer experts have been working with
nursing researchers at Children's Mercy to develop a computer
program to monitor quality of care at the hospital. And Children's
Mercy allergy researchers have used air-sampling equipment
developed by the institute to test air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The new partnership will expand these efforts, Spigarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most likely collaborations by the institute and
hospital will be projects to develop new drugs for children. The
institute would conduct the laboratory analysis of drugs and test
them on animals, while Children's Mercy would test them on
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical industry can look to Kansas City and say,
`Here's a one-stop shop,' &UR; '' said Children's Mercy President
Randall O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy and Midwest Research also plan joint training
programs, including post-doctoral fellowships for scientists and
internships for Children's Mercy residents and faculty seeking
technical training at the institute.

BASEBALL LOOKING INTO WRIGLEY FRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Several members of the Los Angeles Dodgers could be
suspended and/or fined when Major League Baseball concludes its
investigation into the team's Tuesday-night melee with Wrigley
Field fans.
</P>
<P>
   The fight began when catcher Chad Kreuter was allegedly struck
in the back of the head by a fan and had his hat taken. Kreuter and
other Dodgers then went into the stands, breaking the imaginary
barrier between the field and seating area.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest penalty could come to Kreuter since he was the
first to enter the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's black and white in one respect, in people are on the
right side of the fence or the wrong side of the fence,'' said
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations for
the office of the commissioner. ``If a uniformed person is in the
stands, there's a presumption of being on the wrong side.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alderson was asked if he agreed with the presumption, he
said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-field investigation is being handled by Frank Robinson,
vice president of on-field operations for baseball. Sources said
Kreuter told Robinson via telephone Wednesday he didn't plan on
going into the stands, but the fan who allegedly hit him and
grabbed his hat, tripped and fell after a few steps.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter also told Robinson he thought he would be able to detain
the fan until security arrived, but when he entered the stands
several other fans began hitting him.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also spoke with Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and Cubs
manager Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Robinson) wanted to know about the incident, what I saw, what
happened, how many players were involved,'' Baylor said. ``I just
told him I saw a lot of gray shirts in the stands. It got ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said a decision could be reached by the end of the
week, but the review of the incident will take time. Robinson spent
his day working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig nor
Robinson returned repeated phone calls to the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't encourage what happened, we're not happy it
happened,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I'm glad
the players rallied around each other. Even though it's
self-protection, I don't encourage it and we don't condone it. The
Dodgers don't condone what happened. You shouldn't go into the
stands, but I think for security purposes, Chad was going to go in
the stands to prevent the fan from running off after he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter, at the urging of the Dodgers, declined comment because
of possible litigation and suspensions stemming from the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody attacks you from behind, a lot of times you don't
think about it, you react,'' Johnson said. ``I don't condone
players going into the stands, or fans making contact with players
in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred with one out in the bottom of the ninth of
the Dodgers' 6-5 win against the Cubs on Tuesday. Many members of
the Dodgers, including manager Davey Johnson, said the mayhem began
when a fan allegedly hit Kreuter in the back of his head and
grabbed his hat.
</P>
<P>
   While Kreuter was in the stands, several members of the bullpen,
including coach Rick Dempsey, went in to try and bring Kreuter back
onto the field. At that point, the players on the field and
everyone in the dugout ran down to the bullpen, situated along the
right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   The melee lasted nine minutes. Malone expressed concern over how
long it took security personnel to reach the scene. Malone added
that the problem, he believed, came about because of intoxicated
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get to the real issue, it's public intoxication. If they
weren't drunk, this wouldn't have happened,'' Malone said. ``It's
not the Cubs, it's not Wrigley Field, it's an industry-wide
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGuire, Cubs executive vice president of business
operations, said the person who allegedly hit Kreuter and took his
hat was not caught. However, three fans residing in Illinois were
arrested for disorderly conduct. They are each scheduled to appear
in City Court June 19 and are subject to a $750 fine, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Police Department said the arrests were misdemeanor
violations and no counter complaints were made against Dodgers
players.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field security was intensified in the area near the
Dodgers' bullpen for Wednesday's game, including uniformed and
nonuniformed personnel, according to McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said the Cubs did their own investigation of the
incident but couldn't determine if Kreuter was hit before his hat
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we had quite a bit of personnel in the area, and had
we not had players in the stands, it certainly would have been
easier to gain control,'' McGuire said. ``If players go into the
stands, it gets raised to a different level. Then, anyone in the
crowd management business will tell you that it's a much, much more
difficult undertaking.''

LAKERS VS. PORTLAND MATCHUPS
</HEADLINE>
 
 ... corrects semifinals to finals (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS &QL; 
LAKERS vs. PORTLAND
</P>
<P>
   __ Centers: Portland's Arvydas Sabonis has a 7-foot-3, 290-pound
frame to bang against Shaquille O'Neal, and more importantly, he
has plenty of help. MVP O'Neal averaged just 20.5 points (9 below
his average) against Portland this season as he fought through
crowds of Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, Jermaine O'Neal and Brian
Grant. It's unlikely O'Neal will get loose for 37 points a night,
as he did for the first three games against Phoenix. Sabonis has
creaky knees but can get physical and has a nice outside jumper. He
averaged 10.8 points and 7.0 rebounds against the Lakers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forwards: As usual, this is an uphill battle for the Lakers.
Portland's Rasheed Wallace is younger, quicker and stronger than
the A.C. Green-Robert Horry tandem, and he averaged 17 points and
9.3 rebounds against them this season. Horry and Green's job will
be simply to slow him down and, in Horry's case, make some outside
shots to keep Wallace from doubling O'Neal. Glen Rice has held up
well defending Scottie Pippen (14.5 points vs. Lakers). Rice shot
just 33.3 percent and averaged 11.8 points against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guards: The Blazers' Damon Stoudamire is one of the speediest
playmaker-scorers in the league, and Kobe Bryant will have his
hands full _ and an oxygen tank standing by. But the Lakers can
also exploit the matchup when the 5-10 Stoudamire guards the 6-7
Bryant. After missing the first two games against Portland, Bryant
averaged a team-best 24.3 points and 55.6 percent shooting in the
final two meetings. Steve Smith scored 27 points in the Blazers'
Jan. 22 win at Staples, but he shot just 38.2 percent in the season
series. Ron Harper will probably have ex-teammate Pippen draped on
him to slow the Lakers offense.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: No one has a deeper, more experienced group than
Portland. Guard Greg Anthony and forward Detlef Schrempf are
veterans who could start for other teams. Forward Brian Grant
brings the kind ofrebounding and energy the Lakers sometimes lack.
And youngsters Bonzi Wells and Jermaine O'Neal are potential
budding stars. The Lakers will expect the usual from Robert Horry,
Brian Shaw and Rick Fox _ play tough defense, grab some rebounds,
get the ball to Shaq and Kobe and hit the open jumper now and then.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coach: Phil Jackson's steadiness has characterized the
Lakers' postseason, and his players have followed his lead. They
pushed past two losses to Sacramento to win in the first round,
then overcame a horribly embarrassing rout at the hands of Phoenix
to close out the Suns, with hardly a flinch from Jackson, the NBA's
all-time winningest coach. Mike Dunleavy coached the Blazers to the
league's second-best record (59-23), and after struggling through
March, Portland has regained a dominant look in the playoffs. A
footnote: Dunleavy coached the Lakers in their 1991 Finals loss to
Jackson's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   __ Edge: Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Overall: These teams split the regular-season series, and
each won on the other's home court. Every meeting has been a
defensive struggle _ neither team scored more than 100 points in
any game and theyaveraged 89 points each. The Lakers won the
biggest of the four meetings _ a 90-87 victory at the Rose Garden
on Feb. 29 that sent the Blazers into a tailspin and propelled the
Lakers to the league's best record. Portland's athleticism, youth
and depth will provide the Lakers their greatest test of the
season, but the Lakers should squeak by on the strength of Kobe,
Shaq and home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Prediction: Lakers, 4-3. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FRESH LEADERSHIP FOR NEW YORK SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 18:
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education made the only sensible call
Wednesday when it promoted Harold Levy from interim chancellor to
permanent chancellor. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had little choice but
to go along with the decision. With a majority of the board
supporting the interim chancellor, City Hall's appointees could not
have blocked the appointment. The mayor would have risked voter
disapproval and political embarrassment had they tried. Even so,
Wednesday's unanimous vote brings a welcome end to the uncertainty
and political infighting that have dominated the school system
since the former chancellor, Rudy Crew, was forced out by the mayor
in January.
</P>
<P>
   During his four months on the job, Levy has shown impressive
management and personnel skills, as well as imagination and energy.
Now he must apply those skills to the more difficult challenges
ahead. He must, for starters, ensure that the critical summer
session runs smoothly and upgrades the performance of thousands of
children in danger of failing. Even more important, he must make
certain that the schools they return to in the fall have
better-prepared teachers and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   The need for more-qualified teachers is particularly pressing in
low-performing schools, where the least experienced teachers are
being required to do the most difficult jobs of all. Levy will need
to negotiate a more flexible teachers' contract so that capable
teachers can be shifted where needed, and he should develop a bold
new certification program that will allow the system to recruit and
train talented teachers from the business and professional world.
</P>
<P>
   Other key tasks include holding principals and superintendents
accountable for their schools' performance, streamlining the
bloated bureaucracy at the Board of Education headquarters and
repairing the city's crumbling and sometimes dangerous school
buildings. Levy has gotten a jump on this last problem by sitting
as a trustee on the board of the School Construction Authority
instead of appointing a surrogate, as previous chancellors have
done. As the system gets better at building and repair, the case
for more money will be easier to make in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   If all these tasks are carried out expeditiously, the chancellor
will have a fighting chance to reach the most important goal of all
_ upgrading the performance of the system's students.

EDITORIAL: THE LAST BATTLE OF THE GULF WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 17:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Army this week brushed off new reports that American forces
needlessly attacked retreating Iraqi troops after a cease-fire was
declared in the Persian Gulf war. The accounts, contained in a New
Yorker article written by Seymour Hersh, cannot be so easily
dismissed. Though questions about the battle were raised as the war
ended in 1991, and subsequent Army investigations found no fault,
there is good reason for the Pentagon and Congress to revisit the
matter. Some of the officers most familiar with the American
assault offer detailed testimony that one of the country's most
decorated commanders, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, ordered a punishing and
unwarranted attack.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events described by Hersh is complex and filled
with the confusion and ambiguities that are common in war. There
are conflicting accounts about what happened and why, and
McCaffrey, now retired from the Army and serving as the Clinton
administration's top drug-control official, has vigorously defended
his actions. But none of that justifies the Army's cavalier
response to the New Yorker article. Few matters are more important
to a democracy than the conduct of its military forces, and any
credible accusation of reckless or unjustified killing by American
servicemen must be thoroughly investigated by an independent panel
of experts. The Army's internal inquiries are not an adequate
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The core issue raised by the Hersh piece is whether McCaffrey,
who was commander of the 24th Infantry Division, deliberately
provoked a fight with retreating Iraqi forces after the cease-fire
was in place by blocking a main escape route and then seizing on
the firing of several Iraqi weapons to launch a withering assault.
The ferocity of the American attack is not in question. American
ground and air units all but pulverized a Republican Guard tank
division on March 2, 1991, in one of the most devastating and
one-sided battles of the war.
</P>
<P>
   A number of McCaffrey's fellow commanders, including Lt. Col.
Patrick Lamar, who was the division's operations officer, told
Hersh that excessive firepower was used against a weakened and
retreating Iraqi force that did not seriously threaten the
Americans. They believe that the American assault was a clear and
willful violation of the cease-fire rules of engagement that had
been established by the Pentagon. McCaffrey maintains that he acted
properly to defend his troops after the Iraqi forces initiated
combat. He denies that he blocked their escape route in hopes of
forcing a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh examines other serious charges involving McCaffrey's
troops, including reports that they massacred a group of Iraqi
prisoners of war, but the evidence he cites here is not definitive.
The Army's investigations of all these matters, which cleared
McCaffrey and the division, should not be the last word. The
military services have a poor record of holding their own members
accountable for misconduct, especially top officers.
</P>
<P>
   As Walter Cronkite, the former CBS News anchorman, noted in a
letter to The Times earlier this week, the Pentagon's efforts to
restrict coverage of the war denied the American people an
immediate and full account of the battles American forces fought in
Kuwait and Iraq. More comprehensive coverage might long ago have
clarified whether McCaffrey's order to attack was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did not inquire deeply into the 24th Infantry
Division's actions when it approved promotions for McCaffrey after
the war or when it confirmed his appointment to the drug policy
post. Secretary of Defense William Cohen should appoint an
independent review panel. If he does not, the Senate or House
should conduct its own investigation. If McCaffrey acted
responsibly, he should welcome an unflinching examination of the
facts. &QL;

EDITORIAL: ALABAMA'S LONG SEARCH FOR JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 18:
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Southern prosecutors has shown laudable
persistence in reopening the investigations of Ku Klux Klansmen and
other white racists suspected of civil rights killings in the
1960s. In the past decade, Mississippi authorities secured
convictions in the murders of two of that state's black civil
rights pioneers, Medgar Evers and Vernon Dahmer. Wednesday, Doug
Jones, the U.S. attorney in Birmingham, Ala., and David Barber, the
local district attorney, revealed the murder indictments of two
former Klansmen in one of the era's most heinous crimes, the
Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls on Sept. 15,
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Without prejudging the cases, it seems clear that authorities
are armed with both determination and new information. As early as
1964, the indicted men, Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton Jr.,
were identified in FBI files as having helped a well-known
Birmingham racist, the late Robert ``Dynamite Bob'' Chambliss,
place the bomb at 16th Street Baptist Church in the predawn
darkness of a Sunday morning. Chambliss was finally convicted of
murder in 1977, but Alabama authorities felt their cases against
Cherry, Blanton and a third Klansman, now deceased, were not as
strong.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Jackson Clarion-Ledger, which has followed the
new prosecutions in Alabama and Mississippi, Cherry's former wife
and a granddaughter have now come forward to say they heard him
admit participation in the bombing. Testimony at the Chambliss
trial placed Blanton's car at the scene of the crime, but it is not
clear what additional grand jury testimony may have led to his
indictment. Both men have professed their innocence and attribute
their prominence in FBI files and other investigative records to
conspiracies, betrayals or overzealous prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, zeal in such investigations is warranted and was too
long in coming. In the 1960s, Gov. George Wallace of Alabama and
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, both motivated by hostility to the
civil rights movement, hampered efforts by state and federal
investigators to prosecute the 16th Street bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In securing the conviction of Chambliss 14 years after the
bombing, Alabama's attorney general at that time, Bill Baxley, set
the precedent for the reopening of dormant civil rights crimes by
Southern officials. In neighboring Mississippi, according to The
Clarion-Ledger, state authorities have reopened nine cases,
securing five murder convictions and one guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of prosecutions in Alabama represents an
example of state-federal cooperation that was often missing in the
1960s. Jones, the U.S. attorney, has been designated a special
assistant attorney general by the state of Alabama so he can
present the cases against Cherry, now 69, and Blanton, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Such prosecutions give vitality to the legal principle that
there is no statute of limitations on murder. As a matter of simple
justice, that principle is valuable in every case. But it is
especially important when killing is used as an instrument of
political or racial oppression or is aimed at innocents like Denise
McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carole Robertson, the
children who died in the rubble of 16th Street Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   In numbers of people killed at a single stroke, the 16th Street
bombing was the most heinous crime of the civil rights era. It was
a crime that helped bring white Alabama to what Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. called an accord with its conscience. Now, the fact that a
legal resolution is still being pursued after so many years holds
the promise of a new definition for Southern justice.

CONFERENCE DISCUSSES PROS AND CONS OF IMPROVING CHINA'S TRADE
STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ With 1.3 billion consumers who have a
growing appetite for more and better things, China makes any
capitalistic trader weak in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   But as the world's largest communist country and one that is
known for putting dissidents in jail, China is an unsavory customer
to many in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. House of Representatives set to vote next week on
granting China permanent normal trading relations, the subject of
free trade with that country was at the center of Wednesday's World
Trade Week conference, sponsored by the International Trade Club of
Greater Kansas City. The event was at the Ritz Charles conference
center in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Granting normal trade relations to China would help American
businesses make money there, said Michael Copps, assistant
secretary of commerce for trade development. Copps was the
conference's keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``On its merits, it isn't even a close call,'' Copps said.
``Basically, we give up nothing, since our market has long been the
most open in the world for China, and in return, we get access to
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations is among
the most important economic issues facing Congress this year. But
the outcome is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, environmentalists and human rights activists say China is
a country without environmental scruples that treats many of its
citizens cruelly and pays its factory workers about 20 cents an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are numerous instances of environmental activists being
put in jail there,'' said Craig Volland, who also spoke Wednesday.
Volland is with the Kansas chapter of the Sierra Club, which
opposes granting China permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an article of faith among environmentalists that if you
can't speak out, you can't protect the environment of any
country,'' Volland said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been deciding each year whether to treat China as
it treats Japan, Great Britain and other trading partners. That
annual debate is seen by some as an important public relations
hammer on China to do better about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But China is expected to be accepted into the World Trade
Organization later this year whether or not the United States
grants it permanent normal trading relations. As a member of that
trade organization, it must agree to open its markets to countries
that do the same. If the United States doesn't give China permanent
normal trading status, some argue, other countries will get to
China's markets ahead of the United States and get better deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential here to access the world's most populous nation
is incredible,'' said Harry Cleberg, president and chief executive
of Farmland Industries Inc., the country's largest farmer-owned
cooperative. The Kansas City cooperative estimates that the United
States could sell by the year 2005 an additional $1.6 billion worth
of grain to China under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our choice is if we want to enjoy these favorable terms or if
we want to hand this market over to our competitors,'' Cleberg said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, tariffs that Beijing places on
farm products would decline from an average of 31 percent to 14
percent under a permanent trade agreement. Average tariffs on
industrial goods would fall from 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Ancel, with the Institute for Labor Studies at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, disagrees with the argument
that the China market might slip through U.S. fingers. Ancel, who
spoke Wednesday, said that is an argument made by big business,
whose main motivation is to open factories in China and exploit its
cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, big business is trying to harness the power of the
U.S. government to help it edge out other countries and get in on
the ground floor of privatization in China,'' Ancel said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also act as if this will be a one-way street, that
the United States will be only selling things to the Chinese, Ancel
said. But America currently buys a lot more products from China
than it sells.
</P>
<P>
   The United States bought $4.6 billion more in goods from China
than it sold to it in the first two months of this year, the
Commerce Department's most recent figures show.
</P>
<P>
   The department's statistics show that exports to China from
companies in the Kansas City area and throughout Kansas and
Missouri haven't amounted to much in recent years, making up less
than 2 percent of total exports for each of those areas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the point, proponents say. If China is a member
of the World Trade Organization and has normal trading status,
companies and farmers from this area could sell a lot more to
China, whose middle class is growing at a phenomenal rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge potential market, and if the tariffs get reduced,
it makes us more competitive,'' said Christopher Pirotte, China
sales director for Kansas City-based BHA Group, makers of pollution
control equipment. BHA, which had sales last year of $155.7
million, manufacturers one product in China but imports its other
products for sale there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with China and not against it, a lot more can be
accomplished,'' said Pirotte, who lived in China for two years.
``You can't tell China what to do; you just can't. It has a lot of
pride.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A deflated Latrell Sprewell slowly left the floor like a
wind-up toy on its last tick. He was out of energy, out of time.
For most of the night, Sprewell propped up his team as his co-star
on the court, Allan Houston, continually gave in to the junkyard
defense of Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with just under three minutes left in Wednesday night's
Game 5, Houston and the New York Knicks gave into Majerle's
offense. Drifting out on the perimeter, Majerle hit two 3-pointers
in 15 seconds. Then Bruce Bowen added another with 35 seconds left
to give the Miami Heat a pivotal 87-81 victory Thursday night at
American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The stunned Knicks are now one game from elimination, trailing
in this best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal series by 3-2.
Sprewell led the Knicks with 24 points, while Patrick Ewing added
16 and Houston came up with 12 on a 4-for-10 shooting effort. The
Heat were led by Jamal Mashburn's 21 points, while Alonzo Mourning
scored 18 and Majerle added 16. Once again, the Knicks were
outrebounded by the Heat (42-32).
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will have a chance to even the series when Game 6 is
played at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. Thursday night,
the Knicks dug their hole early and never came back. The Knicks
were down, 64-55, with 1 minute 54 seconds left in the third
quarter. After scraping up a few points, they got a reprieve from
their nuisance in the paint when Mourning picked up his fifth foul
with 7:36 left. The Heat was ahead, 66-62, but vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   With Mourning on the sideline, the Knicks took an opportunity to
go inside without his intimidating presence to stop them. Quickly,
Camby scored on a layin. Then, when Camby lost the ball on another
drive, Johnson recovered the ball and scored on a layin to tie the
score, 66-66, with 6:44 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat leaned on the courage of the rookie Anthony Carter.
He hit a key jumper in the panicked moments before the shot-clock
expired. Off a turnover by Sprewell, Carter then led a fast break
that ended up with Majerle scoring on a layup and drawing a foul
with 5:16 left. Majerle converted the 3-point play to put the Heat
up, 73-68. Majerle then answered Houston's first field goal of the
second half by drifting free of him for a 3-pointer with 2:27 on
the clock to give his team a 77-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the cool-headed Ward came right back with another three
before Majerle trumped that with his own three. After a layup by
Ewing, after Mourning picked his sixth foul, Houston went to the
free-throw line. He hit both with 56.2 seconds on the clock. And
the Knicks trailed, 80-77. But off the penetration of Majerle,
Bowen ended up open for a 3-pointer with 35.2 seconds left _ a shot
that put the Knicks away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The nervous two days leading up to Game 5 were filled with
daunting numbers for any team that dared let Thursday night's game
slip away. In a seven-game series, the winner of Game 5 has gone on
to eliminate its opponent 84 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a high number,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the
game. ``But you know what? Whoever wins tonight, they're in great
position, but, obviously it's not over. Usually, Game 5s are at the
home of the team that has the better record. If we win, I don't
think they will worry about the other 16 percent. I remember in
1995 we had Indiana on our floor for a Game 7. And the home team
had won 20-something straight Game 7s at home.'' The Knicks lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was mainly concerned with another statistic. Above the
Knicks' shooting problems against the Heat, beyond their execution
issues down the stretch, Van Gundy was worried about rebounding.
That fear was justified in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   As the aggressors, the Knicks took a 14-4 lead on Sprewell's
energy. But before long, the awkward play of Camby, the team's
inability to grab a loose ball and discord between teammates on the
court caught up to them. After scoring just 13 points in the second
quarter, while allowing the Heat to shoot 52.9 percent, the Knicks
found themselves down, 41-35, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter didn't unfold much better. Tim Hardaway shook
off his 1-for-3 start, ignored the pain in his foot and began to
drive on the Knicks for points and hit the open man for easy
scores. With five minutes left in the third quarter, Hardaway
caught Sprewell napping as he snapped a bullet pass to an open
Majerle in the paint for a layup to give the Heat a 59-53 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, locked in a furious one-on-one battle with Mashburn
all night, recovered with an audacious play three minutes later.
Mashburn was dribbling at the top of the arc when Sprewell flicked
the ball away and darted in for a menacing two-handed dunk. But
that didn't deter the Heat as Miami took its biggest lead of the
game, 64-55, as Hardaway blew by Houston with a crossover for a
layin with 1:55 left in the third. But the unflustered Knicks
managed a 5-0 run to close the third quarter and cut the Heat lead
to 64-60.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the fourth quarter, Sprewell had 22 points, while Ewing
added 13. But no other Knick was in double figures. Majerle had a
clamp on Houston (nine points), and Ward (nine points) was kept
under wraps by a much more attentive Heat defense. But even with
the Knicks' scoring problems, they were still in the game, still
within reach of a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Knicks' first-half spiral was related to
Camby's start. He entered the game with four minutes left in the
first quarter, and his team ahead, 19-10, when the bottom began to
fall out. Camby was eaten alive by Mourning every time he drove to
the basket, and he was beaten to rebounds by Clarence Weatherspoon.
He was driven around by Weatherspoon and also picked up two quick
fouls. At the end of his miserable 11 first-half minutes on the
floor, Camby was 0 for 5 and had three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all Camby's fault, though. The calm that Ward brought
to the floor in the first quarter was lost once Childs came into
the game two minutes into the second quarter. The Knicks were
clinging to a 26-23 lead but were quickly overtaken with 6:15 left
in the half when Carter broke free of Childs for a jumper to give
the Heat a 29-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ewing and Childs started to quarrel on the court. With
three minutes left in the first half, Childs called for Ewing to
set a pick for him. With his hands ready to receive a pass in the
post, Ewing refused. Childs drove inside anyway and missed a
runner.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the first sign of chemistry problems. Sprewell was
visibly upset when he was taken out of the game with 9:30 left in
the second quarter. At that point, he was 6 for 10 with 13 points.
He was in a groove. When he returned three minutes later, he wasn't
the same. He was flustered by a shot block from Mourning and missed
his last three shots of the half.

LEITER DETERMINED TO USE HIS FAME FOR GOOD WHILE HE CAN
</HEADLINE>
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter felt homesick Sunday night. Missed his
wife, missed his daughters, missed his 1-month-old son, so he
jumped on the last flight to Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to be a major league ballplayer who essentially does
not have to worry about the staggering inequities of last-minute
airline fares. Blessed with unimagined income, Leiter is also
setting a high standard for athletes with his hands-on involvement
in charity work, while trying to keep a perspective at home. He
arrived in time for a major milepost in the life of his 5-year-old
daughter, Lindsay, who had lost her first tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to be the Tooth Fairy,'' Leiter reported. ``I was
stunned to learn that the going rate is $5 these days. We persuaded
her this is only for the first one, then it goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck with that theory. With three young children, Leiter
figures to be working out a reasonable scale for Tooth Fairy
activities, but he has vowed that he will be there for much of it.
A 34-year-old left-hander, Leiter has a perfect 5-0 won-lost record
for the New York Mets after pitching eight innings in Wednesday
night's 4-2 victory over Colorado. He is coping with pitching in
New York while his family is living in Florida for much of the
year, but he does not want this to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got two years left on my contract after this year,''
Leiter said the other day. ``I still love the competition, and this
is not about money, but I'm not going to miss the early years of my
kids' lives. I'm just not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is tired of getting messages on his answering machine up
North from his daughters, saying they miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see guys playing as long as they can, while their kids are
teenagers,'' he said. ``I want my kids to know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only his own children will feel the impact of Al Leiter,
however. He and his wife, Lori, are actively working to help other
children through the Leiters Landing Foundation, which they began
in 1996, when he pitched for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable figures are the $1 million they pledged over
his four-year contract beginning in 1998, and the 2,500 children
who have watched Mets games. But Leiter is not a passive spectator
of the charity, like many public figures who write a check. He is
an activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask organizations to write grant proposals and we look them
over,'' Leiter said. ``It is such a good feeling when you do it
yourself. It seems things run much more smoothly. We had one
employee, but we found we could do it ourselves, with my wife and a
friend of ours, Val Chevalier, taking care of the smallest
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter recently organized and financed a project at City Meals
on Wheels that got 15 high school students doing volunteer work
delivering meals to homebound elderly people. There is a mentoring
program in Harlem, a ball field in New Jersey, a computer project
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his celebrity status to bring in other benefactors,
including Knight Securities, Ultimate Software, Twin Labs, Coverall
America and Park Avenue Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts have not gone unnoticed. Recently the Dime Savings
Bank of New York organized a program called Hometown Heroes, giving
six grants of $50,000 each to be donated in the name of six New
York athletes personally involved in community work _ Adam Graves
of the Rangers, Marcus Camby of the Knicks, Kenny Jonsson of the
Islanders, Michael Strahan of the Giants, Jayson Williams of the
Nets and Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Leiter said. ``We can have tremendous impact.
Charles Barkley said we are not role models, that parents and other
adults are role models, and I understand what he means, but I would
tell Charles: `You know, people are looking at you. While you're
here, do something. When we're back home, people are not going to
care about us. We're going to be regular people again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter looks forward to being a regular person. ``It was so
great being home,'' he said. ``My 3-year-old was afraid of the
Tooth Fairy, so she had to sleep in our room. My 5-year-old was so
excited with the money. We went out on a date Monday; she bought
headbands with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows full well that regular people don't excite
corporations, don't attract galleries at charity golf events, don't
make public-service announcements. Al Leiter is doing all that,
rather than merely brood over his homesickness, which can only
occasionally be alleviated by a quick dash to the departure gate.  &QL;

VODAFONE TO SELL CEGETEL STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone AirTouch PLC, the world's largest wireless
telephone operator, will sell its 15 percent stake in the French
telecommunications operator Cegetel to its French partner, Vivendi,
the companies announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's sale of the stake, which Vodafone saw as having
little strategic value, gives Vivendi majority control of Cegetel,
which controls the French wireless operator SFR.
</P>
<P>
   The sale does not mean Vodafone and Vivendi are reducing their
friendly relationship. The closeness of that relationship became a
critical reason for Vodafone's success in buying Mannesmann AG, the
German telecommunications conglomerate, in a record hostile
takeover earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Vodafone and Vivendi Wednesday unveiled a new
joint venture called Vizzavi, a European Internet portal accessible
by mobile telephones, desktop computers and handheld devices. They
hope to sell Vizzavi shares to the public within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone and Vivendi became bedfellows in late January during
Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann. &UR;  &LR; The German company had been
negotiating with Vivendi in hopes of thwarting Vodafone's bid, but
at the last minute, Vivendi agreed to a surprise alliance with
Vodafone, effectively guaranteeing Vodafone's successful takeover
of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Vodafone's alliance with Vivendi announced then,
Vodafone had said it would sell Vivendi half of Mannesmann's 15
percent stake in Cegetel if Vodafone acquired the German
conglomerate. On Wednesday, Vodafone said it would sell the entire
Cegetel stake to Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi already owns a 44 percent stake in Cegetel; Wednesday's
deal would bring that stake to 59 percent. Cegetel is also partly
owned by British Telecommunications, which holds a 26 percent stake
and SBC Communications, which has 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane-Marie Messier, chairman of Vivendi, said said he would
consider reselling the 15 percent stake purchased from Vodafone to
the other partners or outside suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even without its stake in Cegetel, Vodafone still has a direct
investment stake in SFR.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Paris, Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief
executive and Messier said they would launch the Vizzavi site this
summer across Europe in multiple languages. In a separate,
unrelated announcement, Vivendi said it would drop out of the
auction for the next generation cellular license in Germany.

RALLY IN NINTH WINS FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was a mind-numbing, dizzying 19 or so hours for the
Los Angeles Dodgers, but a few clutch hits and a pitiful display by
the wretched Chicago Cubs bullpen certainly made for smiles in the
visiting clubhouse at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put distance between themselves and the wild events of
Tuesday night, when players went into the stands and fought with
fans, the Dodgers kept Wednesday's excitement contained to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen's leadoff pinch-hit homer triggered a three-run
ninth inning as the Dodgers rallied to beat the Cubs 8-6 before a
docile crowd of 30,235, sending Chicago to its third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   And given the circus-like atmosphere that surrounded the Dodgers
since the fight, Gary Sheffield had no problem placing the
importance of their fourth win in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we came in today we were going to see a lot of
chaos,'' Sheffield said. ``We all talked about it. With everything
that went on out there, we just had to deal with it. We couldn't
let anything distract from doing what we came to do, play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of felt like our hands would be full today and we
still got the job done. It was an important win; probably the
biggest game of the year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros had the game-winning hit, a two-out single to center
to score Shawn Green. Adrian Beltre added an RBI single to left to
score Sheffield and give the Dodgers a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills (2-1) threw one pitch for his second victory in as
many days, and Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, apparently past his shaky
outings of last week, recorded his 10th save with a perfect ninth
inning, which is something the Cubs long for.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs closer Rick Aguilera continued his horrid stretch by
blowing his fourth save in 10 opportunities. He's allowed 10 runs
in his last 5 innings for a bullpen whose ERA actually dropped to
7.45 thanks to solid pitching in relief of Scott Downs. Or, at
least until Aguilera entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen worked the count full before driving a pitch into the
right-field bleachers. It was his second pinch-hit homer of the
season and eighth of his career. But more important, it brought
life back to a Dodgers lineup that hadn't sniffed a scoring chance
since getting five runs in the fourth, and it tied the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 3-2 and I was just trying to relax, and I got out there
a little bit and tried to put the ball in play,'' Hansen said.
``This team is really close. We've moved on (from the fight). We've
already forgot about it. It was a little harder, but we moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera retired Todd Hollandsworth and Mark Grudzielanek, but
Cubs manager Don Baylor opted to match Felix Heredia (1-1) against
Shawn Green, who walked. Sheffield also walked before Karros, and
Beltre followed with a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good ballclub, which is evident (Sunday) when we're
down a touchdown with five outs recorded and come back and make a
game of it,'' Karros said. ``Hansen, he's been awesome for us. He's
one of the most valuable players.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the one downer for the Dodgers was right-hander Darren
Dreifort's breakdown after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander had allowed one run in the first three innings
and he looked much like the pitcher who shut out St. Louis on two
hits in his last start. But Dreifort did himself in on the bases,
though the reason for it can vary.
</P>
<P>
   With three runs already in and runners on first and third,
Dreifort doubled to right-center field to score Karros. When Sammy
Sosa bobbled the ball, Todd Hundley scored to give the Dodgers a
5-0 lead. Dreifort continued to third, sliding and jamming his
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort said he wasn't hurt, but he allowed six runs on six
hits in the next 1 innings before getting pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all coincidence,'' Dreifort said. ``I would rate (the
slide) a negative-4 on a scale of 1 to 10. It was horrible. It was
stupid even going to third. Three words for that: Stupid, stupid,
stupid.''

`PEGASUS' 3-5 CHOICE AT PIMLICO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Fusaichi Pegasus arrived at Pimlico Race Course with
royal fanfare Wednesday after a flight from Louisville, where he
won the Kentucky Derby a week and a half ago and put himself in
position to become the 12th horse in racing history to win the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, the star of the 3-year-old class, was made the
3-5 favorite to win the Preakness Stakes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The final test in the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, is June
10. His chances were not particularly affected, for better or for
worse, at the draw for post positions Wednesday. He received slot
No. 7 in the field of eight starters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the draw gave none of the starters much cause for
either joy or anxiety. Hugh Hefner, a long shot at 20-1, drew the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   The speed horse Hal's Hope drew the outside and was also listed
at 20-1. Red Bullet, who did not run in the Derby, drew the No. 4
gate and was made the second choice at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, eighth in the 19-horse Derby, drew the No. 6 slot
and was made the third choice at 8-1. High Yield, 15th in the Derby
but still carrying the flag for D. Wayne Lukas, will start from the
fifth slot at 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very straightforward,'' said Neil Drysdale, the
English trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus. ``It's a quarter of a mile to
the first turn. Eight horses. I don't think the draw is that
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who trains Captain Steve, quipped: ``I'd feel
better if Fusaichi Pegasus were to break from behind the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has won the Preakness five times, said he was still
mystified by High Yield's flat performance in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The horse had won the Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Blue
Grass Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went over for the Derby, I was convinced he was the
best horse,'' Lukas said. ``I don't know what happened. But he's
been training beautifully at Pimlico, he likes the track, and we're
expecting him to run a big race.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was unloaded from his horse van by Drysdale,
who bedded him down in Stall 20 of Barn 7 near the five-eighths
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale elected to stable him across the track from the
Preakness Barn, where the rest of the eight colts will be housed
for the 125th running of the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer decided that his star, who has a balky disposition,
would find more privacy on the backstretch than at the Preakness
Barn with its clamor of news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good flight,'' Drysdale said. ``He handled it
very well. We expect to gallop him each morning up to the
Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus led the midweek migration with a two-hour
flight to Pimlico from Churchill Downs, and was promptly surrounded
by the type of tumult that his trainer had been trying to avoid. He
was met by about 80 people from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived on a flight of 14 horses, but only two others,
Captain Steve and Snuck In, were headed for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hugh Hefner arrived from the West Coast at 9
o'clock Wednesday morning after an overnight cargo flight from Los
Angeles. He was greeted by an entourage of two: his owner, Ed
Nahem, and his trainer, Marty Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cargo plane stopped in Dayton and had a layover for about
an hour,'' Jones said, ``but that's pretty good when you hear
stories of planes sitting on the ground for 10 hours. I'm tired,
but he seems fine. Better the trainer is tired than the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet, who ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood
Memorial last month, took life easy Wednesday while awaiting his
old nemesis. He galloped two miles, then drew praise from his
trainer, Joe Orseno, who said he had handled the Pimlico track
well.
</P>
<P>
   He won a reward of sorts by getting the first choice in the
selection process, a two-tiered gimmick for adding suspense to the
television program on which the draw was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet will also gain the services of Jerry Bailey, the
country's premier jockey, who replaced Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   As for post position, Orseno said: ``I'm not too concerned with
only an eight-horse field and the long run to the first turn. It's
different than when there was 12 in the Wood and a short run to the
turn. He drew the 2-hole, and the horses outside were dropping down
in there. Solis gunned him, and he was up there dueling for the
lead. That was the last thing I wanted to see, but he still ran a
game race.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth and last Preakness horse to arrive at Pimlico will be
Impeachment, third in the Kentucky Derby and third in the Arkansas
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   His trainer, Todd Pletcher, said the colt would board a van at
Belmont Park at 4:30 in the morning and should join the Preakness
parade about 9 o'clock. He will start the race from the No. 3 gate
and will share third place in the betting with Captain Steve at
8-1.

HERNANDEZ TO PLAY SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>

By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ With new Galaxy standout Luis Hernandez arriving
Friday in Los Angeles, Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said Hernandez will
play in Saturday's match against MLS champion D.C. United at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the biggest foreign acquisition in MLS history,
agreed Tuesday to a three-year contract. As long as he passes his
physical, he will debut in his No. 15 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll play,'' Schmid said. ``I don't know for how many
minutes, it depends on how he feels. He's just come off a season,
so he's fit, but we've got to make sure he doesn't have an injury
or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy equipment manager Raul Vargas teased former Galaxy coach
Lothar Osiander, now coach of the Earthquakes. Vargas hung
Hernandez's jersey in the Galaxy's dressing room in San Jose,
explaining to Osiander that Hernandez surprised everyone by showing
up Wednesday morning for his physical and that he was ready to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he believed me for a second,'' Vargas said. ``I was
just having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Osiander was happy Hernandez delayed his debut until Saturday.
He also said the Galaxy shouldn't complain for losing three players
to acquire Hernandez. L.A. parted with Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino
and Roy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel sorry because they want it all and sometimes you
can't have it all,'' Osiander said. ``I'd trade those players they
traded for Hernandez anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will be introduced Friday at a Rose Bowl press
conference. The Galaxy has averaged an MLS-best 18,987 at the Rose
Bowl this season, but Galaxy officials expect 40,000 to 50,000 for
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slow start: San Jose striker Khodadad Azizi has been a huge
disappointment since being allocated to San Jose in March. The
Iranian forward, who looked wonderful during the 1998 World Cup in
France, has only one assist and no goals in six appearances for the
Earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   He has already been suspended three games and fined $7,500 for
shoving an MLS referee. Azizi has looked like a statue at times,
rarely showing consistent effort. The Galaxy had a chance to pursue
Azizi in March, but Schmid opted to pass to wait for a Mexican
player. Of course, it paid off when the Galaxy acquired Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably good he didn't come here,'' said Schmid, who
took some heat for passing on Azizi at the time. ``There is a huge
Iranian community in Southern and Northern California, so he helps
with attendance up here,'' Schmid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think our Mexican-American community is still the
biggest community we have. If we would have taken a player like
Azizi, it would have prevented us from getting Hernandez. Hernandez
is a much bigger bang in our community, so in the end we made the
right decision.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Nearly 37 years after a bombing that
horrified the nation, the authorities here have charged two
longtime suspects with murder in the deaths of four black girls in
the explosion at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, both of whom were
affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and have been considered suspects
for decades in the 1963 bombing, turned themselves in on Wednesday
morning after being indicted by a state grand jury on Tuesday. They
are being held in the Jefferson County jail here without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has ever been tried in the case,
and that was not until 1977, 14 years after the bombing. He was
convicted of murder, sentenced to life and died in prison in 1985.
Herman Cash, another man named as a suspect in early FBI case
files, died in 1994 without ever being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities reopened their investigation of the bombing
in 1996, encouraged by recent successful prosecutions of other
decades-old killings in civil rights cases. But they declined on
Wednesday to discuss the evidence they have gathered against
Blanton, 61, of Birmingham, and Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Several of Cherry's relatives, including an ex-wife and a
granddaughter, have said they told grand jurors that Cherry had
boasted of taking part in the bombing. But there is little
information about what additional new evidence, if any,
investigators may have found to implicate either Cherry or Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the evidence at a news conference on Wednesday, Doug
Jones, the U.S. attorney here, would only say, ``We expect the
evidence today to be a good bit different than it would have been
36 years ago.'' The evidence lent itself better to a prosecution
under state charges rather than federal ones, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Though some witnesses have died and there have been no reports
of new physical evidence, prosecutors said on Wednesday that they
were optimistic about their chances to win convictions. ``The
witnesses that we have, we believe, are sufficient to sustain the
charge,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were each charged with eight counts of murder
_ two counts for each of the four girls. The counts cover
intentional murder and ``universal malice'' because the bomb could
have killed many more people.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutions of Blanton and Cherry are the latest in a
series of dusty civil rights cases that have been reopened in
recent years as a new breed of Southern prosecutors have come to
power, as new witnesses have come forward to relieve guilty
consciences, and as changing times and demographics have made it
easier to impanel jurors willing to convict whites for the murders
of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable case was the 1994 conviction of Byron de la
Beckwith for the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, a prominent
organizer with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, in Mississippi. But there have been numerous others
in several states, and Mississippi officials are now delving again
into the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers _ Andrew
Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham bombing holds a special place in civil rights
history because of the randomness of its violence, the sacredness
of its target and the innocence of its victims. The four girls _
Denise McNair, 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and
Cynthia Wesley, all 14 _ died in a dressing room in the church
basement when the bomb detonated at 10:19 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 15,
1963. The bomb, apparently hidden under the church steps the night
before, blew the face of Jesus out of a stained glass window. The
bodies of the girls, dressed in white for an annual youth service,
were found beneath the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The church had been a center of civil rights activity in
Birmingham, a city that experienced some of the most violent
resistance of the day. Perhaps as much as any single act, the
bombing aroused public sentiment against Southern segregationists
and emboldened civil rights leaders to redouble their efforts. More
recently, the incident was the subject of Spike Lee's acclaimed
documentary, ``Four Little Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual circumstance, the cases brought on Wednesday will
be tried in the state courts here even though the FBI and federal
prosecutors have led the re-examination of the bombing. Jones said
that his ability to prosecute the case in the federal courts was
hindered by jurisdictional issues and by the statute of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to address comments made by one of Cherry's lawyers
in published reports that he had offered Cherry a light sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea on federal charges of interstate
transportation of dynamite. In cases where the dynamite causes a
death, that charge is not subject to the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statute of limitations for murder in Alabama. If the
case goes to trial, Jones and one of his assistants will be
deputized as state prosecutors and will join a deputy district
attorney in the courtroom.

 BIRMINGHAM, Ala.: the courtroom. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Barber, the district attorney here, said he would not
pursue the death penalty against Blanton and Cherry. He said they
would have to be tried under the death penalty statute that existed
in 1963, a statute that has since been changed because of
constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Blanton nor Cherry made any public comment on Wednesday
as they were brought to jail by their lawyers. Blanton arrived
first, at about 7:30 a.m., and Cherry showed up shortly before
noon, chauffeured by his lawyers in a silver Lexus bearing the
license tag: N OCENT.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both men said their clients would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has maintained his innocence for 37 years,'' said David S.
Luker, Blanton's attorney. ``You just wonder what information they
possess now that they didn't possess for the last 37 years.
People's memories don't get better with time, just worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Johnson, one of Cherry's lawyers, said he was trying to
soothe his client, who has suffered two heart attacks. ``We're
trying to keep him somewhat positive in his outlook,'' he said.
``He's an old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blanton, who has had made few comments about the bombing
over the years, Cherry has proclaimed his innocence in frequent
interviews and news conferences. While he has acknowledged his past
membership in the Klan, he has maintained he was at his Birmingham
home watching wrestling on television the night the bomb was
planted. A recent report in the Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss.,
disclosed that there were no wrestling programs on television in
Birmingham that night.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry has been in Alabama since May 4, when he was extradited
from Texas on charges that he sexually abused his former
stepdaughter when she was a child. That charge emerged as the
stepdaughter and other relatives were called to testify before a
grand jury about the bombing case.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine McNair, the only parent of a victim who could be reached
on Wednesday, said that she and her husband, a longtime county
commissioner here, had decided not to comment about the
indictments. ``It's an interesting day, I'll put it that way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Birmingham residents and others with stark memories of
the bombing clearly saw the day's events as an important step in
this city's efforts to salve its racial wounds. Several said they
were gratified to see the federal government leading the way,
particularly given The New York Times' disclosure two decades ago
that former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had shelved the
investigation in the 1960s despite the optimism of his subordinates
in Birmingham that it could be successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tragedy of just absolute monumental proportions,''
Jones said. ``It has scarred the city of Birmingham for almost 37
years. There needs to be some kind of closure, one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. John H. Cross, the pastor of 16th Street Baptist at the
time, recalled Sept. 15 of that year as ``a terrible day, a day
that never ended.'' Wednesday's indictments, he said, ``will help
to ease the temper of the city.''

SURPASSING THE LEGAL LIMIT OF RETRIBUTION  
 (FOR USE BY N.Y. TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - There were five vic tims, so prosecutors charged
Phillip Woods with five counts of endanger ment. He'd been driving
the vehicle when it rolled over, and one of the passengers broke
her neck and nearly died. Woods' blood-alcohol level was 0.114,
over the legal limit. He was told a guilty verdict at trial could
put him in prison for years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At his arraignment, Woods was ordered to avoid all contact with
the victims of his alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   This might be difficult, the defendant claimed, since the judge
was talking about his wife, mother, sister and two best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And none of them wanted him prosecuted,'' says Woods' grandfa
ther, Ernest Apostle, ``particularly the one who got hurt the most,
his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and his family had gone to a haunted house near Bartlett
Lake one evening last October. Woods had some beers at the house,
his grandfa ther says, but no one thought he was drunk when he got
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tricky road, and he made a mistake and the thing rolled
onto its roof,'' Apostle says. ``It wasn't assault. It was an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Not according to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office. A plea
bargain was offered. It would send Woods to jail for six months,
revoke his driver's license and label him a felon. Fearing prison,
Woods decided to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone were to ask any of us if Phillip should be
punished, we would tell them, `Yes,'' says Apostle, who spent 22
years in the U.S. Army. He believes in rules and taking responsi
bility. He's always thought of himself as a tough, law-and-order
kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Apostle adds, ``anyone who believes in discipline also
under stands you must temper it with common sense and proportion. I
don't feel that happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' family says the 33-year-old doesn't have a criminal
record. After high school, he spent four years in the Marines. He's
married with two children. He works.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only people harmed have already forgiven him,''
Apostle says. ``If he had been out with a bunch of hooligans, I'd
understand getting harsh. If he had a history of this, yes. But
that isn't the case. . . . Why ruin his life and further harm his
fam ily?''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods' plea bargain was presented to Maricopa County Supe
rior Court Judge Peter Reinstein, he refused to sign off on it. The
judge won't comment, but others involved say he felt the punishment
was too severe. Rather than modify the deal, prosecutors asked to
have the case reassigned to a new judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Attorney's Office also won't comment, since
the final outcome is pending. A spokes man would say only that the
policy is to enforce drunken-driving laws strictly.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what if Phillip Woods had hurt someone to whom he
wasn't related? And what if Woods were let off with probation, then
was in volved in another DUI in the future? Should the wishes of
the victims in this case win out, or is the system's job to
dispense justice with the entire community in mind?
</P>
<P>
   They're fair questions, but maybe not as important as the one
prosecu tors should be asking themselves:
</P>
<P>
   How is justice served when the people harmed most by your deci
sions are the victims themselves? &QL;
