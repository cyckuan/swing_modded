Fusion 3, MetroStars 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Diego Serna scored two goals,
including the game-winner in the 89th minute, as the Miami Fusion
beat the New York-New Jersey MetroStars 3-1 on Saturday in Major
League Soccer.
	   Miami midfielder Carlos Valderrama, playing for the first time
since being benched for three games by new coach Ivo Wortmann,
scored the Fusion's final goal in the 90th minute.
	   Miami (11-12, 23 points) has won five of six games to move into
fourth place in the Eastern Conference. Second-place New York-New
Jersey (13-11, 35 points) had won the three previous matches
against Miami.
	   Miami is 3-1 under Wortmann, who took over from Cacho Cordoba on
July 24. Valderrama's benching came after he skipped Wortmann's
first two practices without permission. The Colombian midfielder
also was fined dlrs 10,000 by Major League Soccer for the incident.
	   Serna gave the Fusion a 1-0 lead in the 66th minute when he
scored off a rebound. Mike Duhaney tied it in the 84th minute.
 &UR; Fire 2, Clash 1
	   In Chicago, Josh Wolff scored in the 80th minute as the Chicago
Fire beat the San Jose Clash 2-1 on Saturday night in Major League
Soccer to snap a five-game losing streak.
	   Wolff, an MLS rookie who led South Carolina to two NCAA
tournament appearances, took a 12-foot lob pass from Lubos Kubik
and rolled the ball past goalkeeper David Kramer.
	   San Jose's Clash's Ronald Cerritos opened the scoring in the
seventh minute, and Chicago's Roman Kosecki tied it in the 15th
minute.
	   Chicago improved to 14-10, and San Jose dropped to 9-15.
 &UR; Burn 1, Rapids 0
	   In Denver, Chad Deering's first goal of the season gave Dallas a
1-0 victory over Colorado in Major league Soccer Saturday night.
	   Dallas (12-12) moved into fourth place in the Western
Conference, but still trails third-place Colorado (11-13) by virtue
of more shootout victories, which are worth fewer points than a
victory in regulation.
	   Deering scored in the 57th minute with a shot from 25 yards that
deflected off the near post and past Rapids goalkeeper Marcus
Hahnemann. Richard Farrer and Leonel Alvarez assisted.
	   Burn goalkeeper Mark Dodd made five saves for his fourth
shutout. He stopped a point-blank shot by Paul Bravo at the 89th
minute.

Bedford beats Thompson in the 50-meter freestyle final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Barbara Bedford spoiled Jenny
Thompson's bid for a 21st individual title and third title in the
U.S. Championships, winning the 50-meter freestyle final Saturday
night.
	   Bedford, who won the 100 backstroke Friday, finished in a
lifetime best of 25.64 seconds, just three-hundredths of a second
ahead of Thompson.
	   ``I've always been of the mindset that the 50 freestyle is a
controlled seizure,'' Bedford said. ``I had a lot of caffeine
before the race. I had three cups of coffee, so I was about 10
levels ahead of what I usually am and that's pretty high anyway.''
	   Bedford also had a lifetime best in the 100 backstroke on Friday
night.
	   ``It is really nice to do that, especially at my age,'' the
25-year-old said. ``Coming in, I knew that Amy (Van Dyken) was out
and the race was up for grabs. Jenny is an incredible competitor
and I certainly wasn't expecting to top her.''
	   Bill Pilczuk won the men's 50 freestyle in 22.62.
	   ``It was a slow here overall, but I wanted to get under 22.6,''
Pilczuk said.
	   Cristina Teuscher won her second title of the championships,
winning the 200 individual medley. Teuscher also won the 400
freestyle and was second in the 200 freestyle and 400 individual
medley earlier in the week.
	   Tom Wilkens won the men's 200 individual medley with a personal
best of 2:01.80.
	   ``To get my best time on the fourth day of the meet is great,''
said Wilkens, who also won the 200 breaststroke and was second in
the 400 individual medley earlier in the week.
	   Diana Munz swept the women's distance events, winning the 1,500
freestyle in 16:16.0 seconds, the fastest time in the world this
year.
	   Munz, a 16-year-old high school junior from Chagrin Falls, Ohio,
won the 800 freestyle earlier in the week. Brooke Bennett, the 1996
Olympic champion in the 800 free, was second in both races.
	   ``She is still the Olympic and world champion and will always be
right there. There will always be that competition between us,''
Munz said.
	   Erik Vendt won the men's 1,500 freestyle in 15:10.50, the
fastest by an American since 1992.
	   ``I'm feeling great right now. Having such a great time takes
away the pain right now,'' the 17-year-old high school senior said.

Hingis continues dominance of Sanchez Vicario
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ A red-faced Martina Hingis
huffed and puffed chasing down Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's shots in a
hard-fought 6-4, 6-4 semifinal victory Saturday in the Acura
Classic.
	   Hingis blew a 3-0 lead in the first set, then rebounded from a
1-3 deficit in the second. The Swiss teen-ager broke Sanchez
Vicario twice in winning the match's final three games.
	   ``After I won the first set, I was kind of relaxed, but she was
always there,'' Hingis said. ``Against her, you can't give up any
points otherwise then she makes you run. I gave my lead up too
easy.''
	   No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport beat fourth-seeded Monica Seles
6-4, 6-2 in 59 minutes Saturday night to reach her third final in
as many weeks. Davenport won titles at Stanford and San Diego,
where she notched her first career victory over Seles, also in the
semifinals.
	   Davenport brings an 11-match winning streak into Sunday's final
at Manhattan Country Club.
	   Hingis, the world's top-ranked player, has lost in the
semifinals of her last three tournaments. She hasn't won a title
since the Italian Open in May.
	   ``I can't believe I'm in the finals again,'' said Hingis, who
also reached the doubles final with Natasha Zvereva. ``I didn't
know how it feels anymore.''
	   Hingis does know how to play Sanchez Vicario, having beaten the
Spaniard seven times in a row. But Sanchez Vicario, who won the
first time they played in 1996, isn't discouraged. Their two
previous meetings went three sets.
	   ``I know that I'm getting closer and if I do go for my shots
like I did today, I can beat her probably next time,'' she said.
``I know I'm at the same level as her and I can compete.''
	   Trailing 1-3 in the second set, Hingis won two straight games to
tie the set at three games apiece, including breaking Sanchez
Vicario's serve after four deuces. But then she lost her serve at
love-40 to put the Spaniard back in front.
	   Sanchez Vicario committed two straight forehand errors to get
give Hingis a break at 4-4. Hingis served a quick 40-love game and
then closed out the victory on her third match point with a
backhand passing shot.
	   ``I make more mistakes with my forehand,'' said Sanchez Vicario,
who committed 38 unforced errors and converted just three of five
break points. ``When you play against Hingis, you have to go more
for your shots than normal. That probably caused me to force a
little more and I missed some.''
	   Davenport didn't look to have an easy time against Seles. Their
three previous meetings were three-setters and the first game
Saturday night involved 10 deuces before Seles held serve with a
forehand crosscourt winner on the line. She led 3-0 before falling
apart and committing 34 unforced errors to 14 for Davenport.
	   ``She played some great tennis, but I gave her way too many
unforced errors,'' said Seles, who had eight double faults.
``That's what I've been struggling with.''
	   But Davenport, who later gently scolded the crowd for its
zealous support of Seles, lost just six points on her serve in the
first set. She served three games at love to win in 36 minutes.
	   ``It's so important against her to hold your serve because she
returns so well and then you have an opportunity to break her,''
Davenport said.
	   Seles struggled with her shotmaking, spraying errors around the
court and double-faulting at critical moments, including the fifth
game when she lost serve to trail 1-4. She staved off three match
points on her serve in the seventh game only to see Davenport ace
her in the next game to win the match.
	   ``She was just missing a lot of balls tonight and I didn't feel
like I did anything totally spectacular to win, but she was
overhitting and missing more than she normally does,'' Davenport
said.

Malaysia to seek control of airspace now shared with Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's transport minister said
the country will seek full control of airspace it has shared with
neighboring Singapore for 30 years, a news report said Sunday.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said the government would make
its proposal at the next meeting of the International Civil
Aviation Organization, which governs the management of airspace
throughout the world.
	   The comments come amid deteriorating relations between the two
Southeast Asian neighbors, caused by differences over the shifting
of a shared railroad immigration and customs point.
	   Under existing agreements, Singapore controls the airspace over
the southern portion of peninsular Malaysia, from the coastal state
of Negri Sembilan, down south to Johor state, which is separated
from Singapore by the Straits of Malacca.
	   The air, railway and other agreements date back to the years
just after Singapore's independence from the Malayan Federation in
1965.
	   ``We want to gain control of the airspace because Malaysia's
aviation industry has already reached an advanced level where we
are able to manage our own airspace,'' Ling was quoted as saying in
the Star newspaper.
	   Ling said the ministry's Department of Civil Aviation ``will
definitely propose'' to take over the airspace as Malaysia had met
certain criteria mandated by the ICAO. He added Malaysia now had
the capability to establish its own air surveillance system.
	   Relations between the Southeast Asian neighbors have soured
progressively over the last few weeks, following Singapore's
relocation of its immigration, customs and quarantine post from a
downtown railway station to one closer to the border with Malaysia.
	   Malaysia has refused to switch its immigration control, saying
it owns the land under an old treaty and has jabbed back with a
campaign encouraging domestic companies to use Malaysian ports over
Singapore's.
	   Analysts attribute the squabble to deeper problems related to
the region's economic turmoil, which has hurt Malaysia much more
than Singapore.
	   Ling was quoted as saying that many local importers and
exporters had switched to Malaysian facilities.
	   ``This is a healthy trend as this shows Malaysians are going all
out to help the government revive the economy,'' Ling said.

Floods strand 140,000 in north China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Adding to China's flood miseries, a river burst
its banks in the north, stranding 146,000 people and washing away
rail lines, the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday.
	   By late Saturday night, 70,000 people who were cut off by the
flooded Ulyji Muren river had been rescued, Xinhua said. But 76,000
people remained stranded ``in dangerous conditions,'' it said.
	   Authorities in the area, in the eastern part of the Inner
Mongolia region of northern China, were trying to rescue them, it
said.
	   The river also damaged a railway bridge and washed away 200
meters (660 feet) of track, forcing the closure of a line to
Tongliao, a city in the neighboring province of Jilin, it said.
	   Rivers swollen to record levels in China's northeast already
have crushed levees and caused widespread destruction. Two dikes
collapsed near Daqing, a city of 2.3 million and China's largest
oil field, forcing thousands of people to evacuate and closing at
least 155 of its 20,000 oil wells.
	   Daqing authorities fired a top city official for failing to
properly oversee a levee that sprang a leak, the official newspaper
Worker's Daily said Sunday.
	   Dong Zhenju, deputy head of Daqing's Agriculture Bureau, didn't
bother checking the leak for himself and failed to organize repair
efforts, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected to bring the worst floods since 1949
to Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang province that borders
Russia, Xinhua said.
	   Li Peng, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party after party boss
Jiang Zemin, said the Songhua river that runs through Harbin will
very likely surpass its record high, and he urged the city to
``keep on high alert and prepare for the worst,'' Xinhua said.
	   During a tour of flooded areas in the northeast last Friday, Li
also pledged that a large reservoir to accumulate water would be
built on the upper reaches of the Nen river after its record
breaking floodwaters recede, Xinhua said.
	   President Jiang, meanwhile, urged the entire nation to rally
behind the battle against this year's summer floods that have
affected one-fifth of the Chinese population, killing more than
2,000 people nationwide and leaving millions homeless.
	   Jiang, who traveled to flooded areas along the Yangtze, warned
that after more than six weeks of flooding along China's longest
river, flood-fighting efforts were at a ``crucial stage.''

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 28 people
and injured 220 _ the worst single attack in three decades of
conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability of diehard
dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police said a misleading telephone warning caused them to move
people close to a car packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220
kilos) of explosives.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' a visibly moved Ronnie
Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police commander, said at the scene.
	   No group claimed responsibility, but politicians blamed IRA
dissidents who are committed to shattering the outlawed group's
13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped inspire.
Dissidents have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
	   Among the dead from Saturday's blast are three teen-age girls, a
teen-age boy and a young child.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' Adams said.
	   Although political analysts considered his phrase significant
because Adams has steadfastly refused to ``condemn'' violence by
the IRA or its dissident factions in the past, David Trimble, the
Protestant first minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly,
said that Adams' party should take some blame for the bombing
because of the amount of illegal arms and explosives still held by
the IRA and other paramilitary groups.
	   ''Sinn Fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody
atrocity,'' Trimble said.
	   Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement that she was ``shocked to
hear of the appalling crime in Omagh.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in France, told
the BBC that he found it ``impossible to get in the mind of anyone
who could possibly do such a thing,'' and the Northern Ireland
Office said that Mo Mowlam, the senior British politician in charge
of the province, had cut short her holiday and would be in Belfast
on Sunday morning.
	   Britain's Deputy-Prime Minister, John Prescott, will visit Omagh
on Sunday, his office said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed that breakaway IRA
members _ believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic _ would be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   George Mitchell, the former U.S. Senate majority leader who
chaired Northern Ireland's peace talks said the bomb explosion was
the work of ``a very tiny minority of cowards and murderers that
are trying to destroy a process that is supported by an
overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   The explosion came 40 minutes after a telephoned warning to the
BBC in Belfast claimed a bomb had been left outside Omagh's
courthouse on the west end of downtown. Police directed people away
from the area, many of them nearer to the bomb.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with glass and
rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said a Protestant local, Frank Hancock, too
stunned to cry over what he'd seen. ``A young girl down a manhole
that we had to pull out. A young lad burning, his hair pure
singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   British TV stations Sunday aired a graphic amateur video taken
of the chaotic scenes in Omagh immediately after the blast. In one
shot, a women stood crying in the street with blood streaming down
one side of her face and blood stains on her shirt and shirt.
	   In another scene, a women led to safety a shocked boy bleeding
from his right-side ear. In the background of shattered buildings
and dust, blast survivors lent over the bodies of those too injured
to move.
	   Other scenes showed people walking away from the blast with
severe head wounds, and the bodies of the dead temporarily covered
in plastic sheeting.
	   The local Tyrone County Hospital overflowed with wounded.
Survivors used blown-off doors as makeshift stretchers. The Rev.
John Gilmore, a Catholic priest, said that he gave the last rites
to many of the injured.
	   ``To start with it was just nonstop. There were people on the
floors, mattresses and chairs,'' said Gilmore. ``Some of the early
ones were very badly injured.''
	   Other injured people were ferried by ambulance or helicopter to
hospitals in Belfast and Londonderry.
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters. It also came 17 days before U.S.
President Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April
agreement among eight local parties on how this British-ruled
territory should be governed. The White House said Clinton's plans
would not be affected.
	   Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic leader, John Hume, said the
atrocity was ``carried out by undiluted fascists. Obviously they're
trying to impose their will by murder on the people of Ireland,
north and south.''

Abdel Karim, prominent Iraqi actress, dies in exile in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Fakhriya Abdel Karim, an activist and
prominent Iraqi actress better known by her stage name Zeinab, has
died in Sweden, her friends said Sunday. She was 63.
	   Abdel Karim died Friday after a long battle with ovarian cancer
in a hospital in the southern city of Goteborg, where she had lived
since she sought refuge in Sweden in 1991, said the friends, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Abdel Karim was among a handful of Iraqi women who defied
conservative social traditions and became actresses in the early
1950s when the Iraqi film industry was just emerging. She later
starred in dozens of plays and several films.
	   Among her best-known performances were as a humble baker in
``The Palm Tree and The Neighbors'' and as the wife of a government
employee in ``Saeed Afandi,'' one of Iraq's best films.
	   Born in the southern city of Kut, Abdel Karim joined the Iraqi
Communist Party early in her life, becoming one of its activists in
its fight against successive Iraqi governments.
	   After Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein launched a crackdown on the
communists, Abdel Karim left Iraq in 1979 to south Yemen and then
Syria. But in 1991 she was given political asylum in Sweden with
her husband, director Latif Saleh.
	   Abdel Karim is expected to be buried in Goteborg on Friday.
	   She is survived by her husband.

Hundreds of Lebanese evacuees from Congo arrive home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hundreds of Lebanese who escaped the
escalating conflict in Congo arrived home Sunday, part of a growing
exodus of foreigners from the African nation.
	   Some 350 Lebanese, most of them women and children, arrived at
Beirut International Airport aboard a chartered Nigerian plane
after midnight Saturday. They flew from Kinshasa across the Congo
River to the Republic of Congo capital, Brazzaville, then home.
	   The weary-looking evacuees recounted stories of hardship they
experienced since an uprising by rebels against President Laurent
Kabila's military earlier this month escalated into an insurgency.
	   Most of them said they had been living without water and
electricity since the start of the conflict.
	   At least 800 Lebanese, many of them businessmen, were still in
Congo awaiting evacuation, said Haitham Jumaa, director general at
the Ministry of Immigration Affairs.
	   Tens of thousands of Lebanese have settled in West African
countries after fleeing the 1975-90 civil war in their country,
establishing successful businesses and, in some cases, making
significant contributions to local economies. But their wealth has
sometimes provoked local resentment.

Police, troops ready as rumors of possible riots sweep country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of police and troops were
deployed or put on alert in the capital and other cities Sunday,
the eve of nervous celebrations to mark Indonesia's national day.
	   Rumors that riots may break out during the celebrations have
swept much of the country.
	   While there have been no reports of trouble so far, some ethnic
Chinese, who were targeted when deadly unrest broke out in May,
have left the country or have sought refuge in hotels or other safe
havens.
	   Celebrations to mark 53 years of independence from Dutch
colonial rule are expected to be low-key Monday as Indonesia's 202
million people endure the grinding pain of the worst economic
crisis in three decades.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation, was hit
hardest by Asia's economic meltdown.
	   Downplaying the tensions, government officials have repeatedly
dismissed the riot rumors as baseless.
	   Nevertheless, they have taken major security precautions in the
wake May's violence, which ended with the deaths of 1,200 and the
dramatic resignation of longtime President Suharto.
	   About 15,000 troops and police have been put on duty in Jakarta.
	   Dozens of police armed with sticks or automatic weapons stood
guard near the National Monument and the nearby presidential
palace, which has been decorated with patriotic white and red
bunting.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced the autocratic Suharto on
May 21, is to officiate at a flag raising ceremony on Monday, a
national holiday.
	   On Saturday he made a marathon speech to the Parliament in which
he apologized for widespread human rights abuses during Suharto's
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie restated pledges to introduce greater democracy and
suggested major reforms be made to the powerful military, now under
investigation for a list of alleged atrocities.
	   Habibie also promised to fix the ailing economy through reforms
mandated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Soaring inflation, mass unemployment, bankruptcies and food
shortages have triggered fears that civil unrest could break out
again.
	   In his address Habibie decried May's violence as ``barbaric.''
	   Women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped during
May's riots, many of them ethnic Chinese who were targeted for
their affluence. Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and buildings
were ransacked and burned.
	   While Chinese make up only about four percent of the population,
they control much of the economy and have been targeted as
scapegoats for Indonesia's financial mess.
	   China has demanded the Indonesian government take firm action to
protect its ethnic Chinese citizens, and protesters in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and the United States have called for those responsible to be
arrested.
	   Although downplaying the chances of renewed violence, Jakarta's
governor has reportedly suggested on the capital's residents to arm
themselves with clubs, spears and swords.
	   ``Don't hesitate to use weapons to protect yourselves ... that's
completely tolerable if it's for self-defense,'' the Jakarta Post
newspaper Saturday quoted Gov. Sutiyoso as saying.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Heavy and small weapons fire broke the silence
Sunday morning in Togo's capital as the government warned its
citizens to remain indoors, saying unnamed attackers had opened
fire on Togolese territory from across the border in neighboring
Ghana.
	   State radio broadcast a government plea for residents of Lome to
remain calm, saying Togolese troops had been deployed to the border
areas west of Lome, where the government said shelling was
directed.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the shooting and no
reports of casualties.
	   Machine gun fire and heavier explosions were heard in several
Lome neighborhoods near the border beginning around 6:30 a.m.
(0630) GMT as church-goers scurried to return to their homes.

 &UR; New Muslim party to be declared in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The leader of one of Indonesia's
largest Muslim groups plans to declare a new political party later
this month to contest elections scheduled for next year.
	   The official Antara news agency reported on Sunday that Amien
Rais, the prominant Islamic leader who heads the 28 million-member
Muhammadiyah organization, will inaugurate the National Message
Party at Jakarta's main sports stadium on Aug. 23.
	   Antara quoted officials as saying the party was to have been
established on Monday, Indonesia's 53rd anniversary of independence
from Dutch colonial rule. But the kick off was postponed for
``technical reasons.''
	   Thousands of troops have been placed on duty ahead of national
day celebrations following widespread rumors of possible riots.
	   Last month another major Muslim group, the 30 million-member
Nahdlatul Ulama organization, set up its own party.
	   More than 40 new parties, representing a wide range of
interests, have been established after President B.J. Habibie
announced plans for free elections next year.
	   Habibie also said he would abolish strict controls on political
activity that had been imposed under his autocratic predecessor
President Suharto.
	   Suharto's 32 years in power ended in May after a wave of riots
and protests.
	   During Suharto's reign only three government-approved and
controlled parties were allowed to operate.
	   Both Rais and Nahdlatul Ulama's leader Abdurrahman Wahid were
critics of Suharto's regime and both have recently called for
accelerated democratic reform under Habibie.
	   Both their new parties are likely to garner widespread support
at next year's parliamentary election, which will precede the
selection of a president by a legislative assembly before the end
of 1999.
	   Habibie, who is an influential member of a third Islamic group,
has indicated that he will stand again for office and Rais has
suggested that he also wants to run for the presidency.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.

U.S. Ambassador in Singapore: Asia needs more transparency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian economies will continue to deteriorate
until regulations, laws and courts are transparent and fair enough
to draw businesses back, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore was
quoted Sunday as saying.
	   ``There is a need for a systemic change in transparency, laws
and the opportunity to see fair courts impose those laws to enable
capital markets in the world to feel more comfortable to come
back,'' Steven Green was quoted by The Sunday Times as saying.
	   ``Until that happens, we will see continued deterioration in the
economy,'' the paper quoted him as saying during a seminar
organized by the United Nations Association of Singapore.
	   He was quoted as saying the economic crisis in Asia is ``a basic
shift in the way these countries do business and raise capital.''
	   ``It's not easy to swallow the reforms needed,'' the paper
quoted Green as saying.
	   It attributed to him figures that showed how much Asian
economies have deteriorated.
	   Market capitalization _ the value of shares on Southeast Asian
stock markets _ declined from dlrs 565 billion in January 1997 to
dlrs 160 billion, according to the report.

Police, troops ready as rumors of possible riots sweep country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of opposition ceremony, grafs 11, 12
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of police and troops were
deployed or put on alert in the capital and other cities Sunday,
the eve of nervous celebrations to mark Indonesia's national day.
	   Rumors that riots may break out during the celebrations have
swept much of the country.
	   While there have been no reports of trouble so far, some ethnic
Chinese, who were targeted when deadly unrest broke out in May,
have left the country or have sought refuge in hotels or other safe
havens.
	   Celebrations to mark 53 years of independence from Dutch
colonial rule are expected to be low-key Monday as Indonesia's 202
million people endure the grinding pain of the worst economic
crisis in three decades.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation, was hit
hardest by Asia's economic meltdown.
	   Downplaying the tensions, government officials have repeatedly
dismissed the riot rumors as baseless.
	   Nevertheless, they have taken major security precautions in the
wake May's violence, which ended with the deaths of 1,200 and the
dramatic resignation of longtime President Suharto.
	   About 15,000 troops and police have been put on duty in Jakarta.
	   Dozens of police armed with sticks or automatic weapons stood
guard near the National Monument and the nearby presidential
palace, which has been decorated with patriotic white and red
bunting.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced the autocratic Suharto on
May 21, is to officiate at a flag raising ceremony on Monday, a
national holiday.
	   In a snub to Habibie, prominent opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri, who is the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno, has announced she will not attend the ceremony,
but will stage her own across town.
	   Last month police banned her from staging a rally of her
supporters in Jakarta because of fears of violence.
	   On Saturday Habibie made a marathon speech to the Parliament in
which he apologized for widespread human rights abuses during
Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie restated pledges to introduce greater democracy and
suggested major reforms be made to the powerful military, now under
investigation for a list of alleged atrocities.
	   Habibie also promised to fix the ailing economy through reforms
mandated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Soaring inflation, mass unemployment, bankruptcies and food
shortages have triggered fears that civil unrest could break out
again.
	   In his address Habibie decried May's violence as ``barbaric.''
	   Women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped during
May's riots, many of them ethnic Chinese who were targeted for
their affluence. Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and buildings
were ransacked and burned.
	   While Chinese make up only about four percent of the population,
they control much of the economy and have been targeted as
scapegoats for Indonesia's financial mess.
	   China has demanded the Indonesian government take firm action to
protect its ethnic Chinese citizens, and protesters in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and the United States have called for those responsible to be
arrested.
	   Although downplaying the chances of renewed violence, Jakarta's
governor has reportedly suggested on the capital's residents to arm
themselves with clubs, spears and swords.
	   ``Don't hesitate to use weapons to protect yourselves ... that's
completely tolerable if it's for self-defense,'' the Jakarta Post
newspaper Saturday quoted Gov. Sutiyoso as saying.

Brisbane, Newcastle share first place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane _ in the driver's seat for the
minor premiership _ and Newcastle won their penultimate
regular-season matches Sunday to stay level atop the National Rugby
League ladder.
	   The Broncos beat Auckland 16-4 while Newcastle defeated Balmain
30-16. Each team has 35 points but Brisbane will likely take top
spot owing to its better points-for and points-against average.
	   Parramatta blasted Western Suburbs 50-4 Sunday to remain in
third place with 34 points, one ahead of Melbourne and two ahead of
fifth-place North Sydney. Manly beat North Queensland 28-12.
	   Sydney City kept its top six chances alive with a 34-10 win over
the Gold Coast Chargers. Level with Canberra on 30 points but with
a better for-and-against margin, the Roosters must win their
final-round match next weekend with Balmain to be sure of taking a
spot in the top six.
	   On Saturday, the Illawarra Steelers resurrected their hopes of a
semifinal spot with a 30-22 victory over Cronulla. Only one week
after being thrashed by 38 points, the Steelers ran in five tries
to four.
	   In soaking rain at Sydney, Canterbury beat Melbourne 8-4 to keep
its finals chances alive.
	   The Bulldogs led 2-0 after a first half played in torrential
rain. In the second half, the rain was so heavy that the players
were barely visible to the 11,179 spectators and players were
running the ball while shielding their eyes with their free hand.
	   Adam Muir scored a pair of tries as North Sydney shut out
Adelaide 36-0. Skipper Jason Taylor kicked six from eight attempts.
	   On Friday, Penrith overpowered South Sydney 36-18. Leading 16-14
at halftime, the Panthers played an almost flawless second half in
which lock John Cross completed three tries.
	   Departing international Ricky Stuart led Canberra to a 28-24 win
over an injury-depleted St. George in his 200th match Friday. The
game was Stuart's last regular-season appearance at the ground in
Raiders' colors following his decision to join Canterbury next
season. (djp)

Beach closed due to oil spill from ship collision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A tanker and a cargo ship collided off the Pacific
Coast of Japan early Sunday, causing an small oil spill that
reached a nearby beach, according to coast guard officials.
	   About 46,000 liters (12,000 gallons) of fuel leaked from the
985-ton No. 5 Yamabishimaru after its hull was cracked in a
collision with the 6,641-ton cargo ship Princess Seiko just off of
Cape Inubozaki, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of Tokyo, the
Maritime Safety Agency said.
	   The oil reached Iiioka swimming beach in Chiba Prefecture
(state), the agency said.
	   At one point, the oil slick was about 8 kilometers (5 miles)
long and up to 200 meters (220 yards) wide, but most of it had
washed up onto the beach by Sunday afternoon.
	   The beach was closed from Sunday morning, while about 100
townspeople cleaned up the oil.

Bulldogs beat Sydney in close match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Western Bulldogs wrapped up a
top two position in the Australian Football League after a
two-point win over the Sydney Swans in weekend play.
	   Bulldogs forward Paul Hudson kept his cool to drill home a goal
three minutes from fulltime to seal the 15.9 (99) to 15.7 (97)
Australian Rules football victory Saturday.
	   North Melbourne, which beat Fremantle on Friday night, is level
with the Bulldogs on 56 points but has a slightly better
percentage. Sydney is in third place with 52 points and Adelaide,
West Coast, Essendon, St. Kilda and Melbourne are all tied for
fourth with 48 points.
	   In Sunday matches, Melbourne beat Port Adelaide 14.10 (94) to
10.11 (71), Carlton defeated St. Kilda 19.20 (134) to 15.14 (104),
handing the Saints their fourth loss in a row, and the West Coast
Eagles beat Richmond 16.16 (112) to 11.7 (73).
	   Melbourne moved back into the top eight with its 23-point win
over Port Adelaide in an early Sunday afternoon kickoff. Melbourne
coach Neale Daniher said the Demons were lucky to be within 11
points at halftime and probably deserved to lose.
	   ``We trained early on Friday to get used to the early time but
we weren't in sync early and that should have cost us the game,''
Daniher said.
	   In other Saturday matches, Essendon had a 10-point win over
Collingwood, kicking nine consecutive points in the final quarter
in a 16.13 (109) to 15.15 (99) win.
	   Adelaide showed it may have regained its premiership form of
last season when it thrashed Geelong. The Crows grabbed their
first-ever win at Kardinia Park with an 18.10 (118) to 6.8 (44)
display that saw full-forward Tony Modra kick six goals.
	   Hawthorn beat the Brisbane Lions by 35 points. The
bottom-of-the-table Lions struggled to kick goals in perfect
conditions, losing 13.16 (94) to 7.17 (59).
	   On Friday, North Melbourne scored a 104-point victory over
Fremantle. Led by skipper Wayne Carey with eight goals, North
booted 15 majors in the second half to win 22.19 (151) to 7.5 (47).

Irie defends title by four strokes in NEC Karuizawa 72
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARUIZAWA, Japan (AP) _ Yuka Irie shot a final round of
2-under-par 70 Sunday to defend her title by four strokes in the
NEC Karuizawa 72.
	   Irie, starting five strokes ahead, birdied the par-5 second
hole. But she hit the ball short and missed the greens to bogey the
No. 3, 4 and 7 holes, cutting her lead over Michiko Hattori to one
stroke.
	   But the 29-year-old, in contention for her first victory of the
season and fourth overall, regained her swing and touch as she
birdied the par-5 ninth.
	   On the back nine, Irie hit fairways and the center of the
greens, and sank three birdies en route to a 54-hole total of
12-under 204.
	   The victory was worth 10.8 million yen (dlrs 74,500) from a
purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 414,000).
	   ``At No. 7, I noticed that I should hit the center of the
greens, instead of the pins,'' Irie said. ``I was trying too much
to hit the ball close.''
	   ``I really felt uneasy when my advantage was down to one shot,''
she said. ``But the putt that saved par on the eighth hole sort of
turned the tide.'' There she holed a 16-foot (5-meter) par putt.
	   Hattori and Kaori Harada fired 68s and finished tied for second
at 208 along with Akiko Fukushima, who shot a 69.
	   Harada, currently heading the earnings list, and Hattori each
has won two tournaments so far this season. Fukushima, the Japan
tour's best player in the last two years, was seeking her second
title of the season.

Myanmar junta may not be moved by international attention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Protests by foreign activists and
renewed challenges to military rule by opposition leader Aung San
Suu Kyi have brought Myanmar's political deadlock back to the
world's attention, but there's no sign democracy is on the
country's agenda.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory
in a 1990 general election but the military never allowed the
winning lawmakers to take their seats. Instead, it jailed dozens of
them on political charges and sent others fleeing into exile.
	   Four times in the past two months, authorities have blocked Suu
Kyi's way as she has tried to travel to the countryside to meet her
would-be members of parliament.
	   She has responded by refusing to turn back or leave her car, and
Sunday was parked on a small bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of Yangon in the fifth day of her latest such sit-in.
	   Her party meanwhile has made the quixotic demand that the
parliament be seated by Aug. 21.
	   But the generals who have ruled the country since suppressing
mass pro-democracy demonstrations 10 years ago have shown time and
again they will not be pushed around by anyone, be it Suu Kyi, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or the United Nations.
	   They last week rejected a request from U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that his special representative be immediately allowed
to visit Myanmar _ also called Burma _ saying there was no reason
to rush.
	   Albright, among others, had sought Annan's intervention in the
crisis over the government's treatment of Suu Kyi, winner of the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Myanmar's neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations _ who previously maintained a no-criticism policy,
particularly since Yangon joined the group last year _ recently
have added their voices to those urging the generals to ease their
rule.
	   Activists from four ASEAN countries _ Thailand, the Philippines,
Malaysia and Indonesia _ were among the 18 foreigners who handed
out pro-democracy leaflet in the streets of Yangon last week. They
were arrested and given five-year prison sentences which were
suspended when they were expelled Saturday.
	   ``ASEAN or the West can say what they like, but Burma is still
an isolated country, and in the short term I don't think outside
criticism makes a great deal of difference,'' said Martin Smith, a
London-based author of several studies on Myanmar interviewed
Saturday. ``Burmese politics is an intense internal struggle in
which international leverage is very small.''
	   Thanet Apornsuwan, a political scientist at Bangkok's Thammasat
University, believes however that the release of the 18 activists
``has shown that Myanmar could not bear the growing pressure from
outside, especially from neighboring countries in ASEAN region.''
	   Smith said the latest confrontations reminded people there is a
longstanding crisis to be resolved.
	   Only a three-way dialogue _ between the government, Suu Kyi's
democracy movement, and the ethnic minorities who have uneasily
been part of the Burmese state since independence in 1948 _ can
break the deadlock, he said.
	   ``All three groups say they are committed to change,'' he said.
``Aung San Suu Kyi's protest brings everything back into focus.''
	   Suu Kyi responded to critics of her confrontational tactics in
an interview earlier this month with the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
	   ``We've tried various strategies and we will keep on trying new
strategies, but we do want a peaceful solution,'' she said. ``So a
peaceful resolution means a negotiated resolution.''
	   But Suu Kyi's tactics have clearly riled the junta, which
inevitably links her efforts to the foreign pressure.
	   Smith says there is a risk of polarization.
	   Some hardliners in the regime may feel the best way to deal with
the foreign pressure is to withdraw from the international
community altogether, returning to the type of isolation imposed by
the country's former military dictator, Ne Win, from 1962 to 1988.
	   The hardliners can point to the region's economic crisis as an
example of the perils of globalization, Smith said. But he believes
that most of Myanmar's leaders, committed to an open door
investment policy and ``disciplined democracy,'' know that they
cannot turn back the clock.

Beijing police block student protest vs. Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Citing public order concerns, Beijing police have
blocked plans by students in the Chinese capital to protest outside
the Indonesian embassy, a student representative said Sunday.
	   Students at the prestigious Beijing University had wanted to
demonstrate outside the embassy Monday _ Indonesian national day _
to protest rapes and attacks on ethnic Chinese in Indonesia during
riots in May.
	   The demonstrators also had planned to hand over to the embassy a
protest letter signed by about 1,500 students, said Zhao Xiaoli,
one of 10 student representatives who helped draft the letter.
	   The students last week applied for permission to demonstrate, as
required by law. Beijing police turned down the request Saturday,
citing concerns over possible threats to public safety and social
order, Zhao said.
	   China typically keeps a tight lid on civic protests for fear
that they could escalate into attacks on the ruling Communist
Party. Controls are especially strict at Beijing University and
other campuses in the capital because they initiated massive
pro-democracy protests in 1989.
	   Zhao said he did not know whether some students would proceed
with Monday's protest despite the police refusal.
	   He said students would still hand over the protest letter to the
embassy but he did not know where, when or how.
	   Students at Beijing University have put up posters on campus
accusing China's government of reacting apathetically to the
attacks on ethnic Chinese during May's riots that helped drive
Indonesian President Suharto from power.
	   Indonesian women's groups allege 168 women and girls were raped
during May's riots, many of them ethnic Chinese who were targeted
for their affluence. Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and
buildings were ransacked and burned.
	   China's Foreign Ministry has decried the rapes, and demanded at
least three times that Indonesia investigate the attacks.

Sudanese rebel leader says only solution is regime's ouster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The only solution to Sudan's 15-year civil
war is the overthrow of the country's Islamic government, the main
Sudanese rebel leader said in an interview.
	   ``This is a regime with which we cannot do business. It
terrorizes Sudanese people, it has run down the Sudanese economy,
it is killing people,'' John Garang, who heads the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, told Associated Press Television.
	   ``Our position ... is that this regime is a regime that should
be removed. It cannot be improved,'' he added.
	   The SPLA and the Sudanese government, which took power in a 1989
coup and imposed its brand of Islamic rule, have taken part in
several rounds of peace talks but have made little progress. The
latest round ended last month in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   Sudan's latest civil war began in 1983, and more than 1.5
million people have died in the conflict and famines caused by it.
The rebels have demanded greater autonomy for their people in the
south from a north traditionally ruled by a Muslim, Arab elite.
	   Garang repeated the SPLA position that only a secular Sudan
could safeguard the rights of all Sudanese.
	   ``This will be a long step toward peace,'' Garang said.
	   Garang was speaking during a meeting in Cairo of the National
Democratic Alliance, an Eritrea-based umbrella group for northern
politicians and southern rebels opposed to the government.
	   Among the Sudanese attending the meeting are Mohammed Osman
al-Mirgani, who heads the alliance, and former Prime Minister Sadiq
el-Mahdi, who was ousted by President Omar el-Bashir.
	   The meeting was held at Egypt's request after the Addis Ababa
talks failed to yield progress. Egypt fears the civil war could
result in the partition of Sudan and affect the flow of the Nile
River, its overwhelming source of water.
	   Sudan has protested Egypt's decision to host the meeting, saying
that it amounted to ``instigating the opposition against the
Sudanese people and their legitimate, constitutional
institutions.''

Car bomb kills 28 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 8 and 9 with details of dead, injured, pickup
graf 9 pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 28 people
and injured 220 _ the worst single attack in three decades of
conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability of diehard
dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police said a misleading telephone warning caused them to move
people close to a car packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220
kilos) of explosives.
	   ``We have had men, women and children slaughtered here this
afternoon, slaughtered by murderers who wanted to murder ... who
gave us a totally inaccurate warning,'' a visibly moved Ronnie
Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police commander, said at the scene.
	   Flanagan said in a BBC TV interview Sunday that he had
established a special taskforce to investigate the killings, and
pointed initial blame for the bomb at an IRA splinter group.
	   ``It is fair to say that our focus at this point in time would
be on those who call themselves the 32 County Sovereignty Movement,
and those close to them.'' Flanagan said that the group also called
itself the ``Real IRA.''
	   IRA dissidents, who are committed to shattering the outlawed
group's 13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped
inspire, have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths,
and on July 10 British and Irish police said they had foiled a
bombing campaign in London.
	   The dead from Saturday's blast are 13 women, six men, and nine
children, including a baby girl and several teen-agers. Twenty of
the 28 have not yet been formally identified.
	   Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital said it was treating 22
people, eight of them critical, including a child. Altnagelvin
Hospital in Londonderry has 21 injured, three of them critical.

Floods strand 140,000 in north China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official saying oil fields will be protected,
other details grafs 6-8

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Adding to China's flood miseries, a river burst
its banks in the north, stranding 146,000 people and washing away
rail lines, the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday.
	   By late Saturday night, 70,000 people who were cut off by the
flooded Ulyji Muren river had been rescued, Xinhua said. But 76,000
people remained stranded ``in dangerous conditions,'' it said.
	   Authorities in the area, in the eastern part of the Inner
Mongolia region of northern China, were trying to rescue them, it
said.
	   The river also damaged a railway bridge and washed away 200
meters (660 feet) of track, forcing the closure of a line to
Tongliao, a city in the neighboring province of Jilin, it said.
	   Rivers swollen to record levels in China's northeast already
have crushed levees and caused widespread destruction. Two dikes
collapsed near Daqing, a city of 2.3 million and China's largest
oil field, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
	   With efforts to repair both breaches abandoned, flood fighters
were concentrating on reinforcing secondary levees that safeguard
Daqing, Xinhua said.
	   ``We well definitely protect the oil fields. Don't worry about
that,'' said Chai Fa, a spokesman for Daqing's Petroleum
Administration Office.
	   Xinhua said 355 of Daqing's 20,000 oil wells were inundated,
cutting daily production by 807 tons. Daqing's 60.9 million tons of
crude last year accounted for half of China's total output.
	   Daqing authorities fired a top city official for failing to
properly oversee a levee that sprang a leak, the official newspaper
Worker's Daily said Sunday.
	   Dong Zhenju, deputy head of Daqing's Agriculture Bureau, didn't
bother checking the leak for himself and failed to organize repair
efforts, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected to bring the worst floods since 1949
to Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang province that borders
Russia, Xinhua said.
	   Li Peng, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party after party boss
Jiang Zemin, said the Songhua river that runs through Harbin will
very likely surpass its record high, and he urged the city to
``keep on high alert and prepare for the worst,'' Xinhua said.
	   During a tour of flooded areas in the northeast last Friday, Li
also pledged that a large reservoir to accumulate water would be
built on the upper reaches of the Nen river after its record
breaking floodwaters recede, Xinhua said.
	   President Jiang, meanwhile, urged the entire nation to rally
behind the battle against this year's summer floods that have
affected one-fifth of the Chinese population, killing more than
2,000 people nationwide and leaving millions homeless.
	   Jiang, who traveled to flooded areas along the Yangtze, warned
that after more than six weeks of flooding along China's longest
river, flood-fighting efforts were at a ``crucial stage.''
	   With millions stranded on sweltering dikes along the river, with
minimal shelter, clean water or food, relief workers had to ensure
social order and guard against disease, Xinhua quoted Jiang as
saying.

Report: Guerrillas abduct gorilla-viewing tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Four Western tourists were abducted
earlier this week by Hutu rebels in Congo, a Ugandan newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   The state-owned New Vision did not identify tourists by name. It
said their group included people from Canada, Switzerland, Sweden
and New Zealand.
	   The abductions took place Tuesday, it said. Two of the tourists
escaped and were helped by Congolese villagers, the newspaper
reported.
	   It said the tourists were in the region to see rare mountain
gorillas in the Virunga National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable
Forest on the Uganda-Rwanda border. Armed Hutus insurgents from the
former Rwandan army still roam the reserves.
	   The report said the tourists' vehicle was traveling through
thick, bamboo-forested mountains when it was showered with gunfire.
About 10 men confronted the tourists, it said.
	   The New Vision said two tourists escaped by running into the
jungle. Congolese villagers later helped them return to Uganda, the
newspaper said.
	   The incident happened near the Congolese village of Tomba, 20
kilometers (12 miles) from the Ugandan border town of Kisoro.
	   Kisoro is 480 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Kampala, the
Ugandan capital.
	   It was not possible to confirm the report. Government and
diplomatic offices in Uganda were closed Sunday and neither of the
national parks have telephone links with the outside world.
	   Hundreds of tourists visit the parks, home to the about 600
mountain gorillas still remaining in the world, every year.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have taken the main
stronghold of rebel ethnic Albanians in southwestern Kosovo, in
what appeared to be the finale of a crackdown launched last month,
Serb sources reported Sunday.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania was known as
the organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of
Kosovo.
	   According to a police statement carried by state-run Tanjug news
agency, Junik fell to the Serbs late Saturday, after nearly two
weeks under siege. No information from Albanian sources was
immediately available and the report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The report said members of the KLA tried to escape across the
border to Albanian but were blocked by army border guards and
eventually ``broken down'' and later dispersed into mountain
forests. Four policemen died in the operation, it said.
	   Junik, some 75 kilometers (50 miles) west of Pristina, first
made headlines last month when top U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke,
paid a surprise visit to KLA fighters there. The KLA is fighting
for the independence of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians account for
90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Over the past weeks government forces purged the KLA from
several other major strongholds. Gains by government forces,
however, have proved difficult to maintain.
	   On Saturday, government forces launched coordinated attacks on
at least nine villages, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also
raged elsewhere in the province.
	   In Belgrade, independent radio B92 reported that police and the
Yugoslav army used tanks and helicopters in the attacks. Kosovo
province is in Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav republics.
	   While Serb forces shelled the villages in an attempt to force
independence-seeking rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade
invited moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's team to start
negotiations as early as next week.
	   But his party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said its hopes
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was serious about peace
talks ``once again turned out to be futile.''
	   Rugova had said earlier that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. In any event, Rugova has been unable
to persuade the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join him.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported that government forces opened fire at
dawn Saturday on Logja and at least eight other villages west of
Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   There was no word on casualties. The area is inaccessible to
journalists, but smoke was seen from a distance and detonations
were heard.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attacks, an ethnic Albanian
source said. The Serb Media Center in Pristina, meanwhile, reported
that separatists attacked Serb police who were securing a road near
the villages early Saturday. In a counterattack, it said, police
forces pushed KLA rebels into nearby forests.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A French government plane carrying 187 people
fleeing the fighting in Congo arrived Sunday morning in Paris.
	   The plane was carrying 87 French people, while the rest came
from about a dozen other countries.
	   Most of the evacuees had crossed the river from Kinshasa to
neighboring Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo order to get on
the special French plane.
	   Congo is in a chaotic state now as rebel gunmen try to oust
President Laurent Kabila.
	   A rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military has been pushing toward
Kinshasa, the capital.

More than 100 Congo evacuees arrive in Pretoria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ More than 100 evacuees from Congo
arrived early Sunday morning in Pretoria, part of a growing flight
from the escalating conflict in the West African country.
	   ``It is very quiet, but a lot of people are leaving in a hurry.
There is nothing to be too worried about yet,'' South African Andy
Watson told reporters in Pretoria.
	   An army of rebel Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted
members of Congolese President Laurent Kabila's military staged an
uprising earlier this month that has escalated into an insurgent
war. The rebels claim to be closing in on Kinshasa, the capital.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa shut down Saturday, U.S. officials
said in Washington.
	   Evacuations for French and other nationals were being arranged
Saturday, Western diplomats said.
	   Watson, an aircraft engineer, said water and electricity
supplies to the city were unreliable.
	   ``The streets are normal, people are just carrying on with their
day-to-day stuff,'' he said. ``There is a little bit of troop
activity, but nothing out of the ordinary.''
	   Pakistani businessman Ahmed Yousuf said he fled Kinshasa out of
fright.
	   ``The situation is very bad,'' he said. ``The rebels might
arrive there in a day or two.''
	   Foreign Affairs deputy director-general Anthony Mongole told
reporters no-one in the group needed medical treatment.
	   He said five South African embassy workers were among the group.
Two other diplomats stayed behind to run the embassy and to keep
Pretoria informed of the situation in the Congo, he said.
	   The group arriving in Pretoria included 10 South Africans, 13
Germans, 15 Swiss, 13 Tanzanians, eight Iranians, eight Israelis,
one person from the Central African Republic, seven Canadians, a
Dane, two Swedes, one Turkish citizen, two Portuguese, a Pakistani,
a Romanian, five British and 16 South African Airways employees
whose nationalities were not known.

Defense Agency to boost missile defense development budget: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Defense Agency plans to boost its budget
for joint development of the theater missile defense system with
the United States, and has earmarked some 500 million yen (dlrs 3.4
million) for the project next year, news reports said Sunday.
	   Previously, Japan's development of the missile defense system
had been limited to basic research by computer simulation.
	   If approved, the budget would be a significant increase from the
80 million yen (dlrs 548,000) spent on the project this year, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Japan's contribution, however, would still be only a small
fraction of the billions of dollars the United States is spending
on the program.
	   The theater missile defense system is designed to blow up
incoming missiles in the sky before they reach their targets.
	   The agency is expected to ask for funds to develop sensors and
materials for the project as part of its 1999 budget request due at
the end of this month, Kyodo said.
	   Defense Agency officials were not available for comment on
Sunday.
	   The timing of the increase could be sensitive as it comes just
ahead of a state visit to Japan by Chinese premier Jiang Zhemin's
beginning Sept. 6.
	   China, which was invaded by Japan during War II, watches Japan's
defense programs closely. It balked at a recent revision of Japan's
bilateral security alliance with the United States, which allowed
Japan's more active role in regional defense in case of a ``state
of emergency.''
	   Japan sees the theater missile program as crucial for regional
defense, with growing nuclear threats from North Korea, India and
Pakistan.

Newspaper: Iraq can protect itself against U.S. threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq does not fear American threats to use
force and will defend itself against any attack, the newspaper of
Iraq's ruling party said Sunday.
	   ``(U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine) Albright's aggressive
statements will not prevent Iraq from sticking to its just stands
and defense of its rights,'' Al-Thawra newspaper said.
	   ``All must remember that Iraq ... is capable under any
circumstances to defend its rights, sovereignty and the interests
of its citizens,'' the newspaper said.
	   The editorial came in response to Albright's message to Iraq on
Friday to cooperate fully with the United Nations. Albright also
said the United States reserves the right to use military strikes
against Iraq at its own timing.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation on Aug. 5, after the chief U.N.
inspector said he could not certify that Iraq had eliminated all
its weapons of mass destruction. Such a move is required for the
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
	   Long-term monitoring of already marked sites is still ongoing
using cameras and other equipment.

Journalist found dead in eastern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ A Lebanese journalist was found dead
Sunday with a gunshot wound to his head, police said.
	   Hassan Hamiyeh, 35, worked as a reporter for the opposition
Ad-Diyar newspaper in Baalbek, in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
	   He was discovered dead in his car by passers-by on a road near
Taraiya, a village 18 kilometers (12 miles) west of Baalbek.
	   A pistol was found next to Hamiyyeh, the officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A coroner who examined Hamiyyeh's body said he was shot from a
short distance, suggesting that he might have committed suicide.
But the physician said he could not rule out a murder.

Methane blast kills 16 in Ukrainian mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A methane blast deep inside a coal mine in eastern
Ukraine killed at least 16 miners on Sunday, an emergencies
official said.
	   The blast struck 600 meters (2,000 feet) underground at 12:40
a.m. Sunday (2240 GMT Saturday) in a mine in Luhansk, a city 700
kilometers (450 miles) east of Kiev, according to a duty officer
for Ukraine's Emergencies Ministry who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   He said 28 miners were underground at the time of the blast, and
the bodies of 16 victims had been found by noon. Four other miners
have been hospitalized with injuries and eight miners remain
missing.
	   Investigators are working to determine the cause of the blast,
he said.
	   More than 200 miners have already died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines. The worst single accident occurred in
April, when a methane blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the
eastern region of Donetsk.
	   Ukraine's government blames the accidents on neglect of safety
rules and outdated equipment.

U.S. student activists headed home after expulsion from Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spelling of students' names in 2nd graf are CQ
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Four American students deported from
Myanmar for distributing pro-democracy leaflets were on their way
back to the United States Sunday, voicing continued commitment to
the fight for human rights in the military-ruled country.
	   Michele Keegan, Sapna Chhatpar, Nisha Anand, and Anjanette
Hamilton, all students at American University in Washington, D.C.,
boarded a flight in Bangkok shortly after noon that was to take
them to the United States.
	   They, along with two other Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Filipinos and an Australian, belong to
activist groups opposed to military rule in Myanmar, which is also
called Burma.
	   Their action on August 9 was meant to mark the 10th anniversary
of a nationwide uprising against military rule. The 1988
demonstrations were eventually crushed, at the cost of hundreds of
lives.
	   Inside Myanmar, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi meanwhile
continued for a fifth day her own standoff with the junta,
remaining in her parked van 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital, Yangon. The the authorities stopped her there on her way
to meeting members of her political party.
	   There was no independent way to obtain information about her
condition. The government, which apparently kept her from receiving
provisions during a similar six-day sit-in last month, claims to
have supplied her with all amenities this time, including a
cassette player and music tapes by Madonna and Michael Jackson.
	   Apparently aware of the poor image it displayed during the last
standoff, government press releases have described a campaign this
time seemingly designed to kill the 53-year-old opposition leader
with kindness.
	   Suu Kyi had been headed to the city of Bassein, but the
government said her safety could not be assured there.
	   A government news release Sunday described the village where she
was stopped as ``small but picturesque.''
	   It said officials on Sunday morning provided imported cakes,
cookies and soft drinks to Suu Kyi and were ``also in the process
of setting up a mobile bathroom near her camping vehicle to ensure
her maximum comfort and welfare.''
	   There was no indication that Suu Kyi had accepted any of the
gifts. In previous roadside confrontations, she has refused to take
anything from _ or even speak to _ security forces blocking her
way.
	   The four student activists who were returning to the United
States Sunday were accompanied by U.S. Congressman Christopher
Smith, who had flown to Bangkok last week in an effort to help
secure their release from detention.
	   ``We are happy to go home and will of course continue our
interest in Burmese issues,'' said Michele Keegan, whose New Jersey
congressional district is represented by Smith.
	   Nisha Anand expressed appreciation for the international
pressure that helped bring about their release.
	   ``What we did was good because we gave the Burmese a voice from
the outside. It was incredible how much attention people gave to
Myanmar because of our arrest,'' she said.
	   The activists were convicted in a one-day trial Friday before a
judge of violating an Emergency Provisions Act dating from 1950 and
sentenced to five years' hard labor.
	   Almost immediately after sentencing, Myanmar officials announced
that the punishment was suspended and they would be deported. They
flew Saturday to Bangkok, where they received a jubilant welcome
from friends and relatives.
	   ``We are in a little rush because their families would like to
see their daughters as soon as possible,'' said Smith, speaking at
Bangkok international airport Sunday morning. ``They are all
looking forward to their reunions.''

Bank chief: price of settlement not too high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The price paid by Switzerland's two
biggest commercial banks to settle Holocaust survivors' claims
against them was realistic, the chief executive officer of the
biggest bank was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``Of course the sum is very large,'' Marcel Ospel of United Bank
of Switzerland said of Wednesday's agreement to pay dlrs 1.25
billion in an out-of-court settlement.
	   ``It would certainly have been far lower three years ago, and
marginal 10, 20 or 40 years ago,'' he added in an interview with
the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung.
	   Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, the other bank involved,
told Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick it was ``a defensible agreement.''
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   In Switzerland, relief at the settlement continued to be
tempered by caution.
	   While Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin, in a SonntagsZeitung
interview, said he was happy a ``vicious circle'' of sanctions had
been avoided, Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger told Swiss radio it
left a ``slightly unpleasant aftertaste.''
	   ``It will take a lot of commitment for the settlement to be
understood in domestic circles,'' Gut conceded. ``Only then will we
be able to breathe a sigh of relief.''
	   It received a cautious reaction Thursday from Switzerland's main
political parties. The Socialist Party welcomed it, but said many
questions remained to be answered. Two center-right parties
expressed doubts that it would defuse tensions.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
he regretted that a combination of legal action and sanction
threats had achieved its objective.
	   The government issued a statement restating its position that
the settlement is a matter for those involved. It did not take part
in negotiations and is committed to nothing by the agreement,
Thursday's statement added.
	   The commercial banks say they expect ``other Swiss companies and
institutions'' to help finance the settlement.
	   Ospel said he hopes the Swiss National Bank will ``show
financial solidarity,'' while Gut spoke of ``positive signals''
from industry.
	   The main political parties oppose any contribution by the
central bank, which has called an extraordinary board meeting for
Friday to discuss the settlement. Swiss newspapers have expressed
mixed opinions over such a contribution.
	   Whether or not it contributes ``is the central bank's problem,''
Couchepin said. ``Who pays the check is not my problem. The banks
will find the necessary money.''

Hamas leader escapes from Palestinian jail in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police set up roadblocks Sunday and conducted house-to-house
searches for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives. Israeli troops were also involved
in the hunt, radio reports said.
	   Awadallah was arrested last spring and accused of killing Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif, whose mangled body was found March 29
at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. The Palestinian Authority said the bombmaker's death was
the result of an internal feud, a claim angrily denied by Hamas.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub said recently that
Awadallah had confessed to the killing and would be tried.
	   Hamas has accused Israel of killing Sharif with the help of the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas leaders questioned Sunday whether Awadallah had really
escaped.
	   ``We don't have any information _ the Palestinian Authority did
not inform us officially about him,'' said Ismail Abu Shanab, a top
Hamas official in the Gaza Strip.
	   Abu Shanab said Awadallah had been tortured in prison. ``We hold
the Palestinian Authority responsible for his safety inside and
outside the prison,'' he said.
	   Awadallah's brother Adel has been on the run for several years
and is wanted by Israeli officials for allegedly masterminding
several Hamas bombing attacks in Jerusalem.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of Junik falling, trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have taken the main
rebel stronghold in southwestern Kosovo in what appeared to be the
finale of a crackdown launched last month against ethnic Albanian
separatists, Serb sources reported Sunday.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was known as
the organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of
Kosovo.
	   According to a police statement carried by state-run Tanjug news
agency, Junik fell to the Serbs late Saturday, after nearly two
weeks under siege. No information from Albanian sources was
immediately available and the report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The report said members of the KLA tried to escape across the
border to Albanian but were blocked by army border guards and
eventually ``broken down'' and dispersed into mountain forests.
Four policemen died in the operation, it said.
	   Junik, some 75 kilometers (50 miles) west of Pristina, first
made headlines last month when top U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke,
paid a surprise visit to KLA fighters there. The KLA is fighting
for the independence of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians account for
90 percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Over the past weeks government forces purged the KLA from
several other major strongholds. Gains by government forces,
however, have proved difficult to maintain.
	   On Saturday, government forces launched coordinated attacks on
at least nine villages, the ethnic Albanians claimed. Fighting also
raged elsewhere in the province.
	   In Belgrade, independent radio B92 reported that police and the
Yugoslav army used tanks and helicopters in the attacks. Kosovo
province is in Serbia, the larger of the two Yugoslav republics.
	   While Serb forces shelled the villages in an attempt to force
the rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade invited moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's team to start negotiations as
early as next week.
	   But his party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said its hopes
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was serious about peace
talks.
	   Rugova had said earlier that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. In any event, Rugova has been unable
to persuade the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join him.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported that government forces opened fire at
dawn Saturday on Logja and at least eight other villages west of
Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   There was no word on casualties. The area is inaccessible to
journalists, but smoke was seen from a distance and detonations
were heard.
	   Forty-six tanks, four jets, eight helicopters and troops
transported in 20 trucks joined in the attacks, an ethnic Albanian
source said. The Serb Media Center in Pristina, meanwhile, reported
that separatists attacked Serb police who were securing a road near
the villages early Saturday. In a counterattack, it said, police
forces pushed KLA rebels into nearby forests.

Newspaper: Iraq can protect itself against U.S. threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq does not fear American threats to use
force and will defend itself against any attack, the newspaper of
Iraq's ruling party said Sunday.
	   ``All must remember that Iraq ... is capable under any
circumstances to defend its rights, sovereignty and the interests
of its citizens,'' the Al-Thawra newspaper said.
	   The editorial came in response to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's message to Iraq on Friday to cooperate fully
with the United Nations. Albright said the United States reserves
the right to use military strikes against Iraq at its own timing.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation on Aug. 5, after the chief U.N.
inspector said he could not certify that Iraq had eliminated all
its weapons of mass destruction. Such a move is required for the
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
	   Long-term monitoring of already marked sites is still ongoing
using cameras and other equipment.

Police block 2,000 militant students at a Seoul campus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police maintained a tight cordon
around a Seoul campus Sunday to block possible street protests by
2,000 leftist students demanding unification of the two rival
Koreas.
	   After being blocked from marching to the border for a
pro-unification rally with their North Korean counterparts a day
earlier, the students vowed to continue to protest.
	   A three-day unification festival by the leftist students was to
have culminated with a march to the border on Saturday, the 53rd
anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial-rule in
1945.
	   Police blocked the march by using water cannons and pouring
yellow dye from a helicopter to mark the demonstrators for arrest.
	   As in the recent past, North Korea sponsored this year's rally
at the border village of Panmunjom and invited South Korean
students to attend.
	   Police detained 189 students in Saturday's clashes. All but 20
were released Sunday with warnings, they said.
	   This week's protests were led by Hanchongryon, an umbrella
student group outlawed by the Supreme Court for its pro-North
Korean stance, including a demand to end the U.S. military presence
in South Korea.
	   The students also have demanded the abolition of a national
security law that makes it a crime to espouse communism in
staunchly anti-communist South Korea.
	   Despite the protests, President Kim Dae-jung reached out to
Pyongyang on Saturday, offering to help it overcome its economic
difficulty.
	   In an Independence Day address, Kim specifically expressed
support for North Korea's plan to develop its tourism industry in a
joint venture with South Korean businesses.
	   At least two South Korean businesses, including the giant
Hyundai group, plan to start sightseeing tours to Diamond Mountain,
a scenic tourist site on the North's east coast, as early as
September.
	   Kim also proposed that both Koreas exchange special envoys to
discuss rapprochement.
	   The Korean peninsula was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.

Hamas leader escapes from Palestinian jail in West Bank

police set up roadblocks Sunday and conducted house-to-house

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government Sunday said it was
securing bases in eastern and western Congo which they will use to
attack rebel forces trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila's
regime.
	   But despite the words of confidence, Kinshasa's government was
sending out conflicting signals and it was becoming increasingly
apparent that Kabila was no longer in the capital.
	   Although one senior Kabila aide said the president was in
Kinshasa, he has not been seen in public for almost a week and
other officials say he is in the southern city of Lubumbashi,
Kabila's stronghold in his own rebels days.
	   Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi told The Associated Press he
would not be joining Kabila in Lubumbashi for meetings.
	   Other cabinet ministers _ all from Kabila's home province of
Katanga _ were in Lubumbashi on Sunday, but were scheduled to
return to Kinshasa later in the day, Sondgi said.
	   It was unclear whether Kabila would also be returning.
	   Speaking on state radio, Information Minister Didier Mumengi
said the Congolese army was preparing ``mopping up'' operations,
despite claims by the rebels to be pushing for the capital,
Kinshasa.
	   ``The Congolese army has locked up the so-called occupied
territory,'' Mumengi said. ``This is not meant for a
counter-attack, but for establishing a base for the systematic
mopping up of the zones said to be occupied.''
	   The rebels _ an army of Congolese Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disgruntled members of Kabila's military _ say,
however, they are planning a final drive to capture the capital in
the next few days.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by his government.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwanda Tutsi war
against Congo.
	   Tutsis _ an ethnic minority group centered in eastern Congo and
in neighboring countries _ have become the target of attacks and
arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.
	   With tensions mounting in Kinshasa, foreigners have been fleeing
the capital on chartered flights and across the Congo River to the
neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   The United States closed its embassy in Kinshasa on Saturday and
flew its remaining staff out of the country.
	   France says it does not plan to close its diplomatic mission
here, but has been arranging evacuations for French and other
foreign citizens wishing to leave.
	   Criticizing the departing foreigners, Kabila's Cabinet director,
Abdoulaye Yerodia, said they were like ``rats fleeing the ship.''
	   ``I don't know why they are leaving?'' he said on state
television. ``Do they think there is going to be an earthquake
here? If so, they should tell us.''
	   On Saturday, thousands of students and government employees
marched along the city's main street, June 30th Boulevard, pledging
support for Kabila and accusing Rwanda of waging war on Congo.
	   Many protesters also accused France and the United States of
trying to destabilize Congo.
	   More than 300 Americans _ U.S. Embassy staff, family and other
American citizens and their dependents _ left on two chartered
Delta Air Lines flights for Washington on Friday, an embassy
official said.
	   The remaining staff of about 20 left Saturday.
	   The government says neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are fighting
with and supplying the rebellion _ a charge both countries deny.
	   The rebels, who launched the insurgency earlier this month, have
captured several cities in the east.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister, said Saturday
that Congolese opposition leaders had formed the Congolese
Democratic Movement to replace Kabila's government.

Authorities to investigate claim of embezzlement by hard-liner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian authorities will launch an
investigation into charges that a hard-line official
misappropriated the equivalent of dlrs 6.6 million, the Iran Daily
reported Sunday.
	   Ali Razini, the head of the Tehran Justice Department, was
accused of transferring 20 billion rials (dlrs 6.6 million) from a
government account into his personal account.
	   Officials from the ministries of justice and finance and the
Central Bank will investigate the allegations, which were made
earlier this month by the Servants of Construction, a group of
senior government officials that backs Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, the English-language paper said.
	   It did not say when the investigation would begin. Razini has
yet to comment publicly on the charges.
	   The allegations may be an attempt by moderates to hit back at
hard-liners, who succeeded in ousting Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi last month after accusing him of embezzlement.
	   Karbaschi, who was sentenced to five years in prison and fined,
played a major role in the president's 1997 election, and many said
the accusations against him were politically motivated and trumped
up by the president's opponents.
	   On Wednesday, Karbaschi filed an appeal against the sentence,
which will be reviewed by an appeals court.
	   The accusations against Razini will shed more spotlight on the
ongoing power struggle between moderates led by Khatami and
hard-liners opposed to his social and political reforms.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Congolese authorities halted the evacuation of
foreigners who were trying to leave from the capital Kinshasa by
boat for Brazzaville, the French Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
	   The ministry did not say why the Congolese authorities had
suspended the evacuations, which were being carried out by barge to
ferry people from Kinshasa to the neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   French diplomats opened negotiations with representatives of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila to try to persuade them to allow
the evacuations to start again.
	   Meanwhile, a French government plane carrying 187 people fleeing
the fighting in Congo arrived Sunday morning in Paris.
	   The plane was carrying 87 French people, while the rest came
from about a dozen other countries.
	   Most of the evacuees had crossed the river from Kinshasa to
Brazzaville to get on the special French plane.
	   Congo is in a chaotic state now as rebel gunmen try to oust
President Laurent Kabila.
	   A rebel army of Congolese Tutsis, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted members of Kabila's military has been pushing toward
Kinshasa, the capital.

Chiang Kai-shek's widow sells her Long Island estate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The centenarian widow of wartime Chinese
leader Chiang Kai-shek has reportedly sold her Long Island estate,
closing another chapter in the life of one of the most powerful
Chinese women of the 20th century.
	   The 37-acre estate known as Hillcrest was sold to an American
real estate developer for U.S. dlrs 2.8 million and will be
subdivided into plots for further sale, the United Evening News
reported Sunday.
	   Soong Mayling retired to Hillcrest accompanied by her nieces and
nephews in 1975 after Chiang died and she failed in an attempt to
wrest the succession away from her stepson.
	   The estate during Chiang's life was the American home of Soong's
brother-in-law, H.H. Kung who served in several posts on Chiang's
Cabinet, as did her younger brother, T.V. Soong.
	   The Chiang, Kung, and Soong families wielded enormous political
and financial power, first in China, then in Taiwan, becoming
synonymous with the Nationalist's corruption, nepotism and
ineptness in government.
	   Now a spry 100 years old, Soong lives at her sole remaining
niece's Manhattan apartment, leaving the home mostly empty.
	   As the Generalissimos wife, American-educated Soong traveled the
United States to raise support for China's fight against Japanese
invaders, addressing Congress and becoming the best known Chinese
woman of her time.
	   In 1949, she fled with Chiang to Taiwan after Mao Tse-tung's
Communists drove the Nationalist government from the mainland.
Chiang headed a brutal dictatorship in Taiwan until his death, but
with the help of U.S. aid, started the island on the path to
becoming an economic powerhouse.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb that killed 28 people
and injured 220 _ the worst single attack in three decades of
conflict in Northern Ireland _ demonstrates the ability of diehard
dissidents to sabotage Northern Ireland's peace agreement. The
blast was in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast. Police said a misleading telephone warning caused
them to move people close to a car packed with an estimated 500
pounds (220 kilos) of explosives. Ronnie Flanagan, Northern
Ireland's police commander, told the BBC Sunday that he had
established a task-force to investigate, and pointed initial blame
at an IRA splinter group. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton will acknowledge an
``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky when he answers
to a grand jury on Monday, two advisers said late Saturday. For the
first time, the president signaled he had a sexual relationship
with her, these advisers said. These advisers, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said Clinton had let his lawyers and aides
know late Saturday that he had a sexual relationship with the
former White House intern. ``He may not have used the word `sex'
but he has finally broken through that barrier,'' said one of the
advisers. The advisers cautioned the president could still change
his strategy in the hours before his testimony.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A suspect in the recent bombing of
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested in Pakistan and
handed over to Kenya, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Sunday. A
brief ministry statement said the suspect, identified as Mohammad
Sadik Howaida, was arrested and interrogated soon after his arrival
from Nairobi at the Karachi airport on Aug. 7, the day of the
nearly simultaneous bombings that killed a total of 257 people in
both countries. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused immediate
comment. The source, who insisted on anonymity, said investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and Saudi multimillionaire Osama
bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for the
last two years. (PAKISTAN-EMBASSY BOMBING)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The government Sunday said it was
securing bases in eastern and western Congo which they will use to
attack rebel forces trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila.
But despite the words of confidence, Kinshasa's government was
sending out conflicting signals and it was becoming increasingly
apparent that Kabila was no longer in the capital. Although one
senior Kabila aide said the president was in Kinshasa, he has not
been seen in public for almost a week and other officials say he is
in the southern city of Lubumbashi, Kabila's stronghold in his own
rebels days. The rebels _ an army of Congolese Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disgruntled members of Kabila's military _
say, however, they are planning a final drive to capture the
capital in the next few days. (CONGO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Adding to China's flood miseries, a river burst
its banks in the north, stranding 146,000 people and washing away
rail lines, the official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday. By late
Saturday night, 70,000 people who were cut off by the flooded Ulyji
Muren river had been rescued, Xinhua said. But 76,000 people
remained stranded ``in dangerous conditions,'' it said. Authorities
in the area, in the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia region of
northern China, were trying to rescue them, it said. Rivers swollen
to record levels in China's northeast already have crushed levees
and caused widespread destruction. Two dikes collapsed near Daqing,
a city of 2.3 million and China's largest oil field, forcing
thousands of people to evacuate. (CHINA-FLOODS)

Hundreds of Lebanese evacuees from Congo arrive home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hundreds of Lebanese who escaped the
escalating conflict in Congo arrived home Sunday, part of a growing
exodus of foreigners from the African nation.
	   Some 350 Lebanese, most of them women and children, arrived at
Beirut International Airport aboard a chartered Nigerian plane
after midnight Saturday. They flew from Kinshasa across the Congo
River to the Republic of Congo capital, Brazzaville, then home.
	   The weary-looking evacuees recounted stories of hardship they
experienced since an uprising by rebels against President Laurent
Kabila's military earlier this month escalated into an insurgency.
	   Most of them said they had been living without water and
electricity since the start of the conflict.
	   At least 800 Lebanese, many of them businessmen, were still in
Congo awaiting evacuation, said Haitham Jumaa, director general at
the Ministry of Immigration Affairs.
	   Tens of thousands of Lebanese have settled in West African
countries after fleeing the 1975-90 civil war in their country,
establishing successful businesses and, in some cases, making
significant contributions to local economies. But their wealth has
sometimes provoked local resentment.

Final day of Botha trial approaches in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ After hours of testimony and
intense courtroom drama, the trial of apartheid President P. W.
Botha enters its final day of argument on Monday.
	   Lawyers for Botha, who is accused of snubbing a panel probing
human rights abuses committed during white rule, are expected to
spend several hours summing up before the case is adjourned until
Aug. 24 for a verdict.
	   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison has already completed his own
summation.
	   Botha, 82, has ignored three legal summonses to appear before
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, claiming it is conducting
a witch hunt against whites and wants to humiliate him by forcing a
personal appearance.
	   The case symbolizes racial tensions in a country still emerging
from years of oppression after 1994's all-race elections ended
apartheid.
	   Blacks relish seeing a black judge, Magistrate Victor Lugaju,
stand in judgment over Botha, who ruled with an iron fist
throughout the worst violence of the 1980s anti-apartheid struggle.
	   Unlike conservative whites who have rallied round Botha, some
blacks see the Truth Commission as too soft on whites, while taking
a hard line against their own leaders, such as Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela.
	   During the trial Botha, who has not testified, has sat
impassively as Truth Commission witnesses detailed evidence that a
security body he headed sanctioned the killing of anti-apartheid
activists.
	   If found guilty of contempt, Botha faces up to two years in jail
or an unspecified fine. A fine is seen as more likely due to his
age and frail health.
	   ``It is extremely unlikely that the court is going to send an
aged and sickly man to jail,'' said Prof. Tom Lodge, a political
scientist from Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg.
	   As usual, security will be tight, with barbed wire and armed
police ringing the court building in George, a small coastal town
about 240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town and near Botha's
retirement home at Wilderness.

Car bomb kills 28 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Blair flies home, other details; edits &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police sifting the wreckage
caused by a car bomb that killed 28 people and injured 220 said
suspicion was falling on IRA dissidents determined to shatter
Northern Ireland's fledgling peace accord.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair interrupted an Italian vacation to fly
to Belfast to coordinate his government's response to the
province's worst single attack in 30 years of conflict.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police commander Ronnie Flanagan said Sunday a misleading
telephone warning caused his officers to move people close to a car
packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220 kilos) of explosives.
	   ''It is fair to say that our focus at this point in time would
be on those who call themselves the 32 County Sovereignty
Movement,'' IRA dissidents opposed to the peace accord who also go
by the name Real IRA, Flanagan told British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   Before boarding a flight home, a tearful Blair told reporters
the attack was ''a blast of evil'' perpetrated by ''a tiny,
fanatical group of people'' without any support in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We will not let these people wreck the future _ the future
belongs to the decent people of Northern Ireland, it does not
belong to the criminals and psychopaths,'' he said.
	   IRA dissidents, who are committed to shattering the outlawed
group's 13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped
inspire, have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
In July British and Irish police said they had foiled a bombing
campaign in London.
	   Ahern promised Saturday that the dissidents, believed to number
no more than 100 and mostly based in the Irish Republic, will be
``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   The dead are 13 women, six men, and nine children, including a
baby girl and several teen-agers. Hospitals across the province
said they were treating more than 100 people, at least 10 of them
in critical condition. Police said 11 of the injured are Spanish,
but could not confirm hospital reports that one of the Spaniards
had died.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' he said.
	   Political analysts considered his phrase significant because
Adams has steadfastly refused to condemn violence by the IRA or its
dissident factions in the past.
	   But David Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the new
108-seat Northern Ireland Assembly where Catholics and Protestants
share power, said that Adams' party should take some blame for the
bombing because of the amount of illegal arms and explosives still
held by the IRA and other paramilitary groups.
	   ``Sinn Fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody
atrocity,'' Trimble said.
	   In a statement, Queen Elizabeth II said she was ``shocked to
hear of the appalling crime in Omagh.''
	   George Mitchell, the former U.S. Senate majority leader who
chaired Northern Ireland's peace talks, blamed ``a very tiny
minority of cowards and murderers that are trying to destroy a
process that is supported by an overwhelming majority of the people
of Northern Ireland.''
	   The explosion came 40 minutes after a telephoned warning to the
BBC in Belfast claimed a bomb had been left outside Omagh's
courthouse on the west end of downtown. Police directed people away
from the area, many of them nearer to the bomb.
	   ``I saw bodies lying everywhere, dead people being zipped into
bags,'' said Dorothy Boyle, 59, a Catholic resident of the town.
	   ``The bodies were lying there with water running over them from
burst pipes. There were limbs lying about that had been blown off
people,'' she said, noting that one young pregnant woman had lost
her legs.
	   The streets surrounding the bomb site were strewn with glass and
rubble _ and streaked with blood.
	   ``The carnage, the children, a young baby _ pure black,
unrecognizable,'' said Frank Hancock, a Protestant who was too
stunned to cry. ``A young girl down a manhole that we had to pull
out. A young lad burning, his hair pure singeing.
	   ``Any man who puts that (bomb) there,'' he said, pointing
angrily at the bomb site, ``and says, `We're the ``real'' IRA' _
they're cowards.''
	   The attack coincided with the 29th anniversary of the deployment
of British troops in Belfast, a traditional rallying point for
Irish Republican Army supporters, and 17 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton arrives to salute the compromise April agreement. The
White House said Clinton's plans would not be affected.

China's miseries continue with rivers flooding north and south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with new flood surge on Yangtze,
other details; adds byline
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Compounding China's flood miseries, a river burst
its banks in the north, stranding 146,000 people, while further
south, millions prepared to battle a new surge of floodwaters on
the Yangtze River, state media said Sunday.
	   The new Yangtze flood crest _ the sixth so far in a summer that
has seen the river's heaviest flooding in 44 years _ comes as dikes
that protect cities and farmland downstream already are
waterlogged, flood-weakened and threatening to give way.
	   In central Hubei, among the provinces hardest hit by the summer
floods that have killed more than 2,000 people and made millions
homeless, more than 2 million army and civilian flood fighters were
preparing for the Yangtze's latest surge, the Wenhui Daily said.
	   The ``situation is still extremely serious, there can be no let
up,'' the official newspaper said.
	   In northeast China, flood workers worked frantically to
reinforce dikes along the swollen Nen river, using cars and even
horse-drawn carts to bring in earth, stones, wood and sacking, the
Beijing Evening News said.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in north China's Inner Mongolia region
were trying to rescue 76,000 people stranded ``in dangerous
conditions'' by the flooded Ulyji Muren river, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   Another 70,000 people cut off by the river already had been
rescued, it said.
	   Rivers swollen to record levels in China's northeast already
have crushed levees and caused widespread destruction. Two dikes
collapsed near Daqing, a city of 2.3 million and China's largest
oil field, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
	   With efforts to repair both breaches abandoned, flood fighters
were concentrating on reinforcing secondary levees that safeguard
Daqing, Xinhua said.
	   ``We well definitely protect the oil fields. Don't worry about
that,'' said Chai Fa, a spokesman for Daqing's Petroleum
Administration Office.
	   Xinhua said 355 of Daqing's 20,000 oil wells were inundated,
cutting daily production by 807 tons. Daqing's 60.9 million tons of
crude last year accounted for half of China's output.
	   Daqing authorities fired a top city official for not properly
overseeing a levee that sprang a leak, the official Worker's Daily
said.
	   Dong Zhenju, deputy head of Daqing's Agriculture Bureau, didn't
bother checking the leak for himself and failed to organize repair
efforts, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected to bring the worst floods since 1949
to Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang province that borders
Russia, Xinhua said.
	   Li Peng, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party after party boss
Jiang Zemin, said the Songhua river that runs through Harbin will
very likely surpass its record high, and he urged the city to
``keep on high alert and prepare for the worst,'' Xinhua said.
	   During a tour of the flood-hit northeast last Friday, Li said a
large reservoir to accumulate water would be built on the Nen
river's upper reaches after its record breaking floodwaters recede,
Xinhua said.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The sound of heavy and small weapons fire
shook Togo's capital for several hours Sunday morning amid
government warnings for civilians to remain indoors, saying unnamed
attackers were shelling from neighboring Ghana.
	   Sirens wailed and at least one Togolese military aircraft zoomed
low above the city of Lome as state radio broadcast a government
plea for residents to remain calm, saying Togolese troops had been
deployed to the border areas west of the city where the government
said shelling was directed.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the shooting and no
reports of casualties.
	   Kofi Totobi Quakyi, the Ghanaian minister responsible for
national security, said the government was dispatching a team of
officials and soldiers to the border area to investigate the
reports, but had no further immediate information.
	   Steady machine gun fire and heavier explosions first pierced the
silence in several Lome neighborhoods near Ghana's border shortly
after dawn, prompting frightened civilians on their way to church
to scurry home.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A suspect in the recent bombing of
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested in Pakistan and
handed over to Kenya, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
	   A brief ministry statement said the suspect, identified as
Mohammad Sadik Howaida, was arrested and interrogated soon after
his arrival from Nairobi at the Karachi airport on Aug. 7, the day
of the nearly simultaneous bombings that killed a total of 257
people in both countries.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused immediate comment. A day
earlier, U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents were headed
to Pakistan to question the man.
	   ``On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts,
he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law,'' the Pakistani
Foreign Ministry statement said. It identified Howaida as an ``Arab
national'' without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually
means someone from anywhere in the Middle East.
	   The statement did not say when or how Howaida was sent to Kenya,
but a government source told The Associated Press it was Friday, a
week after the bombing.
	   The source, who insisted on anonymity, said investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and Saudi multimillionaire Osama
bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for the
last two years.
	   U.S. officials say bin Laden, among the world's most militant
sponsors of terrorism and vocal in his hatred of the United States,
was a possible suspect in the African bombings.
	   The source said Howaida told his interrogators that several
conspirators who left Nairobi a few days before him had already
passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan, as he had planned to do.
	   The source said that though U.S. investigators traveled to
Karachi, Pakistani officials questioned the man and decided to turn
him over to Kenya instead of the United States. It was not clear if
the United States had requested custody of Howaida and been
refused.
	   When Mir Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani later convicted in the United
States of killing two CIA employees, was arrested in Pakistan in
June 1997 in a joint FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis
accused their government of groveling before U.S. power.
	   The government source said the suspect was detained at the
Karachi airport because immigration officials noticed he did not
match the photograph in the passport he was carrying. When he tried
to bribe the officials, he was arrested, the newspaper said.
	   Pakistani newspapers identified the suspect by a slightly
different name, Mohammed Sadique.
	   The national newspaper The News, quoting unidentified government
sources Sunday, said the suspect confessed to planning the
bombings. The News said he received help in Kenya from sympathizers
with connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania. The group is considered the successor to the
groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.

Pope on bombing: `Don't yield to violence'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II prayed Sunday
for those lost their lives in the bombing in Northern Ireland and
urged people there to keep their faith in the peace process.
	   ``I hope for the dear island that the people of goodwill will
not yield to violence. I hope they can preserve the peaceful
cooperation on which the country depends,'' John Paul said in his
weekly Sunday address.
	   He called the bombing ``tragic and nonsensical,'' and evoked
eternal rest for those who died.
	   ``We evoke the blessing of God on the many injured, the familes
of the dead, and anybody who has confidence in the dialogue,'' he
added.
	   He spoke to a crowd gathered beneath his window of Castel
Gandolfo, a palace southeast of Rome that serves as his vacation
retreat.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The sound of heavy and small weapons fire
shook Togo's capital for several hours Sunday morning amid
government warnings for civilians to remain indoors, saying unnamed
attackers were shelling from neighboring Ghana.
	   Sirens wailed and at least one Togolese military aircraft zoomed
low above the city of Lome as state radio broadcast a government
plea for residents to remain calm, saying Togolese troops had been
deployed to the border areas west of the city where the government
said shelling was directed.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the shooting and no
reports of casualties.
	   Kofi Totobi Quakyi, the Ghanaian minister responsible for
national security, said the government was dispatching a team of
officials and soldiers to the border area to investigate the
reports, but had no further immediate information.
	   Steady machine gun fire and heavier explosions first pierced the
silence in several Lome neighborhoods near Ghana's border shortly
after dawn, prompting frightened civilians on their way to church
to scurry home.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police set up roadblocks Sunday and conducted house-to-house
searches for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt for Awadallah, setting up
roadblocks on Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and
elsewhere in the West Bank, the army said.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside to escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu said was concerned and looking into the escape,
Bushinsky said.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority last April
and accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif, whose
mangled body was found March 29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb
blast in Ramallah. The Palestinian Authority said Sharif was killed
as the result of an internal feud, a claim angrily denied by Hamas.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub said recently that
Awadallah had confessed to Sharif's killing and would be tried.
	   Hamas has accused Israel of killing Sharif with the help of the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas leaders questioned Sunday whether Awadallah had really
escaped.
	   ``We don't have any information _ the Palestinian Authority did
not inform us officially about him,'' said Ismail Abu Shanab, a top
Hamas official in the Gaza Strip.
	   Abu Shanab said Awadallah had been tortured in prison. ``We hold
the Palestinian Authority responsible for his safety inside and
outside the prison,'' he said.
	   Awadallah's brother Adel has been on the run for several years
and is wanted by Israeli officials for allegedly masterminding
several Hamas bombing attacks in Jerusalem.

Car bomb kills 28 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in graf 2 that two Spanish tourists confirmed dead;
CORRECTS that Blair was in France; REMOVES reference to political
analysts in graf 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police sifting the wreckage
caused by a car bomb that killed 28 people and injured 220 in the
worst single attack in Northern Ireland in 30 years said suspicion
was falling on IRA dissidents determined to shatter a fledgling
peace accord.
	   As Prime Minister Tony Blair interrupted his vacation in France
to fly to Belfast, the Spanish government confirmed that two
Spaniards were among the dead. They are believed to be the first
foreign tourists to die in the conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police commander Ronnie Flanagan said Sunday a misleading
telephone warning caused his officers to move people close to a car
packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220 kilos) of explosives.
	   ``It is fair to say that our focus at this point in time would
be on those who call themselves the 32 County Sovereignty
Movement,'' IRA dissidents opposed to the peace accord who also go
by the name Real IRA, Flanagan told British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   Before boarding a flight home, a tearful Blair told reporters
the attack was ``a blast of evil'' perpetrated by ``a tiny,
fanatical group of people'' without any support in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We will not let these people wreck the future _ the future
belongs to the decent people of Northern Ireland, it does not
belong to the criminals and psychopaths,'' he said.
	   IRA dissidents, who are committed to shattering the outlawed
group's 13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped
inspire, have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
In July British and Irish police said they had foiled a bombing
campaign in London.
	   Ahern promised Saturday that the dissidents, believed to number
no more than 100 and mostly based in the Irish Republic, will be
``ruthlessly suppressed.''
	   The dead are 13 women, six men, and nine children, including a
baby girl and several teen-agers. Hospitals across the province
said they were treating more than 100 people, at least 10 of them
in critical condition. The Spanish foreign ministry said two
Spaniards _ a boy and a girl _ were dead and another 12 were
injured.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, said he
was ``totally horrified'' by the bombing. ``I condemn it without
any equivocation whatsoever,'' he said.
	   The phrase is significant because Adams has steadfastly refused
to condemn violence by the IRA or its dissident factions in the
past.

Myanmar board to probe graft charges against former ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Corruption charges against three former
cabinet ministers will be taken up by a three-member preliminary
board of inquiry formed last month, according to an official
announcement from Myanmar's government seen Sunday.
	   The announcement of the board's establishment, published in an
issue of the government gazette dated August 7, comes after months
of speculation that investigation of the alleged graft had fallen
dormant.
	   The board is to examine the report of the National Intelligence
Bureau which found that former commerce minister Lt. Gen. Tun Kyi,
former transport minister. Lt. Gen. Thein Win and former
agriculture minister Lt. Gen. Myint Aung acquired assets and
properties by illegal means.
	   It is to report its findings to the government at the earliest
date, the gazette said.
	   The three former ministers were removed from office during a
major cabinet reshuffle in November last year when more than half
the ministers and deputy ministers in the previous military
government were dropped amid rumors of corruption at high levels.
	   At the same time the ruling junta underwent a name change from
the State Law and Order Restoration Council to the State Peace and
Development Council.
	   Investigations for corruption involving senior officials in the
ministries of commerce, agriculture and transport began last year.
	   But in recent months little had been heard about the probes,
leading some outsiders to speculate they might have been derailed,
for political or other reasons.
	   Constituted on July 26, the preliminary board of enquiry is led
by Minister of the State Peace and Development Council Chairman's
Office Lt. Gen. Min Thein, and also includes Deputy Home Minister
Brig. Gen. Thura Myint Maung and Deputy Minister for the Council
Chairman's Office Set Maung, the official gazette said.

Bank chief: price of settlement not too high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The price paid by Switzerland's two
biggest commercial banks to settle Holocaust survivors' claims
against them was realistic, the chief executive of the biggest bank
was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``Of course the sum is very large,'' Marcel Ospel of United Bank
of Switzerland said of Wednesday's agreement to pay dlrs 1.25
billion.
	   ``It would certainly have been far lower three years ago, and
marginal 10, 20 or 40 years ago,'' he added in an interview with
the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung.
	   Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, the other bank involved,
told Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick that it was ``a defensible
agreement.''
	   The settlement involves the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank, other commercial banks and Swiss industry.
	   In Switzerland, relief at the settlement continued to be
tempered by caution.
	   While Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin, in a SonntagsZeitung
interview, said he was happy that a ``vicious circle'' of sanctions
had been avoided, Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger told Swiss radio
that it left a ``slightly unpleasant aftertaste.''
	   ``It will take a lot of commitment for the settlement to be
understood in domestic circles,'' Gut conceded. ``Only then will we
be able to breathe a sigh of relief.''
	   It received a cautious reaction from Switzerland's main
political parties. The Socialist Party welcomed it, but said many
questions remained. Two center-right parties expressed doubts that
it would defuse tension.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
he regretted that a combination of legal action and sanction
threats had achieved its objective.
	   The government issued a statement restating its position that
the settlement is a matter for those involved. It did not take part
in negotiations and is committed to nothing by the agreement.
	   The commercial banks say they expect ``other Swiss companies and
institutions'' to help finance the settlement.
	   Ospel said he hopes the Swiss National Bank will ``show
financial solidarity,'' while Gut spoke of ``positive signals''
from industry.
	   The main political parties oppose any contribution by the
central bank, which has called an extraordinary board meeting for
Friday to discuss the settlement. Swiss newspapers have expressed
mixed opinions over such a contribution.
	   Whether or not it contributes ``is the central bank's problem,''
Couchepin said. ``Who pays the check is not my problem. The banks
will find the necessary money.''

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police set up roadblocks
and conducted house-to-house searches Sunday in a massive manhunt
for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Israeli troops joined the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank, the army said.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in April and
accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif, whose mangled
body was found March 29 at the scene of a massive car-bomb blast in

African crime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Taking a break from the PGA
tournament in Seattle, top golfer Ernie Els called a Johannesburg
newspaper to blast uncontrolled crime in his native South Africa.
	   His farm in the Western Cape Province was burgled for the second
time this year, by a man who allegedly had just murdered four
people on a nearby farm.
	   ``Our rights as human beings are being taken away from us,'' Els
was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying. ``We're not safe and no
one seems to care.''
	   Since 1994's first all-race vote ended apartheid, crime has
spiralled out of control, giving South Africa one of the world's
highest crime rates.
	   The golfer said crime in South Africa had gotten so bad that he
dreaded post-match news conferences, where the topic often comes
up.
	   He attacked President Nelson Mandela's decision to free 9,000
criminals six months before their sentences were up, as a gesture
of mercy on his 80th birthday July 18.
	   But he said he would always return to South Africa because
``that's where my heart is.''

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A new 35 million dinar (dlrs 114.37 million)
waterfront entertainment center will open to the public the
beginning of next month, the Arab Times daily reported Sunday.
	   The facility, called Al-Sharq, will be the fourth largest in the
world, David Tanbouz, project manager, told the newspaper. He said
he expected it to attract 25,000 visitors a day.
	   Built on 300,000 square meters (360,000 square yards) of land
mostly reclaimed from the sea, Al-Sharq features a marina, a health
club, shopping malls, a fishing pier, restaurants and theaters.
	   The National Real Estate Co., which built the project on
government land in Kuwait City, will own and manage it for 25
years.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Turkey has signed dlrs 228 million dollars
in contracts with Iraq under U.N.-administered exemptions to
sanctions, a weekly Iraqi magazine reported Sunday.
	   The contracts were signed since the program went into effect in
December 1996, Al-Musawir Al-Arabi said.
	   Turkey was one of Iraq's main trading partners before the United
Nations imposed sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A proposed coastal city in Subiya, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) from the Iraqi border, would cost the government 1.8
billion dinars (dlrs 5.9 billion), al-Qabas daily reported Sunday.
	   The government said in 1995 it was considering the revival of a
pre-Gulf War plan to build the city, but the cost of the project
was not revealed then.
	   If the plan is approved, the city will be built in three stages
over a period of 20 years, the newspaper quoted a state study as
saying. It is designed for a population of 260,000 who will live on
an area of 25,000 hectares.
	   Subiya City would solve the problem of thousands who have been
waiting for government housing, the study said. It will also create
job and investment opportunities.
	   Iraq invaded this small oil-rich state eight years ago and
occupied it for seven months before a U.S.-led coalition drove
Iraqi troops out in February 1991.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The profits of one of Jordan's main
pharmaceutical firms surged by 68.4 percent to 3.2 million dinars
(dlrs 4.5 million) in the first half of the year over the same
period in 1997.
	   The profits were a result of more markets that Dar al-Dawa
exported to in Africa and Europe this year, the company's market
manager, Mahmoud Ja'abari, said Sunday.
	   He told The Associated Press that sales amounted to 15.4 million
dinars (dlrs 21.7 million) between January and June this year, a
60.4 percent increase over the same period last year.
	   He added that the firm, which was established in 1975 with
capital of 6 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 8.4 million), plans to
set up joint ventures with Saudi-Arabia and Algeria.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government has imported more than a
million bottles of mineral water to meet increased demand resulting
from acute shortages following reports of the contamination of
drinking water in Amman.
	   The Trade Ministry said Sunday the bottled mineral water was
imported from neighboring Saudi Arabia and Syria.
	   It did not provide an estimate for the value of the import, but
said each bottle would be sold at .3 dinars (dlrs 0.42) _ same as
the price of the bottled Jordanian water.
	   There are five main Jordanian firms producing mineral water. But
they have been unable to meet the demand of residents of the posh
suburbs of Amman who have been complaining that water flowing out
of taps the last six weeks has an odor and contained worms and
larvae.
	   Water and Irrigation Minister Munther Haddadin, who was accused
of negligence in supervising water purification, resigned last
week.
	   King Hussein has ordered a committee to probe the allegations on
the pollution of the water.
	   ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria and the European Union have signed
an agreement to facilitate European aid to Syria, the Tishrin
government newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The aid will be given as donations from EU sources or loans from
the European Investment Bank to support Syria's development efforts
and help a Syria-European partnership, the newspaper said.
	   Signing the agreement Saturday was Tawfiq Ismail, the Syrian
deputy state minister for planning affairs, Alan Waddams, and the
EU representative in Damascus.

Devastated parents weep for their lost, maimed young

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Weeping and shaking, a father
grieved Sunday for his soccer-mad 12-year-old son, whose leg was
blown off in a deadly bombing.
	   Another recounted how he waited for hours for news of his
17-year-old daughter, only to have confirmed what he already knew
instinctively: she was one of 28 people killed in Northern
Ireland's worst single attack in 30 years of sectarian
''troubles.''
	   Under gray skies that wept a light rain, many in the usually
bustling market town of Omagh went to church to pray Sunday _ or
gathered in small, subdued groups near the site of the devastating
car bombing a day earlier on a busy street packed with shoppers.
	   Many relatives of the dead and injured spent the night at the
main leisure center in Omagh, where volunteers handed out tea and
other refreshments. Now and then, a family would receive bad news,
and leave in tears.
	   Tommy Logue, an Omagh resident, had to wait until Sunday morning
to learn that his daughter Brenda had been killed.
	   He had suspected the worst. ``I knew all along that she was
dead,'' he said, his voice breaking. ``The front of the shop where
I knew her to be was completely blown out _ nobody could survive
that.''
	   Hospitals said they were treating more than 100 victims,
including some children. At least 10 of the injured are in critical
condition. The Spanish foreign ministry confirmed that two
Spaniards were among the dead, believed to be the first foreign
tourists killed in the conflict in Northern Ireland. Another 12
Spaniards were injured.
	   In Omagh, the community rallied round. Social workers, police,
medical staff and local political representatives _ as well as a
host of religious ministers , both Catholic and Proestant _ offered
assistance and taxi drivers provided free transport to the
bereaved. In the few shops that opened Sunday, the mood was somber.
	   Father Eugene Hasson, the Catholic chaplain at the Omagh's
Tyrone County Hospital, said there was no one in the small market
town ``who has not been affected by this to a greater or lesser
degree.''
	   In his house in a quiet Omagh street, Lindsay Hall shakingly
wiped tears from his face with a towel as he surveyed pictures of
his three sons. His youngest, Alastair, ''was out with his mum
buying some trousers for going back to school when the warning
came,'' he said.
	   ``They came out of the shop and tried to get back to the car. If
they'd stayed in the shop they would both have been killed.''
Lindsay said. His son lost his leg.
	   ``He's only 12. I'm 57, why couldn't it have happened to me?''
said Lindsay, who toyed with a rugby ball.
	   ''Alastair loved playing (sports), but he will never be able to
again now.''

Police charge three men for blackmail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Three men were charged with blackmail Sunday
after they allegedly attempted to extort 15 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.9 million) from a major Hong Kong property
company, police reported.
	   A police statement said the suspects, whose names were not
disclosed, will appear in court on Monday.
	   They were among five people arrested in police raids on Friday
for allegedly threatening to beat up employees of Sun Hung Kai
Properties if the company did not pay the money.
	   Police have provided no details on the suspects. Sun Kai
Properties has denied reports that the blackmailers were former
employees.

Car bomb kills 28 in Northern Ireland's deadliest attack

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police sifting the wreckage
caused by a car bomb that killed 28 people and injured 220 in the
worst single attack in Northern Ireland in 30 years said suspicion
was falling on IRA dissidents determined to shatter a fledgling
peace accord.
	   As Prime Minister Tony Blair interrupted his vacation in France
to fly to Belfast, the Spanish government confirmed that two
Spaniards were among the dead. They are believed to be the first
foreign tourists to die in the conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   The blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms)
west of Belfast, came less than three months after voters in both
parts of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern
Ireland government with power shared between its majority
Protestants and minority Roman Catholics.
	   Police commander Ronnie Flanagan said Sunday a misleading
telephone warning caused his officers to move people close to a car
packed with an estimated 500 pounds (220 kilos) of explosives.
	   ``It is fair to say that our focus at this point in time would
be on those who call themselves the 32 County Sovereignty
Movement,'' IRA dissidents opposed to the peace accord who also go
by the name Real IRA, Flanagan told British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   Before boarding a flight home, a tearful Blair told reporters
the attack was ``a blast of evil'' perpetrated by ``a tiny,
fanatical group of people'' without any support in Northern
Ireland.
	   ``We will not let these people wreck the future _ the future
belongs to the decent people of Northern Ireland, it does not
belong to the criminals and psychopaths,'' he said.
	   IRA dissidents, who are committed to shattering the outlawed
group's 13-month-old truce and the April peace accord it helped
inspire, have planted several car bombs in other Northern Ireland
towns in recent months, which caused many injuries but no deaths.
In July British and Irish police said they had foiled a bombing
campaign in London.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern promised Saturday that the
dissidents, believed to number no more than 100 and mostly based in
the Irish Republic, will be ``ruthlessly suppressed.''

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police set up roadblocks Sunday and conducted house-to-house
searches for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank, the army said.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside to escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu said Israel was concerned and looking into the escape,
Bushinsky said.
	   Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian security in the West Bank, said
a committee had been appointed to investigate Awadallah's escape.
	   Awadallah, 29, was arrested by the Palestinian Authority last
April and accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif,
whose mangled body was found March 29 at the scene of a massive
car-bomb blast in Ramallah. The Palestinian Authority said Sharif
was killed as the result of an internal feud, a claim angrily
denied by Hamas.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub said recently that
Awadallah had confessed to Sharif's killing and would be tried.
	   Hamas has accused Israel of killing Sharif with the help of the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas leaders questioned Sunday whether Awadallah had really
escaped.
	   ``We don't have any information _ the Palestinian Authority did
not inform us officially about him,'' said Ismail Abu Shanab, a top
Hamas official in the Gaza Strip.
	   Abu Shanab said Awadallah had been tortured in prison. ``We hold
the Palestinian Authority responsible for his safety inside and
outside the prison,'' he said.
	   Awadallah's brother Adel has been on the run for several years
and is wanted by Israeli officials for allegedly masterminding
several Hamas bombing attacks in Jerusalem.
	   His mother, Kunuah, said Palestinian intelligence officials had
searched the house early Sunday.
	   ``They think he came to me? I haven't seen him in two years,''
she said.
	   ``I thank God he managed to escape and hope God will protect
him,'' said Awadallah's wife and the mother of his four children,
who gave her name only as Umm Ahmed.

Sudan fears starvation in government-controlled town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Thousands of civilians fleeing fighting
in southern Sudan are facing starvation in a government-controlled
town, and four people are dying daily, a local Sudanese official
was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   About 70,000 people face starvation because a daily influx of
between 150 and 200 civilians has depleted food stocks and
stretched medical care to its limits in Mairam, a town in Western
Kordofan Province in western Sudan, Fitnanom Kom said.
	   ``The situation is similar to the case of people in Wau,'' said
Kom, who serves as the political adviser to the Western Kordofan
government. He was referring to the capital of Bahr al-Ghazal, a
hard-hit area where dozens of people are dying daily.
	   Mairam is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Wau, just
north of Bahr al-Ghazal province.
	   In the interview with El-Osbu, Kom called on relief groups to
``move in quickly to remedy the deteriorating situation.''
	   U.N. officials in Khartoum could not confirm the conditions in
the town, but said they expected an assessment team to return by
Wednesday. Kom did not say when the exodus began.
	   Sudan's civil war started in 1983 when rebels took up arms
against the Muslim government in the north to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south. More than 1.5
million people have died in the battles and famines caused by them.
	   As of last month, 700,000 civilians faced starvation in Bahr
al-Ghazal's rebel-controlled areas.
	   Both sides have declared a temporary cease-fire to allow
international aid agencies to deliver food.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have taken the main
rebel stronghold in southwestern Kosovo in what appeared to be the
finale of a crackdown launched last month against ethnic Albanian
separatists, Serb sources reported Sunday.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was known as
the organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of
Kosovo.
	   According to a police statement carried by state-run Tanjug news
agency, Junik fell to the Serbs late Saturday, after nearly two
weeks under siege. No information from Albanian sources was
immediately available.
	   The report said members of the KLA tried to escape across the
border to Albanian but were blocked by army border guards and
eventually ``broken down'' and dispersed into mountain forests.
Four policemen died in the operation, it said.
	   A reporter from Belgrade-based independent radio B92 who visited
Junik said up to 1,000 rebel fighters were believed to have been
based in Junik, along with several hundred civilians. Radio B92
reported the village was deserted, but did not appear to be
seriously damaged.
	   Junik, some 75 kilometers (50 miles) west of Pristina, first
made headlines in June when top U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, paid
a surprise visit to KLA fighters there. The KLA is fighting for the
independence of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians account for 90
percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   Over the past weeks government forces purged the KLA from
several other major strongholds. Gains by government forces,
however, have proved difficult to maintain.
	   Albanian analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
following the recent series of defeats the KLA is regrouping and
reorganizing. They said the independence-seeking organization is
determined to continue its fight, most likely with hit-and-run
actions.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center claimed fighting
continued Sunday in the village Logja and that heavy artillery had
destroyed part of the village. Government forces reportedly used
army tanks and helicopters to attack Logja Saturday, along with
eight other villages in the area some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   There was no word on casualties and journalists were prevented
from reaching the area.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was trying to reach the Logja area
Sunday, where there were believed to be a number of displaced
people, spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   ``It's all a very alarming picture,'' he said of the weekend's
fighting. ``But no one really has access to the area,'' so it's
hard to tell what the situation is.
	   Janowski said they were also concerned about reports of an
attack on woods around Decane, where around 20,000 displaced people
were reportedly camped. Reporters traveling the Pec-Decane road saw
several destroyed villages in the area, some still burning, radio
B92 said.
	   While Serb forces shelled the villages in an attempt to force
the rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade invited moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's team to start negotiations as
early as next week.
	   But his party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said its hopes
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was serious about peace
talks.
	   Rugova had said earlier that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. In any event, Rugova has been unable
to persuade the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join him.

China's miseries continue with rivers flooding north and south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of river heading for point where dikes
could be dynamited in graf 5, slight editing to trim
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Compounding China's flood miseries, a river burst
its banks in the north, stranding 146,000 people, while further
south, millions prepared to battle a new surge of floodwaters on
the Yangtze River, state media said Sunday.
	   The Yangtze flood crest _ the sixth so far in a summer that has
seen the river's heaviest flooding in 44 years _ threatened
waterlogged, flood-weakened dikes that protect cities and farmland
downstream.
	   In Hubei, a central province among the hardest hit by summer
floods that have killed more than 2,000 people and made millions
homeless, more than 2 million army and civilian flood fighters were
preparing for the new surge, the Wenhui Daily said.
	   The ``situation is still extremely serious, there can be no let
up,'' the official newspaper said.
	   The Yangtze at Hubei's Shashi city could surpass a record 45
meters (148.5 feet), state television reported. That was the level
state media have said could prompt officials to dynamite dikes to
divert water away from the Yangtze, safeguarding cities downstream
by deliberately flooding an area south of Shashi where 500,000
people live.
	   In northeast China, flood workers worked frantically to
reinforce dikes along the swollen Nen river, using cars and even
horse-drawn carts to bring in earth, stones, wood and sacking, the
Beijing Evening News said.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in north China's Inner Mongolia region
were trying to rescue 76,000 people stranded ``in dangerous
conditions'' by the flooded Ulyji Muren river, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   Another 70,000 people cut off by the river already had been
rescued, it said.
	   Rivers swollen to record levels in China's northeast already
have crushed levees and caused widespread destruction. Two dikes
collapsed near Daqing, a city of 2.3 million and China's largest
oil field, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
	   With efforts to repair both breaches abandoned, flood fighters
were concentrating on reinforcing secondary levees that safeguard
Daqing, Xinhua said.
	   ``We well definitely protect the oil fields. Don't worry about
that,'' said Chai Fa, a spokesman for Daqing's Petroleum
Administration Office.
	   Xinhua said 355 of Daqing's 20,000 oil wells were inundated,
cutting daily production by 807 tons. Daqing's 60.9 million tons of
crude last year accounted for half of China's output.
	   Daqing authorities fired a top city official for not properly
overseeing a levee that sprang a leak, the official Worker's Daily
said.
	   Dong Zhenju, deputy head of Daqing's Agriculture Bureau, didn't
bother checking the leak for himself and failed to organize repair
efforts, the newspaper said.
	   Heavy rains were expected to bring the worst floods since 1949
to Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang province that borders
Russia, Xinhua said.
	   Li Peng, No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party after party boss
Jiang Zemin, said the Songhua river that runs through Harbin will
very likely surpass its record high, and he urged the city to
``keep on high alert and prepare for the worst,'' Xinhua said.
	   During a tour of the flood-hit northeast last Friday, Li said a
large reservoir to accumulate water would be built on the Nen
river's upper reaches after its record breaking floodwaters recede,
Xinhua said.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two Spaniards were killed and
another 12 were injured in the deadly bombing in Omagh, the Spanish
foreign ministry said Sunday. They are believed to be the first
foreign tourists to die in the conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   News reports said the dead were a schoolboy and his female
teacher. The victims were part of a group of 26 schoolchildren and
two teachers, most of them from Madrid, who had been staying in the
Irish Republic to learn English and came to Omagh to attend its
festival this weekend, the reports said.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes is expected to fly to
Omagh to visit the wounded.
	   Three of the injured are in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital in
Belfast. One, a teen-age girl, is described as critical. Others are
being treated at Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital.
	   Police could only confirm that 11 Spanish nationals were injured
in the bombing in the center of the bustling market town of Omagh.
	   ``We are in the process of informing families in Spain,'' said a
spokesman for the royal Ulster Constabulary, speaking on condition
of anonymity.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police set up roadblocks
and conducted house-to-house searches Sunday in a massive manhunt
for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Israeli troops joined the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank, the army said.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian security in the West Bank, said
a committee had been appointed to investigate Awadallah's escape.

Uzbek president visits border with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of the former Soviet republic of
Uzbekistan visited his country's border with Afghanistan and
concluded that his compatriots would be able to keep the peace at
home, the Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
	   ``I could see that the people are confident in their own
strength. Such a nation is invincible,'' President Islam Karimov
was quoted as saying after his visit Saturday to the border town of
Termez. He said he had wanted to check on the population's mood.
	   Karimov and other Central Asian leaders have expressed worry
over the fighting in Afghanistan, where the Taliban offensive has
practically reached their southern borders. The Central Asian
leaders are concerned about a spillover of violence as well as more
pressure from Islamic fundamentalists on their secular governments.
	   Karimov said that ``although the situation on the border is
rather complicated, we are ready to defend ourselves and safeguard
peace and tranquility in Uzbekistan,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The people of Afghanistan must follow Uzbekistan's example and
live in peace. We shall be ready to help Afghanistan then, and
supply it with food and bread.''
	   Several of the Central Asian leaders have blamed what they call
radical Muslim groups for violence on their territories. Earlier
this year, Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan formed an alliance to
oppose aggressive Islamic fundamentalism in mostly Muslim Central
Asia.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A team of experts from the International
Telecommunication Union are expected to arrive here Sunday for
meetings with Iraqi officials on upgrading the telecommunications
network, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   Eric Falt told The Associated Press that the Jordanian,
Ukrainian and British experts will meet with officials from the
transport and communications ministry on ways of spending dlrs 150
million earmarked for the telecommunications sector under the
fourth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food agreement.
	   The Geneva-based Union is an arm of the United Nations. Iraq's
telecommunications network was badly damaged during the 1990-91
Gulf conflict following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   Falt said the dlrs 150 million would be made available for the
telecommunications sector only if Iraq met the enhanced oil sales
of dlrs 5.2 billion every six months _ the quota approved for the
fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal which started in June.

Taiwan charities launch aid drive for Indonesian rape victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TPE101

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese charities and religious leaders
called on Indonesia Sunday to protect its ethnic-Chinese minority
from racial attacks and launched a campaign to aid women and girls
raped during the violence in May.
	   ``We call on the Indonesian government to consolidate the work
of rooting out racial prejudice,'' said a statement issued by a
collection of human rights groups and a Taipei radio station.
	   The groups did not provide specific details on how to aid rape
victims, but Joseph Kang Ti, Catholic archbishop of Taipei, said
healing their psychological scars through counseling and therapy
should be a priority.
	   About 1,200 people died in rioting over price increases in May
that helped force the resignation of former strong man Suharto.
Women's groups say at least 168 women were raped by rioters, twenty
of whom were killed by their attackers or later died of their
wounds.
	   Most rape victims were believed to have been ethnic Chinese, who
make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population of 202 million but
play a dominant role in the country's economy. Resentment and
suspicion of Chinese often turns into violence and rumors have been
circulating in Jakarta that riots will erupt again on national
independence day Monday.
	   Outrage over the May rioting has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests, some of them outside Indonesian
diplomatic offices, in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United
States.
	   Indonesia has condemned the rapes and said it would provide
counseling for victims.

Major ethnic Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have taken the main
rebel stronghold in southwestern Kosovo in what appeared to be the
finale of a crackdown launched last month on ethnic Albanian
separatists, Serb sources said Sunday.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was the
organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for the independence of
Kosovo from Serbia.
	   A police statement carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency
said Junik fell to the Serbs late Saturday, after nearly two weeks
under siege. No information from ethnic Albanian sources was
immediately available.
	   The report said members of the KLA tried to escape into Albania
but were blocked by border guards and eventually ``broken down''
and dispersed into mountain forests. Four policemen died in the
operation, it said.
	   A reporter from Belgrade-based independent radio B92 who visited
Junik said up to 1,000 rebel fighters were believed to have been
based there, along with several hundred civilians. Radio B92
reported that the village was deserted, but did not appear
seriously damaged.
	   Junik, some 75 kilometers (50 miles) west of Pristina, first
made headlines in June when top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke paid a
surprise visit to KLA fighters there.
	   The KLA is fighting for the independence of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of the province's 2 million
people. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   Over the past weeks government forces have purged the KLA from
several other major strongholds. Gains by government forces,
however, have proved difficult to maintain.
	   While Serb forces shelled several villages in an attempt to
force the rebels to retreat, the government in Belgrade invited
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's team to start
negotiations as early as next week.
	   His party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, said it hoped that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was serious about peace
talks.
	   Rugova had said earlier that the government offensive must stop
before peace talks can begin. In any event, Rugova has been unable
to persuade the KLA to join him.
	   Ethnic Albanian analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the KLA is regrouping and reorganizing. They said the
organization is determined to continue its fight, probably with
hit-and-run actions.
	   The pro-ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said fighting
continued Sunday in the village of Logja and that heavy artillery
had destroyed part of the village.
	   Government forces reportedly used army tanks and helicopters to
attack Logja on Saturday, along with eight other villages in the
area some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   There was no word on casualties and journalists not permitted
into the area.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was trying to reach the Logja area
Sunday, where there were believed to be a number of displaced
people, spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   ``It's all a very alarming picture,'' he said of the weekend's
fighting. ``But no one really has access to the area,'' so it's
hard to tell what the situation is.
	   Janowski said they were also concerned about reports of an
attack on woods around Decane, where around 20,000 displaced people
were reportedly camped. Reporters traveling the Pec-Decane road saw
several destroyed villages in the area, some still burning, radio
B92 said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov will visit
Russia later this month on the invitation of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, news agencies reported Sunday.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police set up roadblocks Sunday and conducted house-to-house
searches for an escaped Hamas leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank, the army said.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside to escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The Palestinians themselves say it was an inside job,''
Netanyahu told reporters Sunday. ``But we have no information as to
who helped and in what capacity or at what level, so we are still
investigating this as well.''

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Two years ago, Robert Karega joined rebels
who were determined to put an end to three decades of Mobutu Sese
Seko's dictatorship and mismanagement of the vast, central African
nation.
	   They chose Laurent Kabila as their leader and said they were
working for a better future for the country they would rename the
Congo.
	   Two weeks ago, Goma radio interrupted Karega's Sunday dinner in
this eastern Congolese town with an announcement that another
rebellion was underway. This time, he and his friends had little
idea what it was all about.
	   ``We were all surprised. Nobody expected things to change so
fast,'' said the 25-year-old political science graduate. ``We know
(President) Laurent Kabila is bad, but we don't see how this will
work and what will change.''
	   The two-week-old rebellion, spearheaded by ethnic Tutsis and
disgruntled officers and troops in the partially re-tooled
Congolese Army, has swept eastern and souuthwestern Congo with
surprising speed.
	   But as rebels are reported to be closing in on the capital,
Kinshasa, questions about the rebellion multiply.
	   Who are the people behind it? What do they want? And, what can
they deliver to the long-suffering 47 million people of the country
that is rich in natural resources, yet limping along at a
subsistence level?
	   The few identified rebel leaders, mainly disgruntled army
officers, say they're fighting for democracy and discipline in the
armed forces.
	   But for those on the sidelines, their objectives are not so
clear.
	   Karega works at several odd jobs to come up with the equivalent
in Congolese francs of dlrs 180 to pay for a year's studies.
	   Life in his hometown Goma, the capital of 30,000 of the
agriculturally rich northeastern Masisi region, is tough. There are
few job opportunities, political upheaval has added to insecurity
and the old state-run economic institutions are in shambles.
	   ``We're like hostages,'' said one Goma resident, who refused to
be identified for fear of reprisals. ``We're waiting to see what
will happen next. We've heard too many promises in the past.''
	   Two years ago when Kabila assumed the leadership of the
rebellion in the eastern town of Uvira, his speeches to
enthusiastic crowds were laced with rhetoric from his days as a
minor Maoist rebel in the 1970s. He spoke of justice and democracy
and promised to eradicate corruption, nepotism and tribal
favoritism that characterized the Mobutu years.
	   Now, he stands accused of exactly the same sins by the people
who put him in power _ his former Congolese supporters and his
erstwhile allies in Rwanda and Uganda.
	   In late 1996, leaders of Rwanda and Uganda used Mobutu's
persecution of ethnic Tutsis and his tolerance of the sprawling
refugee camps in border areas in eastern Zaire that housed Hutu
rebels as a pretext for intervening in support of Kabila's rebels.
	   This time, it was the witch-hunt against ethnic Tutsis and
Kabilia's expulsion of the Rwandan troops who had helped him gain
power and were training the Congolese army that sparked the
beginning of the rebel takeover of eastern Congo.
	   ``So far, it's a purely military affair,'' Karega said. ``We
suspect Rwanda is behind it again, but we don't exactly know why.''
	   Although Rwanda has repeatedly denied it backs the current
rebellion _ after belatedly acknowledging its support for the
previous one _ it is widely thought to be supplying vital
logistical support and troops that have made the blitzkrieg
possible.
	   Thousands of rebel troops are being ferried in big transport
planes from Goma to Kitona air base near the mouth of the Congo
River on the Atlantic Ocean. From there, they are moving up towards
Kinshasa in what appears to be part of a pincer movement.
	   ``It's a strange revolution. Somehow we're not part of it,''
Karega said.

Minorities fleeing Mazar-e-Sharif stopped on way to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Hundreds of minority Afghans fleeing a
northern city that recently fell to the Taliban are being by
Taliban authorities on the way to neighboring Pakistan, witnesses
and aid workers said Sunday.
	   Taliban officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Mohammad Ali, a bus driver who shuttles between Kabul and the
Pakistani border, said that since Tuesday, Taliban authorities have
stopped buses near Jalalabad, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Kabul and 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the border.
	   Passengers are questioned, ``and if they are found to be
Hazaras, Shiites or Uzbeks, they told them to get off the bus and
not allowed to continue to Pakistan,'' Ali said.
	   Ali and other drivers said those being detained were from
Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in northern Afghanistan, which
fell to Taliban fighters Aug. 8. The loss of the city about 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Kabul, the capital, was a major
blow to the northern-based opposition alliance, and one of several
recent victories for the Taliban.
	   The Taliban, who profess an extreme version of Islam, could soon
control all of Afghanistan. They have held the capital since 1996.
	   The Taliban, who like most Afghans are from the Pashtun ethnic
group and followers of the Sunni sect of Islam, have been accused
of harassing and killing minorities.
	   Aid workers who insisted on anonymity said hundreds of people
from the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic groups and the Shiite sect of
Islam who had fled Mazar-e-Sharif were being housed in schools near
Jalalabad that have been transformed into camps. The workers had
few details, saying they had not been asked to help care for the
displaced people.
	   The Taliban were accused of killing minorities after conquering
Mazar-e-Sharif. The Taliban suffered heavy losses in Mazar-e-Sharif
last year at the hands of Hazaras and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahadat
militia.
	   In a statement on Taliban radio Saturday night, Taliban
spokesman Abdul Manan Niyazi said that if Hazaras ``did not repeat
their previous deeds, they can continue their ordinary lives in
Afghanistan.''
	   A day earlier, Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar said in a
radio address that minorities would be treated equally under his
version of Islamic law.
	   Iranian radio reported that Afghans also fled north from
Mazar-e-Sharif toward Tajikistan. The former Soviet republic closed
its border shortly before Mazar-e-Sharif fell. Iranian radio said
some 10,000 refugees were at the border, in need of food and
medical aid.
	   In other developments Sunday:
	   _A Red Cross team flew to Mazar-e-Sharif to deliver medicine and
assess conditions at the city's hospitals and among prisoners of
war. A spokesman did not immediately have details on the team's
findings.
	   _Pakistani diplomats traveled to the southern Taliban stronghold
of Kandahar seeking information about 11 missing Iranians. Iran has
said it holds Pakistan responsible for its missing citizens, who
include diplomats. Pakistan rejects accusations from Iran and
others that it is supporting the Taliban war effort, but has said
it would do everything possible to trace the missing Iranians.

England collapse to 247 all out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A dramatic middle-order collapse restricted
England to 247 all out against Sri Lanka in the limited-overs
triangular series at Lord's Sunday.
	   After Graeme Hick and skipper Alec Stewart hit half centuries to
prop the innings, England _ comfortably placed on 223 for three in
the 45th over _ lost 7-24 in 35 balls to lose its way.
	   Sri Lanka won the toss and sent England into bat, claiming
opener Alistair Brown (12) in the third over and Nick Knight (17)
in the 11th over to have the home side 56 for two.
	   But Stewart (51) and Hick (86) hit the side out of trouble with
a 76-run third wicket stand.
	   Hick, who had scored 111 for Worcestershire against the tourists
in a one-day match, carried the form into the game as he anchored
the innings for two useful stands.
	   His partnership with Stewart was followed by a 91-run stand for
the fourth wicket with an inform Nasser Hussain (39) before the rot
set in.
	   Hussain, having brilliantly cover driven Kumara Dharmasena for
his first boundary, hit out wildly at the off-cutter and was
bowled.
	   Hick, who had failed miserably in his four test innings this
summer, hit a towering six off Dharmasena to add to four other
boundaries.
	   But with a century in sight, Hick was run out failing to beat a
throw from Marvan Atapattu to 'keeper Romesh Kaluwitharana as he
called Adam Hollioake for a quick single.
	   Television umpire Trevor Jesty gave Hick out after a long
deliberation, which required frame by frame slow motion replays
from different angles.
	   Arjuna Ranatunga, the 242-match veteran, switched his bowlers
around intelligently, especially the spinners when he had three of
them operating during the `slog' overs.
	   Sanath Jayasuriya, better known for his explosive batting, took
3-36 in his 10 overs despite going wicketless in his first eight
overs.
	   Jayasuriya and Dharmasena, shared the England spoils as the home
side was restricted to a gettable score.
	   World Cup champions, Sri Lanka, inflicted a heavy 57-run defeat
on South Africa in the tournament opener at Trent Bridge on Friday.
	   Medium pacemen Pramodaya Wickramasinghe and Suresh Perera,
finished with two wickets apiece.

Somali national conference postponed for fourth time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somalia's national reconciliation
conference has been postponed for a fourth time and will not be
held until January, faction leaders said Sunday.
	   The delay was announced in a statement after a two-day meeting
of faction leaders in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
	   The conference is supposed to set up Somalia's first national
government since 1991. First set for February in the southwestern
town of Baidoa, then March, then August, the conference is now
supposed to take place on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The statement blamed the delay on a lack of funds and
territorial disputes among clans.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre was ousted in 1991, and the country disintegrated into
fiefdoms protected by clan-based militias.
	   In December, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who runs the northern half of
the war-torn capital, and Hussein Mohammed Aidid, who controls most
of the southern half, and 22 other faction leaders agreed in Cairo
to form a government of transition.
	   But the Cairo agreement appears to be in trouble. A key sub-clan
leader, Hassan Osman Ali, known by his nickname Atto, and his ally,
Mohamed Sheikh Osman, walked out of the meeting in Mogadishu this
weekend.
	   ``The Cairo peace deal is now a total failure,'' Atto told
reporters.
	   He complained that Aidid had failed to pull his militiamen out
of the Bay and Bakol regions in the Baidoa area, as called for the
in the Cairo accord. He also said Aidid and Ali Mahdi refused to
share power in the capital.
	   ``There are entire clans and sub-clans who are not given their
share,'' he said.
	   Mogadishu was calm Sunday, but there were fears that the dispute
could erupt into clashes between supporters of Atto and those of
Ali Mahdi and Aidid. Rival fighters were assembled in several
camps.
	   Aidid was outside the country and did not attend the weekend
talks.
	   The last time Atto took offense at the growing power of Aidid's
Hawiye sub-clan in August 1996, his fighters took them on, and
Aidid's father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, died of battle wounds.

Schumacher wins Hungarian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Using a clever pit-stop strategy,
Michael Schumacher won the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday and
closed the gap on Mika Hakkinen in the Formula One championship.
	   Schumacher took the lead nearly two-thirds into the 77-lap race,
after all leading drivers went into the pits for the second time.
	   But the German was using a three-stop strategy. With less fuel
to weigh him down, Schumacher's Ferrari took off like a rocket,
gaining more than a second per lap over all the rivals.
	   By the time Schumacher went in for his third pit stop, he was so
far ahead that he easily went out again before he could be
overtaken.
	   Schumacher's fifth victory of the season gave him 10 points and
left him trailing Hakkinen by only seven points with four races
left in the year.
	   Hakkinen, the McLaren-Mercedes driver who led from the pole
until lap 46 when he went to the pit and Schumacher took over,
dropped back to sixth, one lap behind Schumacher, and gained only
one point.

Yokohama beats Swallows 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takuro Ishii batted in a tie-breaking run in the
top of the ninth inning Sunday to lift the Central League's
front-running Yokohama BayStars to a 4-2 victory over the Yakult
Swallows.
	   Ishii belted a solo homer in the first inning to give Yokohama a
1-0 lead in the game at Jingu Stadium in Tokyo.
	   The Swallows' winning streak stopped at three.
	   At the Nagoya Dome, Tomoaki Kanemoto hit a tie-breaking solo
homer in the top of the seventh inning to help the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp beat the Chunichi Dragons 3-1.
	   Tomonori Maeda batted in another run on a sacrifice fly in the
eighth.
	   Carp starter Nathan Minchey (11-8) went the distance, striking
out three and walking four. Minchey formerly pitched for the Boston
Red Sox.
	   Leo Gomez, formerly of the Chicago Cubs, cracked a solo homer in
the bottom of the third, the Dragons' only run in the game. Gomez
has 19 homers so far.
	   At the Tokyo Dome, catcher Shinichi Murata hit a tie-breaking
three-run homer in the bottom of the second inning as the Yomiuri
Giants overwhelmed the Hanshin Tigers 10-2, their fourth victory in
a row.
	   The Tigers' suffered their 12th straight defeat, the longest
losing streak in the club history.
	   In the Pacific League, Fukuoka Daiei Hawks hurler Brian Williams
allowed only three hits and struck out 11 in a 2-0 shutout of the
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters at Kurashiki.
	   Williams, formerly of the Baltimore Orioles, effectively mixed
speed balls and curve balls in seven-plus innings to pick up his
second win this season.
	   Hawks' infielder Takashi Uchinokura batted in the team's first
run on a single in the second.
	   Meanwhile, Hawks' infielder Luis Lopez, formerly of the
Cleveland Indians, was suspended from Sunday's game as a penalty
for a scuffle Saturday with Nippon Ham Fighters pitcher Hiroshi
Shibakusa.
	   Lopez was ejected after he shoved Shibakusa after a pitch almost
hit him in the back. Lopez also faces a 100,000-yen (dlrs 680) fine
from his team.
	   At Osaka Dome, Hiroyuki Nakamura batted in a total of five runs,
giving the Kintetsu Buffaloes a 10-7 victory over the Chiba Lotte
Marines, halting their losing streak at four.
	   Nakamura singled home two runs in the bottom of the sixth inning
for a 4-3 lead. In the seventh, he cracked a three-run homer, his
21st this season.
	   At Seibu Dome, Ichiro Suzuki batted in a tie-breaking run on a
triple in the top of the fifth inning as the Orix BlueWave beat the
Seibu Lions 7-2.
	   Yasuo Fujii hit a solo homer in the second and a two-run homer
in the fifth. He has 22 homers on the year.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A methane blast deep inside a coal mine in
eastern Ukraine killed at least 17 miners on Sunday and injured
four others, a government official said. Six miners were missing
after the explosion.
	   The blast struck 600 meters (2,000 feet) underground at 12:40
a.m. Sunday (2240 GMT Saturday) in a mine in Luhansk, a city 700
kilometers (450 miles) east of Kiev, according to a duty officer
for Ukraine's Ministry of the Mining Industry who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said 123 miners were underground at the time of the blast,
with 27 working in the section where the explosion occurred. By 4
p.m. (1200 GMT), the bodies of 17 victims had been found. Four
other miners were hospitalized in a burn unit, and six remain
missing.
	   Investigators are working to determine the cause of the blast,
he said.
	   More than 200 miners have already died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines. The worst single accident occurred in
April, when a methane blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the
eastern region of Donetsk.
	   Ukraine's government blames the accidents on neglect of safety
rules and outdated equipment.

Magnitude 5.2 earthquake hits central Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2
struck Sunday in an area of central Taiwan that was jolted by a
severe trembler last month. There were no reports of damage or
injuries.
	   The quake struck at 7:13 p.m. (11:13 GMT) with its epicenter
located 36.5 kilometers (23 miles) south of Chiayi city, the
Central Weather Bureau reported.
	   Five people were killed in the mountains near Chiayi, 200
kilometers (124 miles) south of Taipei, in the aftermath of a 6.2
magnitude quake in July. Most of Taiwan's earthquakes are recorded
off the island's east coast, but several deadly quakes have also
struck Chiayi and the surrounding region this century.
	   The latest quake was felt most strongly in Taiwan's cultural
capital Tainan city, about 180 kilometers (111 miles) south of
Taipei.

Hoddle faces up to England players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle says he is going into his first
meeting with England's soccer squad since the World Cup with no
regrets about writing his controversial autobiography.
	   The British media has been calling for Hoddle to step down as
England manager amid claims he sold his soul and breached the
confidences of his players by revealing inside details about
individuals in the team.
	   Hoddle's book, ``The 1998 World Cup Story,'' which is being
serialized in the Sun newspaper, was branded ``pathetic'' after
details revealing how Paul Gascoigne went berserk when he was cut
from the England squad were published.
	   Hoddle denied he planned to profit by holding back details of
the Gascoigne incident during press conferences at the World Cup to
make his book ``spicier''.
	   ``It's wrong for anyone to suggest it was just money orientated
or whatever,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Hoddle said he had no regrets about writing the book and hoped
the people who read the book enjoy it.
	   The England coach said he would not have been forced into
telling his side of the Gascoigne incident if the former England
midfielder had not published his version of events in the press.
	   ``I was protecting the guy. I didn't want to crucify the lad and
in many ways he crucified himself by coming out so quickly
afterwards in the press.''
	   ``I haven't said anything (in the book) I should have said in
the press conference.
	   ``For anyone to suggest that I was saving the juicy bits is
wrong.''
	   Hoddle also claimed the Sun's headline on the first episode of
the serialization was misleading, although the facts were balanced.
	   David Davies, head of public affairs at the Football
Association, was Hoddle's ghost-writer on the book.
	   Davies said the book merely addressed issues the public wanted
Hoddle to address.
	   ``Above all it's an honest book and if Glenn is being condemned
for being honest _ well that is a problem,'' he said.
	   However, Professional Footballers' Association chief executive
Gordon Taylor said Hoddle had been unprofessional.
	   ``A manager's relationship with his players should be like a
doctor with his patient,'' Taylor said. ``Players in the squad will
be very wary of Glenn now and I don't think it is going to help his
relationship with them,'' he said.
	   The controversy which met the publication of excerpts from
Hoddle's World Cup diary is threatening to overshadow preparations
for the European Championship qualifying games.
	   Hoddle goes into camp Monday night with 29 players selected for
England's Euro 2000 squad, including seven uncapped players.
	   As manager, he will be focusing on next month's qualifying match
against Swededn but discussion on the book is certain to come up.
	   Davies said it was up to Hoddle as to what he talked to the
players about.

Traffic, train service return to normal after deadly mudslides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ Italy's busy main highway south of the
Austrian border fully reopened Sunday, cleared of mudslides that
claimed the lives of five Germans on vacation.
	   Three mudslides, triggered by a thunderstorm, struck a valley in
the South Tyrol on Saturday. Mud, water and rocks covered the
autostrada, Italy's highest-speed road, as well as local highways
and rail lines.
	   The slides hit near the town of Fortezza, 25 miles south of the
border, in the heart of Italy's Alpine resort country.
	   On Sunday, traffic was flowing on all lanes after miles-long
traffic jams the previous day. Train service, delayed for hours
after the slides, also returned to normal.
	   Italian authorities said they expected to identify the five
victims on Monday. Austria Press Agency said the dead were a
married couple from Mainz and a family with a boy from Pinneberg,
Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany.
	   Italy's right-wing National Alliance party accused the
government of having failed to adequately guard against the
region's high risk of slides, the ANSA news agency reported.
Critics also said local authorities should have blocked the road at
the first, smaller, slides, an hour before the bigger avalanches,
ANSA said.

King Hussein gives Prince Hassan more constitutional authority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein has given his brother and heir
to the throne authority to shuffle the government, officials said
Sunday.
	   The move comes at a time when the government has come under fire
over polluted drinking water and economic recession.
	   Hussein, 63, is undergoing cancer treatment in the United
States.
	   A government official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, said Hussein issued the decree from his hospital bed in
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., giving his brother Crown
Prince Hassan more powers.
	   Hassan, 51, is acting as regent in the absence of the king.
	   Another government official, who also asked not to be
identified, said the move ``should not be seen in the context of
His Majesty surrendering power, but to allow the prince to have the
adequate authority to run the affairs of the state in His Majesty's
absence.''
	   He added: ``We should not read a lot into it.''
	   A third official, who also requested anonymity, said Hussein had
initially barred Hassan from shuffling the government in a decree
he issued in late July when he left for treatment in the United
States.
	   He now deleted that reference in the new decree.
	   The official said the king's latest decree maintained other
restrictions which include banning the prince from declaring war on
a foreign country, signing peace treaties or changing the
Constitution.
	   Neither decrees were made public.
	   The 24-member Cabinet of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali,
which was formed in March 1997, has been accused of negligence in
supervising the purification of drinking water in parts of the
capital, Amman.
	   Water experts have asserted that water contained worms and
larvae which could be hazardous to health. Jordanians have
complained that water flowing from taps had an odor. The government
has denied these charges.
	   Majali's Cabinet has also been widely accused of exaggerating
official growth rates in Jordan to cover up for worsening economic
performance.

Quakes continue to shake central Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with landslide, evacuation, latest statistics

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A landslide triggered by a recent series of
moderate earthquakes in central Japan damaged an outdoor spa at a
hot spring resort Sunday, forcing 90 people to evacuate, police
said.
	   A huge rock, about 5 meters (5.5 yards) in diameter, smashed
into an outdoor bath at a village-operated inn at Shin Hodaka hot
springs resort early Sunday, the Gifu Prefectural (state) Police
said.
	   Nobody was injured, but 78 tourists and 12 employees of the inn
evacuated to a village community hall, the police said.
	   The mountainous resort is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
the epicenters of a recent series of earthquakes.
	   A total of 508 earthquakes, including 15 that were strong enough
to be felt by humans, jolted the area in central Nagano since
midnight Saturday, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   No casualties have been reported.
	   The agency said a total 4,346 tremors have hit the region since
Aug. 7. On Saturday alone, the agency recorded 691 quakes, with 28
detectable by humans.
	   Earlier Sunday, one tremor had a preliminary magnitude of 5.2,
rattling the nerves of locals and spooking tourists to the region's
hot spring resorts into canceling reservations.
	   The quake, the day's largest, struck at 3:31 a.m. (1831 GMT),
and its epicenter was located in the sparsely inhabited Hida region
of Gifu prefecture, 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of Tokyo, the
agency said.
	   After an emergency meeting Friday, members of the Science and
Technology Agency's seismological committee proclaimed that the
earthquakes will continue for several more weeks. The committee
warned that tremors could be intense near the epicenter.
	   The same area experienced similar spates of seismic activity in
1990 and 1967.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations,
sitting atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Hoddle faces up to England players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates lead, corrects squad in camp to Sunday

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle went into his first meeting with
England's soccer squad since the World Cup Sunday saying he had no
regrets about writing his controversial autobiography.
	   The British media has been calling for Hoddle to step down as
England manager amid claims he sold his soul and breached the
confidences of his players by revealing inside details about
individuals in the team.
	   Hoddle's book, ``The 1998 World Cup Story,'' which is being
serialized in the Sun newspaper, was branded ``pathetic'' after
details revealing how Paul Gascoigne went berserk when he was cut
from the England squad were published.
	   He also attacked Blackburn striker Chris Sutton for refusing to
play for England's B team and Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson for interfering.
	   The controversy which met the publication of excerpts from
Hoddle's World Cup diary is threatening to overshadow preparations
for the European Championship qualifying games.
	   Hoddle met the squad selected for the Euro 2000 campaign Sunday
when 29 players assembled at Burnham Beeches for a two day camp.
	   David Davies, the Football Association's head of public affairs
_ who was also Hoddle's ghost writer on the book _ said it was up
to the England manager what he discussed with his players.
	   However, discussion on the book is certain to come up.
	   England vice-captain Paul Ince has admitted Hoddle's revelations
could jeopardise his relationship with some players, while reports
that Tony Adams plans to publish his own account of the World Cup
which could be critical of Hoddle.
	   Hoddle said he had no regrets about writing the book and hoped
the people who read the book enjoy it.
	   He said he would not have been forced into telling his side of
the Gascoigne incident if the former England midfielder had not
published his version of events in the press.
	   ``I was protecting the guy. I didn't want to crucify the lad and
in many ways he crucified himself by coming out so quickly
afterwards in the press,'' he told BBC radio.
	   Hoddle denied he planned to profit by holding back details of
the Gascoigne incident during press conferences at the World Cup to
make his book ``spicier''.
	   ``I haven't said anything (in the book) I should have said in
the press conference.
	   ``It's wrong for anyone to suggest it was just money orientated
or whatever. For anyone to suggest that I was saving the juicy bits
is wrong.''
	   Hoddle also claimed the Sun's headline on the first episode of
the serialization was misleading, although the facts were balanced.
	   Davies said the book merely addressed issues the public wanted
Hoddle to address.
	   ``Above all it's an honest book and if Glenn is being condemned
for being honest _ well that is a problem,'' he said.
	   However, Professional Footballers' Association chief executive
Gordon Taylor said Hoddle had been unprofessional.
	   ``A manager's relationship with his players should be like a
doctor with his patient,'' Taylor said. ``Players in the squad will
be very wary of Glenn now and I don't think it is going to help his
relationship with them,'' he said.

Quakes continue to shake central Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 5.3 magnitude earthquake Sunday evening in grafs
8 and 9

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A landslide triggered by a recent series of
moderate earthquakes in central Japan damaged an outdoor spa at a
hot spring resort Sunday, forcing 90 people to evacuate, police
said.
	   A huge rock, about 5 meters (5.5 yards) in diameter, smashed
into an outdoor bath at a village-operated inn at Shin Hodaka hot
springs resort early Sunday, the Gifu Prefectural (state) Police
said.
	   Nobody was injured, but 78 tourists and 12 employees of the inn
evacuated to a village community hall, the police said.
	   The mountainous resort is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
the epicenters of a recent series of earthquakes.
	   A total of 508 earthquakes, including 15 that were strong enough
to be felt by humans, jolted the area in central Nagano since
midnight Saturday, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   No casualties have been reported.
	   The agency said a total 4,346 tremors have hit the region since
Aug. 7. On Saturday alone, the agency recorded 691 quakes, with 28
detectable by humans.
	   Meanwhile, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3
struck off the Pacific coast of northern Japan at 1405 GMT Sunday.
	   The epicenter was 50 kilometers (31 miles) under the seabed off
the coast of Fukushima prefecture, 280 kilometers (179 miles)
northeast of Tokyo. There were no reports of damage.
	   Earlier Sunday, one tremor near the hot spring resorts had a
preliminary magnitude of 5.2, rattling the nerves of locals and
spooking tourists to the region's resorts into canceling
reservations.
	   The quake struck at 3:31 a.m. (1831 GMT), and its epicenter was
located in the sparsely inhabited Hida region of Gifu prefecture,
220 kilometers (140 miles) west of Tokyo, the agency said.
	   After an emergency meeting Friday, members of the Science and
Technology Agency's seismological committee proclaimed that the
earthquakes will continue for several more weeks. The committee
warned that tremors could be intense near the epicenter.
	   The same area experienced similar spates of seismic activity in
1990 and 1967.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations,
sitting atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Women larger force than men at European Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The biggest star of this week's
European Championships might be 800-meter world record-holder
Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, and he was born in Kenya.
	   The quadrennial championships open Tuesday at a time when
European track and field seems to be in a slump. That's
particularly true for the men, where the sprints this season have
been owned by Americans, and every other distance by Africans.
	   Even Kipketer is beatable. Indomitable for several seasons, he
was hit with an attack of malaria in February, didn't resume
training until late May, and was beaten last week in the Weltklasse
Grand Prix in Zurich _ his first loss in three years _ by Kenyan
Japheth Kimutai.
	   It's a different story for the European women, who have
world-class athletes in almost every event and lead many of the
field events.
	   The six-day championships in the Hungarian capital are
sandwiched between last week's Weltklasse, the fourth of the Golden
League meets, and the fifth meet in the series Aug. 28 in Brussels.
	   About the only sanctuary for the men is in the field events, led
by British triple jump world-record holder Jonathan Edwards.
	   Edwards, 32, gold medalist at the '95 World Championships when
he set the mark, hasn't won gold since in the Olympics, worlds or
Europeans but has the top two marks in this season in his
speciality.
	   The host Hungarians will be watching the hammer throw most
closely, where '96 Olympic champion Balazs Kiss faces countryman
Tibor Gecsek, a bronze medalist in the '93 and '95 worlds who is
returning from a two-year drug ban.
	   Britain has most of Europe's limited sprint strength with a
British sweep of the 100 possible, led by Malcolm Christian, Dwain
Chambers, Darren Campbell and Marlone Devonish. The fastest
European so far is Italy's Carol Boccarini (10.08).
	   ``We have been running so well this year and have been a long
way ahead of other Europeans on the international circuit,'' said
Chambers. ``I believe that it is a realistic aim to have all three
of us on the podium.''
	   At 400 meters, Britain's Mark Richardson has run 44.37, which is
the top non-American time in the world this season. Teammate Iwan
Thomas is right behind at 44.38.
	   Spain _ led by Isaac Viciosa at 1,500 and Fabian Roncero in the
10,000 and marathon _ is again the force in the distance races with
with eastern Europe dominating most of the field events.
	   On the women's side, there is a world-class threat from France's
Christine Arron at 100 meters. She has run 10.85 this year and is
the only consistent sub-11 European in the world.
	   Germany's 26-year-old Grit Breuer, an Olympic bronze medalist in
the relays at 16 and later banned for drug use, ran 49.51 (the
second fastest in the world this season) to win last week's
Weltklasse 400.
	   From 800 through 10,000 meters _ excluding the 5,000 _ European
women have the top times in the world this season. Romanian
Gabriela Szabo has the top time at 1,500 and 3,000.
	   Six of the eight field events also have European women leading
them: Venelina, Veneva, Bulgaria (high jump); Rodica Mateescu,
Romania (triple jump), Irina Korzhanenko, Russia (shot put),
Natalya Sadova, Russia (discus), Olga Kuzenkova, Russia (hammer
throw), Tanja Damaski, Germany (javelin).
	   A major absence in the triple jump will be world indoor
record-holder Ashia Hansen of Britain, who is out with a heel
injury.
	   Four years is an eternity in track and field. So it's
eye-popping, the quest by 33-year-old German Heike Drechsler to win
a fourth straight European long-jump title.
	   Four others are out to win their third straight European golds:
Briton's Colin Jackson (110 hurdles) and Steve Backley (javelin),
and German's Ilke Wyludda (discus) and Sabine Braun (heptathlon).

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In an unprecedented manhunt,
Palestinian police clamped a curfew on the West Bank town of
Jericho on Sunday and searched house-to-house for an escaped Hamas
leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Palestinian police searched houses and cars throughout Jericho,
and police vans drove through the city on Sunday afternoon, issuing
orders over loudspeakers for merchants to close their shops and
residents to return home. Policeman patrolled the streets on foot,
Kalishnikovs raised.
	   It was the first time the Palestinian Authority imposed a curfew
on its own people, although it was not strictly enforced. Curfews
are commonly used by Israel in Palestinian areas still under
Israeli control.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from
inside to escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The Palestinians themselves say it was an inside job,''
Netanyahu told reporters Sunday. ``But we have no information as to
who helped and in what capacity or at what level, so we are still
investigating this as well.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ For the second time in two weeks, a Japanese horse
on Sunday won a summer race in the French seaside resort of
Deauville.
	   The horse, Taiki Shuttle, ridden by Japanese jockey Yukio Okabe,
won the 1,000,000 franc (dlrs 166,000) Jacques Le Marois prize in
racing Sunday.
	   Taiki Shuttle, whose owner is also Japanese, came first in a

Schumacher wins Hungarian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes, details, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Using a clever pit-stop strategy,
Michael Schumacher won the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday and
closed the gap on Mika Hakkinen in the Formula One championship.
	   Schumacher took the lead nearly two-thirds into the 77-lap race,
after all leading drivers went into the pits for the second time.
	   But the German was using a three-stop strategy. With less fuel
to weigh it down, Schumacher's Ferrari took off like a rocket,
gaining more than a second per lap over all the rivals.
	   By the time Schumacher went in for his third pit stop, he was so
far ahead that he easily went out again before he could be
overtaken.
	   ``Today's race was ideal for the championship, at least from my
point of view,'' said Schumacher, who is trying to become the first
Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody Schockter in
1979. Schumacher has won the title twice with other cars.
	   Schumacher's fifth victory of the season gave him 10 points and
left him trailing Hakkinen by only seven points with four races
left in the year.
	   ``It was one of the nicest victories I've had, it was
outstanding,'' Schumacher said.
	   He was cheered by thousands of German and Ferrari fans blowing
horns and setting off fire crackers.
	   Hakkinen, the McLaren-Mercedes driver who led from the pole
until lap 46 when he went to the pit and Schumacher took over,
dropped back to sixth, one lap behind Schumacher, and gained only
one point.
	   Schumacher now has 70 points, while Hakkinen has 77. Hakkinen
went into the race holding a 16-point lead.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard was second, while
Jacques Villeneuve, last year's winner here and Formula One
champion, finished third for the second race in a row in a
Williams.
	   Schumacher snapped Hakkinen's two-race winning streak.
	   The German started from the second row on the starting grid,
after qualifying third.
	   He stayed third until the second round of pit stops were
completed. He took the lead on lap 46 and never relinquished it
again.
	   Schumacher made another pit stop on lap 62 and still came out
five seconds ahead of Coulthard, who by then had overtaken
Hakkinen, who obviously was having a problem with his car.
	   ``It was a pretty difficult strategy. It didn't seem to be
working at first,'' said Schumacher, who was fourth after his first
pit stop.
	   ``But it was a waiting game and after the second stop I had a
clear run,'' he said. ``I was pushing to the limit.''
	   The German completed the race distance of 305.844 kilometers
(190.043 miles) in one hour, 45 minutes, 25.550 seconds, clocking
an average speed of just over 174 kilometers (104 miles) per hour.
	   Schumacher also recorded the fastest lap on the 3.9-kilometer
(2.4-mile) Hungaroring of one minute, 19.286 seconds.
	   Coulthard was 9.6 seconds behind Schumacher, while Villeneuve
was 44.4 seconds off the pace.
	   ``It's quite remarkable to win on three stops,'' Coulthard said.
``We are still in shock. It was pretty impressive.''
	   Villeneuve said his power steering broke down after 10 laps.
	   ``We've been driving with power steering for two years so it was
pretty tough,'' the Canadian said.
	   ``The half way into the race all the light in the car started
flashing. I asked the pit about but they didn't answer so I thought
it was better not to know what it was,'' Villeneuve said.
	   Former champion Damon Hill was fourth in a Jordan, while
Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fifth in the second Williams.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Hundreds of minority Afghans fleeing a
northern city that recently fell to the Taliban are being detained
by Taliban authorities on the way to neighboring Pakistan,
witnesses and aid workers said Sunday.
	   Taliban officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Mohammad Ali, a bus driver who shuttles between Kabul and the
Pakistani border, said that since Tuesday, Taliban authorities have
stopped buses near Jalalabad, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Kabul and 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the border.
	   Passengers are questioned, ``and if they are found to be
Hazaras, Shiites or Uzbeks, they are told to get off the bus and
are not allowed to continue to Pakistan,'' Ali said.
	   Ali and other drivers said those being detained were from
Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in northern Afghanistan, which
fell to Taliban fighters Aug. 8. The loss of the city about 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Kabul, the capital, was a major
blow to the northern-based opposition alliance, and one of several
recent victories for the Taliban.
	   The Taliban, who profess an extreme version of Islam, could soon
control all of Afghanistan. They have held the capital since 1996.
	   The Taliban, who like most Afghans are from the Pashtun ethnic
group and followers of the Sunni sect of Islam, have been accused
of harassing and killing minorities.
	   The Taliban claimed to have captured Hybak, south of
Mazar-e-Sharif, after a battle on Sunday. There was no independent
claim of Hybak's fall, which would put the Taliban on the threshold
of their opposition's last major stronghold, central Bamiyan
province.

Rebuilt PSV retains Johan Cruyff Trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven captured the Johan
Cruyff Trophy Sunday for the third staight year, downing Ajax
Amsterdam 2-0 in the Dutch soccer season's curtain raiser.
	   The first goal came in the 32nd minute when Russian Dmitri
Khokhlov won a challenge with Ajax defender Danny Blind, beat two
more players and slid the ball past keeper Edwin van der Sar.
	   And Arnold Bruggink doubled the lead from point blank range in
the 53rd, after build up work from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Finn
Joonas Kolkka.
	   Ajax's misery was complete when substitute Richard Witschge
blasted an 85th-minute penalty high and wide after Pole Tomek Ivan
fouled Ajax winger Peter Hoekstra.
	   Intricate passing movements between Ajax's two Georgians, Shota
Arveladze and new signing Georgi Kinkladze, failed to penetrate a
massed PSV defense.
	   Ajax badly missed the absent De Boer twins Ronald and Frank, who
are in contractual dispute with the club and want to play abroad.
	   And it was the first strong performance of the new PSV, rebuilt
by English coach Bobby Robson during the close season after five
Dutch internationals were given transfers.
	   The match pits the Dutch league winner against the Amstel Cup
holder, but Ajax won the double last season so losing cup finalist
PSV was its opponent.

Turkish prosecutor opens investigation of latest Islamic party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In a new challenge to Turkey's Islamic
movement, a prosecutor has started scrutinizing speeches and
actions of an Islamic-oriented party to assess whether it is a
continuation of one banned for its anti-secular stance, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Ankara state security prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel could ask the
Supreme Court to shut down the Virtue Party if he concludes it
shares the alleged anti-secular views of the Welfare Party, the
Yeni Yuzyil daily said.
	   Turkey has an overwhelmingly Islamic population but a
constitutionally protected secular government.
	   Welfare was the largest party in Parliament until a court
ordered the party disbanded earlier this year, saying it had sought
to undermine the secular system. Five of its deputies, including
former premier Necmettin Erbakan, were banned from holding
political office for five years.
	   Under the constitution, a banned party cannot be reborn under a
different name.
	   Although Virtue is made up of former Welfare deputies, the party
has been following a more moderate line under its leader, Recai
Kutan. It has taken pains not to anger the pro-secular
establishment, led by the military.
	   Critics claim that Erbakan, who has led the Islamic movement for
the last two decades, is running Virtue behind the scenes.
	   Turkey's generals pressured Erbakan's government into resigning
last year after it sought to introduce a number of policies aimed
at increasing the influence of Islam.
	   Virtue is considered a front-runner in national parliamentary
elections set for April. There was no indication when the
prosecutor would decide.

Jordan's King Hussein gives Prince Hassan more constitutional
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein has given his brother and heir
to the throne authority to shuffle the government, Jordanian
officials said Sunday.
	   The move comes at a time when the government has come under fire
for polluted drinking water and economic recession.
	   Hussein, 63, is undergoing cancer treatment in the United
States.
	   A government official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, said Hussein issued the decree from his hospital bed in
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, giving Crown Prince Hassan
more powers.
	   Hassan, 51, is acting as regent in the absence of the king.
	   Another government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the move ``should not be seen in the context of His
Majesty surrendering power, but to allow the prince to have the
adequate authority to run the affairs of the state in His Majesty's
absence.''
	   He added: ``We should not read a lot into it.''
	   A third official, also speaking anonymously, said Hussein had
initially barred Hassan from shuffling the government in a decree
issued in late July, when he left for the United States.
	   He deleted that reference in the new decree.
	   The official said the king's latest decree maintained other
restrictions, which include banning the prince from declaring war
on a foreign country, signing peace treaties or changing the
Constitution.
	   Neither decree was made public.
	   The 24-member Cabinet of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali,
which was formed in March 1997, has been accused of negligence in
supervising the purification of drinking water in parts of the
capital, Amman.
	   Water experts have asserted that water contained worms and
larvae which could be hazardous to health. Jordanians have
complained that water flowing from taps had an odor. The government
has denied it.
	   Majali's Cabinet has also been widely accused of exaggerating
official growth rates in Jordan to cover up worsening economic
performance.

Famine in Sudan like ``vision of hell,'' Irish minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Irish foreign minister's news conference, CHANGES
overline, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Irish foreign minister said Sunday he
saw a ``vision of hell'' in famine-stricken southern Sudan.
	   David Andrews called on all warring parties to lay down their
arms and allow peace to flourish.
	   ``As long as the war continues, there will be no peace for the
people of Sudan,'' Andrews told a news conference at the end of a
two-day visit.
	   ``The horrors which we saw in the southern part of The Sudan are
just quite unforgettable. It is like a vision of hell,'' Andrews
said.
	   Andrews, who earlier met with his Sudanese counterpart, Mustafa
Osman Ismail, said his government will provide dlrs about 3.2
million in relief and humanitarian assistance to Sudan.
	   Earlier, a Sudanese official was quoted as saying that thousands
of civilians fleeing fighting in southern Sudan were facing
starvation in a government-controlled town, and four people were
dying daily.
	   About 70,000 people face starvation because a daily influx of
between 150 and 200 civilians has depleted food stocks and
stretched medical care to its limits in Mairam, a town in Western
Kordofan Province in western Sudan, Fitnanom Kom said.
	   ``The situation is similar to the case of people in Wau,'' said
Kom, who serves as the political adviser to the Western Kordofan
government. He was referring to the capital of Bahr al-Ghazal, a
hard-hit area where dozens of people are dying daily.
	   Mairam is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Wau, just
north of Bahr al-Ghazal province.
	   In the interview with El-Osbu, Kom called on relief groups to
``move in quickly to remedy the deteriorating situation.''
	   U.N. officials in Khartoum could not confirm the conditions in
the town, but said they expected an assessment team to return by
Wednesday. Kom did not say when the exodus began.
	   Sudan's civil war started in 1983 when rebels took up arms
against the Muslim government in the north to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south. More than 1.5
million people have died in the battles and famines caused by them.
	   As of last month, 700,000 civilians faced starvation in Bahr
al-Ghazal's rebel-controlled areas.
	   Both sides have declared a temporary cease-fire to allow
international aid agencies to deliver food.

Border Police find 12 youths hiding in ships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ Border police found a total of 12
African youths hiding in the holds of two ships that arrived in
southern Romania, port officials said Sunday.
	   Ten of the youths, aged between 10 and 22 from Liberia and
Guinea, were found late Saturday stuffed into the Cypriot mineral
transporter Tassos-L. Manolukos Savas, captain of Tassos-L, said
the teenagers illegally boarded the ship on July 30 in the Guinean
port of Conakry. The crew later found them in the ship's coal
depository.
	   When the ship docked in the Black Sea Port of Constanta, 222
kilometers (139 miles) southeast of Bucharest, the 10 were
discovered.
	   The other two adolescents were coming from the Algerian port of
Oran and were found on the Turkish cargo ship Feryol Kalkavan late
Saturday, when port inspectors boarded the ship to check for
illegal activity.
	   Alexe Prodan, a port authority who inspected the Cypriot ship
said the teenagers were kept in latticed rooms and it appeared they
had been used by the crew as slave labor. He also said the crew had
tried to hide the ``infernal'' conditions in which the immigrants
were transported.
	   Members of the crew refused to comment.
	   The 12 boarded the ships without knowing where they were going,
but hoping to reach Western Europe. They were into custody of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who was to meet with Romanian
authorities to discuss repatriating the youths.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In an unprecedented manhunt,
Palestinian police clamped a curfew on the West Bank town of
Jericho on Sunday and searched house-to-house for an escaped Hamas
leader also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Palestinian police searched houses and cars throughout Jericho,
and police vans drove through the city on Sunday afternoon, issuing
orders over loudspeakers for merchants to close their shops and
residents to return home. Policeman patrolled the streets on foot,
Kalashnikovs raised.
	   It was the first time the Palestinian Authority imposed a curfew
on its own people, although it was not strictly enforced. Curfews
are commonly used by Israel in Palestinian areas still under
Israeli control.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers and
said there was suspicion that Awadallah was helped from inside to
escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   ``The Palestinians themselves say it was an inside job,''
Netanyahu said Sunday. ``But we have no information as to who
helped and in what capacity or at what level, so we are still
investigating this as well.''

Mandela urges continuing pursuit of peace despite Omagh bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela urged the
people of the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sunday to continue
pursuing peace ``even more steadfastly'' after a car bomb in Omagh
killed 28 people.
	   ``The overwhelming positive results in the recent Irish
referendums showed a determined desire for peace rather than
conflict and violence,'' Mandela said in a statement. ``So much
goodwill and faith should not be lost to the mindless violence of a
few.''
	   Mandela expressed South Africa's ``deepest sympathy ... profound
shock and utter dismay'' at Saturday's explosion.
	   Mandela's African National Congress leaders have been involved
in advising leaders from Northern Ireland in settling their
conflict, starting with last year's seminar near Cape Town with
opposing leaders.
	   Before May's vote that showed 71 percent of Northern Ireland's
voters supported a power-sharing government, an ANC delegation
traveled to Ireland, apparently to help leaders convince their
grassroots members to back the settlement.
	   The ANC went through a similar experience of convincing their
supporters to accept the negotiations that led to 1994's first
all-race elections, which ended four decades of white minority
rule.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police searched house-to-house Sunday for an escaped Hamas leader
also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Palestinian police searched houses and cars and combed orchards
in Jericho, and police vans drove through the city Sunday
afternoon, announcing a curfew over loudspeakers and ordering
merchants to close their shops and residents to return home. Police
patrolled the streets on foot, Kalishnikovs raised.
	   It was the first time the Palestinian Authority imposed a curfew
on its own people, although it was in effect only in the center of
town and was not strictly enforced. Still, locals accustomed to
such curfews during years of Israeli occupation rushed to stock up
at bakeries before going home.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank.
	   Israeli intelligence officials briefed Cabinet ministers on the
escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah had inside help
to escape, said Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The Palestinians themselves say it was an inside job,''
Netanyahu told reporters Sunday. ``But we have no information as to
who helped and in what capacity or at what level, so we are still
investigating this as well.''
	   Haj Ismail, head of Palestinian security in the West Bank, said
a committee was investigating Awadallah's escape.
	   Awadallah, 29, was arrested by the Palestinian Authority last
April and accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif,
whose mangled body was found March 29 at the scene of a massive
car-bomb blast in Ramallah. The Palestinian Authority said Sharif
was killed as the result of an internal feud, a claim angrily
denied by Hamas.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub said recently that
Awadallah had confessed to Sharif's killing and would be tried.
	   Hamas has accused Israel of killing Sharif with the help of the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas leaders questioned Sunday whether Awadallah had really
escaped.
	   ``We don't have any information _ the Palestinian Authority did
not inform us officially about him,'' said Ismail Abu Shanab, a top
Hamas official in the Gaza Strip.
	   Abu Shanab said Awadallah had been tortured in prison. ``We hold
the Palestinian Authority responsible for his safety inside and
outside the prison,'' he said.
	   Awadallah's brother Adel has been on the run for several years
and is wanted by Israeli officials for allegedly masterminding
several Hamas bombing attacks in Jerusalem.
	   His mother, Kunuah, said Palestinian intelligence officials had
searched the house early Sunday.
	   ``They think he came to me? I haven't seen him in two years,''
she said.
	   ``I thank God he managed to escape and hope God will protect
him,'' said Awadallah's wife and the mother of his four children,
who gave her name only as Umm Ahmed.

Pakistan hands US embassies bombing suspect to Kenya

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A suspect in the U.S. Embassy
bombings that killed more than 250 people in East Africa was
arrested in Pakistan and handed over to Kenyan authorities,
bypassing U.S. investigators, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry and
another government source said Sunday.
	   The suspect, identified as Mohammad Sadik Howaida, was arrested
on his arrival from Nairobi at the Karachi airport on August 7, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. That was the day of the nearly
simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
A government source speaking on condition of anonymity said he was
returned to Nairobi a week later.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused immediate comment.
	   The government source said the suspect told his interrogators
that a few other conspirators, who left Nairobi earlier, had
already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan. He had planned to
do the same, he said.
	   The source told The Associated Press that investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and Saudi multimillionaire Osama
bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for the
last two years.
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said immigration
officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was forged, and
he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   ``On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts,
he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law,'' Altaf said,
adding that Howaida was sent to Nairobi aboard a special plane.
	   A foreign ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab
national'' without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually
means someone from anywhere in the Middle East.
	   A day earlier, U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents
were headed to Pakistan to question the man. But Altaf said no
foreigners were allowed to interrogate Howaida. The government
source said Pakistani officials refused U.S. officials who came to
Karachi access to the suspect, and they had to follow him to Kenya
on another plane.
	   When Mir Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani later convicted in the United
States of killing two CIA employees, was arrested in Pakistan in
June 1997 in a joint FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis
accused their government of groveling before U.S. power.
	   The Kasi case could be one reason that Howaida was not directly
handed over to the Americans, the source said.
	   The national newspaper The News, quoting unidentified government
sources Sunday, said the suspect confessed to planning the
bombings. The News said he had received help in Kenya from
sympathizers with connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad
organization.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly
vowed to strike America interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania. That group is considered the successor to the
groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Briton was charged with involuntary
manslaughter but released pending trial Sunday, two days after a
Greek teenager was killed and another was seriously injured when
his yacht crashed into a speedboat, local media reported.
	   John Williams, 56, was arrested by the coast guard on Friday
after his sailing yacht allegedly rammed a speedboat with five
people on board off the coast of the Ionian island of Meganisi near
Lefkada Friday. Williams and his 55-year-old wife are from
Saundersfoot, Britain. The rest of the people on the speedboat were
not seriously injured.
	   Spyros Katopodis, 23, who was driving the speedboat was also
charged with involuntary manslaughter by a prosecutor. No trial
date was set.
	   Maria Konidari, 17, was killed in the crash. Her cousin
Evangelia Konidari, also 17, was seriously injured and was
airlifted to a hospital in Athens, the ministry said.

Monsoon floods hit millions in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Torrential rains worsened the flood
situation in India's two most populous states, killing at least 14
people over the weekend, officials said Sunday.
	   Four deaths were reported Sunday from the eastern Bihar state
where rivers fed by monsoon rains have affected nine million people
in 6,000 villages, Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   On Saturday night, at least 10 people were swept away by gushing
waters of a swollen river in Deoria district in Uttar Pradesh
state, 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of New Delhi, said
S.N.Shukla, a top bureaucrat.
	   A day earlier, at least 40 villagers were feared drowned when
their crowded boat sank in an overflowing river as they left their
submerged homes in nearby Maharajgan district, Shukla said.
	   Nearly 335,000 people have become homeless in Uttar Pradesh
state where the military was helping in rescue work in 22 of 83
districts in the state, he said.
	   The state flood control center in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar
Pradesh state, put the total death toll at 240 in the state in the
past four weeks. Another 159 people have been swept away or killed
by collapsing homes in neighboring Bihar state, PTI said.
	   Monsoon rains are expected to last until August-end in most
parts of India.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The driver of a bus carrying a large number of
children to the seashore lost control on a winding mountain road in
southern Russia and overturned, killing himself and one of his
young passengers, news agencies reported Sunday.
	   Twenty-one other passengers were injured, 14 of them children.
	   The accident occurred late Saturday afternoon near the village
of Lazarevskoye outside the Black Sea resort of Sochi, 1,400
kilometers (900 miles) south of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Of the 24 passengers, 16 were children. A 14-year-old girl died
in the accident and seven were hospitalized with severe injuries,
the reports said. The parents of other children, including seven
who had been treated at the hospital and released, came to retrieve
their sons and daughters, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The bus was heading from a children's summer camp in the village
of Armavir to a campsite on the sea.

Leading in polls, Kohl's challenger warns of over-confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Holding a steady lead in all polls with
national elections just six weeks away, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
main challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, on Sunday warned his party of
over-confidence.
	   In an interview on ZDF television, Schroeder disagreed with a
report in Welt am Sonntag newspaper, which quoted Social Democratic
Chairman Oskar Lafontaine as saying the polls show the elections
are practically won.
	   Schroeder, who seeks to end Kohl's 16 years in office, said he
wasn't nervous about the conservative Christian Democrats and
Bavarian sister-party, Christian Social Union, gaining a point to
38 percent in the polls recently, ``that's a completely normal
development.''
	   ``But I have never said it's already over,'' Schroeder said. His
leftist party, which Schroeder has been moving more to the center,
registered 41 percent in an Emnid Institute poll of 2,000 people
published in Der Spiegel magazine's Monday editions.
	   Emnid claims a margin of error of 2.5 to 3 percent, which keeps
the election race very close.
	   Schroeder said he has cautioned in each of his campaign speeches
of anticipating victory. ``Rushing to conclusions is damaging, and
I say that Kohl is a tough campaigner.''
	   The challenger said he wants his party to stick to the central
themes with the campaign heating up for the Sept. 27 elections.
Those include fighting unemployment and repealing a law passed by
Kohl's government to cut social security payments for the retired.
	   Schroeder also said that his goals include tax relief for lower
paid workers and small and medium-sized businesses.
	   Kohl's conservatives have charged that the Social Democrats'
plans to repeal laws pushed through over the last two years to
reduce public spending and boost the economy threatens millions of
jobs.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The word of God at the Army of Victory
Church is garbled with feedback.
	   Over crackling, blaring loudspeakers, hundreds of Congolese
crowd into the rowdy and music-filled Pentecostal church Sunday to
hear distorted but soothing words of faith and love and prayers for
peace.
	   ``The people packing their bags and running say there will be
war in Kinshasa,'' says firebrand preacher Francois Kapenga. ``The
faithful know God will protect us.''
	   Their country embroiled in a rebel war that threatens to topple
President Laurent Kabila's 15-month-old regime, Kinshasa's
Christians turn to their church for comfort.
	   An army of rebel fighters says it is closing in on Kinshasa and
claims that it will take the city within days. Kabila, feeding on
nationalist pride, says neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are behind
the war _ a charge both countries deny.
	   Ethnic Tutsis, whose brethren have been leading the rebellion
against Kabila, have been rounded up in large numbers in Kinshasa.
Many remain detained at a military base in the capital, others have
been beaten, most others are in hiding.
	   With tension in Kinshasa building through a week filled with
power outages, water shortages and an exodus of foreigners, the
city seems somehow to take a day off Sunday to prepare for another
frenetic week.
	   In neighborhood churches throughout this impoverished Central
African capital, rumors of war and words of hatred against Rwanda
and ethnic Tutsis are washed away for a day in a chorus of
``Amens'' mixed with thumping gospel music.
	   At the Army of Victory Church, with its battered corrugated
steel roof, worshipers say the war is the devil's work.
	   ``It's in the Bible,'' says church-goer Dieudonne Abula, waving
a frayed, dog-eared copy of the King James Bible. ``God will
protect us, we're ready for tomorrow.''
	   Although vast numbers of Congo's roughly 45 million people are
animists, Christianity has found a foothold in Kinshasa.
	   Most Sundays, the Army of Victory Church's faded blue wooden
benches are packed. Families and young couples, grandparents and
toddlers all dressed in their best clothing converge on the
stoned-walled building.
	   A few hundred meters (yards) away is Kinshasa's main soccer
stadium, where thousands of young men have turned up to join
Kabila's army in recent days. The stadium grounds virtually empty,
the church _ and not the recruiting drive _ is the focus for at
least a few hours Sunday.
	   More than religion, the weekly service, with singing, dancing
and plenty of music, is an escape from the daily reality of
Kinshasa's garbage-strewn streets and staggering poverty.
	   Now it's also an escape from the fear of war.
	   With arms outstretched, standing beneath a crucifix outlined
with red Christmas tree lights, preacher Kapenga speaks words of
peace that work the crowd into a crescendo of cheers and praise.
	   ``With the Lord, it is possible,'' bellows Kapenga, who then
stops abruptly with purposeful, dramatic flair. The audience falls
silent and only the whoosh of twirling ceiling fans is heard.
	   ``Amen! I said, Amen,'' he recommences suddenly. The
congregation responds with volume tenfold, hands waving and
stretched toward the gray roof.
	   At the end of the service, people pour back out onto the
streets, back to talk of war and reports that the rebels are
coming.
	   Refuge from Congo's troubles is fleeting in Kinshasa, even for
the faithful.

Libya asks Britain to investigate plot to kill Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya asked Britain Sunday to investigate
allegations by a former British intelligence agent that London
plotted the assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Former British agent David Shayler alleged in a televised TV
interview earlier this month that Britain's Secret Intelligence
Service channeled about dlrs 160,000 to an Islamic group to kill
Gadhafi.
	   ``The government of the United Kingdom is called upon to open an
independent investigation concerning what David Shayler revealed,''
said a Libyan Foreign Ministry statement. It was carried by the
official Libyan news agency, JANA, on Sunday.
	   The British government has denied Shayler's allegations.
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry demanded that London hand over to
Tripoli Libyan ``terrorists'' living in Britain in order to prove
that it was not involved in the alleged plot.
	   The statement said Shayler's arrest ``confirms the involvement
of the British government in this terrorist act.''
	   Libya ``reserves the right to defend itself and also sue the
British government at the suitable time,'' the statement said.
	   It was Libya's first comment on the alleged plot.
	   Shayler, who worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency from 1994 until 1997, was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1.
London is trying to extradite him to face charges under the
Official Secrets Act. The former agent has threatened to put a
7,000 word dossier on Britain's secret services on an Internet
website.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Georgette was downgraded from a hurricane to
a tropical storm as it weakened over colder Pacific waters far from
Mexico's coast Sunday.
	   Maximum sustained winds dropped to 40 mph (64 kph), well below
the threshold for hurricane status. The U.S. Hurricane Center in
Miami said the storm would further weaken as it moved over colder
water and was expected to dissipate in a day or so.
	   Georgette, which never approached land, was about 700 miles
(1,125 kilometers) west of the Baja California peninsula and moving
to the west-northwest at 6 mph (10 kph).

Congolese government says it will counterattack against rebels

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila met with several
cabinet ministers in the southern city of Lubumbashi over the
weekend, while his army reportedly lost ground to advancing rebels
in the west.
	   Kabila was scheduled to return to Kinshasa on Sunday, but it was
unclear whether or not he was actually in the capital.
	   Leaders of the rebel movement _ a coalition of Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disgruntled members of Kabila's army _ said
they had captured the western river port town of Matadi and were
fighting to take up positions closer to Kinshasa.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government.
	   A western diplomat and a former military commander both said
said fighting was reported near the town of Songololo, about 250
kilometers (155 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Despite the apparent setbacks, the Congolese government said
Sunday that it was securing bases in the east and west of the
country in order to attack rebel forces trying to overthrow Kabila.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwandan Tutsi
war against Congo. Rwanda denies the charge.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, have become the target of attacks and
arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.
	   Kinshasa's government, meanwhile, was sending out conflicting
signals Sunday after denying Kabila had left the capital and later
saying he was to return.
	   Although one senior Kabila aide said the president was in
Kinshasa, he has not been seen in public for almost a week.
	   Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi told The Associated Press
that four cabinet ministers had met with Kabila over the weekend in
the southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's former rebel
stronghold.
	   All four ministers were scheduled to return to Kinshasa later in
the day, Sondgi said.
	   He would not say what the officials discussed.
	   Asked why he and other cabinets ministers had not joined Kabila
in Lubumbashi, Sondgi responded: ``The president asked that the
majority of ministers stay here, if not it will give the impression
that we've all fled Kinshasa.''
	   Speaking on state radio, Information Minister Didier Mumengi
said the Congolese army was preparing ``mopping up'' operations,
despite claims by the rebels to be pushing for the capital,
Kinshasa.
	   ``The Congolese army has locked up the so-called occupied
territory,'' Mumengi said. ``This is not meant for a
counter-attack, but for establishing a base for the systematic
mopping up of the zones said to be occupied.''
	   With tensions mounting in Kinshasa, foreigners have been fleeing
the capital on chartered flights and across the Congo River to the
neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   The United States closed its embassy in Kinshasa on Saturday and
flew its remaining staff out of the country.
	   France says it does not plan to close its diplomatic mission
here, but has been arranging evacuations for French and other
foreign citizens wishing to leave.
	   Criticizing the departing foreigners, Kabila's Cabinet director,
Abdoulaye Yerodia, said they were like ``rats fleeing the ship.''
	   ``I don't know why they are leaving,'' he said on state
television. ``Do they think there is going to be an earthquake
here? If so, they should tell us.''
	   Thousands of students and government employees marched along the
city's main street, June 30th Boulevard, pledging support Saturday
for Kabila and accusing Rwanda of waging war on Congo.
	   Many protesters also accused France and the United States of
trying to destabilize Congo.

Schumacher wins Hungarian Grand Prix

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A clever but risky pit-stop stop
strategy paid off for Michael Schumacher and sent the Formula One
season into a thrilling finish.
	   Schumacher won the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday in his Ferrari
and closed the gap on Mika Hakkinen in the drivers' standings.
	   ``I thought we would be competitive today but I never dreamed I
would leave Hungary having closed the championship gap from 16 to
just seven points,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``It was one of the nicest victories I've had, it was
outstanding,'' said the 29-year-old German ace, who moved past
Nigel Mansell into third place on the all-time list with 32 career
wins. The retired Alain Prost has 51 and the late Ayrton Senna 41.
	   Schumacher took the lead nearly two-thirds into the 77-lap race,
after all leading drivers went into the pits for the second time.
	   But the German was using a three-stop strategy. With less fuel
to weigh him down, Schumacher took off like a rocket, gaining more
than a second per lap over all the rivals.
	   By the time Schumacher went in for his third pit stop, he was so
far ahead that he easily went out again before he could be
overtaken.
	   ``Today's race was ideal for the championship, at least from my
point of view,'' said Schumacher, who is trying to become the first
Ferrari driver to win the championship since Jody Scheckter in
1979. Schumacher has won the title twice with other cars.
	   Schumacher's fifth victory of the season gave him 10 points and
left him trailing Hakkinen by only seven points with four races
left in the year.
	   ``The championship is now wide open,'' Schumacher said.
	   He was cheered by thousands of German and Ferrari fans blowing
horns and setting off fire crackers.
	   ``It was one of my most emotional wins, thanks to the reaction
of all the Ferrari fans,'' said Schumacher, who snapped Hakkinen's
two-race winning streak.
	   Hakkinen, the McLaren-Mercedes driver who led from the pole
until lap 46 when he went to the pit and Schumacher took over,
dropped back to sixth, one lap behind Schumacher, and gained only
one point.
	   ``After the second tire stop the car was impossible to drive,
especially over the bumps and through the corners,'' the Finn said.
``We have to check the car before we really know what the problem
was.''
	   Schumacher now has 70 points, while Hakkinen has 77. The next
race is Aug. 30 in Belgium, where Schumacher celebrated his first
Formula One victory in 1992 and where he has won four times.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard of Britain was
second, while Jacques Villeneuve, winner here in 1996 and 1997 and
Formula One champion last year, finished third for the second race
in a row in a Williams.
	   Schumacher started from the second row on the starting grid,
after qualifying third.
	   After the second round of pit stops were completed, he took the
lead on lap 47 and never relinquished it again.
	   Schumacher made another stop on lap 62 and still came out five
seconds ahead of Coulthard, who by then had overtaken Hakkinen.
	   ``The team picked the right strategy, although at first I was
not quite sure if our plan would work out,'' said Schumacher, who
had dropped to fourth after his first pit stop.
	   ``But it was a waiting game and after the second stop I had a
clear run,'' he said. ``I was pushing to the limit.''
	   Schumacher said the team had been prepared for either two or
three stops and decided to go with three once the race had started.
	   The German completed the race distance of 305.844 kilometers
(190.043 miles) in one hour, 45 minutes, 25.550 seconds, averaging
a speed of just over 174 kilometers (104 miles) per hour.
	   Schumacher also recorded the fastest lap on the 3.9-kilometer
(2.4-mile) Hungaroring of one minute, 19.286 seconds.
	   Coulthard was 9.6 seconds behind Schumacher, while Villeneuve
was 44.4 seconds off the pace.
	   ``It's quite remarkable to win on three stops,'' Coulthard said.
``We are still in shock. It was pretty impressive.''
	   Villeneuve said his power steering broke down after 10 laps.
	   ``We've been driving with power steering for two years so it was
pretty tough,'' the Canadian said.
	   ``The half way into the race all the light in the car started
flashing. I asked the pit about but they didn't answer so I thought
it was better not to know what it was,'' Villeneuve said.
	   Former champion Damon Hill of Britain, twice a winner here, was
fourth in a Jordan, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany was
fifth in the second Williams.
	   Eddie Irvine of Ireland retired in the 14th lap with gearbox
problems in his Ferrari.

Gunfire in Lome amid warnings of cross-border shelling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with statement from interior
minister retracting warning to stay indoors, Ghana sends
helicopters and equipment. No pickup.
 &UR; By COMBIETE COMBEY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Heavy and small weapons fire shook Togo's
capital Sunday as planes and troops were rushed in to repel what
the government said were insurgents shelling Togolese territory
from neighboring Ghana.
	   Stray shells landed in several neighborhoods of Lome near the
border with Ghana after the firing began early Sunday morning,
several witnesses said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
	   In a state radio broadcast, Togo's Minister of Interior and
Security Seyi Memene blamed the shelling on unidentified
``aggressors'' whom he said had tried unsuccessfully to enter the
country from Ghana.
	   ``The situation is under control,'' Memene said Sunday
afternoon, retracting an earlier warning for civilians to remain
indoors.
	   Ghana condemned the alleged incursion, and both governments said
the two West African neighbors were working together to flush out
the alleged attackers.
	   Ghana sent its top army officer to meet with officials in Lome
over the incident and the country deployed several military planes
and helicopters over the border area.
	   Togolese army planes also zoomed low over Lome during the
shelling as frightened citizens took refuge in their homes for
several hours amid the sound of intermittent machine gun fire and
explosions.
	   Sirens wailed and state radio broadcast a plea for residents to
remain calm as Togolese troops were deployed to the border region
from where the shelling could be heard.
	   There were also unconfirmed reports of gunfire near the Togolese
city of Kpalime near Ghana's border about 120 kilometers (70 miles)
northwest of Lome. The reports could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The heavy firing reduced in intensity after several hours and
abated by mid afternoon.
	   Kofi Totobi Quakyi, the Ghanaian minister responsible for
national security, said his country was dispatching a team of
officials and soldiers to the border area to investigate the
reports.
	   A statement from the Ghana's ministry of foreign affairs
expressed ``deep concern and strong disapproval of reported
disturbances by armed elements within Togo and along the Ghana-Togo
border.''
	   Relations between Ghana and Togo have traditionally been cool,
partly as a result of efforts by ethnic Ewe activists to create a
homeland encompassing parts of the two countries.
	   In addition, Ghana is the exile home of key Togolese opposition
leader Gilchrist Olympio.
	   Scattered protests by Olympio's opposition group followed the
re-instatement of President Gnassigbe Eyadema following June 21
elections in which vote-counting was interrupted prematurely.
	   Eyadema has led this tiny French-speaking West African country
for 31 years since taking over in a coup that resulted in the
killing of his predecessor _ Olympio's father. Since then, Eyadema
has accused Olympio of carrying out several failed takeover bids
launched from Ghanaian territory.

Russia to design new heavy plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The commander-in-chief of Russia's Air Force said
Sunday that a new, heavy plane was being designed for the military,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Col.-Gen. Anatoly Kornukov told reporters at an air show in
Tushino, about 12 kilometers (8 miles) northwest of Moscow, that
work would start on the new plane next year by orders of the
Russian Security Council, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. He did
not divulge further details of the plane.
	   A multifunctional plane is also being tested, and a new, light
front-line fighter plane is to be introduced in the Air Force
within a decade.
	   Kornukov and other military officers spoke at an air show in
Tushino, about 12 kilometers (8 miles) northwest of Moscow, which
was held in honor of Russian Aviation Day and the 86th anniversary
of the nation's Air Force. More than 100 military and civilian
planes, helicopters and fighter planes flew maneuvers, while
anti-aircraft defense systems including S-300 ground-to-air
missiles were on show on the ground.
	   ``Russia is justifiably regarded as a great aviation power,''
said President Boris Yeltsin in a congratulatory message quoted by
ITAR-Tass. ``The Russian aviation complex boasts the most advanced
technologies, skilled specialists and experienced pilots.''
	   Kornukov said that the Air Force had completed 90 percent of its
reform program, but had received only one-fifth of the 3.2 billion
rubles (dlrs 490 million) required for housing and other
administrative expenditures.

Report: German banks not worried about large credits to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German banks, by far the largest
creditors with some 50 billion marks (dlrs 27.9 billion) in Russia,
appear ``at least outwardly,'' unconcerned by the financial crisis
there, Handelsblatt newspaper said Sunday.
	   The Duesseldorf-based economics daily said that most of the
credits by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank and a fusion
of banks in Bavaria are covered by Hermes government loan
guarantees.
	   Consequently, analysts say a bit more than 3 billion marks (dlrs
1.7 billion) of the banks credits, of which 50-60 percent has been
covered by the bank's own risk precautions, is at stake,
Handelsblatt said.
	   The report cited an unnamed spokesman for Dresdner Bank as
saying that institution sees no threat to its engagement in Russia,
and that the Asian financial crisis was far more threatening.
	   No one was available at the banks Sunday to comment on the
report.
	   First signs of a financial crisis came last week, with the
Russian Central Bank suspending some interbank dollar sales and
rumors spreading of some bank defaults.
	   The Central Bank denied the rumors, but depositors at some banks
were told they could withdraw funds only in rubles, not dollars.
Now there are fears that the ruble may be devalued, making it even
more difficult to repay debts.
	   The crisis came less than a month after the International
Monetary Fund approved the latest installment in foreign assistance
to Russia _ a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package.

Sweden's shy water monster eludes expedition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OESTERSUND, Sweden (AP) _ Even in a country noted for its
reserve, his shyness is exceptional. The monster of Storsjoe lake
has been reported seen only 175 times in 400 years.
	   He kept to his retiring ways on Sunday while a flotilla of
boats, under the direction of noted Loch Ness monster investigator
Adrian Shine, combed a section of the huge lake for clues.
	   ``It was inconclusive but encouraging,'' Shine said after the
daylong hunt, in which a dozen unexpected blips showed up on the
boats' sonar.
	   Positive thinking is a characteristic of those who search for
the fearsome creatures rumored to lurk in large bodies of water
worldwide. Nobody has found the famed Nessie, much less Chessie or
South Bay Besse (of Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie), but their
adherents are convinced there's something down there.
	   Sweden's monster hasn't achieved the worldwide renown of Nessie.
For one thing, there have been far fewer sightings than the more
than 4,000 reported for the Scottish sea beast.
	   Then there's its name: Storsjoeodjuret. It's a tongue-twister
for those who can't speak Swedish _ pronounced STOR-hweu-oh-yur-et,
more or less _ and dull for those can, meaning just Big Lake
Monster.
	   But it's got some cachet in the area around the
465-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) lake about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) northwest of Stockholm.
	   ``I want to believe in it,'' said Olle Mattsson, director of the
local historical museum and one of the organizers of Sunday's
expedition. ``I believe in the people who say they've seen it.''
	   The sightings don't give a clear picture of the monster. It's
variously described as being from five to 15 meters long,
serpent-like or chubby, either gray, green or red, and with a head
like a dog or a fish. Some say it wails, others say it rattles.
	   Theories about what the spotters have seen range from whirlwinds
disturbing the lake's surface to moose swimming in formation with
their noses above water.
	   The label on a local microbrewer's beer portrays a monster that
looks like a beatnik dinosaur, but Shine says the monster, if it's
there, is probably more prosaic.
	   ``It's very unlikely your lake is Jurassic Park,'' he told about
100 people who gathered for a dockside summary of the day's work.
	   But the genial Shine doesn't think the search for a rational
explanation takes the romance out of the monster legend. ``The fun
in this process is the process of reasoning,'' he said.
	   His reason also tells him there's a certain flaw in the method
used in Sunday's search. The strategy was to have 15 small boats
moving slowly abreast over a 5-square-kilometer (2-square-mile)
section of the lake; if sonar or echo-location equipment found
something unexpectedly large, one of the boats would place a buoy
at that spot and Shine's boat, equipped with underwater camera,
would speed up and investigate further.
	   Of course, he noted, if the mystery object didn't move it
obviously isn't the monster.
	   ``If it's there when I get there, it isn't very interesting, is
it?'' he said.

Steinhauer charges through to win title as Moodie throws it away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with detail, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Three days after starting the
championship with a 9-over 81, Sherri Steinhauer won the Women's
British Open Sunday with a four-birdie final round of 69.
	   Slowed only by a single bogey at the first, the American charged
up the leaderboard to win the title by one stroke from countrywoman
Brandie Burton and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden. She totaled a 4-over
292 while Burton finished with a 71 and Gustafson a 70 for 5 over
for the tournament.
	   Scotland's Janice Moodie, a U.S. Tour rookie who led the field
by one stroke going into the final round, missed six six-foot putts
during her 75 to throw away the chance a first British victory in
the championship for seven years. She finished 6-over in fourth
place.
	   Steinhauer, winner of one major, the Du Maurier Classic, in
1992, gained only her third pro title and a check for 100,000
pounds (dlrs 165,000) at Royal Lytham St. Annes. Her best result
this season before this one was a share of fourth at the Rochester
International.
	   Her opening 9-over par round seemed a distance memory as she
followed it with rounds of 72, 70 and 69 to charge past the leading
contenders.
	   Betsy King, who was one stroke off the lead at the start of the
final round, had seven bogies in her 78 and she finished 9-over for
the championship.
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, aiming to win the
title for the third time in four years, finished 8-over after a
final round 73.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of four tournaments including two majors in
her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, wound up 20-over for the
championship after a final round 77 to go with scores of 78, 74 and
79.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean, who won the LPGA Championship and
the U.S. Women's Open, couldn't cope with the windy conditions and
the tough links course and managed only three birdies in 72 holes.

Bomb-ravaged Omagh grieves as Irish premier vows to `crush' IRA

dissidents

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Praying that Northern Ireland's
fragile peace won't shatter, Protestants and Catholics united in
uncomprehending grief Sunday over the car-bomb slaughter of at
least 28 civilians, including nine children, in this religiously
mixed town.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed to ``crush''
the IRA dissidents being blamed for the worst terrorist atrocity in
Northern Ireland history. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who
flew to Belfast, condemned what he called ``a tiny, fanatical
group'' who ``have no support in Northern Ireland ... just this
capacity for evil.''
	   Police said Saturday's unclaimed car bomb in downtown Omagh
killed a 65-year-old grandmother, her 30-year-old pregnant daughter
and her 18-month-old granddaughter.
	   Also among the official dead were two Spanish tourists, a
24-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy, and three boys aged 8 to 12
from the Irish Republic seaside resort of Buncrana, who all had
traveled togther to Omagh to visit the Ulster-American Folk Park
near the town.
	   With several residents still missing 24 hours later, soldiers
used heat-detecting equipment to determine whether more bodies lay
hidden in collapsed buildings in ravaged Market Street.
	   Those slain bore the full brunt of the blast when police
unwittingly herded a crowd towards the bomb because of a misleading
phoned warning.
	   Of approximately 220 people wounded in Omagh, about 100 remained
in hospitals across Northern Ireland, including 11 critical cases.
	   ``All of our patients will be disfigured in some way. Some will
be disabled very severely, and some may not survive,'' said Dr.
Laurence Rocke, surgeon at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, a
veteran of hundreds of bombings and shootings.
	   ``You keep thinking you're not going to see it again,'' he said,
his tired eyes misting over after operating around the clock on
many of the hospital's 22 most seriously wounded from Omagh.
	   Also Sunday, a man died after his car collided with an ambulance
ferrying wounded people from Omagh to a Belfast hospital.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, Protestant leader of
Northern Ireland's embryonic cross-community government, asked
church leaders to organize ``a national day of mourning,'' perhaps
Tuesday, ``for the whole community to come together and express its
sorrow, and to show that this evil act will not drive us back into
violence.''
	   Market Street grotesquely illustrated how 500 pounds (200 kgs)
of homemade explosives packed into a stolen car smashed so many
lives in seconds.
	   Shattered windows, ripped-off roofs, collapsed walls. Children's
diapers scattered amid fallen glass, bricks and wood planks. A
mangled and fire-blackened stroller resting near the carcass of the
car bomb. Tatters, too, of school uniforms littering the roadway
like autumn leaves. At Old McDonald's side-street cafe, half-eaten
bread and abandoned coffee.
	   And on buildings and pavements everywhere, despite an incessant
downpour, the running stains of Protestant and Catholic blood
alike.
	   ``They parked the car there deliberately. They must have seen
the mothers and children all around them buying their school
uniforms _ and just walked away,'' said the senior detective on the
scene, Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson.
	   Police and politicians in both parts of Ireland said they were
certain Irish Republican Army defectors were responsible. Of three
uncompromising anti-British gangs opposed to the IRA truce of July
1997, one group dubbed the ``Real IRA'' is considered the greatest
threat to undermine April's compromise accord on how Northern
Ireland should be governed.
	   Ahern said the Irish government would destroy the ``Real IRA,''
which has been blamed for planting several car bombs in Northern
Ireland towns in the past six months, wounding many but killing
nobody until now.
	   ``Whatever resources are necessary to crush this organization
will be given,'' said Ahern, who noted that 14 suspected members of
the faction were already imprisoned for earlier thwarted attacks.
	   Mary McAleese, the first Northern Ireland native to be elected
president of the Irish Republic, arrived in Omagh to meet anxious
relatives of people on the ``missing'' list. Some were huddled in
desperate embraces as each hour increased the likelihood that their
loved one was among the mangled bodies awaiting identification at
the nearby army base's makeshift morgue.
	   McAleese condemned the IRA dissidents as ``a posse of serial
killers'' who abandoned their car bomb amid ``a scene of simple,
humble innocence.''
	   Also there was Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, who appealed for people ``not to give up hope. People need
to have the conviction that we are going to see peace in this
country.''
	   But his deputy, Martin McGuinness, rejected an appeal from
former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton for IRA commanders to
cooperate with the Irish Republic's police and ``finger'' the
dissidents.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Pakistan has returned a suspect in the
U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to Nairobi, where a
growing team of FBI investigators pressed ahead Sunday in their
painstaking search for evidence.
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said
Sunday that Mohammad Sadik Howaida was handed over to Kenyan
authorities last week, bypassing U.S. investigators in Pakistan.
	   A ministry spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival from
Nairobi at the Karachi airport on Aug. 7, the day twin bombings at
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
257 people and wounded at least 5,500 more.
	   A government source in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sadik was returned to Nairobi on Friday, bypassing
U.S. investigators who had flown to Pakistan to question him.
	   U.S. officials in Nairobi refused to discuss Sadik.
	   ``This is a matter in which we are working very closely and very
hard with our Kenyan colleagues. I can't make any comment,'' said
the assistant FBI special agent in charge of the Nairobi
investigation, Hardrick Crawford. ``This is an ongoing
investigation.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also refused comment.
	   As the probe in Nairobi intensifies, more FBI agents arrived
over the weekend in the Kenyan capital, where they are expected to
stay for four to five months.
	   The government source in Pakistan said the suspect told his
interrogators that a few other conspirators, who left Nairobi
earlier, had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan. He
had planned to do the same, he said.
	   The source told The Associated Press that investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and exiled Saudi multimillionaire
Osama bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for
the last two years.
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said
immigration officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged, and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   ``On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts,
he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law,'' Altaf said,
adding that Howaida was sent to Nairobi aboard a special plane.
	   A ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab national''
without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually means
someone from the Middle East.
	   A day earlier, U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents
were headed to Pakistan to question the man.
	   But Altaf said no foreigners were allowed to interrogate
Howaida. The government source said Pakistani officials refused
U.S. officials who came to Karachi access to the suspect, and they
had to follow him to Kenya on another plane.
	   It wasn't clear why Howaida was not directly handed over to the
Americans. But it could be fallout from the case involving Mir
Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani convicted in the United States of killing
two CIA employees.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.
	   At the site of the bombing, meanwhile, U.S. investigators in
helmets and gloves were going through the shattered embassy
building piece by piece Sunday, occasionally pulling out magnifying
glasses to inspect something before tossing it out the window onto
a heap below.
	   The FBI has more than 200 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
and more agents arrrived in Nairobi on Sunday to assist in the
probe into the worst-ever attack on an American embassy.
	   Across the street from the embassy, Kenyan workers were on the
roof of the national railway headquarters, installing new red tiles
to replace ones blown off by the force of the blast.
	   Even nine days after the bombing, thousands of Kenyans still
lined up at police barricades erected in a wide circle around the
bombing site, gazing quietly at the wreckage.
	   Pakistan's national newspaper, The News, quoting unidentified
government sources Sunday, said Sadik confessed to planning the
bombings. The News said he was helped in Kenya by sympathizers with
connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
	   Kenyan police have said they detained about five people for
questioning in the case.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly
vowed to strike America interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania. That group is considered the successor to the
groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In a show of support for both East Africans and embassy staffers
abroad, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is planning
brief stops in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi on Tuesday.

Kazak police claim victory in fight against drug-smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazak security officials have claimed a victory in
their fight against drug-smuggling, having detained members of two
criminal groups accused of smuggling narcotics to Russia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
	   While the amounts of drugs the groups had tried to smuggle were
small _ eleven kilograms (24.2 pounds) of marijuana, and 2,200
grams (77.6 ounces) of opium _ their detention signaled that a new,
dirt-road route that bypassed customs posts would not become a new
corridor for drug-smuggling, officials of Kazakstan's National
Security Committee said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   More than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of drugs are smuggled from
Kazakstan to Russia every day, according to Interpol information
cited by ITAR-Tass. Only 5 percent of the drugs are confiscated by
Kazak police, said Bekzhan Karikbolov, the head of Interpol's
office in Kazakstan. Soon the police will be joined by sniffer
dogs, who should help improve their record.

Yemen government cracks down on illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Hundreds of policemen were deployed in
Yemen's major cities Sunday in a campaign to enforce a ban on
illegal weapons.
	   The Interior Ministry on Friday ordered the banning of all
unlicensed weapons in an effort to curb rising violence.
	   Two men were slightly injured on Saturday when they clashed with
security forces after refusing to hand over their weapons. There
were no report of violence on Sunday.
	   Officials say there are over 50 million weapons of different
kinds in Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen, armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. They have kidnapped foreigners
and clashed with security forces.
	   More than 100 soldiers and tribesmen have died and hundreds more
have been wounded since June in clashes over fuel price hikes.
Tribesmen armed with rockets, grenades and artillery have attacked
soldiers, blown up oil pipelines and tried to assassinate top
government officials.
	   More than 250 foreigners have been kidnapped by tribesmen since
1991 to pressure the government to provide better services and
money. So far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including
sending armed security guards with tourists, have proved futile.
	   The hostages, often oil workers, diplomats or tourists, are
usually treated as guests and released unharmed.

Russian, Finnish navies to resume cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top Russian and Finnish naval officers have
drafted a program of cooperation to promote stability in the Baltic
Sea region, the commander-in-chief of Russia's navy said Sunday
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov said that the program was elaborated
during his three-day official visit to Finland that ended on
Wednesday. The program gives priority to training and exchanging
naval cadets and their professors and will include traditional
activities like port calls by warships, he said.
	   ``The Baltic region is over-saturated with armaments and
military structures.... Naturally, this does not ensure stability
and provokes concern,'' Kuroyedov was quoted as saying.

Sweden's shy water monster eludes expedition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OESTERSUND, Sweden (AP) _ Even in a country noted for its
reserve, his shyness is exceptional. There have only been 175
reported sightings of the monster of Storsjoe lake in 400 years.
	   He kept to his retiring ways on Sunday while a flotilla of
boats, under the direction of noted Loch Ness monster investigator
Adrian Shine, combed a section of the huge lake for clues.
	   ``It was inconclusive but encouraging,'' Shine said after the
daylong hunt, in which a dozen unexpected blips showed up on the
boats' sonar.
	   Positive thinking is a characteristic of those who search for
the fearsome creatures rumored to lurk in large bodies of water
worldwide. Nobody has found the famed Nessie, much less Chessie or
South Bay Besse (of Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie), but their
adherents are convinced there's something down there.
	   Sweden's monster hasn't achieved the worldwide renown of Nessie.
For one thing, there have been far fewer sightings than the more
than 4,000 reported for the Scottish sea beast.
	   Then there's its name: Storsjoeodjuret. It's a tongue-twister
for those who can't speak Swedish _ pronounced STOR-hweu-oh-yur-et,
more or less _ and dull for those can, meaning just Big Lake
Monster.
	   But it's got some cachet in the area around the
465-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) lake about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) northwest of Stockholm.
	   ``I want to believe in it,'' said Olle Mattsson, director of the
local historical museum and one of the organizers of Sunday's
expedition. ``I believe in the people who say they've seen it.''
	   The sightings don't give a clear picture of the monster. It's
variously described as being from 5 meters to 15 meters (5 1/2
yards to 16 yards) long, serpent-like or chubby, gray, green or
red, and with a head like a dog or a fish. Some say it wails,
others say it rattles.
	   Theories about what the spotters have seen range from whirlwinds
disturbing the lake's surface to moose swimming in formation with
their noses above water.
	   The label on a local microbrewer's beer portrays a monster that
looks like a beatnik dinosaur, but Shine says the monster, if it's
there, is probably more prosaic.
	   ``It's very unlikely your lake is Jurassic Park,'' he told about
100 people who gathered for a dockside summary of the day's work.
	   But the genial Shine doesn't think the search for a rational
explanation takes the romance out of the monster legend. ``The fun
in this process is the process of reasoning,'' he said.
	   His reason also tells him there's a certain flaw in the method
used in Sunday's search. The strategy was to have 15 small boats
moving slowly abreast over a 5-square-kilometer (2-square-mile)
section of the lake; if sonar or echo-location equipment found
something unexpectedly large, one of the boats would place a buoy
at that spot and Shine's boat, equipped with underwater camera,
would speed up and investigate further.
	   Of course, he noted, if the mystery object didn't move it
obviously isn't the monster.
	   ``If it's there when I get there, it isn't very interesting, is
it?'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya asked Britain Sunday to investigate
allegations by a former British intelligence agent that London
plotted the assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Former British agent David Shayler alleged in a televised TV
interview earlier this month that Britain's Secret Intelligence
Service channeled about dlrs 160,000 to an Islamic group to kill
Gadhafi.
	   ``The government of the United Kingdom is called upon to open an
independent investigation concerning what David Shayler revealed,''
said a Libyan Foreign Ministry statement. It was carried by the
official Libyan news agency, JANA, on Sunday.
	   The British government on Sunday dismissed the allegations.
	   ``There is no British plot to assassinate Gadhafi,'' a British
Foreign Office spokeswoman said in London, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has already described the
allegations ``as fantasy, so it's a non-story,'' the spokeswoman
said.

Owen starts Premier League campaign with a goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) Michael Owen showed he's pumped and
ready to repeat his World Cup heroics in the Premier League as he
scored one goal and set up another in Liverpool's 2-1 opening win
over Southampton on Sunday.
	   Owen broke a 1-1 deadlock in the 73rd minute when he slammed-in
a right-foot drive from 10 yards to clinch the match for Liverpool
at the Dell.
	   Steve Staunton took a throw-in deep in Southampton's territory,
Paul Ince jumped high and headed the ball back in front of goal and
Owen, who scored 18 goals for Liverpool last season, completed the
sequence.
	   Liverpool had gone on the attack early, with Ince attempting a
drive from 25 yards after just 15 seconds and Owen just missing
with his first attempt in the fourth minute.
	   The 18-year-old, who scored one of the best goals of the France
98 World Cup, set up the Reds' first goal in the 39th minute when
he made room on the left flank and provided the perfect cross for
Karlhienze Riedle to head into the net.
	   Southampton absorbed most of the pressure in the first half
before opening the scoring in the 36th minute when Egil Ostenstad
flew high above a pack in front of goal and headed a cross past
Reds' goalkeeper Brad Friedel.
	   But Liverpool remained composed and scored the equalizer three
minutes later.
	   Liverpool, the glamor team of English top-flight soccer in the
1970s and 1980s, has not won the league since 1990 but has
assembled a strong line-up for its 1998-99 campaign behind England
stars Ince, Owen and Steve McManaman.
	   The Red's also took aboard former French national team coach
Gerrard Houllier to share the management responsibilities with Roy
Evans in its bid to mould the league winning combination.
	   FA Cup and League double titlist Arsenal kicks off its Premier
League defense against Nottingham Forrest at Highbury on Monday.
	   The Gunners stars are eager to show their wares on the European
stage in the Champions Cup but Arsene Wenger said he will ensure
his players concentrate on one match at a time.
	   ``Personally I'm more concerned for the Premier League. I have
to make sure their minds are fully concentrated on it,'' Wenger
said Sunday.
	   The Premier League season opened Saturday, with Chelsea the
major casualty.
	   Gianluca Viall's foreign legion _ he launched his 1998-99 league
campaign with nine foreign players in his starting side, including
new signings Marcel Desailly, Albert Ferrer and Pierluigi Casiraghi
_ was outplayed by Coventry to the tune of 2-1.
	   Coventry, which won the corresponding match last season, relied
on two unheralded Englishman, Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby, to
give it a surprise 2-0 lead after 15 minutes.
	   The shock opening sparked the international-studded Chelsea into
action but the Blues could only manage one goal, through Uraguay's
Gustavo Poyet in the 37th minute.
	   David Beckham may still be a villain in the eyes of some English
fans after being sent off during England's World Cup loss to
Argentina but he's still a hero at Old Trafford after scoring a
late goal to ensure Mancheter United salvaged a draw against
Leicester.
	   Manchester United trailed by two goals in the second half but
its internationals came good in the last 10 minutes to earn last
year's league runner-up a crucial point.
	   Teddy Sheringham came of the bench to score the goal which
reduced Leicester's lead and then Beckham scored on a 25-yard free
kick to level the match three minutes into injury time.
	   It wasn't a good start for Everton's new Scottish manager Walter
Smith or Scotland's World Cup star John Collins in a 0-0 tie with
Aston Villa.
	   Collins, a transfer from Monaco, missed a crucial penalty kick
after just eight minutes. Although Villa didn't set the game alight
either, with striker Dwight Yorke showing none of the spark which
attracted 10 million pound (dlrs 16.25 million) transfer bids for
him in the off-season.
	   Former England international Paul Gascoigne's debut for
Middlesbrough was overshadowed by a calf injury and the death of
his close friend on Friday. Gascoigne, who vowed to do his talking
through his football this season after being axed from England's
World Cup squad in France, had a quiet game in the 0-0 tie with
Leeds United.
	   Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright registered his
first goal for West Ham on debut when he scored a goal in the final
five minutes against Sheffield Wednesday to give the Hammers a 1-0
win.
	   Blackburn and Derby fought out a 0-0 draw, while newly-promoted
Charlton managed a 0-0 draw against Newcastle despite playing one
man down for 70 minutes after Richard Rufus was red-carded for
violent conduct.
	   Wimbledon, rated one of the teams most likely to face relegation
this season, got away to a positive start with a 3-1 home victory
of Christian Gross' Tottenham Hotspur outfit. Efan Ekoku scored
goals in the 59th and 90th minutes to become the league's leading
goal scorer.

Deploring `butchery,' world leaders urge Northern Ireland to keep
</HEADLINE>
faith in peacemaking &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II appealed to the
people of bomb-bloodied Northern Ireland to keep their faith in the
peace process _ a message repeated by leaders around the world, who
said that violent retaliation would only serve the cause of the
killers.
	   Saturday's bombing in Omagh led newscasts and topped front pages
in newspapers in Europe and around the world. Many _ journalists
and politicians _ made clear their fear that the final victim would
be the province's 5-month-old peace accord.
	   Calling the bombing `tragic and senseless,'' John Paul evoked
the ``blessings of God on the many wounded, on the families of the
dead and on those who continue to have faith in dialogue and in the
accord.''
	   ``I hope for dear Ireland that people of goodwill will not yield
to violence, and that they know to faithfully persevere in the
peaceful cooperation on which the future of their country
depends,'' the pontiff said.
	   The pope, straying from prepared remarks for his weekly Sunday
address, spoke to faithful gathered below the window of his
vacation retreat southeast of Rome. Political leaders from Africa
to the United States echoed his appeal, citing voter approval of
the April peace accord in saying that the majority of Northern
Ireland's people already had made their preference for peace known.
	   ``So much goodwill and faith should not be lost to the mindless
violence of a few,'' South African President Nelson Mandela said in
Pretoria.
	   In Washington, President Clinton called it ``butchery.''
	   ``I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland
against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends
here,'' Clinton said in a statement from the White House.
	   He said the attack was ``intended to wreck Northern Ireland's
hopes for peace and reconciliation.''
	   Spain's Barcelona-based La Vanguardia newspaper compared
Northern Ireland to another bomb-bloodied nation: Israel, where a
series of 1996 bombings played a key role in stalling the region's
peace process.
	   ``Just as in Palestine, the extremist minorities will continue
to feed off each,'' the Spanish newspaper predicted.
	   In Boston, home to a large community of Irish-Americans, the
lead headline in the Boston Herald said simply, ``Carnage.''
	   But Connell Gallagher, publisher of Boston's weekly Irish
Emigrant newspaper, said many Irish and Irish-Americans overseas
have hope the peace will endure beyond the momentary bloodshed.
	   ``It's a reminder of the devastation of the past 28 years,''
Gallagher said. ``It's a reminder of why peace is more important
now than it ever was.''

Frozen graves on Arctic island may hold secret of deadly virus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) - Six young coal miners killed 80
years ago by one of the deadliest viruses ever known may now share
the secrets they took to frozen graves on this remote Arctic
island.
	   Scientists will begin exhuming the corpses on Wednesday, in
hopes of learning the secrets of the Spanish Flu, which killed at
least 20 million people in a 1918-19 global epidemic. The knowledge
could help fight future virus epidemics.
	   ``If we know the genetic structure of the virus, it can help us
produce a vaccine,'' Tom Bergan, a Norwegian physician and
professor at the University of Oslo, said when he arrived at
Norway's remote and frigid Svalbard Islands on Sunday.
	   It is not without qualms that the 15 experts from four countries
will begin digging into the permafrost, which has preserved the
bodies in graves marked by white wooden crosses in Longyearbyen.
The village is the main town on the largely glacier-covered
Svalbard Archipelago, a mining outpost north of mainland Norway and
just 950 kilometers (600 miles) from the North Pole.
	   ``Death is a very private thing,'' team leader Kristy Duncan, a
medical geographer from the University of Windsor in Canada, said
in an interview Sunday. ``We did not want to disturb a cemetery
unless there was a good chance of learning the secrets of the
Spanish Flu.''
	   Duncan said she was deeply moved that the families of the men
would give their permission to dig up the graves in hopes of
benefiting humanity.
	   The young men were working as coal miners on these islands, when
they died of the flu in October 1918. Like many of the victims they
were young - 18 to 29 - suggesting that older people may have built
up at least some immunity from a similar virus years earlier.
	   Victims of the Spanish Flu suffered a sudden fever, chills,
headache, malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death. It
killed more people than all the fighting in World War I, and
scientists are still not sure exactly what it was.
	   The research team, which includes experts from Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States, hopes the viral material that may
have been frozen in the bodies will make it possible to get a
genetic profile of the virus. According to Duncan, that could help
explain how the 1918 virus killed so many people and then
disappeared.
	   Other scientists, including a team that took samples from a
frozen corpse in Alaska this year, still only have a partial
genetic picture of the virus.
	   Last year, the team studied the Svalbard graves with radar, and
determined that the bodies of the miners were well below the
permafrost. That made them excellent subjects for study.
	   On Tuesday, the team plans to assure Svalbard residents that
opening the graves will not expose them to a risk of disease. Flu
viruses deteriorate rapidly, which has been a problem in studying
the Spanish Flu.
	   ``There is no chance in the world that there is a viable virus
in there,'' said Bergan, the Norwegian doctor. ``But we are acting
like responsible people.''
	   The grave site will be treated as if it were highly contagious.
He said access to a tent over the graves will be strictly limited,
and that all researchers inside will wear protective clothing and
oxygen masks.
	   The excavation, sample-taking and restoration of the graves is
expected to take about three weeks. Analysis of the samples will
take much longer.
	   Duncan, the team leader, said no trace will be left of the
exhumations when the team is done.
	   ``We know that this is something potentially hurtful to the
families,'' she said. ``But perhaps we can at last learn the
secrets of 1918 and use them to better international human
health.''

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Praying that Northern Ireland's
fragile peace won't shatter, Protestants and Catholics united in
uncomprehending grief Sunday over the car-bomb slaughter of at
least 28 civilians, including nine children and a woman pregnant
with twins, in this religiously mixed town.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern vowed to ``crush''
the IRA dissidents being blamed for the worst terrorist atrocity in
Northern Ireland history. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who
broke of his vacation to fly to Belfast, condemned what he called
``a tiny, fanatical group'' who ``have no support in Northern
Ireland ... just this capacity for evil'' and pledged to ``carry on
to my last breath working for peace'' in the province.
	   Police said Saturday's unclaimed car bomb in downtown Omagh
killed 65-year-old grandmother Mary Grimes, her 30-year-old
daughter Avril Monaghan who was expecting twins, and her
18-month-old granddaughter Maura Monaghan. The Catholic Primate of
All Ireland, Archbishop Sean Brady, visited surviving family
members Sunday and said they are ``just totally devastated. They
are just so shocked.''
	   Mrs. Grimes, a mother of 12 from Beragh, about 8 miles (13 kms)
southeast of Omagh, was on a shopping trip with her daughter and
granddaughter. Mrs. Monaghan, who lived between two towns about 15
miles (25 kms) southeast of Omagh, is survived by her husband, two
daughters and a son, the oldest of whom is six.

Owen starts Premier League campaign with a goal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITS, edits throughout

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) Michael Owen showed he's pumped and
ready to repeat his World Cup heroics in the Premier League as he
scored one goal and set up another in Liverpool's 2-1 opening win
over Southampton on Sunday.
	   Owen broke a 1-1 deadlock in the 73rd minute when he slammed-in
a right-foot drive from 10 yards to clinch the match at the Dell.
	   Steve Staunton took a throw-in deep in Southampton's territory,
Paul Ince jumped high and headed the ball back in front of goal for
Owen, who scored 18 league goals for Liverpool last season, to
complete the sequence.
	   Liverpool had gone on the attack early, with Ince attempting a
drive from 25 yards after just 15 seconds and Owen just missing
with his first attempt in the fourth minute.
	   The 18-year-old, who scored one of the best goals of the France
98 World Cup, set up the Reds' first goal in the 39th minute when
he made room on the left flank and provided the perfect cross for
Karlhienze Riedle to head into the net.
	   Southampton absorbed most of the pressure in the first half
before opening the scoring in the 36th minute when Egil Ostenstad
flew high above a pack in front of goal and headed a cross past
Reds' goalkeeper Brad Friedel.
	   But Liverpool remained composed and scored the equalizer three
minutes later.
	   Liverpool, the glamor team of English top-flight soccer in the
1970s and 1980s, has not won the league since 1990 but has
assembled a strong line-up for its 1998-99 campaign behind England
stars Ince, Owen and Steve McManaman.
	   The Reds' also took aboard former French national team coach,
Gerrard Houllier, to share the management responsibilities with Roy
Evans in its bid to mould the league-winning combination.
	   Owen, the England striker who became a national hero after his
dynamic performances in the World Cup, was named player of the
match.
	   Arsenal, FA Cup and League double titlist, kicks off its Premier
League defense against Nottingham Forest at Highbury on Monday.
	   The Gunners stars are eager to show their wares on the European
stage in the Champions Cup but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said
he will ensure his players concentrate on one match at a time.
	   ``Personally I'm more concerned for the Premier League. I have
to make sure their minds are fully concentrated on it,'' Wenger
said Sunday.
	   The Premier League season opened Saturday, with Chelsea the
major casualty.
	   Gianluca Vialli's foreign legion _ he launched his 1998-99
league campaign with nine foreign players in his starting side,
including new signings Marcel Desailly, Albert Ferrer and Pierluigi
Casiraghi _ was outplayed by Coventry to the tune of 2-1.
	   Coventry, which won the corresponding match last season, relied
on two unheralded Englishman, Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby, to
give it a surprise 2-0 lead after 15 minutes.
	   The shock opening sparked the international-studded Chelsea into
action but the Blues could only manage one goal, through Uraguay's
Gustavo Poyet in the 37th minute.
	   David Beckham may still be a villain in the eyes of some English
fans after being sent off during England's World Cup loss to
Argentina but he's still a favorite at Old Trafford after scoring a
late goal to ensure Manchester United salvaged a draw against
Leicester.
	   Manchester United trailed by two goals in the second half but
its internationals came good in the last 10 minutes to earn last
season's league runner-up a crucial point.
	   Teddy Sheringham came of the bench to score the goal which
reduced Leicester's lead and then Beckham scored on a 25-yard free
kick to level the match three minutes into injury time.
	   It wasn't a good start for Everton's new Scottish manager Walter
Smith or Scotland's World Cup star John Collins in a 0-0 tie with
Aston Villa.
	   Collins, a transfer from Monaco, missed a crucial penalty kick
after just eight minutes. However, Villa didn't set the game alight
either, with striker Dwight Yorke showing none of the spark which
attracted 10 million pound (dlrs 16.25 million) transfer bids for
him in the off-season.
	   Former England international Paul Gascoigne's debut for
Middlesbrough was overshadowed by a calf injury and the death of
his close friend on Friday. Gascoigne, who vowed to do his talking
through his football this season after being axed from England's
World Cup squad in France, had a quiet game in the 0-0 tie with
Leeds United.
	   Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright registered his
first goal for West Ham on debut when he scored a goal in the final
five minutes against Sheffield Wednesday to give the Hammers a 1-0
win.
	   Blackburn and Derby fought out a 0-0 draw, while newly-promoted
Charlton managed a 0-0 draw against Newcastle despite playing one
man down for 70 minutes after Richard Rufus was red-carded for
violent conduct.
	   Wimbledon, rated one of the teams most likely to face relegation
this season, got away to a positive start with a 3-1 home victory
of Christian Gross' Tottenham Hotspur outfit. Efan Ekoku scored
goals in the 59th and 90th minutes to become the league's leading
goal scorer.

Steinhauer charges through to win title as Moodie throws it away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Three days after starting the
championship with a 9-over 81, Sherri Steinhauer won the Women's
British Open Sunday with a four-birdie final round of 69.
	   Slowed only by a single bogey at the first, the American charged
up the leaderboard to win the title by one stroke from countrywoman
Brandie Burton and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden. She totaled a 4-over
292 while Burton finished with a 71 and Gustafson a 70 for 5 over
for the tournament.
	   ``This is like a dream,'' said Steinhauer, whose 156-yard
approach to the last gave her a straight 8-foot birdie putt. It
only just made it. The ball looked like staying out, hung on the
lip and dropped in.
	   ``When I walked up to make the putt, I looked at the leader
board and thought `this could win the British Open','' Steinhauer
said. ``I made a good strike but it barely made it. It was the last
roll.''
	   With eight players still out on the course, Steinhauer had to
wait for only her third pro victory, although one is a major, the
1992 Du Maurier Classic.
	   Scotland's Janice Moodie, a U.S. Tour rookie who led the field
by one stroke going into the final round, missed six six-foot putts
during her 75 to throw away the chance a first British victory in
the championship for seven years. She finished 6-over in fourth
place.
	   ``I missed six that could have been,'' the Scot said. ``I was so
close. Two shots on that course was nothing.''
	   Steinhauer collected 100,000 pounds (dlrs 165,000) for her
victory. Her best result this season had been a share of fourth at
the Rochester International.
	   Her opening 9-over par round seemed a distance memory as she
followed it with rounds of 72, 70 and 69 to charge past the leading
contenders.
	   Six players either led or had a share of the lead on the final
day of the tournament but Steinhauer, who started the day four off
the lead, didn't join them until the 16th.
	   She would have an outright lead but a 10-foot birdie putt stayed
on the edge of the hole at 16. A 6-foot birdie putt at 17 slipped
right but she finally moved ahead at the last.
	   ``After my 81, the only thing I dreamed of was changing my
flight because I would have to leave early,'' Steinhauer said. ``At
that stage, my only real goal was making the cut.
	   ``Last night, I called my parents and my dad said: `wouldn't it
be something for someone who shot 81 first day to go and win the
tournament?' I just laughed.''
	   After birdies at six, 11 and 13, she knew it was more than a
possibility because no one had made a break at the front and others
were falling out of contention.
	   Betsy King, who was one stroke off the lead at the start of the
final round, had seven bogies in her 78 and she finished 9-over for
the championship. Winner of 31 titles and more money than anyone in
the Tour's history, she's still looking for her first victory of
the year.
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, aiming to win the
title for the third time in four years, finished 8-over after a
final round 73 and took fifth place.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of four tournaments including two majors in
her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, wound up 20-over for the
championship after a final round 77 to go with scores of 78, 74 and
79.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean, who won the LPGA Championship and
the U.S. Women's Open, couldn't cope with the windy conditions and
the tough links course and managed only three birdies in 72 holes.
	   ``I learned many things,'' said Pak, who had 16 bogeys and two
double bogeys over four days. ``The wind made it hard and the
greens are hard to read. This is a totally different course. It is
hard to play.''

Leon Van Bont sprints to triumph in World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Corrects spelling of Michele Bartoli's name in lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Holland's Leon Van Bont held off World
Cup leader Michele Bartoli in a furious sprint over the final
meters Sunday to capture the HEW Classic cycling race in Hamburg.
	   Van Bont started the sprint, jumping to the front of a pack of
13 riders with 500 meters (500 yards) left to edge Bartoli in a
time of six hours, nine minutes and 28 seconds at the World Cup
race.
	   Belgium's Ludo Dierckyens was third on the flat 253 (152 mile)
kilometer course that wound through Hamburg and favored sprinters
like Van Bont, winner of the Tour de France's ninth stage.
	   The top 11 riders finished with identical times.
	   ``There's a lot of fast people and you don't know what's going
to happen at the end of a long race, but I felt strong,'' said Van
Bont. ``I put this win on the same level as the stage win at the
Tour.''
	   The World Cup race was just the second major event since the
Tour of France finished with a doping scandal that led to several
teams and riders being expelled from cycling's premier event.
	   The second place of Bartoli, recovering from bronchitis, gave
the Italian rider a huge lead in the overall standings after the
seventh of 10 World Cup races.
	   The Team Asacs rider has 276 points, while Van Bont is second at
181.
	   After a slow start for the first hour, a group of 24 riders
separated from the pack and was whittled to 13 with 42 kilometers
(26 miles) left after one of the course's few steep climbs.
	   During the final four kilometers, riders constantly threatened
breakaways but were caught by the lead group that included Van
Bont, Bartoli and Telekom's Jan Ullrich, second at the Tour de
France.
	   Ullrich, last year's winner of the event, finished ninth as he
failed to keep pace with Van Bont's final spurt.
	   The doping scandals that plague the sport continue with four
Italian cyclists from Team Mobilvetta Northwave all failing blood
tests Tuesday at the Tour de Portugal.

Frozen graves on Arctic island may hold secret of deadly virus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ Six young coal miners killed 80
years ago by one of the deadliest viruses ever known may now share
the secrets they took to frozen graves on this remote Arctic
island.
	   Scientists will begin exhuming their corpses on Wednesday in
hopes of learning the secrets of the Spanish flu, which killed at
least 20 million people in a 1918-19 global epidemic. The knowledge
could help fight future virus epidemics.
	   ``If we know the genetic structure of the virus, it can help us
produce a vaccine,'' Tom Bergan, a Norwegian physician and
professor at the University of Oslo, said when he arrived at
Norway's remote and frigid Svalbard Islands on Sunday.
	   It is not without qualms that the 15 experts from four countries
will begin digging into the permafrost, which has preserved the
bodies in graves marked by white wooden crosses in Longyearbyen.
The village is the main town on the largely glacier-covered
Svalbard Archipelago, a mining outpost north of mainland Norway
just 950 kilometers (600 miles) from the North Pole.
	   ``Death is a very private thing,'' team leader Kristy Duncan, a
medical geographer from the University of Windsor in Canada, said
in an interview Sunday. ``We did not want to disturb a cemetery
unless there was a good chance of learning the secrets of the
Spanish flu.''
	   Duncan said she was deeply moved that the families of the men
would give permission to dig up the graves in hopes of benefiting
humanity.
	   The young men were working as coal miners on these islands when
they died of the flu in October 1918. Like many of the victims they
were young _ 18 to 29 _ suggesting that older people may have built
up at least some immunity from a similar virus years earlier.
	   Victims of the Spanish flu suffered a sudden fever, chills,
headache, malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and rapid death. It
killed more people than all the fighting in World War I, and
scientists are still not sure exactly what it was.
	   The research team, which includes experts from Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States, hopes the viral material that may
have been frozen in the bodies will give them a genetic profile of
the virus.
	   That could help explain how the 1918 virus killed so many people
and then disappeared, Duncan said.
	   Other scientists, including a team that took samples from a
frozen corpse in Alaska this year, still only have a partial
genetic picture of the virus.
	   Last year, the team studied the Svalbard graves with radar and
determined that the bodies of the miners were well below the
permafrost. That made them excellent subjects for study.
	   On Tuesday, the team plans to assure Svalbard residents that
opening the graves will not expose them to a risk of disease. Flu
viruses deteriorate rapidly, which has been a problem in studying
the Spanish flu.
	   ``There is no chance in the world that there is a viable virus
in there,'' said Bergan, the Norwegian doctor. ``But we are acting
like responsible people.''
	   The grave site will be treated as if it were highly contagious.
He said access to a tent over the graves will be strictly limited,
and that all researchers inside will wear protective clothing and
oxygen masks.
	   The excavation, sample-taking and restoration of the graves is
expected to take about three weeks. Analysis of the samples will
take much longer.
	   Duncan, the team leader, said no trace will be left of the
exhumations when the team is done.
	   ``We know that this is something potentially hurtful to the
families,'' she said. ``But perhaps we can at last learn the
secrets of 1918 and use them to better international human
health.''

Congolese rebels announce new leadership

 &UR; With BC-Congo, BC-Congo-Strange Revolution &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurant Kabila on Sunday announced members of a transitional team
which is preparing to take power from the country's embattled
leader.
	   The Congolese Democratic Coalition is led by Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, a professor and a longtime opponent to former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, and includes Kabila's former foreign minister,
Bizima Karaha.
	   ``We want to gather all political parties fighting against
Kabila's dictatorship,'' Wamba said. ``We will welcome any
political parties, as long as we avoid a new dictatorship.''
	   The coalition called on all Congolese to join in the fight
against Kabila, and on the international community to aid the
uprising by denying their support for the government.
	   In a lengthy political declaration, Wamba said the movement will
establish a democratic republic and unity among all Congolese, and
eradicate corruption, nepotism, arbitrary arrests and political
assassinations which it claims have been perpetrated by Kabila.
	   Wamba said the government will be formed once Kinshasa is in
rebel hands, and although he promised elections, he said it was too
soon to speculate on a date.
	   ``We're still in a war,'' Wamba said.
	   Other members are academics and former Kabila allies from the
provinces of Kivu, Katanga, Kasai and other parts of the vast
African nation.
	   Kabila is a Muluba from Katanga, and currently is in the
regional capital, Lubumbashi, according to Karaha. But he denied
that Kabila will take Katanga or lead the copper-rich province to
secession, saying it too will be in rebel hands soon.
	   ``We will be in Kinshasa in a week,'' said Jean-Pierre Ondekane,
the chief rebel commander.
	   Since the revolt began Aug. 2, the rebels _ ethnic Tutsis,
members of Kabila's opposition and disgruntled soldiers _ have
taken over eastern Congo and flew thousands of troops to the far
west, closing in on Kinshasa.
	   Ondekane said the rebels were targeting Songololo, about 250
kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, after capturing the
Congo River port of Matadi and the Inga power plant.
	   He also reported fighting outside Kisangani, the third largest
city in north-central Congo, but gave no details.
	   ``Population is behind our operations,'' he said. ``This is not
a Tutsi movement, this is a nationwide revolution.''

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Officials at Mission Control in St. Louis lost
contact with balloonist Steve Fossett Sunday as he flew near
Australia.
	   Alan Blount, director of mission control at Washington
University in St. Louis, said that an emergency locator beacon was
activated about the time they lost contact.
	   At the time, the balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers)
northwest of New Caledonia, and 500 miles (800 kilometers) from the
Australian coast, he said at a news conference.
	   However, Blount said it was too early to say if the balloon had
gone down.
	   A second emergency locator beacon was activated _ indicating
that either Fossett started the beacon himself or it was set off by
water.
	   ``We don't really know what happened as yet,'' Blount said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rebel organization's name, program in new grafs

 &UR; With Congo, Congo-Rebels
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Two years ago, Robert Karega joined rebels
who were determined to put an end to three decades of Mobutu Sese
Seko's dictatorship and mismanagement of the vast central African
nation.
	   They chose Laurent Kabila as their leader and said they were
working for a better future for the country they would rename the
Congo.
	   Two weeks ago, Goma radio interrupted Karega's Sunday dinner in
this eastern Congolese town with an announcement that another
rebellion was under way. This time, he and his friends had little
idea what it was all about.
	   ``We were all surprised. Nobody expected things to change so
fast,'' said the 25-year-old political science graduate. ``We know
(President) Laurent Kabila is bad, but we don't see how this will
work and what will change.''
	   The two-week-old rebellion, spearheaded by ethnic Tutsis and
disgruntled officers and troops in the partially retooled Congolese
Army, has swept eastern and souuthwestern Congo with surprising
speed.
	   But as rebels are reported to be closing in on the capital,
Kinshasa, questions about the rebellion multiply.
	   Who are the people behind it? What do they want? And, what can
they deliver to the long-suffering country of 47 million people
that is rich in natural resources, yet limping along at a
subsistence level?
	   The rebel leaders, mainly disgruntled army officers, say they're
fighting for democracy and discipline in the armed forces.
	   In Goma Sunday, the rebel political leadership announced members
of a new movement _ the Congolese Democratic Coalition _ which is
preparing to take power from Kabila.
	   The chairman, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, an exiled professor and
longtime Mobutu opponent, said the movement will establish a
democratic republic based on rule of law and invited the country's
political groups to join in.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Firefighters rescued 40 people who
became trapped in a mountain cable car 30 meters (100 feet) above
ground Sunday, news reports said.
	   The cable car got stuck shortly before arriving at its
destination, Estany Gento, in northeastern Spain, with 38
passengers and two workers aboard, the private news agency Europa
Press said.
	   In a four-hour operation, firefighters in a helicopter helped 31
of the people aboard use rappel climbing ropes to get down.
	   The remaining nine _ four elderly persons, four children and one
man who had recently left hospital_ were lowered down by a cable
connected to the helicopter.
	   No one was injured in the incident.

Congolese rebels announce new leadership

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurant Kabila on Sunday announced members of a transitional team
which is preparing to take power from the country's embattled
leader.
	   The Congolese Democratic Coalition is led by Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, a professor and a longtime opponent to former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, and includes Kabila's former foreign minister,
Bizima Karaha.
	   ``We want to gather all political parties fighting against
Kabila's dictatorship,'' Wamba said. ``We will welcome any
political parties, as long as we avoid a new dictatorship.''
	   The coalition called on all Congolese to join in the fight
against Kabila, and on the international community to aid the
uprising by denying their support for the government.
	   In a lengthy political declaration, Wamba said the movement will
establish a democratic republic and unity among all Congolese, and
eradicate corruption, nepotism, arbitrary arrests and political
assassinations which it claims have been perpetrated by Kabila.
	   Wamba said the government will be formed once Kinshasa is in
rebel hands, and although he promised elections, he said it was too
soon to speculate on a date.
	   ``We're still in a war,'' Wamba said.
	   Other members are academics and former Kabila allies from the
provinces of Kivu, Katanga, Kasai and other parts of the vast
African nation.
	   Kabila is a Muluba from Katanga, and currently is in the
regional capital, Lubumbashi, according to Karaha. But he denied
that Kabila will take Katanga or lead the copper-rich province to
secession, saying it too will be in rebel hands soon.
	   ``We will be in Kinshasa in a week,'' said Jean-Pierre Ondekane,
the chief rebel commander.
	   Since the revolt began Aug. 2, the rebels _ ethnic Tutsis,
members of Kabila's opposition and disgruntled soldiers _ have
taken over eastern Congo and flew thousands of troops to the far
west, closing in on Kinshasa.
	   Ondekane said the rebels were targeting Songololo, about 250
kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, after capturing the
Congo River port of Matadi and the Inga power plant.
	   He also reported fighting outside Kisangani, the third largest
city in north-central Congo, but gave no details.
	   ``Population is behind our operations,'' he said. ``This is not
a Tutsi movement, this is a nationwide revolution.''

Two holes to drive a golfer crazy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Sahalee Country Club's closing two
holes, particularly the round-wrecking 18th, provide the perfect
test for a PGA champion.
	   At the Masters, it's said the tournament doesn't begin until the
back nine on Sunday.
	   At Sahalee, which is Chinook Indian for ``heavenly high
ground,'' the test comes at the last two holes.
	   The 17th, a par-3 at 215 yards (197 meters), demands a good
swing and good thinking. There's a lake that borders the right side
of the green and during the week it has been filled with golf
balls. A large bunker parallels the green on the left to catch
those who bail out on their swing trying to avoid the water.
	   Any pin on the right brings into play the lake and a shaved
slope reminiscent of No. 12 at Augusta National Golf Club, where
any short shot could carry the water and roll back into it.
	   Greg Kraft and Steve Elkington had the only birdies there on
Saturday among the leaders as par became a treasured score.
	   Although this is the first major championship at Sahalee, its
18th hole already has become a legend.
	   It's an uphill 475-yard (434 meter) par-4 that the members play
as a par-5. The hole is long and tight, with towering 100-foot
Douglas fir trees catching any mishit ball. A drive turning too
much to the left can be blocked from the green by a large fir and
big cedar.
	   A drive to the right winds up with a sidehill lie. The player
faces a second shot into a 120-foot (37-meter), two-tiered green
surrounded by three bunkers.
	   Steve Stricker made a miracle par out of the trees in the third
round. Steve Elkington, Skip Kendall, Frank Lickliter, John Cook,
Scott Gump and Russ Cochran all bogeyed. Brad Faxon and Colin
Montgomerie had a 6.
	   Going into Sunday, the average score on the hole was 4.520,
about a half-stroke over par. It was the hardest hole on the
course.
	   Third-round leaders Vijay Singh and Stricker parred No. 18 every
day, as did Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara. Then there was Kendall,
who had three consecutive bogeys.
	   ``The last couple holes test you,'' said Elkington, a former PGA
champion. ``Eighteen is a bear.''
	   John Huston agreed.
	   ``It's hard to get down there where you don't have a long iron
into the green,'' he said. ``It will be tough for the guys to
finish the last two holes very strong.''

England beat Sri Lanka by 36 runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England continued its roll of cricket success with
a 36-run win over Sri Lanka in the triangular limited-overs match
at Lord's on Sunday.
	   Fresh from a 2-1 test series win over South Africa, the English
team finally managed to avenge its embarrassing hammering by Sri
Lanka in the 1996 World Cup quarterfinal.
	   England shot out the reigning World Cup champions for 211 in
49.3 overs after setting a target of 247.
	   It was England's first win over Sri Lanka following three
successive defeats on the sub-continent.
	   The victory put England on par with Sri Lanka in the triangular
series with one win each.
	   England will play South Africa at Edgbaston on Tuesday in the
final round-robin match before Thursday's final.
	   An England win Tuesday will book the home side a berth in the
final with Sri Lanka, but a South African win could complicate
matters because places in the final would have to be decided on net
run-rates.
	   Sri Lanka beat South Africa by 57 runs in the tournament opener
at Trent Bridge on Friday.
	   However, England's medium pace quartet was too hot for Sri Lanka
on Sunday in front of a 25,000-strong crowd. The visitors' top
order was packed away at 83 for five in the 20th over.
	   It was a remarkable turn around in fortunes for England after it
lost its last seven wickets for 24 runs earlier in the day.
	   The England total was built around a forceful 97-ball 86 by
man-of-the-match Graeme Hick and 51 by skipper Alec Stewart.
	   However, the home side crashed when Nasser Hussain, 39 in 61
balls, was bowled by Kumara Dharmasena and Hick was run out in the
next over. England had been 200 for three after 40 overs.
	   Hick, who had a miserable run with the bat on his test recall
against South Africa, hit his first one-day half century in 12
innings, and it could not have come at a better time.
	   His innings included five boundaries, one of them disappearing
into the second tier of the new grandstand over square leg off
Dharmasena.
	   Opener Sanath Jayasuriya, who managed just 11 in the Sri Lanka
innings, was the main destroyer of the England batting, taking 3-36
in 10 overs of left arm spin.
	   Stewart, dominated the 76-run stand with Hick, hammering eight
fours off 67 balls, before becoming Jayasuriya's first victim.
	   It was a good comeback by the Sri Lankans, who had dropped five
catches, including Hick twice, in addition to numerous fumbles and
overthrows.
	   The dangerous Sri Lankan openers _ Jayasuriya and Romesh
Kaluwitharana _ were separated in the second over when the latter
edged a catch to Stewart off Peter Martin.
	   Darren Gough, one of England's heroes in test series win over
South Africa, struck in successive overs to remove Jayasuriya and
Marvan Atapattu.
	   When left hander Russel Arnold was dismissed for three, Sri
Lanka was precariously placed on 49 for four.
	   Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga, with 483 one-day matches
between them, joined for a 34-run stand before De Silva was
contentiously given out leg before wicket by umpire Mervin Kitchen.
	   At 83 for five, skipper Ranatunga had the enormous task of
seeing his side through with the last two recognized batsmen _
Chandika Hathurusingha and Dharmasena.
	   Ranatunga, survived an outstanding five-over spell by left arm
seamer Alan Mullally to score 33 and when he chopped on to off
spinner Robert Croft, England had taken a stranglehold of the
match.
	   Gough finished with 3-51, while Mullally and debutant Ian Austin
took two wickets apiece costing 20 and 37 runs respectively.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 400 artillery shells dating from World War
II were discovered Sunday on the outskirts of the Volga River town
of Saratov, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The civil defense and emergencies committee of the city, about
700 kilometers (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, said the shells
probably originated with a munitions testing ground that operated
in Saratov at the time.
	   Five sappers were working to check the area for more shells,
ITAR-Tass said. The shells are to be removed from the site and
destroyed.

Leon Van Bon sprints to triumph in World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Corrects spelling of Van Bon thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Holland's Leon van Bon held off World
Cup leader Michele Bartoli in a furious sprint over the final
meters Sunday to capture the HEW Classic cycling race in Hamburg.
	   Van Bon started the sprint, jumping to the front of a pack of 13
riders with 500 meters (500 yards) left to edge Bartoli in a time
of six hours, nine minutes and 28 seconds at the World Cup race.
	   Belgium's Ludo Dierckyens was third on the flat 253 (152 mile)
kilometer course that wound through Hamburg and favored sprinters
like Van Bon, winner of the Tour de France's ninth stage.
	   The top 11 riders finished with identical times.
	   ``There's a lot of fast people and you don't know what's going
to happen at the end of a long race, but I felt strong,'' said Van
Bon. ``I put this win on the same level as the stage win at the
Tour.''
	   The World Cup race was just the second major event since the
Tour of France finished with a doping scandal that led to several
teams and riders being expelled from cycling's premier event.
	   The second place of Bartoli, recovering from bronchitis, gave
the Italian rider a huge lead in the overall standings after the
seventh of 10 World Cup races.
	   The Team Asics rider has 276 points, while Van Bon is second at
181.
	   After a slow start for the first hour, a group of 24 riders
separated from the pack and was whittled to 13 with 42 kilometers
(26 miles) left after one of the course's few steep climbs.
	   During the final four kilometers, riders constantly threatened
breakaways but were caught by the lead group that included Van Bon,
Bartoli and Telekom's Jan Ullrich, second at the Tour de France.
	   Ullrich, last year's winner of the event, finished ninth as he
failed to keep pace with Van Bon's final spurt.
	   The doping scandals that plague the sport continue with four
Italian cyclists from Team Mobilvetta Northwave all failing blood
tests Tuesday at the Tour de Portugal.

Azeri official: 105 arrested in Azerbaijan protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijan's top police official on Sunday refuted
reports that 300 opposition protesters had been detained in the
capital Baku over the weekend, saying the true number of detainees
was 106, a news agency reported.
	   Interior Minister Ramil Usubov said that of the 106 detained on
Saturday, five were put in custody for 10 days, six were fined and
the rest were released after a warning, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. The ministry said that 5,000 people had taken part in the
opposition rally _ as opposed to the 50,000 some witnesses had
estimated.
	   Usubov said that the police had detained people for resisting
police, not for attending the rally, which two opposition parties
had organized to protest preparations for presidential elections
scheduled for Oct. 11.
	   The opposition has said it will boycott the vote, alleging that
it will likely be unfair. President Geidar Aliev, the Soviet-era
Communist Party boss who returned to power in 1993 in a bloodless
coup, is seeking re-election.
	   The protesters called for democratic elections and urged Aliev
and the country's other leaders to resign over their handling of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region located inside Azerbaijan but
populated by ethnic Armenians.

King Hussein gives Prince Hassan more constitutional authority
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein, who is undergoing cancer
treatment in the United States, has given his brother and heir to
the throne the power to shuffle the government, officials said
Sunday.
	   The move comes at a time when the government is expected to be
reshuffled following harsh public criticism over polluted drinking
water and economic recession.
	   Hussein, 63, issued the decree _ the first of its kind _ from
his hospital bed in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., a
government official said, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Crown Prince Hassan, 51, is acting as regent in the absence of
the king.
	   Fayez Tarawneh, a senior aide to the king, said Hussein's decree
was prompted by the recent resignation of Jordan's water minister
following the water scandal.
	   ``The prime minister had to send the resignation to His Majesty
to sign at the Jordanian Embassy in Washington'' instead of Hassan
handling it in Jordan, Tarawneh said in a statement carried by
Jordan Television.
	   Another government official, who also requested anonymity, said
the decree ``should not be seen seen in the context of His Majesty
surrendering power, but to allow the prince to have the adequate
authority to run the affairs of the state in His Majesty's
absence.''
	   He added: ``We should not read a lot into it.''
	   A third official, who also asked not to be named, said Hussein
had initially barred Hassan from shuffling the government in a
decree he issued in late July when he left for treatment in the
United States.
	   He deleted that reference in the new decree.
	   The official said the king's latest decree maintained other
restrictions which include banning the prince from declaring war on
a foreign country, signing peace treaties or changing the
Constitution.
	   Neither decrees were made public.
	   The 24-member Cabinet of Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali,
which was formed in March 1997, has been accused of negligence in
supervising the purification of drinking water in parts of the
capital, Amman.
	   Water experts have asserted that water contained worms and
larvae which could be hazardous to health. Jordanians have
complained that water flowing from taps had an odor. The government
has denied it.
	   Majali's Cabinet has also been widely accused of exaggerating
official growth rates in Jordan to cover up for worsening economic
performance.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police declared Kosovo ``free for
movement in all directions'' Sunday after gaining control of the
main stronghold of ethnic Albanians fighting for independence.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was the
organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of Kosovo
from Serbia.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, told reporters visiting
Junik Sunday that Serb police gained control of the village late
Saturday, after they had encircled it for about 20 days, appealing
for the KLA to surrender. Filic said there were no civilian
casualties because they left Junik before the fighting began.
	   Reporters visiting Junik on Sunday found the village deserted
except for about 15 people who were too old to flee. Some houses
were still smoldering, but most of the village was intact.
	   Filic said that by wiping out the rebel stronghold, ``the
territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all directions.
All road communications have been deblocked and all terrorist bases
destroyed.''
	   The fall of Junik appears to be the finale of the Serb offensive
to quash the KLA. Over the past weeks government forces have purged
the KLA from several other strongholds. But since fighting began
five months ago, gains by government forces have proven difficult
to maintain.
	   Ethnic Albanian analysts in Kosovo said the KLA is regrouping
and reorganizing after its recent string of defeats. Ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
Serbia is itself the dominant province in Yugoslavia.
	   The government in Belgrade has invited moderate ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team to start talks as early as
next week.
	   But Rugova has said that the government offensive must stop
before he will return to the negotiating table. In any event,
Rugova has no support from the KLA.
	   According to a police statement carried by the state-run Tanjug
news agency Sunday, members of the KLA tried to escape from Junik
across the border to Albania but were blocked by border guards and
fled into mountain forests. Four policemen and two Yugoslav
soldiers died in the operation, it said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties on the ethnic
Albanian side.
	   The pro-ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said fighting
continued Sunday in Logja and that heavy artillery had destroyed
part of the village.
	   Government forces reportedly used army tanks and helicopters to
attack Logja Saturday, along with eight other villages in the area
some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Reporters in the area saw smoke rising from the direction of
Logja, but they were prevented from reaching it and there was no
word on casualties.
	   The U.N. refugee agency was trying to reach the Logja area
Sunday, where there were believed to be a number of displaced
people, spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   ``It's all a very alarming picture,'' he said of the weekend's
fighting. ``But no one really has access to the area,'' so it's
hard to tell what the situation is.
	   Janowski said he were concerned about reports of an attack on
woods around Decane, where around 20,000 displaced people were
reportedly camped.

US diplomats evacuate Albania as international force arrives

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ U.S. soldiers arriving to participate in
a multi-national military exercises designed to promote calm in the
region crossed paths Sunday with diplomats evacuating this Balkan
nation for non-related security reasons.
	   Hundreds of soldiers from the United States, Germany, France,
Italy, Canada, Albania and other countries were arriving at Tirana
International Airport to prepare for five days of military
maneuvers that start Monday.
	   The 1,700-member, 26-nation force will conduct training for
parachute supply drops, vehicle and foot patrols, sharpshooting,
mine awareness and other non-offensive drills in the Albanian
mountains.
	   The exercises are also viewed as a veiled message to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his forces' offensive against
separatist rebels in the province of Kosovo on Albanian's northern
border.
	   Hundreds have died in fighting in Kosovo since police cracked
down in February on the separatist ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, accused by the Yugoslav government of harboring
arms depots across the border in Albania.
	   In Tirana, the majority of the U.S. diplomatic corps packed up
headed for the airport, following orders from Washington to
evacuate the country, for security reasons, following the attack on
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people.
	   The U.S. government has also warned Americans against traveling
to Albania and offered to assist any of the 890 citizens registered
with the embassy assistance in leaving the country.
	   Heightening fears of the safety of U.S. citizens in Albania are
recent reports that Albanian and U.S. authorities cooperated in
arresting at least five Egyptians in Albania suspected of
international terrorist links.
	   Albanian Premier Fatos Nano tried distanced his predominately
Muslim nation from an international Islamic organization, stressing
the need for solid relations with western Europe.
	   He said Albania was not officially a part of the international
Organization of Islamic Conference, despite earlier attempt by
former President Sali Berisha to include Albania in the
middle-Eastern-based group.
	   ``The Organization of Islamic Conference is an organization that
never really included Albania, because the (membership) procedure
started by Berisha was illegitimate'' said Nano in an interview
with Socialist newspaper Zeri i Popullit.
	   ``Albania has no other future, except the efforts to be
integrated in Europe. This apart, we will still push for good
relations with the Arab and Islamic countries.''

Georgian defense minister cancels visit to Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The defense minister of the former Soviet republic
of Georgia on Sunday postponed his planned trip to Moscow, Georgian
state radio reported.
	   The radio said that Maj.-Gen. David Tevzadze had called off his
trip at the last minute because of ``the lack of coordination and
settlement of issues that were to be discussed during the visit,''
Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The two countries have recently traded accusations of fueling
conflict in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, where Russian
peacekeepers have been stationed since 1994. Large-scale
hostilities have ceased since the civil war, but sporadic clashes
between Abkhazian separatists and militia loyal to the Georgian
government have continued in spite of the troops' presence.

Colombia's environment minister: Drug crop eradication program a
</HEADLINE>
failure &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The aerial crop-spraying program favored
by the United States to reduce Colombian cocaine and heroin
production has failed, the new environmental minister said in an
interview published Sunday.
	   ``The cultivated areas have increased, which demonstrates that
fumigation hasn't worked,'' Juan Mayr, who won the prestigious
Goldman Prize for environmental conservation, was quoted as saying
in the newspaper El Tiempo.
	   Mayr, whom the paper dubbed Colombia's first conservationist
environment minister, said he would seek alternatives to spraying
coca and opium crops with herbicides, which environmentalist say
endanger humans and animals and threaten the Amazon rain forest.
	   ``We can't permanently fumigate the country,'' he added.
	   Mayr did not say whether he would oppose the use of tebuthiuron,
a herbicide strongly favored by U.S. officials that has yet to be
tested by Colombian authorities for health and environmental
effects.
	   Currently, the herbicide glyphosate is used. U.S. officials
favor tebuthiuron because it is granular, can be dropped from
higher altitudes and dissolves less readily.
	   Last year, a record 41,000 hectares (160 square miles) of coca
were sprayed but coca cultivation nevertheless increased 18
percent, to 79,500 hectares (307 square miles), by U.S. account.
	   TurboThrush prop planes, their pilots contracted for by
Washington and including Americans, carry out the spraying in areas
dominated by leftist rebels, who periodically fire on the aircraft
and the U.S.-donated helicopter gunships that escort them.
	   The rebels levy taxes on drug crop cultivation and production.
	   President Andres Pastrana, who took office Aug. 7, has said he
prefers a different approach to eradication.
	   He is seeking international funding for programs to encourage
poor coca and opium farmers to switch to legal, but less lucrative
crops.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a letter to Pastrana last
week that he would support those efforts. But American officials
insist that eradication remains the central element of U.S.
anti-narcotics policy in Colombia _ the producer of 80 percent of
the cocaine sold in the United States and a growing share of the
heroin.

Pakistan returns bombing suspect to Nairobi

Newsweek on apparent bombing vehicle's drive shaft found &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Pakistan has returned a suspect in the
U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to Nairobi, where a
growing team of FBI investigators pressed ahead Sunday in their
painstaking search for evidence.
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said
Sunday that Mohammad Sadik Howaida was handed over to Kenyan
authorities last week, bypassing U.S. investigators in Pakistan.
	   A ministry spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival from
Nairobi at the Karachi airport on Aug. 7, the day twin bombings at
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
257 people and wounded at least 5,500 more.
	   A government source in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Howaida was returned to Nairobi on Friday,
bypassing U.S. investigators who had flown to Pakistan to question
him.
	   Kenya's private KTN television reported that Howaida arrived in
Nairobi only on Sunday. The discrepancy could not immediately be
explained.
	   U.S. officials in Nairobi refused to discuss Howaida.
	   ``This is a matter in which we are working very closely and very
hard with our Kenyan colleagues. I can't make any comment,'' said
the assistant FBI special agent in charge of the Nairobi
investigation, Hardrick Crawford. ``This is an ongoing
investigation.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also refused comment.
	   As the probe in Nairobi intensifies, more FBI agents arrived
over the weekend in the Kenyan capital, where they are expected to
stay for four to five months.
	   The government source in Pakistan said the suspect told his
interrogators that a few other conspirators, who left Nairobi
earlier, had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan. He
had planned to do the same, he said.
	   The source told The Associated Press that investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and exiled Saudi multimillionaire
Osama bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for
the last two years.
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said
immigration officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged, and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   ``On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts,
he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law,'' Altaf said,
adding that Howaida was sent to Nairobi aboard a special plane.
	   A ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab national''
without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually means
someone from the Middle East.
	   A day earlier, U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents
were headed to Pakistan to question the man.
	   But Altaf said no foreigners were allowed to interrogate
Howaida. The government source said Pakistani officials refused
U.S. officials who came to Karachi access to the suspect, and they
had to follow him to Kenya on another plane.
	   It wasn't clear why Howaida was not directly handed over to the
Americans. But it could be fallout from the case involving Mir
Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani convicted in the United States of killing
two CIA employees.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.
	   At the site of the bombing, meanwhile, U.S. investigators in
helmets and gloves were going through the battered embassy building
piece by piece Sunday, occasionally pulling out magnifying glasses
to inspect something before tossing it out the window onto a heap
below.
	   Newsweek magazine reported that investigators have found a
220-kilogram (100-pound) steel drive shaft believed to have
belonged to the pickup truck that carried the bomb to the embassy
in Nairobi. The shaft, found a kilometer (more than a half-mile)
from the site, contains part of the vehicle identification number,
the magazine said, quoting unidentified sources.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of Albanian causalities in Logja region
in graf 12.

<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police declared Kosovo ``free for
movement in all directions,'' Sunday, after gaining control of the
main stronghold of ethnic Albanians fighting for independence.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was known as
the organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of
Kosovo.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, told reporters visiting
Junik Sunday, Serb police gained control of the village late
Saturday, after they had encircled it for about 20 days, appealing
for the KLA to surrender. Filic said there were no civilian
casualties, because they left Junik before the fighting began.
	   Reporters visiting Junik Sunday, found the village deserted
except for about 15 elderly people who were too old to flee. Some
houses were still smoldering, but most of the village remained
intact.
	   Filic told the visiting reporters that by wiping out the rebel
stronghold ``the territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in
all directions. All road communications have been deblocked and all
terrorist bases destroyed.''
	   According to a police statement carried by state-run Tanjug news
agency, members of the KLA tried to escape across the border to
Albania but were blocked by army border guards and eventually
``broken down'' and dispersed into mountain forests. Four policemen
and two Yugoslav army soldiers died in the operation, it said.
	   There were no immediate reports of causalities on the Albanian
side.
	   The KLA is fighting Serb security forces for the independence of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the
province's 2 million people.
	   Over the past weeks government forces purged the KLA from
several other strongholds. It remained unclear, however, what the
Albanians would do next. Since fighting began five months ago,
gains by government forces have proven difficult to maintain.
	   Albanian analysts in Kosovo, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that following the recent series of defeats the KLA
is regrouping and reorganizing.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center claimed fighting
continued Sunday in the village Logja and that heavy artillery had
destroyed part of the village. Government forces reportedly used
army tanks and helicopters to attack Logja Saturday, along with
eight other villages in the area some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   The center also reported three ethnic Albanains were killed and
14 wounded during the weekend in the fighting for Lodja, Grabovac
and several others villages east of the Decane-Pec road.

Methane blast kills at least 17 in Ukrainian mine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of 24 bodies recovered. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A methane blast deep inside a coal mine in
eastern Ukraine killed at least 17 miners on Sunday and injured
four others, a government official said.
	   The blast struck 600 meters (2,000 feet) underground at 12:40
a.m. Sunday (2240 GMT Saturday) in a mine in Luhansk, a city 700
kilometers (450 miles) east of Kiev, according to a duty officer
for Ukraine's Ministry of the Mining Industry who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said 123 miners were underground at the time of the blast,
with 27 working in the section where the explosion occurred. By
mid-afternoon, the bodies of 17 victims had been found. Four other
miners were hospitalized in a burn unit, and six were missing, the
official said.
	   Investigators were working to determine the cause of the blast,
he said.
	   Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency and NTV television station
reported Sunday night that 24 bodies had been pulled out of the
mine, but the ministry could not confirm the reports.
	   More than 200 miners have already died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines. The worst single accident occurred in
April, when a methane blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the
eastern region of Donetsk.
	   Ukraine's government blames the accidents on neglect of safety
rules and outdated equipment.

 &UR; Terrible personal toll from Northern Ireland's worst attack &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland, BC-ANALYSIS-Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A grandmother, her pregnant
daughter and her 18-month-old granddaughter.
	   A mother of four buying a school uniform for her youngest girl.
	   Three young southern Irish boys traveling with a 12-year-old
Spanish student as part of an exchange program and the 24-year-old
teacher leading them.
	   All lay in Omagh's British army barracks Sunday alongide the
rest of the 28 civilians slain _ in some cases mutilated or burned
beyond recognition _ by the Omagh car bomb.
	   On the west side of downtown, where Saturday's caller falsely
claimed the bomb had been planted, local Catholic, Anglican,
Presbyterian and Methodist churches filled with stunned
worshippers.
	   Some bore bandages themselves from shrapnel wounds. All prayed
for their dead and maimed neighbors.
	   At Sacred Heart Catholic church, some parishioners cradled their
heads in their hands after the Rev. Michael Keveney told them that
one member in her 20s, Geraldine Breslin, had died overnight in a
Belfast hospital.
	   Amateur video footage of the blast's aftermath captured
survivors gasping in the smoky haze, spattered with blood. Some
stood in dazed silence, others frantically searched for relatives
momentarily lost _ or forever blown away.
	   ``It was the nearest thing to a horror movie I've ever
witnessed,'' said barber Damien Turbitt, who escaped injury but had
his Market Street shop wrecked.
	   Avril Monaghan, 30, her daughter Maura and mother Mary Grimes,
65, all of whom lived in outlying towns, were visiting Omagh to
shop when the bomb exploded. Mrs. Monaghan was pregnant with twins;
Mrs. Grimes was a mother of 12.
	   Kevin Skelton recalled how his wife, Philomena, and three
daughters also were shopping _ for a school uniform for their
youngest, 13-year-old Shauna _ while he browsed in a neighboring
store. After the explosion, he ran outside.
	   ``My wife was lying on top of the rubble. She was face down and
the clothes had been blown off her,'' said Skelton, 43, who felt
her wrist to confirm that his wife of 20 years was dead.
	   His two eldest daughters escaped uninjured, he said, but Shauna
suffered a broken jaw.
	   Omagh resident Tommy Logue had to wait until Sunday morning to
learn his daughter Brenda had been killed.
	   ``I knew all along that she was dead,'' he said, his voice
breaking. ``The front of the shop where I knew her to be was
completely blown out _ nobody could survive that.''
	   Beyond the dead were tales of life-shattering injuries. Omagh
resident Lindsay Hall, a Protestant, wiped tears from his face as
he looked at pictures of his son Alastair, a rugby enthusiast who
had a leg blown off Saturday.
	   ``Alastair loved playing, but he will never be able to again
now,'' Hall said. ``He's only 12. I'm 57. Why couldn't it have
happened to me?''

Leon Van Bon sprints to triumph in World Cup race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Clarifies meaning of blood tests in last graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Holland's Leon van Bon held off World
Cup leader Michele Bartoli in a furious sprint over the final
meters Sunday to capture the HEW Classic cycling race in Hamburg.
	   Van Bon started the sprint, jumping to the front of a pack of 13
riders with 500 meters (500 yards) left to edge Bartoli in a time
of six hours, nine minutes and 28 seconds at the World Cup race.
	   Belgium's Ludo Dierckyens was third on the flat 253 (152 mile)
kilometer course that wound through Hamburg and favored sprinters
like Van Bon, winner of the Tour de France's ninth stage.
	   The top 11 riders finished with identical times.
	   ``There's a lot of fast people and you don't know what's going
to happen at the end of a long race, but I felt strong,'' said Van
Bon. ``I put this win on the same level as the stage win at the
Tour.''
	   The World Cup race was just the second major event since the
Tour of France finished with a doping scandal that led to several
teams and riders being expelled from cycling's premier event.
	   The second place of Bartoli, recovering from bronchitis, gave
the Italian rider a huge lead in the overall standings after the
seventh of 10 World Cup races.
	   The Team Asics rider has 276 points, while Van Bon is second at
181.
	   After a slow start for the first hour, a group of 24 riders
separated from the pack and was whittled to 13 with 42 kilometers
(26 miles) left after one of the course's few steep climbs.
	   During the final four kilometers, riders constantly threatened
breakaways but were caught by the lead group that included Van Bon,
Bartoli and Telekom's Jan Ullrich, second at the Tour de France.
	   Ullrich, last year's winner of the event, finished ninth as he
failed to keep pace with Van Bon's final spurt.
	   The doping scandals that plague the sport continue with four
Italian cyclists from Team Mobilvetta Northwave all failing blood
tests Tuesday at the Tour de Portugal.
	   The tests may indicate the use of EPO, a synthetic hormone that
stimulates the production of red blood cells and is suspected to be
widely used by cyclists to improve performance.

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Steve Stricker and Vijay Singh can
interpret recent history of the PGA Championship any way they
choose.
	   It's true that nine of the past 10 champions have won their
first major at the PGA, a good sign for the co-leaders as they
began the final round at Sahalee Country Club with a four-stroke
lead.
	   But each raindrop that softened Sahalee on Sunday also brought
this harrowing thought: Only four of the last 12 PGA champions have
started the final round in the lead.
	   ``They've got to be careful not to try to turn it into a match
play,'' Ernie Els said before he teed off Sunday in a light
drizzle.
	   Els knows from experience. Three years ago at Riviera, he was 16
under after three rounds and took a three-stroke lead into the
final round before playing tentatively on the front nine.
	   Steve Elkington blew past him and won, beating Colin Montgomerie
in a playoff after shooting a 64, the lowest final round ever by a
PGA champion.
	   Mike Reid had a three-stroke lead in 1989 until the pressure of
trying to win his first major caught up with him. Payne Stewart
closed with a 67 to win his first major championship.
	   ``Realistically, there could be 10 guys that have a chance on
the back nine _ if something happens on the front,'' said
Elkington, who started Sunday within four shots of the lead.
	   Singh and Stricker were aware of that shortly after they
finished Saturday at 7-under 203, four strokes clear of some worthy
challengers.
	   Elkington, defending champion Davis Love III and Billy Mayfair
were at 207. Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara and
Tiger Woods were among those at 208.
	   All but Mayfair have won majors, although Mayfair is coming off
his second PGA Tour victory of the year at last week's Buick Open.
All were capable of making up ground on a course where early rain
allowed pins to be attacked.
	   ``I haven't been in this situation before,'' Stricker said.
``I'm just going to have to try to worry about my own game starting
off and get myself going in a nice, positive direction. There's
going to be people that make moves early on.''
	   Love, trying to become the first back-to-back PGA champion since
Denny Shute in 1937, was tied with Justin Leonard going into the
final round at Winged Foot last year but finished with a 66 for a
five-stroke victory.
	   The only other players who protected the lead at the PGA since
1986 were Nick Price at Southern Hills in 1994; John Daly, who
overpowered wide-open Crooked Stick in 1991; and Wayne Grady, who
took a two-stroke lead into last round at Shoal Creek and won by
three strokes when Fred Couples self-destructed down the stretch.
	   ``Obviously, there will be a little bit more pressure on myself
and Steve,'' Singh said. ``We've got to wait and see what happens
on the front side and how the rest of the players are doing to even
think about a match-play situation. At that stage, we've got to be
playing our best to keep our position.''
	   Working in their favor is that Singh and Stricker have played
solidly for three rounds _ accurate off the tee and confident on
the greens.
	   Singh got a taste of this drama in the 1993 PGA at Inverness,
where he started the last round two strokes off the lead but
finished fourth.
	   ``I have a good chance of doing what I've always dreamed of
doing _ winning a major,'' Singh said.
	   Stricker played in the final group at the Buick Open last week,
shooting a 72 to tie for sixth. He has five top 10s in his last
seven tournaments, and is clearly back to his form of two years ago
when he won twice and finished fourth on the money list.
	   And while he had never been in contention at a major, he was
paired with Lee Janzen in the final round at the past U.S. Open
when Janzen made up seven strokes on the last day to win.
	   ``I just took all that in,'' Stricker said. ``I was able to
watch what he did and how he handled himself down the stretch. If I
can imitate what he did, I'll be in good shape.''
	   Should either keep it together, it would be the first time this
year a major was won by someone from the front.

Iran considering all options to secure release of diplomats in
</HEADLINE>
Afghanistan &QL; 
Taliban &HT;    TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran is keeping its options open to secure
the release of its nationals allegedly captured in Afghanistan, a
senior parliament official said Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   The deputy ground forces commander of Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, meanwhile, said this year's military
maneuvers will be held along Iran's borders with Afghanistan.
	   Iran claims that 44 Iranians, including 11 diplomats, were
captured by the Muslim Taliban militia in northern Afghanistan
eight days ago.
	   ``Considering the problems created by Taliban and the issue of
the hostages, the IRGC is ready to counterattack upon the orders of
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,'' said Mohammad Jafar Asadi,
the Revolutionary Guard's deputy commander of ground forces. He was
quoted by the evening Kayhan newspaper.
	   He said the maneuvers will be held along the 830-kilometer (514
mile) border with Afghanistan. He did not say when the they will be
held.
	   Hassan Rowhani, Iran's deputy parliament speaker, blamed the
United States and Pakistan for the disappearance of the Iranians in
Afghanistan.
	   ``The Afghan nation is beset by conspiracies plotted outside its
borders,'' Tehran radio quoted Rowhani as telling the Parliament.
	   ``America's involvement in the Afghan crisis today is quite
clear. That is why America has kept totally silent in the face of
so many atrocities committed by the Taliban. This demonstrates that
in the Afghan crisis, the Americans are seeking their own
objectives,'' Rowhani said.
	   ``Considering the Vienna Convention and the U.N. Charter as well
as the fact that presently no government rules over Afghanistan,
Iran considers as lawful any action for restoration of its rights
and also those of its citizens,'' Rowhani added.
	   However, a conservative daily called for peaceful solution to
the crisis.
	   ``Those who prescribe a military option don't say what will be
the consequences of such a decision and how Iran should deal with
it,'' an editorial in the English-language Kayhan International
said.
	   Military action will also sabotage President Khatami's plans to
forge better relations with Iran's neighbors. ``Iran's enemies are
waiting for an Iranian mistake in order to settle accounts with the
Islamic Republic,'' the paper said.
	   The Taliban have denied they are holding any Iranian diplomats.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
who accuse Iran of aiding an opposition coalition in northern
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government and the
country's rebels remained deadlocked Sunday over who should mediate
peace talks to resolve their 10-week-old conflict, news reports
said.
	   The government favors a greater role for the West African
regional organization, ECOWAS, but the rebel military faction was
warmer to mediation by Portuguese-speaking countries, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   `I want to make it very clear that we are part of a sub-region
and the instability in Guinea-Bissau could have negative
repercussions on other countries in the area,'' said Guinea-Bissau
President Joao Bernardo Vieira, explaining why he wanted
neighboring countries as mediators.
	   Mediation efforts were dominated by the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, CPLP, until the Economic Community
of West African States, ECOWAS, began pushing for a greater role
last week.
	   ``We want ECOWAS to intervene,'' Lusa quoted Vieira's chief
negotiator Joao Cardoso as saying.
	   ECOWAS pressure prompted the CPLP to postpone a third round of
talks in Cape Verde aimed at shoring up a ceasefire agreement it
had mediated on July 26.
	   The CPLP is still inviting the government and rebels to the
meeting, scheduled for Aug. 18 and 19, but the encounter has been
downgraded to an evaluation of the negotiation process.
	   On Sunday, the rebels said they would definitely be going to
Cape Verde. Cardoso said the government had yet to decide whether
it would attend, Lusa reported.
	   The prospect of ECOWAS taking over the mediation has worried the
rebels largely because member-states Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea have been providing Vieira with military help since the
start of the conflict.
	   Fighting erupted in the tiny former Portuguese colony when Brig.
Ansumane Mane led a rebellion on June 7 accusing Vieira of rampant
corruption. Mane had just been dismissed as military chief for
allegedly running arms to Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   The CPLP is made up of Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Angola,
Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe. ECOWAS has 16
members in the region.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police declared Kosovo ``free for
movement in all directions'' Sunday after gaining control of the
main stronghold of ethnic Albanians fighting for independence.
	   The village of Junik, near the border with Albania, was the
organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of Kosovo
from Serbia.
	   Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, told reporters visiting
Junik Sunday that Serb police gained control of the village late
Saturday, after they had encircled it for about 20 days, appealing
for the KLA to surrender. Filic said there were no civilian
casualties because they left Junik before the fighting began.
	   Reporters visiting Junik on Sunday found the village deserted
except for about 15 people who were too old to flee. Some houses
were still smoldering, but most of the village was intact.
	   Filic said that by wiping out the rebel stronghold, ``the
territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all directions.
All road communications have been deblocked and all terrorist bases
destroyed.''
	   The fall of Junik appears to be the finale of the Serb offensive
to quash the KLA. Over the past weeks government forces have purged
the KLA from several other strongholds. But since fighting began
five months ago, gains by government forces have proven difficult
to maintain.
	   Ethnic Albanian analysts in Kosovo said the KLA is regrouping
and reorganizing after its recent string of defeats. Ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
Serbia is itself the dominant province in Yugoslavia.
	   The government in Belgrade has invited moderate ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team to start talks as early as
next week.
	   But Rugova has said that the government offensive must stop
before he will return to the negotiating table. In any event,
Rugova has no support from the KLA.
	   According to a police statement carried by the state-run Tanjug
news agency Sunday, members of the KLA tried to escape from Junik
across the border to Albania but were blocked by border guards and
fled into mountain forests. Four policemen and two Yugoslav
soldiers died in the operation, it said.
	   The pro-ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said fighting
continued Sunday in Lodja and that heavy artillery had destroyed
part of the village.
	   The center said three ethnic Albanians were killed and 14
wounded during the weekend in the fighting for Lodja, Grabovac and
several others villages east of the Decane-Pec road.

Deploring `butchery,' world leaders urge Northern Ireland to keep
</HEADLINE>
faith in peacemaking &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS dateline; CONFORMS slug to style in digest &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II appealed to the people of
bomb-bloodied Northern Ireland to keep their faith in the peace
process _ a message repeated by leaders around the world, who said
that violent retaliation would only serve the cause of the killers.
	   Saturday's bombing in Omagh led newscasts and topped front pages
in newspapers in Europe and around the world. Many _ journalists
and politicians _ made clear their fear that the final victim would
be the province's 5-month-old peace accord.
	   Calling the bombing `tragic and senseless,'' John Paul evoked
the ``blessings of God on the many wounded, on the families of the
dead and on those who continue to have faith in dialogue and in the
accord.''
	   ``I hope for dear Ireland that people of goodwill will not yield
to violence, and that they know to faithfully persevere in the
peaceful cooperation on which the future of their country
depends,'' the pontiff said.
	   The pope, straying from prepared remarks for his weekly Sunday
address, spoke to faithful gathered below the window of his
vacation retreat southeast of Rome. Political leaders from Africa
to the United States echoed his appeal, citing voter approval of
the April peace accord in saying that the majority of Northern
Ireland's people already had made their preference for peace known.
	   ``So much goodwill and faith should not be lost to the mindless
violence of a few,'' South African President Nelson Mandela said in
Pretoria.
	   In Washington, President Clinton called it ``butchery.''
	   ``I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland
against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends
here,'' Clinton said in a statement from the White House.
	   He said the attack was ``intended to wreck Northern Ireland's
hopes for peace and reconciliation.''
	   Spain's Barcelona-based La Vanguardia newspaper compared
Northern Ireland to another bomb-bloodied nation: Israel, where a
series of 1996 bombings played a key role in stalling the region's
peace process.
	   ``Just as in Palestine, the extremist minorities will continue
to feed off each,'' the Spanish newspaper predicted.
	   In Boston, home to a large community of Irish-Americans, the
lead headline in the Boston Herald said simply, ``Carnage.''
	   But Connell Gallagher, publisher of Boston's weekly Irish
Emigrant newspaper, said many Irish and Irish-Americans overseas
have hope the peace will endure beyond the momentary bloodshed.
	   ``It's a reminder of the devastation of the past 28 years,''
Gallagher said. ``It's a reminder of why peace is more important
now than it ever was.''

	   He said the maneuvers will be held along the 830-kilometer (514
mile) border with Afghanistan. He did not say when the they will be
held.
	   Hassan Rowhani, Iran's deputy parliament speaker, blamed the
United States and Pakistan for the disappearance of the Iranians in
Afghanistan.
	   ``The Afghan nation is beset by conspiracies plotted outside its
borders,'' Tehran radio quoted Rowhani as telling the Parliament.
	   ``America's involvement in the Afghan crisis today is quite
clear. That is why America has kept totally silent in the face of
so many atrocities committed by the Taliban. This demonstrates that
in the Afghan crisis, the Americans are seeking their own
objectives,'' Rowhani said.
	   ``Considering the Vienna Convention and the U.N. Charter as well
as the fact that presently no government rules over Afghanistan,
Iran considers as lawful any action for restoration of its rights
and also those of its citizens,'' Rowhani added.
	   However, a conservative daily called for peaceful solution to
the crisis.
	   ``Those who prescribe a military option don't say what will be
the consequences of such a decision and how Iran should deal with
it,'' an editorial in the English-language Kayhan International
said.
	   Military action will also sabotage President Khatami's plans to
forge better relations with Iran's neighbors. ``Iran's enemies are
waiting for an Iranian mistake in order to settle accounts with the
Islamic Republic,'' the paper said.
	   The Taliban have denied they are holding any Iranian diplomats.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
who accuse Iran of aiding an opposition coalition in northern
Afghanistan.

Firefighters rescue 40 people trapped in Spanish cable car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Firefighters rescued 40 people trapped
in a cable car on a Spanish mountain 30 meters (100 feet) above the
ground Sunday, news reports said.
	   The cable car got stuck shortly before arriving at its
destination, Estany Gento, in northeastern Spain, with 38
passengers and two workers aboard, the private news agency Europa
Press said.
	   In a four-hour operation, firefighters in a helicopter helped 31
of the people aboard rappel to the ground with climbing ropes.
	   The remaining nine _ four elderly persons, four children and one
man who had recently left hospital_ were lowered down by a cable
connected to the helicopter.
	   No one was injured.

Russian Orthodox leader calls for church involvement in calendar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Orthodox leader proposed on Sunday that
the leaders of all Christian denominations be included in
discussions of a new calendar, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   During a trip to St. Petersburg, Patriarch Alexy II said that
the United Nations was planning to introduce what he called a
northern mirror-symmetrical permanent calendar.
	   The issue ``is too important for believers to be dealt with by
politicians from the United Nations alone,'' Interfax quoted Alexy
as saying.
	   Noting that the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches have never
reconciled the Julian and Gregorian calendars, Alexy warned that
the new calendar ``can divide people,'' whereas ``unification, not
division'' was needed.
	   In other church news on Sunday, St. Petersburg Governor
Alexander Yakovlev promised Alexy that several Orthodox sanctuaries
in the northern port would be returned to the church by 2000, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The holy places include the Alexander Nevsky monastery and the
Kazan Cathedral, which during the Soviet era was the Museum of
Atheism and Religion.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein, who is undergoing cancer
treatment in the United States, has given his brother and heir to
the throne the power to shuffle the government, officials said
Sunday.
	   The move comes at a time when the government is expected to be
reshuffled following harsh public criticism over polluted drinking
water and economic recession.
	   Hussein, 63, issued the decree _ the first of its kind _ from
his hospital bed in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, a
government official said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Crown Prince Hassan, 51, is regent in the absence of the king.
	   Fayez Tarawneh, a senior aide to the king, said Hussein's decree
was prompted by the recent resignation of Jordan's water minister
following the water scandal.
	   ``The prime minister had to send the resignation to His Majesty
to sign at the Jordanian Embassy in Washington'' instead of Hassan
handling it in Jordan, Tarawneh said in a statement carried by
Jordan Television.

Libya asks Britain to investigate plot to kill Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-8 with Libya asking France to extradite
Shayler. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya asked Britain Sunday to investigate
allegations by a former British intelligence agent that London
plotted the assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   Former British agent David Shayler alleged in a televised TV
interview earlier this month that Britain's Secret Intelligence
Service channeled about dlrs 160,000 to an Islamic group to kill
Gadhafi.
	   ``The government of the United Kingdom is called upon to open an
independent investigation concerning what David Shayler revealed,''
said a Libyan Foreign Ministry statement. It was carried by the
official Libyan news agency, JANA, on Sunday.
	   The British government on Sunday dismissed the allegations.
	   ``There is no British plot to assassinate Gadhafi,'' a British
Foreign Office spokeswoman said in London, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has already described the
allegations ``as fantasy, so it's a non-story,'' the spokeswoman
said.
	   The Libyan Foreign Ministry demanded that London hand over to
Tripoli Libyan ``terrorists'' living in Britain as proof that it
was not involved in the alleged plot.
	   The statement said Shayler's arrest ``confirms the involvement
of the British government in this terrorist act.''
	   Libya ``reserves the right to defend itself and also sue the
British government at the suitable time,'' the statement said.
	   It was Libya's first comment on the alleged plot.
	   Meanwhile, the Libyan Foreign Ministry asked France to extradite
Shayler or allow Libyan judicial authorities to question him in
France, said Libyan radio, monitored by the BBC.
	   It said a Libyan Foreign Ministry official made the request in a
meeting with the French charge d'affaires in Tripoli.
	   Shayler, who worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency from 1994 until 1997, was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1.
London is trying to extradite him to face charges under the
Official Secrets Act. The former agent has threatened to put a
7,000 word dossier on Britain's secret services on an Internet
website.

Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to combat car theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ One week after a national police crime report
estimated that a car is stolen in Israel every 12 seconds, Israel's
Security Cabinet announced plans Sunday to curb theft by beefing-up
security along its West Bank divide.
	   Some 45,000 Israeli-owned cars were stolen in 1997 and police
have said they believe most of the cars end up in Palestinian areas
of the West Bank where they are resold or stripped for parts. Car
thefts are a point of contention between Israeli and palestinian
police who have tried, with little success to cooperate on the
issue.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the police also
want the government to fund the deployment of an additional 2000
troops to be spread out along some 80 kilometers (50 miles), or one
quarter of the Green Line or pre-1967 border line between Israel
and the West Bank, to prevent thieves from skirting checkpoints by
using back roads.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War. Although its major cities have been handed over to
Palestinians control since Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking began in
1993, Israel still controls overall security and patrols roads and
checkpoints between Israel proper and the West Bank.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police searched house-to-house Sunday for an escaped Hamas leader
also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and in Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Palestinian police searched houses and cars and combed orchards
in Jericho, and police vans drove through the city Sunday
afternoon, announcing a curfew over loudspeakers and ordering
merchants to close their shops and residents to return home. Police
patrolled the streets on foot, Kalishnikovs raised.
	   It was the first time the Palestinian Authority imposed a curfew
on its own people, although it was in effect only in the center of
town and was not strictly enforced. Still, locals accustomed to
such curfews during years of Israeli occupation rushed to stock up
at bakeries before going home.
	   Israeli troops joined in the hunt, setting up roadblocks on
Israeli-controlled roads leading out of Jericho and elsewhere in
the West Bank.
	   Israel radio reported later Sunday that Palestinian troops had
arrested 15 Hamas activists in connection with Awadallah's escape.

Steinhauer wins Women's British Open

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Sherri Steinhauer, who shot an
81 in the opening round, surged to victory in the Women's British
Open on Sunday with a closing round of 69.
	   Slowed by a bogey at the first hole, Steinhauer finished one
stroke ahead of American compatriot Brandie Burton and Sophie
Gustafson of Sweden on a windy, links course where no one could
complete four rounds at par.
	   Steinhauer, had a total of 4-over 292 at Royal Lytham St. Annes.
Burton (71) and Gustafson (70) were at 293.
	   Scotland's Janice Moodie, the LPGA rookie who led by a stroke
entering the final round, missed six 6-foot (2-meter) putts during
her 75 and finished fourth at 6-over. She was trying to become the
first Briton to win the championship for seven years.
	   Steinhauer, who captured the 1992 du Maurier Classic, earned
dlrs 100,000 in winning for the third time in her pro career. Her
best previous result this season was a share of fourth at the
Rochester International.
	   Her opening 9-over round seemed a distant memory as she followed
with rounds of 72, 70 and 69 to charge past the leaders.
	   Betsy King, one stroke off the lead at the start of the final
round, had seven bogeys in her 78 and finished at 9-over.
	   Defending champion Karrie Webb of Australia, aiming to win the
title for the third time in four years, was at 73-296.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of four tournaments, including two majors, in
her rookie season, wound up 20-over after a final round of 77. Her
earlier scores were 78, 74 and 79. The 20-year-old South Korean,
who won the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Women's Open, had only
three birdies in 72 holes.

Women larger force than men at European Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Corrects spelling Carlo Boccarini 9th graf
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The biggest star of this week's
European Championships might be 800-meter world record-holder
Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, and he was born in Kenya.
	   The quadrennial championships open Tuesday at a time when
European track and field seems to be in a slump. That's
particularly true for the men, where the sprints this season have
been owned by Americans, and every other distance by Africans.
	   Even Kipketer is beatable. Indomitable for several seasons, he
was hit with an attack of malaria in February, didn't resume
training until late May, and was beaten last week in the Weltklasse
Grand Prix in Zurich _ his first loss in three years _ by Kenyan
Japheth Kimutai.
	   It's a different story for the European women, who have
world-class athletes in almost every event and lead many of the
field events.
	   The six-day championships in the Hungarian capital are
sandwiched between last week's Weltklasse, the fourth of the Golden
League meets, and the fifth meet in the series Aug. 28 in Brussels.
	   About the only sanctuary for the men is in the field events, led
by British triple jump world-record holder Jonathan Edwards.
	   Edwards, 32, gold medalist at the '95 World Championships when
he set the mark, hasn't won gold since in the Olympics, worlds or
Europeans but has the top two marks in this season in his
speciality.
	   The host Hungarians will be watching the hammer throw most
closely, where '96 Olympic champion Balazs Kiss faces countryman
Tibor Gecsek, a bronze medalist in the '93 and '95 worlds who is
returning from a two-year drug ban.
	   Britain has most of Europe's limited sprint strength with a
British sweep of the 100 possible, led by Malcolm Christian, Dwain
Chambers, Darren Campbell and Marlone Devonish. The fastest
European so far is Italy's Carlo Boccarini (10.08).
	   ``We have been running so well this year and have been a long
way ahead of other Europeans on the international circuit,'' said
Chambers. ``I believe that it is a realistic aim to have all three
of us on the podium.''
	   At 400 meters, Britain's Mark Richardson has run 44.37, which is
the top non-American time in the world this season. Teammate Iwan
Thomas is right behind at 44.38.
	   Spain _ led by Isaac Viciosa at 1,500 and Fabian Roncero in the
10,000 and marathon _ is again the force in the distance races with
with eastern Europe dominating most of the field events.
	   On the women's side, there is a world-class threat from France's
Christine Arron at 100 meters. She has run 10.85 this year and is
the only consistent sub-11 European in the world.
	   Germany's 26-year-old Grit Breuer, an Olympic bronze medalist in
the relays at 16 and later banned for drug use, ran 49.51 (the
second fastest in the world this season) to win last week's
Weltklasse 400.
	   From 800 through 10,000 meters _ excluding the 5,000 _ European
women have the top times in the world this season. Romanian
Gabriela Szabo has the top time at 1,500 and 3,000.
	   Six of the eight field events also have European women leading
them: Venelina, Veneva, Bulgaria (high jump); Rodica Mateescu,
Romania (triple jump), Irina Korzhanenko, Russia (shot put),
Natalya Sadova, Russia (discus), Olga Kuzenkova, Russia (hammer
throw), Tanja Damaski, Germany (javelin).
	   A major absence in the triple jump will be world indoor
record-holder Ashia Hansen of Britain, who is out with a heel
injury.
	   Four years is an eternity in track and field. So it's
eye-popping, the quest by 33-year-old German Heike Drechsler to win
a fourth straight European long-jump title.
	   Four others are out to win their third straight European golds:
Briton's Colin Jackson (110 hurdles) and Steve Backley (javelin),
and German's Ilke Wyludda (discus) and Sabine Braun (heptathlon).

Steinhauer surges at Women's British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; eds: UPDATES throughout with details &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Sherri Steinhauer had more
reason to think about switching her airline reservations than
winning a tournament.
	   After all, she shot a 9-over-par 81 in the first round of the
Women's British Open. Three days later, after a closing round of
69, the tournament belonged to her.
	   ``After my 81, the only thing I dreamed of was changing my
flight because I would have to leave early,'' Steinhauer said. ``At
that stage, my only real goal was making the cut.''
	   She began the final round four strokes off the lead and opened
with a bogey at the first hole at Royal Lytham St. Annes. Then
Steinhauer began her surge on a windy, links course where no one
could complete four rounds at par.
	   She finished one stroke ahead of American compatriot Brandie
Burton and Sophie Gustafson of Sweden. Steinhauer had a total of
4-over 292, with Burton (71) and Gustafson (70) at 293.
	   ``This is like a dream,'' said Steinhauer, whose 156-yard
(143-meter) approach to the last green gave her a straight 8-foot
(2.4-meter) birdie putt. The ball hung on the lip and dropped in.
	   ``When I walked up to make the putt, I looked at the leaderboard
and thought, `This could win the British Open','' Steinhauer said.
``I made a good strike but it barely made it. It was the last
roll.''
	   With eight players still on the course, Steinhauer had to wait
before the title was secure. This was her third pro victory, one of
them a major _ the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
	   Scotland's Janice Moodie, the LPGA rookie who led by a stroke
entering the final round, missed six 6-foot (2-meter) putts during
her 75 and finished fourth at 6-over. She was trying to become the
first Briton to win the championship in seven years.
	   ``I was so close,'' Moodie said. ``Two shots on that course was
nothing.''
	   Steinhauer earned dlrs 165,000 for her victory. Her best
previous result this season was a share of fourth at the Rochester
International.
	   On Sunday, her opening round of 9-over seemed a distant memory.
She followed with rounds of 72, 70 and 69 to charge past the
contenders.
	   ``Last night, I called my parents and my dad said, 'Wouldn't it
be something for someone who shot 81 first day to go and win the
tournament?''' she said. ``I just laughed.''
	   Six players either led or shared the lead on the final day of
the tournament. But Steinhauer didn't join them until the 16th.
	   She would have had the lead alone but a 10-foot (3-meter) birdie
putt stayed on the edge of the hole at No. 16. A 6-foot (2-meter)
birdie putt at No. 17 slipped past the cup, but she finally moved
ahead at the last hole.
	   After birdies at Nos. 6, 11 and 13, she knew she had a chance
because no one had made a break at the front and others were
falling fast.
	   Betsy King, one stroke off the lead at the start of the final
round, had a 78 and she finished 9-over. Winner of 31 titles and
more money than anyone in tour history, she's still looking for her
first victory this year.
	   Defending champion Karrie Webb of Australia, aiming to win this
title a third time in four years, shot a 73 for 296 and fifth
place.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of four tournaments, including two majors, in
her rookie season, wound up 20-over after a closing 77. Her earlier
scores were 78, 74 and 79. The 20-year-old South Korean, who won
the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Women's Open, had only three
birdies in 72 holes.
	   ``I learned many things,'' said Pak, who had 16 bogeys and two
double bogeys during her four days. ``The wind made it hard and the
greens are hard to read. This is a totally different course. It is
hard to play.''

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ In a massive manhunt, Palestinian
police searched house-to-house Sunday for an escaped Hamas leader
also wanted by Israel.
	   Imad Awadallah, a leader of the military wing of the Islamic
militant group, escaped Saturday from a Palestinian Authority
prison in the West Bank town of Jericho, Palestinian security
officials said. Roadblocks were set up in Jericho and Ramallah,
where Awadallah's family lives.
	   Palestinian police searched houses and cars and combed orchards
in Jericho. Police vans drove through the city Sunday afternoon,
announcing a curfew over loudspeakers and ordering merchants to
close their shops and residents to return home. Police patrolled
the streets on foot, Kalishnikovs raised.
	   It was the first time the Palestinian Authority imposed a curfew
on its own people, although it was in effect only in the center of
town and was not strictly enforced. Still, locals accustomed to
such curfews during years of Israeli occupation rushed to stock up
at bakeries before going home.

Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to combat car theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ One week after a national police crime report
estimated that a car is stolen in Israel every 12 seconds, Israel's
Security Cabinet announced plans Sunday to curb theft by beefing-up
security along its West Bank divide.
	   Some 45,000 Israeli-owned cars were stolen in 1997. Police
believe most of the cars end up in Palestinian areas of the West
Bank, where they are resold or stripped for parts. Car thefts are a
point of contention between Israeli and Palestinian police who have
tried, with little success, to cooperate on the issue.
	   Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the police also
want the government to fund the deployment of an additional 2,000
troops along some 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the pre-1967 border
between Israel and the West Bank to prevent thieves from skirting
checkpoints by using back roads.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War. Although its major cities have been handed over to Palestinian
control under Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, Israel still
controls overall security and patrols roads and checkpoints between
Israel proper and the West Bank.

Fossett's team loses contact with him

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Balloonist and millionaire adventurer Steve
Fossett lost contact with his ground crew Sunday as he headed into
thunderstorms over shark-infested waters of the South Pacific, more
than halfway through his attempt to fly around the world.
	   Crew members at mission control center in St. Louis said that an
emergency locator beacon was activated about the time they lost
contact with Fossett, but that its signal was not picked up by
satellite.
	   Although it was too soon to tell whether the American balloonist
went down, a mission spokesman said it was likely the balloon
developed a tear during a storm and was disabled. If that happened,
the balloon should not fall suddenly.
	   ``It would come down slowly,'' Jim Mitchell said. ``These
balloons can do unusual things.''
	   The balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian
coast heading toward its final destination of Argentina, South
America, when contact was lost, according to Alan Blount, director
of mission control at Washington University in St. Louis.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
	   A second emergency locator beacon was activated _ indicating
that either Fossett started the beacon himself or it was set off by
water. The first beacon went off shortly after midnight, Australian
time, and the second was activated about 1 1/2 hours later.
	   About five hours before the locator sounded, meteorologist Bob
Rice had cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong
thunderstorms and they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Australian officials were sending a rescue plane to the spot.
	   Fossett has traveled 15,200 miles (24,500 kilometers) since
launching from Argentina Aug. 7. He had at least another five days
of travel before he was expected to reach South America.
	   The balloon's capsule could float for a while, but it was not
leakproof. Fossett had a life raft and emergency wet suit on board,
officials said.
	   ``He has supplies for more than enough time for that part of the
world,'' Blount said. ``We're not concerned about that.''
	   A major concern was finding Fossett. An Australian C-130 plane
was not expected to take long to reach the spot where Fossett was
last contacted. But a satellite that passed over the area failed to
locate either emergency beacon.
	   ``He could cope if any human could cope,'' Mitchell said.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined that Northern
Ireland's fragile peace won't shatter, Protestants and Catholics
united in uncomprehending grief Sunday over the car-bomb slaughter
of at least 28 civilians, including nine children and a woman
pregnant with twins, in this religiously mixed town.
	   Irish Prime Minster Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, speaking to reporters after meeting in Belfast, pledged to
do everything within their power to hunt down the bombers and keep
the peace process moving forward.
	   ``The purpose of that bomb was to destroy the work and hope and
agreement we built up. Our determination has got to be, these
people will never win, and that democracy will triumph over evil,''
Blair said.
	   ``We will defeat them _ and defeat them we will,'' declared
Ahern, who earlier vowed to ``crush'' the IRA dissidents being
blamed for the worst terrorist atrocity in Northern Ireland history
.
	   The two leaders announced that Irish and British police chiefs
and ministers will meet Monday to discuss measures to improve
security.
	   Blair, who broke of his vacation to fly to Belfast, condemned
what he called ``a tiny, fanatical group'' who ``have no support in
Northern Ireland ... just this capacity for evil'' and pledged to
``carry on to my last breath working for peace'' in the province.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police have arrested 23 people suspected of
involvement in three bombings in southern and central Yemen that
left eight people dead, the interior minister said Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab told state-run Yemeni
television that the arrests were made during the past three days.
	   Twenty-two men were suspected of involvement in the blowing up
of an oil pipeline in the southern city of Aden on July 3 that
caused an oil spill in the Arabian Sea and an explosion 11 days
later in Lahj, 35 kilometers (21 miles) north of Aden. Five people
were killed in the Lahj blast.
	   Arab said a man linked to a mosque bombing in the center of the
capital, San`a, in April had also been arrested. Three people were
killed and 27 wounded in that blast. Ali Mohammed Shaman, a member
of the Socialist Party, confessed to receiving orders from abroad,
Arab said. He gave no details.
	   Yemen is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore
apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and
the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of
violence were directed from abroad, but it has not named any
country.

Guerrilla killed, 1 captured by Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli-backed militiamen on Sunday
killed a leftist Lebanese guerrilla and captured another as the
pair infiltrated the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon,
militia officials said.
	   A patrol of the South Lebanon Army, a local militia armed and
paid by Israel, engaged the infiltrators near the town of Hasbaya
in the eastern sector of the occupied zone after dark, said the SLA
officials.
	   A gunbattle ensued in the area north of Hasbaya, some 12
kilometers (7.5 miles) northeast of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied zone. The area is about the same distance from the
Israeli border.
	   One guerrilla was killed and the second infiltrator captured,
said the officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Silencer-equipped pistols, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher,
ammunition and hand grenades were found on the two guerrillas, the
SLA officials said.
	   They added that the captured guerrilla identified himself as
belonging to the Communist party.
	   The SLA unit suffered no casualties, the officials said.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement confirmed that a
guerrilla was killed. But it made no mention of any guerrilla being
captured.
	   Lebanese Communists have taken part in the guerrilla war against
Israeli forces, who occupy 10 percent of Lebanese territory along
their border in the south.
	   Shiite Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollah have been leading the
fight to dislodge the 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 SLA
militiamen from the border zone.

Never, never: A painful about-face on Monica Lewinsky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Why didn't he change his story sooner?
	   If President Bill Clinton admits Monday to an improper or sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, that question could haunt him
until his last day in office.
	   The fallout from an about-face could be explosive.
	   This is the man who stood in the Roosevelt Room last Jan. 26,
wagged his finger at the cameras and sternly said, ``Listen to me.
... I did not have sexual relations with that woman _ Monica
Lewinsky.''
	   This is the man who testified under oath in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case that he ``never had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
	   This is the man who allowed friend after friend and aide after
aide to be hauled before a grand jury, at great legal and personal
expense, to testify about an affair he said never happened.
	   And his most senior advisers stood by loyally.
	   ``He didn't have any relations with her that I would consider
improper,'' Paul Begala said, echoing a chorus of defenders who
faithfully followed the president's cue.
	   Why let the drama play on and on?
	   Clinton's closest confidants offer this answer: The president
thought he could talk himself out of a jam that he considered
irrelevant to his job and his standing with the public. Clinton has
used his charm and agility with words to wiggle away from tough
questions before, about marijuana use and his military draft status
and alleged affairs.
	   Even as he signaled for the first time this weekend that he had
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton was slow to grasp the
implications.
	   Aides said Saturday night he planned to concede only an
``inappropriate'' relationship, though his lawyers were convinced a
grand jury would want to know details. And many political advisers
believe that the public will not settle for anything less than a
full confession and apology.
	   ``He's moving to realizing this, very slowly,'' said one
frustrated political adviser.
	   ``If the president changes his testimony and acknowledges an
improper relationship here, he obviously is going to have to go
through a lot of pain himself, not only in apologizing to his wife
and his family, but obviously to the staff and to those that he
misled and to the American public,'' former chief of staff Leon
Panetta said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet The Press.''
	   Americans have told pollsters they will forgive Clinton if he
admits that he lied and apologizes. But there are signs that a
change of story could carry great risk.
	   One recent poll revealed that the people who ``definitely''
believe he lied want Clinton impeached. Those who think he
``probably'' lied are more forgiving. If his testimony moves more
people from ``probably'' to ``definitely'' the political landscape
could change overnight.
	   Clinton may soon have plenty to answer for _ from prosecutors,
from grand jurors, from the public, from his loyal staff, from
skittish Democrats, from Congress.
	   And, most of all, from home.
	   In a TV interview that helped her husband weather the first days
of the crisis, Hillary Rodham Clinton was asked what would happen
if Clinton was proven wrong.
	   ``If all that were proven true,'' she said, ``I think that would
be a serious offense. That is not going to be proven true.''

British, Irish leaders promise security crackdown on 'Real IRA'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland, BC-NIreland-The Victims &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British and Irish governments
say they will wipe out IRA dissidents believed responsible for the
Omagh car bombing.
	   Imprisoning militants from the so-called ``Real IRA'' would
remove the most obvious threat to the Belfast peace agreement.
	   But past crackdowns against Ireland's many underground armies
have bent the law and civil rights standards, and provided a
recruiting sergeant for the next generation of killers.
	   ``We will do whatever we can to root these people out,'' British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said, citing the ``burning anger right
across Northern Ireland'' and the need to defend the compromise
agreement reached in April on joint Protestant and Catholic rule.
	   Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced that Irish
and British police and army leaders will meet Monday in Belfast to
plan a joint strategy to capture those behind the bombing, which
killed 28 people, including nine children.
	   The ``Real IRA'' is believed made up of about 10 experienced
operatives who defected from the Irish Republican Army and scores
of young recruits.
	   The IRA split after a July 1997 cease-fire, when most commanders
authorized their Sinn Fein party allies to pursue compromise.
	   The suspected commander of the ``Real IRA'' in the Irish
Republic, Mickey McKevitt, has been under sustained police
surveillance. But while more than a dozen underlings have been
caught making or delivering other bombs, he has yet to be charged
with any crime.
	   McKevitt, the IRA's reputed former ``quartermaster'' responsible
for maintaining secret arms dumps, resigned from the IRA command in
October, protesting that any agreement would require the IRA to
disarm under international supervision, a goal which was ultimately
adopted in the April accord.
	   The accord fell far short of the IRA goal of abolishing Northern
Ireland as a Protestant-majority state.
	   While membership in outlawed groups is itself a crime under both
British and Irish law, it's difficult to prove.
	   No figure illustrates this better than Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, whom history books record as an architect of the modern IRA.
	   When the British tried to convict Adams of membership in 1978 _
after the IRA burned 12 Protestants to death in a hotel _ they
eventually dropped the charge because they had no firm evidence.
	   But taking a harder line against the ``Real IRA'' by shunting
the legal process could also be a mistake.
	   When Northern Ireland soldiers and police interned without trial
several hundred IRA suspects in 1971, the move backfired
spectacularly, fueling popular support for the outlaws. When they
shot dead several unarmed IRA members in the 1980s, each became a
potent martyr for the cause.

Rebels move closer to Kinshasa, Kabila returns to capital

Lubumbashi and Angola. ADDS quotes, details. CHANGES overline.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila met with several
cabinet ministers in the southern city of Lubumbashi and made a
brief visit Sunday to neighboring Angola, where he tried to rally
support for his beleaguered government.
	   His army, meanwhile, had reportedly lost ground to advancing
rebels who aim to topple the government.
	   On his return to Kinshasa, Kabila lashed out at the Western
media, accusing foreign journalists of conspiracy against his
government.
	   ``Since when has the Western press been in our favor?'' Kabila
told reporters at the Kinshasa's international airport. ``We must
defy their plot against our country.''
	   He did not elaborate, but his government and state-controlled
radio and television have been stepping up attacks on Western
governments and accusing them of trying to destabilize his regime
by reporting on rebel territorial gains.
	   Leaders of the rebel movement _ a coalition of Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disgruntled members of Kabila's army _ said
they had captured the western Congo river port town of Matadi and
were fighting to take up positions closer to Kinshasa.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government.
	   A Western diplomat and a former military commander both said
said fighting was reported near the town of Songololo, about 250
kilometers (155 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Despite the apparent setbacks, the Congolese government said
Sunday that it was securing bases in the east and west of the
country in order to attack rebel forces trying to overthrow Kabila.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwandan Tutsi
war against Congo. Rwanda denies the charge.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, have become the target of attacks and
arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.
	   Increasingly, Kabila has accused the West of turning a blind eye
to Rwanda's alleged aggression.
	   A newspaper on Saturday carried a banner headline saying U.S.
war ships moving toward Congo's Atlantic shores were positioning to
help the rebels. The U.S. ships have been deployed to help evacuate
foreigners if necessary.
	   Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi told The Associated Press
that four cabinet ministers had met with Kabila over the weekend in
the southern city of Lubumbashi _ the president's former rebel
stronghold.
	   All four ministers were scheduled to return to Kinshasa later in
the day, Sondgi said.
	   He would not say what the officials discussed.
	   Asked why he and other cabinets ministers had not joined Kabila
in Lubumbashi, Sondgi responded: ``The president asked that the
majority of ministers stay here, if not it will give the impression
that we've all fled Kinshasa.''
	   Speaking on state radio, Information Minister Didier Mumengi
said the Congolese army was preparing ``mopping up'' operations,
despite claims by the rebels to be pushing for the capital,
Kinshasa.
	   ``The Congolese army has locked up the so-called occupied
territory,'' Mumengi said. ``This is not meant for a
counter-attack, but for establishing a base for the systematic
mopping up of the zones said to be occupied.''
	   With tensions mounting in Kinshasa, foreigners have been fleeing
the capital on chartered flights and across the Congo River to the
neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   The United States closed its embassy in Kinshasa on Saturday and
flew its remaining staff out of the country.
	   France says it does not plan to close its diplomatic mission
here, but has been arranging evacuations for French and other
foreign citizens wishing to leave.
	   Criticizing the departing foreigners, Kabila's Cabinet director,
Abdoulaye Yerodia, said they were like ``rats fleeing the ship.''
	   ``I don't know why they are leaving,'' he said on state
television. ``Do they think there is going to be an earthquake
here? If so, they should tell us.''
	   Thousands of students and government employees marched along the
city's main street, June 30th Boulevard, pledging support Saturday
for Kabila and accusing Rwanda of waging war on Congo.
	   Many protesters also accused France and the United States of
trying to destabilize Congo.

Terrible personal toll from Northern Ireland's worst attack

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A grandmother, her pregnant
daughter and her 18-month-old granddaughter.
	   A mother of four buying a school uniform for her youngest girl.
	   Three young boys from the Irish Republic traveling with a
12-year-old Spanish student as part of an exchange program, and the
24-year-old teacher leading them.
	   A university student working part-time for the summer and a
young woman who had just gotten engaged.
	   All lay in the British army barracks in the Northern Ireland
city of Omagh on Sunday, alongside the rest of the 28 civilians
slain _ in some cases mutilated or burned beyond recognition _ by a
500-pound car bomb.
	   The attack Saturday was the province's single worst terrorist
atrocity.
	   On the west side of downtown, where a caller falsely claimed the
bomb had been planted, Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and
Methodist churches filled with stunned worshippers on Sunday.
	   Some bore bandages themselves from shrapnel wounds. All prayed
for their dead and maimed neighbors.
	   At Sacred Heart Catholic church, some parishioners cradled their
heads in their hands after the Rev. Michael Keveney told them that
a member in her 20s, Geraldine Breslin, had died overnight in a
Belfast hospital.
	   Friends wept Sunday for another victim, Julie Hughes, 21, a
Dundee University student who was working at a photo shop in Omagh
for the summer.
	   And there were more tears for Esther Gibson, in her 30s, a
Sunday school teacher at the Rev. Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian
Church who worked in a local clothing factory and had recently
become engaged.
	   ``She was a very fine girl with a good future. This is terrible
for the children and the congregation,'' said Paisley, leader of
the hardline Protestant Democratic Unionist Party.
	   	   Amateur video footage of the blast's aftermath captured
survivors gasping in the smoky haze, spattered with blood. Some
stood in dazed silence, others searched frantically for relatives
lost momentarily _ or forever blown away.
	   ``It was the nearest thing to a horror movie I've ever
witnessed,'' said barber Damien Turbitt, who escaped injury but had
his business destroyed.
	   Mary Grimes, 65, her daughter Avril Monaghan, 30 _ who was
pregnant with twins _ and her granddaughter, Maura, all of whom
lived in outlying towns, were visiting Omagh to shop when the bomb
exploded.
	   Kevin Skelton said his wife of 20 years, Philomena, and their
three daughters also were shopping _ for a school uniform for the
youngest, 13-year-old Shauna _ while he browsed in a neighboring
store. Their 16-year-old son was fishing.
	   After the explosion, Skelton ran outside.
	   ``My wife was lying on top of the rubble. She was face down and
the clothes had been blown off her,'' said Skelton, 43, who felt
her wrist to confirm that she was dead.
	   His two older daughters escaped uninjured, he said, but Shauna
suffered a broken jaw.
	   The Spanish exchange students had been studying English for the
past month in Donegal, in the northwest corner of the Irish
Republic. They made a day trip Sunday across the border with some
Irish students to visit the Ulster-American Folk Park near Omagh
and some decided afterwards to shop in the town.
	   The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs identified the dead as
Francisco Blasco Baselga, 12, and Rocio Abad Ramos, 24. Eleven
other Spanish students were injured, police said.
	   Omagh resident Tommy Logue had to wait until Sunday morning to
learn that his daughter Brenda had been killed.
	   ``I knew all along that she was dead,'' he said, his voice
breaking. ``The front of the shop where I knew her to be was
completely blown out _ nobody could survive that.''
	   Beyond the dead were tales of life-shattering injuries. Omagh
resident Lindsay Hall, a Protestant, wiped tears from his face as
he looked at pictures of his son Alastair, a rugby enthusiast whose
leg was blown off.
	   ``Alastair loved playing, but he will never be able to again
now,'' Hall said. ``He's only 12. I'm 57. Why couldn't it have
happened to me?''

Panama investigates disappearance of Swiss banker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Swiss police were traveling to Panama
on Sunday to help investigate the disappearance of the director of
a Swiss bank here, a newspaper reported.
	   Hans Jorg Vosch, director of the Panama office of the Union of
Swiss Banks, was last seen Thursday night when he attended a
cocktail party as part of a conference about money laundering, the
newspaper La Prensa reported Sunday.
	   Authorities would not say what they believed happened to Vosch,
but law enforcement chief Gabriel Castro said they were not
treating it as a kidnapping because no ransom had been demanded.
	   The last banker to be kidnapped in Panama was Panamanian citizen
Sam Kardonsky. He disappeared in 1984, and showed up a year later
in Ecuador after his family paid a ransom.

	   Crew members at mission control center in St. Louis said an
emergency locator beacon had been picked up by satellite by
midafternoon, giving rescuers from Australia a near pinpoint
location for their search.
	   ``We've got an extremely credible fix on his location,'' rescue
coordinator Joe Ritchie said. ``That's a big deal.''
	   There was no word on whether Fossett was OK.
	   He had been two-thirds of the way through his effort. The
balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian coast
heading toward its final destination of Argentina, South America,
when contact was lost, according to Alan Blount, director of
mission control at Washington University in St. Louis.
	   ``A lot depends on how fast he came down,'' Blount said.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   About five hours before the locator sounded, meteorologist Bob
Rice had cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong
thunderstorms and they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Australian and French officials were sending rescue planes to
the spot. Ritchie said the planes will drop survival gear _ a raft,
water, first-aid supplies _ in case Fossett was swimming in the
ocean. Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the
capsule of the balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   The nearest ship was a New Zealand naval vessel, about 200
nautical miles (370 kilometers) from the beacon location. Ritchie
estimated the ship would arrive at 2 p.m. Australian time (0400
GMT).
	   At the mission control office, a dozen crew members sat around a
conference table, working phones, scanning maps and checking
computers in an effort to find Fossett. A map on the wall tracked
his trip, showing how far he'd gone _ a record 15,200 miles (24,500
kilometers).
	   It also showed how far he had to go _ a massive stretch of the
Pacific Ocean between Australia and Argentina, the site of his Aug.
7 launch. Fossett had at least another five days of travel before
he was expected to reach South America.
	   It was the Chicago man's fourth attempt to fly around the world.
He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and raced in the
Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   ``He has supplies for more than enough time for that part of the
world,'' Blount said. ``We're not concerned about that.''
	   Mitchell said Fossett as an outstanding balloonist and a
survivalist.
	   ``He could cope if any human could cope,'' Mitchell said.

Guerrilla killed, 1 captured by Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli-backed militiamen on Sunday
killed a Lebanese guerrilla and captured another as the pair
infiltrated the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, militia
officials said.
	   A patrol of the South Lebanon Army, a local militia armed and
financed by Israel, engaged the infiltrators near the town of
Hasbaya in the eastern sector of the occupied zone after dark, said
the SLA officials. A gunbattle ensued in the area, about 12 kms (8
miles) from the Israeli border.
	   One guerrilla was killed and the second infiltrator captured,
said the officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
Silencer-equipped pistols, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher,
ammunition and hand grenades were found on the two guerrillas, the
SLA officials said.
	   They added that the captured guerrilla identified himself as
belonging to the Communist party.
	   The SLA unit suffered no casualties, the officials said.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed a guerrilla had been
killed but made no mention of any guerrilla being captured.
	   Lebanese Communists have taken part in the guerrilla war against
Israeli forces, who occupy 10 percent of Lebanese territory along
their border in the south.
	   Shiite Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollah have been leading the
fight to dislodge the 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 SLA
militiamen from the border zone.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Georgette was downgraded from a hurricane to
a tropical storm, then from a tropical storm to a tropical
depression on Sunday as it weakened quickly far from Mexico's
Pacific coast.
	   Maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph (56 kph). The U.S.
Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm would further weaken as it
moved over colder water and was expected to dissipate by Monday.
	   Georgette, which never approached land, was about 700 miles
(1,100 kms) west of the Baja California Peninsula and moving to the
west-northwest at 5 mph (8 kph).

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ D.C. United became the first team from the
United States to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup, beating Toluca of
Mexico 1-0 Sunday on Eddie Pope's goal in the 41st minute.
	   The annual tournament features the top teams from last season in
the top leagues of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
D.C. United won the first two titles in Major League Soccer, while
Toluca is the reigning Mexican League champion.
	   Pope's goal, his first of 1998, came after goalkeeper Mario
Alberran almost collided with two of his own defenders and bobbled
Marco Etcheverry's corner kick. Pope collected the loose ball.
	   D.C. United outscored opponents 11-0 in three Champions Cup
games this week. Scott Garlick made three saves for his second
shutout of the tournament.
	   Toluca's best scoring chance came in the 82nd minute when
Garlick barely deflected Jose Salvador Carmona's 25-yard (meter)
shot beyond the near post.
	   United earned a dlrs 125,000 first-place prize and a spot in the
Interamerican Cup, a home-and-away series against the winner of
South America's Liberators Cup.
	   In the third-place game, Deportivo Saprissa of Costa Rica beat
Leon of Mexico 2-0.
	   Adrian Mahia scored in the 45th minute and Walter Centeno in the
85th.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stricker, Singh after nine holes; O'Meara, Love,
Woods, falling back; edits to trim; Will be topped at conclusion of
round &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Match play at the PGA Championship
ended in 1957. Steve Stricker and Vijay Singh resurrected it Sunday
at Sahalee Country Club.
	   Four strokes ahead of the field to start the final round, two
men looking for their first major championship kept their distance
from an impressive collection of challengers and set up a duel for
the final nine holes.
	   Singh, played the front side with eight pars and a birdie and
was 8-under-par at the turn. Stricker was two strokes behind after
hitting in the water on No. 9, but making a superb recovery for
bogey.
	   But when it comes to Stricker, recovery is par for the course.
	   He may have saved his round on the par-5 second hole when he
hooked it into the trees. Cedars knocked down his next shot, and he
had to chip to a fairway running away from him, the ball scooting
across into thick rough.
	   Stricker's approach from 175 yards (meters) just cleared the
water, and he two-putted for bogey. But he came back with birdies
on the next two holes to take back the lead, only to watch Singh
sink a 6-foot (2-meter) birdie on No. 5.
	   Singh took a one-stroke lead on the par-4 sixth hole when
Stricker again went left into the trees and missed a 10-foot
(3-meter) par putt.
	   Stricker and Singh can interpret recent history of the PGA
Championship any way they choose.
	   It's true that nine of the past 10 champions have won their
first major at the PGA, a good sign for the co-leaders as they
began the final round at Sahalee Country Club with a four-stroke
lead.
	   But each raindrop that softened Sahalee early Sunday also
brought this harrowing thought: Only four of the last 12 PGA
champions have started the final round in the lead.
	   ``They've got to be careful not to try to turn it into a match
play,'' Ernie Els said as the sun broke through and began to dry
the course.
	   Els knows from experience. Three years ago at Riviera, he was 16
under after three rounds and took a three-stroke lead into the
final 18 holes before playing tentatively on the front nine.
	   Steve Elkington blew past him and beat Colin Montgomerie in a
playoff after shooting a 64 _ the lowest final round ever by a PGA
champion.
	   Mike Reid had a three-stroke lead in 1989 until the pressure of
trying to win his first major caught up with him. Payne Stewart
closed with a 67 to win his first major championship.
	   ``Realistically, there could be 10 guys that have a chance on
the back nine _ if something happens on the front,'' said
Elkington.
	   But none of them made a strong enough move.
	   Mark O'Meara, trying to join Ben Hogan as the only players to
win three majors in a season, eagled the second hole and got to
5-under with a birdie on No. 5 until making bogeys on the next
three holes.
	   Davis Love III saw his chances to become the first back-to-back
PGA champion in 61 years disappear with a double bogey on the par-3
fifth, dumping his tee shot into the water.
	   And Tiger Woods might have to wait until next year to win his
second major. The first-round leader made bogey on three of the
last four holes on the front and was seven strokes back.
	   The only other players who protected the lead at the PGA since
1986 were Nick Price at Southern Hills in 1994; John Daly, who
overpowered wide-open Crooked Stick in 1991; and Wayne Grady, who
took a two-stroke lead into last round at Shoal Creek and won by
three strokes when Fred Couples self-destructed down the stretch.
	   Working in their favor is that Singh and Stricker have played
solidly for three rounds _ accurate off the tee and confident on
the greens.
	   Singh got a taste of this drama in the 1993 PGA at Inverness,
where he started the last round two strokes off the lead but
finished fourth.
	   ``I have a good chance of doing what I've always dreamed of
doing _ winning a major,'' Singh said.
	   While Stricker has never been in contention at a major, he was
paired with Lee Janzen in the final round at the past U.S. Open
when Janzen made up seven strokes on the last day to win.
	   ``I just took all that in,'' Stricker said. ``I was able to
watch what he did and how he handled himself down the stretch. If I
can imitate what he did, I'll be in good shape.''
	   Should either keep it together, it would be the first time this
year a major was won by someone from the front.

Archer wins First of America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADA, Michigan (AP) _ George Archer completed his long comeback
from hip-replacement surgery with a record-setting, five-stroke
victory Sunday in the Senior PGA's First of America Classic.
	   Archer, 58, who had the operation in April 1996, tied the Egypt
Valley Country Club course record with an 8-under-par 64 in the
final round to finish the 54-hole tournament with a record
17-under-par 199.
	   He already had the tournament record, but the 199 he posted when
he won the 1993 First of America Classic came at the shorter,
par-71 Highlands course in nearby Grand Rapids.
	   Archer had not won on the Senior Tour since May 1995 when he won
the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic. He also is the first repeat winner
of the First of America Classic.
	   He won by five strokes over Jim Dent and six strokes over
second-round leader Bruce Summerhays, 1996 Classic champion Gil
Morgan and first-round leader Jose Maria Canizares.
	   ``What a deal. This was quite a day,'' Archer said. ``Sixty-four
is quite a thrill.
	   ``I had set a goal of winning a tournament after the hip but a
couple of weeks ago I asked myself what I was doing out here. I
said, `Why not go fishing?' I never have a bad day fishing.''
	   Any notions Archer might have had of retiring from competitive
golf were dispelled on Sunday.
	   ``It is no fun to be out here when you don't get in the hunt,''
he said. ``Today though, was unbelievable. All the exercise and
everything I have done for the last two years paid off.
	   ``What I like to do is win, and I don't mind waiting a long time
to win, but you've got to be knocking at the door.''
	   Entering the final round two strokes behind Summerhays, Archer
thought he would have to continue to wait for another victory.
	   ``I really didn't think I had a chance to win,'' Archer said.
``But the old horse stood out there today and good things
happened.''
	   Dent shot a final-round 68 to overtake Summerhays, who finished
with a 72.
	   ``I couldn't make any short putts today,'' Dent said. ``I made
two putts that were at least 40 feet, but I missed all the short
ones.''
	   Dent missed three birdie putts inside 10 feet (3 meters) down
the stretch.
	   ``I had a good week overall,'' Dent said. ``I played well this
week. It has been a long time since I've been able to have fun out
here.''
	   Summerhays three-putted twice in the final round.
	   ``I three-putted two times today, and normally I don't
three-putt,'' Summerhays said. ``That hurt, for second place at
least, because it would have been hard to catch George. George knew
what he was doing today, and he did it all right.''

headed to a remote region of the South Pacific ocean Monday after
receiving an emergency call believed to be from the downed balloon
of millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett, authorities said.
	   Robin Poke of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said a
Royal Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 left Sydney about 6 a.m.
local time (2000 GMT), less than 90 minutes after a satellite
distress signal was received from the balloon.
	   A French navy plane took off about the same time from Noumea,
New Caledonia, he said. Both planes were expected to be in the area
at about 9.30 a.m. local time (2300 GMT).
	   Fossett lost contact with his ground crew Sunday as he headed
into thunderstorms over shark-infested waters of the South Pacific,
more than halfway through his attempt to fly around the world.
	   Crew members at mission control center in St. Louis said an
emergency locator beacon was activated about the time they lost
contact with Fossett.
	   Poke said the satellite signal was received at the authority's
rescue coordination center in Canberra from the Bellona reefs,
about 416 nautical miles (770 kms) off the east coast of Australia.
	   ``We are assuming he is down,'' Poke told The Associated Press.
He said the distress beacon was manually operated, indicating it
was set off by Fossett, not automatically.
	   The authority alerted all ships in the area by radio. Two ships
closest to the area of the distress beacon were on their way to its
source, Poke said. The container ship Papuan Chief was about 250
nautical miles (460 kms) northeast of the search site and New
Zealand Navy tanker Endeavor was about 200 nautical miles (370 kms)
south of the site. ``They are steaming to the area and making
haste,'' Poke said.
	   The rescue planes were carrying life rafts, which would be
dropped to Fossett if he was found to be separated from his
balloon's capsule, which has safety equipment aboard, Poke said.
	   ``We understand the capsule is seaworthy, with a life raft,
sufficient food and water,'' Poke said. ``But if he is not in that
life raft, our planes will drop a life raft to him. The aim at this
stage is to get a visual sighting and stay in visual contact.''
	   The balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian
coast heading toward its final destination of Argentina, when
contact was lost, according to Alan Blount, director of mission
control at Washington University in St. Louis.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm, but the crew was
concerned because the area is near a coral reef that could be full
of sharks.
	   Shortly before contact was lost, meteorologist Bob Rice had
cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong thunderstorms and
they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Fossett has traveled 15,200 miles (24,500 kilometers) since
launching from Argentina Aug. 7. He had at least another five days
of travel before he was expected to reach South America.
	   The balloon's capsule could float for a while, but it is not
leakproof. Fossett had a life raft and emergency wet suit on board,
officials said.
	   ``He has supplies for more than enough time for that part of the
world,'' Blount said. ``We're not concerned about that.''
	   Australian rescue authorities were praised internationally last
year after rescuing yachtsmen Tony Bullimore of Britain and
Frenchman Thierry Dubois after their boats capsized separately in a
ferocious storm during the French-organized Vendee Globe nonstop
solo around-the-world yacht race.
	   The men's boats capsized in January 1997, about 2,000 miles
(3,200 kilometers) southwest of Australia and only 1,000 miles
(1,600 kilometers) north of Antarctica.

De Swardt wins BostonCup singles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with doubles results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Unseeded Mariaan de Swardt
rallied from a 5-1 third-set deficit Sunday to defeat
seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of Austria 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 to win
the BostonCup.
	   De Swardt, of South Africa, earned dlrs 27,000 and her first
championship on the WTA tour. She had defeated second-seeded Anke
Huber of Germany and third-seeded Lisa Raymond of the United States
earlier in the tournament.
	   ``I felt good coming into the final and I was confident,'' she
said. ``When I served I went for it.''
	   Schett took the opening set 6-3 and appeared poised to win when
she broke de Swardt in the seventh game of the second set. However,
de Swardt immediately broke back and with an improved backhand took
the second set in the tiebreaker.
	   But Schett surged out to a 5-1 lead in the last set and served
for the match. Then de Swardt suddenly rallied.
	   ``I thought she became tentative,'' de Swardt said of Schett.
``I knew it was hard, but I decided I would make her earn it. She
made some unforced errors and went for shots she hadn't tried
earlier in the match.''
	   Schett began to unravel.
	   She lost the service game for 5-2 and de Swardt held serve for
5-3. De Swardt broke Schett for 5-4 and fought off a match point in
the 10th game to even the match at 5-5.
	   ``I was tired, and with her powerful serve I knew I was in
trouble,'' Schett said.
	   De Swardt again broke Schett in the eleventh game and smashed
three aces in the deciding game to take the victory.

	   Paul Quantrill, pitching despite a stiff back, got the final out
for his fourth save, retiring Gary Disarcina on a bouncer.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Reggie Sanders singled, doubled, tripled and
scored four runs Sunday as the Cincinnati Reds took advantage of
the Montreal Expos' ragged play to get a 8-1 victory and a series
sweep.
	   Brett Tomko (11-8) had a pair of hits, scored twice and pitched
seven innings to reach a Reds milestone. He's the first Cincinnati
pitcher to win 11 games in each of his first two seasons since Art
Fowler in 1954-55.
	   Sanders tripled, was hit by a pitch from Carl Pavano (4-6),
doubled and singled in his four plate appearances in the first five
innings. He scored each time, matching his career high, and came up
short of the cycle when he flew out to the warning track in the
seventh.
	   Pavano gave up six hits, three walks and five runs _ four earned
_ in his shortest start since June 22.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Cardinals 1
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire remained stuck on 47 homers, and
didn't walk, going 2-for-5 with two singles and three strikeouts
Sunday in the Cardinals' loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   McGwire, 26-for-111 (.234) since the All-Star break with 10
homers and 19 RBIs, was tied for the home run lead Sunday when the
Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit his 47th.
	   Pirates starter Francisco Cordova (11-10) gave up a two-out
single to McGwire with none on the first, struck him out with two
on in the third, fanned him to start the fifth and gave up a
two-out single in the seventh _ McGwire's 5,000th career at-bat.
	   Matt Morris (3-3) allowed three runs and eight hits in eight
innings.

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ A small boat carrying political
activists sank off the Pacific coast of western Panama, and
rescuers pulled 10 people and one body from the waters on Sunday.
Four others remained missing.
	   The boat was taking 15 activists from the opposition Arnulfista
Party on a tour of western Veraguas province to rally against an
Aug. 30 referendum that would allow the re-election of the
president.
	   It sank on Saturday between the villages of Puerto Vidal and
Pixvae, 125 miles (210 kms) west of Panama City. The cause wasn't
known.
	   Among the missing was an acting congresswoman, Yolanda de Casis.
Mireya Moscoso, president of the Arnulfist Party, Panama's largest
opposition party, traveled to the site to participate in the
search, the RPC radio network reported.

Guatemalan judge denies issuing arrest warrants for two priests in
</HEADLINE>
bishop slaying &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan judge on Sunday denied a
claim that had issued arrest warrants for two priests in the
slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop.
	   On Saturday, Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio said two
priests were being sought for the killing of Bishop Juan Gerardi.
But judge Isaias Figueroa Medina, who is overseeing the case, said
he never issued the order.
	   ``It's false that there are new arrest warrants in the Gerardi
case,'' Figueroa said on the Sonora radio station. He said he
didn't expect other religious officials to be arrested.
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, two
days after he delivered a church human rights report blaming the
military and pro-government death squads for most of the deaths
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   Police in July arrested the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera in
connection with Gerardi's death, and last month, Ronalth Ochaeta of
the Archbishop's Human Rights Office claimed that two military men
were involved in the slaying.
	   Even the archbishop had said he was surprised by the arrest
warrants that he said were issued Saturday. The archbishop could
not be located for comment Sunday.

Davenport upsets Hingis for third straight title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport kept
Martina Hingis off-balance with powerful serves and deep
groundstrokes to surprise the world's top-ranked player 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 Sunday in the Acura Classic for her third consecutive WTA Tour
victory.
	   Davenport's run of titles includes Stanford and San Diego,
giving her a 12-match winning streak as she tunes up for the U.S.
Open beginning Aug. 31.
	   ``To beat the No. 1 player in the world where I used to come and
watch as a little girl and to win three in a row, this is a great
ending for the whole month,'' said Davenport, who grew up 20
minutes from Manhattan Country Club.
	   On Davenport's second match point, Hingis appeared to hit a
winning lob and the crowd cheered only to see Davenport race
backward and make the return, then hit a backhand volley into the
open court for the victory.
	   ``Lindsay played great the last three tournaments, so she's got
to take a break now and let someone else win,'' joked Hingis, who
hasn't won a tournament in three months.
	   Davenport, ranked second in the world, took command early in
front of a partisan home crowd. Ahead 4-2, she let the first set
slip away with three unforced errors as Hingis broke her twice in
winning the final four games and the set 6-4.
	   But Hingis, who reached her first final since May when she won
the Italian Open, never felt comfortable returning Davenport's
booming serves, who alternately zinged them up the middle and
kicked them wide.
	   ``Some of the balls she hit today were just amazing. What can
you do about that?'' Hingis said. ``I felt pretty OK, just
sometimes I had some bad mis-hits.''
	   The Swiss teen-ager staved off two break points to hold serve at
the start of the second set. But Davenport got the pivotal break in
the fifth game when Hingis double-faulted to trail 2-3 and the
American gave up just three points on her serve to even the match.
	   ``My serves really almost won me the last three tournaments,''
Davenport said. ``I have been able to hold serve and not struggle
too much, therefore, you have more energy and you can be a little
bit more relaxed when you are returning.''
	   Tied 1-1 in the third, Hingis dropped serve on two consecutive
forehand errors. Davenport took the break and built a 4-2 lead,
cracking a forehand winner down the line on what appeared to be an
easy smash putaway by Hingis.
	   ``I had to risk a lot today, I had to be more aggressive than I
usually am, so you have a couple bad shots,'' said Hingis, who had
39 unforced errors.
	   Hingis hit one of her 10 aces, negated by seven double faults,
to trail 3-4. Davenport's toughest challenge on her serve came in
the eighth game when she faced break point. She fought off deuce as
Hingis sprayed two errant shots to lose the game. Hingis tossed her
racket in disgust, and as if to prove she couldn't get a break, it
hit her in the head. She wasn't hurt.
	   Davenport earned dlrs 79,000, bringing her three-week California
total to dlrs 237,000. She also took home a new Acura.
	   ``This is the only car I've ever won in my pro career,'' she
said. ``I'm going to keep it.''

Franchitti gets first CART victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELKHART LAKE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Dario Franchitti, avoiding the
troubles that plagued most of the top competitors, ran off with his
first CART FedEx Series victory Sunday in the Texaco-Havoline 200.
	   The 25-year-old Scotsman, in his second year of Champ Car
racing, beat defending series champion and current points leader
Alex Zanardi to the finish line by 7.102-seconds _ nearly the
length of the last straightaway. He averaged 127.145 mph (204.61
kph).
	   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Franchitti said. ``It was a long time coming.
We've been in position before and had so many things happen. We
beat everybody on the track today. My guys were perfect.''
	   The youngster, making only his 30th career start, led the last
21 of 50 laps around the 4.048-mile (6.51-kilometer), 14-turn Road
America circuit. Franchitti took the lead when Bobby Rahal made his
final pit stop of the afternoon.
	   Franchitti made his third and last pit stop at the end of lap
42, coming off pit road with a lead of 11.673 seconds over Michael
Andretti of the United States.
	   Andretti, who walked away from a spectacular tumbling crash a
week earlier at Mid-Ohio, was fending off Zanardi in the battle for
second on the last lap when his left rear tire exploded on the back
straightaway. That sent his Swift-Ford pounding into a concrete
barrier and then a tire wall at over 190 mph (305 kph). The former
CART champion, frustrated and angry, was again able to walk away
without injury.
	   That left Zanardi to cruise to the finish line, taking the 16
points for second place and building his season margin over
American teammate Jimmy Vasser _ who finished ninth _ to 80 points
with only five of 19 races remaining. Each race has a maximum of 22
points, including one for leading the most laps and one for winning
the pole.
	   Despite his second-place finish, it was another tough afternoon
for the Italian driver, who was fined dlrs 50,000 and one
championship point for ``taking unjustified risks'' twice during
the race at Mid-Ohio.
	   On the second turn of the first lap, Gil de Ferran ran into the
rear of American Scott Pruett's car near the front of the bunched
28-car field. Several other drivers braked and swerved to avoid the
aftermath and Zanardi slammed hard into the rear of Al Unser Jr.,
of the United States.
	   Unser, who started fifth, slid off into a gravel pit, where he
was hit again by the spinning car of Patrick Carpentier, ending the
day for both drivers.
	   ``I don't really know what happened,'' said Zanardi, already on
probation for the incidents at Mid-Ohio. ``I'm so sorry. I spent
the whole race thinking about that.
	   ``I saw a lot of smoke and I hit the brakes as hard as I could
and ran into the rear of his car very hard. I just hit him.''
	   Wally Dallenbach, the chief steward, was expected to review
videotapes of the incident.
	   Bryan Herta, who started next to pole-winner Andretti in second,
came away without injury from a bizarre and dangerous mishap on the
11th lap.
	   Herta, who chose to stay on the track while several other early
leaders pitted, was out front for a restart on lap 11 after the
first full-course caution period. Teammate and boss Rahal passed
Herta, of the United States, for the lead and Herta, who said his
engine was starting to go, was trying to hold off Greg Moore when
he drove too deep into fifth turn, a tight left-hander.
	   Herta tapped the rear of Rahal's car and spun. He wound up
sitting backward just off the track surface.
	   As safety workers approached the stopped car, they were suddenly
sent scrambling as rookie Alex Barron also slid off course. Herta,
looking right at the runaway, tucked in his arms and ducked his
head before Barron's car slid to a stop on top of his.
	   Barron's car touched Herta's hands, but neither driver was
injured.
	   Moore took the lead moments later as Rahal made his first pit
stop, but his strategy, trying to finish the race on two stops,
went awry. The Canadian driver's gearbox broke as he tried to leave
the pits following his first stop at the end of lap 18.
	   De Ferran was also unlucky, blowing up his engine while running
third on lap 43.
	   Christian Fittipaldi, of Brazil, wound up a distant third,
trailing Franchitti across the finish line by 43.922 seconds.
Rookie Tony Kanaan, of Brazil, was fourth, followed by Mexican
Adrian Fernandez, Canadian Paul Tracy, Englishman Mark Blundell,
Rahal, who is retiring as a driver at the end of the season, and
Vasser.

Dozens of soldiers reported killed in new fighting with leftist
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In what appears to be another setback
for a besieged Colombian army, dozens of soldiers were reported
killed and captured in weekend clashes with leftist rebels in
northwestern Colombia.
	   In a statement read on Radionet radio station, guerrillas from
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said they had
killed 53 soldiers, wounded 30 and taken 20 more prisoner.
	   The fighting took place in a remote part of the municipality of
Rio Sucio, in Choco state, about 250 miles (400 kms) northwest of
Bogota.
	   Rebel death counts have in the past proven accurate.
	   In its own statement, the army said ``numerous'' soldiers and
rebels had died in the fighting. It said only 19 soldiers had been
wounded.
	   The army said the fighting had begun Friday and continued Sunday
afternoon. The ongoing combat made it impossible to confirm the
exact number of deaths, the army said.
	   According to the army, the battle began when about 600
guerrillas attacked soldiers from three counterinsurgency
battalions.
	   An official from the Red Cross in nearby Apartado, Jorge
Cardona, told The Associated Press that at least 43 wounded
soldiers had been evacuated but that the number of deaths was
unclear.
	   The fighting comes less than two weeks after guerrillas from the
FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army destroyed a major
anti-narcotics base, killing up to 143 soldiers and police and
capturing 129. It was one of the most devastating offensives by the
rebels, who have been fighting the government since the 1960s.
	   The rebel onslaught preceded the Aug. 7 inauguration of
President Andres Pastrana, who has vowed to make peace his
government's top priority.

Rafter beats Sampras for second straight tour victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Patrick Rafter of Australia won his second
straight title Sunday, beating American Pete Sampras 1-6, 7-6
(7-2), 6-4 in the dlrs 2.45 million ATP Championship.
	   It was the fourth victory this year for Rafter, the reigning
U.S. Open champion. He is the first Australian to win four titles
in a year since Rod Laver did it in 1975.
	   Rafter, ranked third in the world, has reached the finals of
four tournaments this season, also winning in India, the
Netherlands and last week in Toronto. He has been the hottest
player on tour recently, winning 10 consecutive matches _ including
six against top-15 opponents.
	   Sampras, who won the ATP Championship in 1992 and last year, had
not lost to Rafter since their first meeting in 1993, beating him
eight straight times. The loss prevented Sampras from regaining the
No.1 ranking that he lost to Marcelo Rios of Chile a week ago.
	   The first point of Sunday's match hinted at how the day would go
for Rafter, who stumbled early. Sampras won the point when his
return hit near the top of the net and dribbled over, well out of
Rafter's reach.
	   When Sampras broke Rafter in the second game with a passing
shot, all that remained was for him to serve out the set. But when
Sampras broke Rafter again in game six with pinpoint placements,
Rafter handed his racket to a ball boy and traded places with him.
	   The crowd roared, and the stunt added a moment of levity, but it
didn't halt the inevitable. The first set was over in 27 minutes.
	   Rafter said he altered his strategy after the dismal first set.
	   ``I started serving to the forehand more. He wasn't quite as
strong on that side,'' Rafter said.
	   Early in the second set, Sampras had Rafter off balance, moving
in the wrong direction or diving at perfect shot placements. But
Rafter revived, bringing the crowd to its feet by winning a
spirited exchange in game nine, twice taking Sampras to set point
in game 12 and then blitzing the tiebreaker 7-2.
	   From there, play slowed noticeably as the humid, 91 F (33 C)
afternoon dragged on, and Rafter wore down Sampras, winning the
match on a serve that Sampras clearly thought was out.
	   ``That's not why I lost the match, but it certainly ended it on
a bad note,'' Sampras said.
	   The win was worth dlrs 361,000 to Rafter. The runnerup got dlrs
190,000.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico won't try to stop its citizens from
crossing illegally into the United States because they have a right
to try to better their lives, the head of Mexico's migration agency
says.
	   ``Mexico will never discourage Mexican migrants from entering or
leaving the country. We will do nothing that limits or discourages
migration to the United States by people who leave their families
and their hometowns to better their living conditions,'' Fernando
Solis Camara, head of the Subsecretariat of Population and
Migration Services, said in comments reported by local newspapers
on Sunday.
	   He said he was worried about an increase in deaths and injuries
to immigrants trying to cross the border through harsh deserts, and
that the Mexican government was trying to offer more protection to
those who try to make the trip.
	   He said signs now warn people about natural hazards, and that
rescue teams patrol the area. He said the teams never try to
persuade people not to make the trip.
	   On Thursday, seven bodies were found near El Centro, California,
bringing the number of heat-related deaths among would-be illegal
immigrants this year to 81.
	   As U.S. immigration officials have invested more officers and
equipment into blocking the border at the most common crossing
places, many immigrants have been trying to cross in more remote _
and dangerous _ spots.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Two major labor federations said
Sunday they will stage huge strikes if President Carlos Flores
Facusse does not triple salaries nationwide within 30 days.
	   The United Workers' Federation and the General Workers' Central
said they would block roads, bridges and government offices and
stage a general strike if their demand is not met.
	   The groups are two of the three major labor federations in
Honduras. Along with the Workers' Federation, they have a
membership of 600,000.
	   The government had no comment Sunday.
	   The labor groups said free-market changes by the government are
making it difficult for Hondurans to survive. Minimum wage is dlrs
90 a month. They also criticized a recent rise in the sales tax,
from 7 percent to 12 percent.
	   Flores Facusse announced his economic problem in April, saying
he needed to improve the economy in the face of a dlrs 200 million
budget deficit and a dlrs 4.2 billion foreign debt.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ D.C. United became the first team from the
United States to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup, beating Toluca of
Mexico 1-0 Sunday on Eddie Pope's goal in the 41st minute.
	   ``It's a great victory for a league that is 3 years old,''
United coach Bruce Arena said.
	   The annual tournament features the top teams from last season in
the top leagues of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
D.C. United won the first two titles in Major League Soccer, while
Toluca is the reigning Mexican League champion.
	   ``We reached an important milestone today,'' MLS commissioner
Doug Logan said. ``Our top teams have gotten to the point where we
are going to be reckoned with.''
	   Pope's goal, his first of 1998, came after goalkeeper Mario
Alberran almost collided with two of his own defenders and bobbled
Marco Etcheverry's corner kick. Pope collected the loose ball.
	   D.C. United outscored opponents 11-0 in three Champions Cup
games this week. Scott Garlick made three saves for his second
shutout of the tournament.
	   ``Garlick put together probably two of the best games of his
career back-to-back,'' Arena said.
	   Toluca's best scoring chance came in the 82nd minute when
Garlick barely deflected Jose Salvador Carmona's 25-yard (meter)
shot beyond the near post.
	   United earned a dlrs 125,000 first-place prize and a spot in the
Interamerican Cup, a home-and-away series against the winner of
South America's Liberators Cup.
	   But first, United (20-5) returns to league action. It already
has clinched a playoff spot.
	   ``We want as much silverware as we can in the trophy case,''
midfielder John Harkes said.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  In the third-place game, Deportivo Saprissa of Costa Rica
beat Leon of Mexico 2-0.

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The long, lonely hours on the range
were merely a dress rehearsal for Vijay Singh. He was on center
stage Sunday at Sahalee and turned in a star performance.
	   With a lucky bounce out of the trees, a spectacular recovery
from the woods and nerves of steel down the stretch in a steady
rain, Singh won the PGA Championship with a 2-under 68.
	   The 35-year-old from Fiji two-putted for par on the 18th _ his
fourth par on the toughest hole at Sahalee Country Club _ to finish
at 9-under 271 for a two-stroke victory over Steve Stricker.
	   It was the 10th time in 11 years that a player won his first
major championship at the PGA.
	   For Singh _ a Hindu name that means ``Victory'' _ it ended years
of grinding away for hours at a time in search of a game that would
give him one of golf's ultimate prizes.

Price's 65 falls short
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Nick Price was at his best in the
final round of the PGA Championships. He still never had a
realistic shot.
	   ``I putted the best I've putted all year,'' said Price, who
matched the course record Sunday with a 5-under-par 65.
	   Price, the 1992 and 1994 winner, saved par four times by getting
it up and down. He also made a 25-foot (7.6-meter) eagle putt on
the 546-yard (499-meter), par-5 No. 11.
	   Price finished at 4-under-par 276.
	   ``I thought if I could get it to 7-under I might have a chance,
but that's a tough order when you consider how tough the back nine
can be, particularly the last two holes,'' Price said. ``I really
hung in there. I can't complain, but I wish that putt had gone in
on No. 17.''
	   Price's putt for birdie off the fringe hung on the lip. He
waited as long as he legally could before he nudged the ball into
the cup.
	   Price, who had 28 putts, said the key to his round wasn't the
eagle. It was the four par saves he made.
	   ``Par saves in the final round of a major are just as important
as birdies,'' Price said. ``It just kills you if you make bogeys
and I didn't have any those today. ''
	   Price shot 2-under 33 on the front and 3-under 32 on the back
nine of tough Sahalee Country Club.
	   He tied the course record set by Greg Kraft on Saturday.
	   ``My putting had been awful this year but it shows what you can
do when you get it going,'' Price said. ``Now I stand on the tee
knowing if I miss a green I can get it up and down for par. That's
the way I used to play.''

	   He would practice on the far end of the driving range where he
wouldn't be disturbed. He would rearrange the furniture in hotel
rooms to give him room to practice at night.
	   It all paid off Sunday in what amounted to match play against
Stricker, two men in search of their first major championship, both
playing well enough to put a worthy collection of challengers at a
distance.
	   Singh finally got some breathing room when he saved par from the
bunker on No. 17 from about 18 feet (5.5 meters) and Stricker
couldn't match him. He blasted out of the same bunker to 15
feet(4.6 meters), but the putt grazed by the left side of the hole
to put Stricker two strokes back.
	   All that stood between Singh and the Wanamaker Trophy was an
accurate drive on the 475-yard (434-meter) finishing hole, and he
split the middle.
	   Stricker closed with a 70 for 273. Steve Elkington, the 1995
champion held back all year by health problems, shot 67 and
finished third at 274.
	   Mark O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan
in 1953 to win three majors in one season, was five strokes back in
a tie for fourth after a string of three bogies on the sixth,
seventh and eighth holes offset an early charge that pulled him
within two strokes of the lead.

	   Fossett had been two-thirds of the way through his effort. The
balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian coast
heading toward its final destination of Argentina, South America,
when contact was lost, according to Alan Blount, director of
mission control at Washington University in St. Louis.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   About five hours before the locator sounded, meteorologist Bob
Rice had cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong
thunderstorms and they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Australian and French officials had sent rescue planes to the
spot to drop survival gear _ a raft, water, first-aid supplies.
Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the capsule
of the balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   The nearest ship was a New Zealand naval vessel, about 200
nautical miles (370 kilometers) from the beacon location. Ritchie
estimated the ship would arrive about 2 p.m. Australian time (0400
GMT).
	   At the mission control office, a dozen crew members sat around a
conference table, working phones, scanning maps and checking
computers in an effort to find Fossett. A map on the wall tracked
his trip, showing how far he'd gone _ a record 15,200 miles (24,500
kilometers).
	   It also showed how far he had to go _ a massive stretch of the
Pacific Ocean between Australia and Argentina, the site of his Aug.
7 launch. Fossett had at least another five days of travel before
he was expected to reach South America.
	   It was the Chicago man's fourth attempt to fly around the world.
He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and raced in the
Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.

O'Meara, threatening early, loses bid for third major in three hole

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Striding off the fifth green, Mark
O'Meara raised a triumphant fist at the gallery cheering his charge
toward history.
	   Three holes later, he could only ponder what might have been.
	   O'Meara's shot at winning his third major championship of the
year evaporated Sunday almost as quickly as he had raised the hopes
of the exuberant crowds lining the fairways and greens at Sahalee
Country Club.
	   Three bogeys in a row cut short a brilliant start and made sure
he would not become the first man since Ben Hogan 45 years ago to
win three major titles in one year.
	   ``It's a little disappointing, but that's the way it goes,''
O'Meara said. ``I played hard and fought hard out there. I just
came up a few shots short.''
	   O'Meara, who started the day lurking off the lead just as he had
before winning the Masters and British Open, ended up walking up
the 18th hole trailing by the same five shots he had when play
began.
	   Even sinking two 50-foot (15-meter) putts in the final round
wasn't enough to allow O'Meara to make a charge on the back nine.
	   He could be consoled only by the huge ovation from a crowd that
had come in hopes of seeing him make history.
	   ``I'm proud of myself,'' O'Meara said. ``I wanted to come here
and play well this week, and I did.''
	   O'Meara was 2 under when he began the day, five back of the lead
shared by Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker. By the time he sunk his
first 50-footer (15 meter), for eagle on the second hole, the lead
had been trimmed to three.
	   After missing a short birdie putt on No. 4, O'Meara carved a
5-iron within 10 feet (3 meters) on the par-3 fifth hole and made
the putt. Suddenly, he was just two shots behind.
	   The crowd sitting in the bleachers behind the fifth green roared
their approval as O'Meara strode toward the sixth tee.
	   ``Mark, you're going to win,'' one man shouted.
	   O'Meara smiled broadly and pumped a clenched fist in the air. If
destiny meant anything, this was the man carrying its banner.
	   Then it all unraveled, as quickly as the weather can change at
Sahalee. His tee shot on the 480-yard (439-meter), par-4 sixth hole
went into a fairway bunker and O'Meara missed a 4-footer (1.2
meters) for par. On the next hole, he missed the green right and
his 8-footer (2.4 meters) for par slid by the hole.
	   When his 12-footer (3.7 meters) for par on No. 8 missed the cup,
O'Meara had shot himself out of the tournament.
	   ``I realized if I had gotten off to a quick start I'd have as
good a chance as anyone,'' O'Meara said. ``I did that, but then I
rattled off those three bogeys and that was it.''
	   O'Meara came back to birdie the 10th hole and ran in his second
50-footer (15 meters) for birdie on No. 17. The 68 was his best
round of the week, but it wasn't good enough.
	   Later, he was philosophical about his shot at history.
	   ``It would have been a tremendous honor to go alongside Ben
Hogan's name, but it wasn't meant to be,'' O'Meara said. ``It's not
easy winning on tour, let alone winning a major championship.''

	   Soft but steady rain fell throughout the morning, making it
easier to attack the flags. But those who made a charge either
started too far behind or made their move too late.
	   Elkington was the only one who got seriously close.
	   Just like in 1995, when his 64 was the lowest closing round ever
by a PGA champion, Elkington stormed down the stretch and got to 7
under with a birdie on the par-3 17th.
	   But his drive found the right rough on the 18th and he took
bogey.
	   Nick Price, trying to join Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen as a
three-time PGA champion, tied the course record with a bogey-free
65. He was 5 under for day after an eagle on No. 11, but could do
no better than par over the last seven holes and finished five back
at 276, along with O'Meara and Frank Lickliter.
	   O'Meara, Davis Love III and Tiger Woods all had something to
prove, and all of them had their chances.
	   O'Meara, impervious to the pressure of chasing Hogan, raised
hopes once again with an eagle on the par-5 second hole and a
birdie on No. 5, the roars echoing through the forest of firs at
Sahalee.
	   But he missed the next three greens and all three of the short
par-saving putts to fall back to 2 under, well out of the hunt.
Still, his tie for fourth was the best finish of the nine previous
players who came to the PGA with a chance to win their third major
of the year.
	   Love was trying to become the first player to win back-to-back
at the PGA since Denny Shute in 1937. But his chances were drowned
in the water on No. 5 with a double bogey, and three late birdies
only got him back to par.
	   Love was at 277, along with Billy Mayfair.
	   Woods will have to wait until next year to squeeze another major
out of his awesome talent. Starting five strokes back, Woods made
up one stroke before making bogey on the three of the last four
holes on the front side to take himself out of the picture.
	   Woods, who opened with a 66, failed to break par the rest of the
week and played the par 5s only 1 under. He shot a 71 on Sunday and
finished in a tie for 10th at 279.

Balloonist Steve Fossett found in South Pacific

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Balloonist and millionaire adventurer Steve
Fossett was found Monday in the South Pacific, eight hours after
his attempt to fly around the world ended when his balloon went
down in the shark-infested waters.
	   ``We've been sweating bullets ... so we're feeling pretty
good,'' rescue coordinator Joe Ritchie said.
	   Fossett was found alive after ditching in the Coral Sea off
Queensland state, an Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman
said.
	   He was sighted at 8:10 a.m. Monday Australian time (2210 GMT
Sunday) by a French patrol aircraft that dropped a raft and Fossett
climbed inside, the spokesman said.
	   The French aircraft was to continue to circle Fossett until an
Australian transport plane arrived. The spokesman said there was no
sign of the balloon's capsule, which was believed to have sunk. The
Australian plane was to drop emergency supplies to Fossett and
remain with him until a ship arrived, the spokesman said.
	   Fossett had been two-thirds of the way through his effort. The
balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian coast
heading toward its final destination of Argentina, South America,
when contact was lost, according to Alan Blount, director of
mission control at Washington University in St. Louis.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   About five hours before the locator sounded, meteorologist Bob
Rice had cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong
thunderstorms and they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Australian and French officials had sent rescue planes to the
spot to drop survival gear _ a raft, water, first-aid supplies.
Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the capsule
of the balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   At the mission control office, a dozen crew members sat around a
conference table, working phones, scanning maps and checking
computers in an effort to find Fossett. A map on the wall tracked
his trip, showing how far he'd gone _ a record 15,200 miles (24,500
kilometers).
	   It also showed how far he had to go _ a massive stretch of the
Pacific Ocean between Australia and Argentina, the site of his Aug.
7 launch. Fossett had at least another five days of travel before
he was expected to reach South America.
	   It was the Chicago man's fourth attempt to fly around the world.
He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and raced in the
Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.

Half-full Monty at PGA Championship

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie wasn't in a sharing
mood Sunday after finishing the PGA Championship with rounds of 77
and 74.
	   The Scot was asked if he had any thoughts about the
disappointing finish that left him 17 strokes behind winner Vijay
Singh at 8-over 288.
	   ``Lots of them. But they're all for me,'' said Montgomerie, who
opened with rounds of 70 and 67 on the difficult Sahalee course.
	   ``It's very disappointing. It doesn't matter what the course is
like if you're not playing well. If that happens, I can't be one of
your favorites.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WOOZY WOOSIE: &LR;  Ian Woosnam is tired of seeing Fred Couples on
the golf course.
	   On Sunday, the Ryder Cup rivals were paired together in the last
round of the PGA Championship. Again, Couples triumphed.
	   Couples shot a 2-under 68, while Woosnam came in with a 72 in a
matchup of two players who were matched against each other in
singles in the last three Ryder Cups.
	   After they halved in 1993 and 1995, Couples won 8 and 7 in 1997.
	   ``I brought out the best in him again today,'' Woosnam said.
``When is he going to bring out the best in me?''
	   In 1991, Woosnam won the Masters. The following year, he put the
green jacket on Couples.
	   Couples was smiling after his 67-68 finish in his return to the
Seattle area.
	   ``I've played with Ian a bunch,'' he said. ``He's got a great
game. He's easy to play with.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIME FLIES: &LR;  With a birthday coming up, Jeff Sluman knows his
time is running out.
	   The 1988 PGA Champion was asked Sunday if he'd like to come back
to Sahalee for another major.
	   ``I'm closing in on 41 so I need to come back soon,'' Sluman
quipped.
	   All kidding aside, Sluman would like to be a factor on the PGA
Tour for another four or five years.
	   ``I hope so,'' he said with a grin. ``But we'll find out.''
	   Sluman, who will be 41 on Sept. 11, ended up with a 1-under 69
for a 3-over 283 total in his 13th PGA Championship. He won the
Tucson Chrysler Classic last year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; RELUCTANT LEHMAN: &LR;  Tom Lehman and a number of players left
Sahalee for Pebble Beach, California, for Monday's final round of
the suspended Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
	   ``The best thing to say would have been, `I'm sorry. Mother
Nature won. Let's go home,''' Lehman said.
	   The final two rounds at Pebble Beach were rained out in February
and reduced to one round.
	   Lehman is playing with a separated shoulder suffered while
showing off for his kids by doing a handstand just before the
British Open. He'll start Monday's round in second place, one shot
behind Tom Watson and Tim Herron.
	   At Sahalee, in his first tournament since missing the cut in the
British Open, Lehman had a 4-over 284 total.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEST BUDS: &LR;  On the 18th hole, Brad Faxon was quick to come to
the aid of his buddy, Billy Andrade.
	   Andrade's tee shot went into the rough and landed near a dozen
TV cables three feet inside the rope. Faxon and Andrade lifted the
cables out of the way with the help of a tournament volunteer.
	   ``He's like a big brother for me,'' Andrade said of Faxon. ``We
grew up in the same county playing the same sport and it's not a
very big place. He was the guy I always looked up to.''
	   Said Faxon: ``I play with Billy every chance I get. We practiced
together Wednesday. It's really fun to be around him.''
	   Faxon wound up at even-par 280 after shooting a 2-under 68.
Andrade, a late-tournament addition after Steve Jones withdrew
following the death of a close friend, finished with a 75 for a 288
total.

	   Match play ended at the PGA Championship in 1957, but Stricker
and Singh resurrected it on a final day that took as many turns as
the tree-lined fairways of Sahalee.
	   They were tied at 7 under and had a four-stroke lead to start
the day. Both had said they couldn't worry about the other in case
someone emerged from back in the pack. Eight of the previous 12 PGA
champions had all rallied from off the lead in the final round.
	   But it was clear early on it was a two-man race.
	   Stricker hooked his 3-wood into the trees on No. 2, a 507-yard
(463- meter) par 5 guarded by water in front. He was 10 yards (3
meters) past Singh, who was in the fairway with a 3-wood in his
hand, 263 yards (240 meters) from the pin.
	   ``Are you going to hit?'' Stricker asked.
	   ``Still thinking,'' Singh replied.
	   Stricker, trying to punch into the fairway with tree limbs
forming a tunnel only 6 feet (2 meters) high, caught the trees and
found more trouble. Singh promptly put the 3-wood in the bag and
laid up.
	   Still, the second hole was one of several that kept Stricker
going. His third shot back into a fairway that sloped away from him
rolled to the thick rough, but he went for the green from 175 yards
(160 meters) and barely cleared the water, taking a two-putt bogey.
	   Stricker came back with two birdies to take the lead. Singh
caught him with a 6-foot (2-meter) birdie putt on No. 5, then
surged ahead when Stricker again went in the trees and couldn't
save par on the 480-yard (439-meter), par-4 sixth.
	   Singh led by two going into the back nine, but more heroics from
Stricker kept it only at that. The 31-year-old from Wisconsin
pulled his tee shot into the water on the par-3 ninth, but his
third shot after a drop spun back 4 inches (10 centimeters) from
the cup for bogey.
	   From there, the race was on.
	   The last two majors have taken a peculiar twist _ Lee Janzen's
ball that somehow dropped from the tree on the fifth hole at the
U.S. Open, Mark O'Meara's ball at Royal Birkdale that a spectator
found and then picked up.
	   For Singh, it was a tree _ what else? _ on the 11th hole, where
the green is guarded by two huge trees that serve as goal posts.
	   His shoulders slumped when his second shot headed for the right,
but the ball bounced around and kicked out onto the front of the
green, 20 feet away for a two-putt birdie.
	   But Stricker wouldn't go away. He hit driver from the fairway
that shot into the trees, only his ball stayed well short. He
played a low, delicate bump under the trees to 6 feet (2 meters)
and made the birdie to stay one back.
	   Singh gave up a stroke when he missed a 4-foot (1.2-meters) par
putt on the next hole, but refused to buckle under the Sunday
pressure of a major.
	   He saved par from the bunker at No. 13, and played a hard hook
out of the trees on No. 14 onto the green for a two-putt par. And
when Stricker stuck his approach within 3 feet (1 meter) for birdie
on No. 15, Singh answered with a shot within 6 feet (2 meters),
also making the birdie.
	   Stricker, who recovered from a disastrous 1997 season when he
struggled through equipment changes, couldn't reach down and make
the putt on No. 17 that would have kept him within one shot of the
lead.
	   Singh, who won for the sixth time in America and 24th time
around the globe, collecting dlrs 540,000, ended a steak of five
straight majors won by American players and kept them from sweeping
the majors for the first time since 1982.

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The long, lonely hours on the
practice range were merely a dress rehearsal for Vijay Singh. He
was on center stage Sunday at Sahalee and turned in a star
performance.
	   With a lucky bounce out of the trees, a spectacular recovery
from the woods and nerves of steel down the stretch in a steady
rain, Singh won the PGA Championship with a 2-under 68.
	   The 35-year-old from Fiji two-putted for par on the 18th _ his
fourth par on the toughest hole at Sahalee Country Club _ to finish
at 9-under 271 for a two-stroke victory over Steve Stricker.
	   It was the 10th time in 11 years that a player won his first
major championship at the PGA.
	   For Singh _ a Hindu name that means ``Victory'' _ it ended years
of grinding away for long hours in search of a game that would give
him one of golf's ultimate prizes.
	   He would practice on the far end of the driving range where he
wouldn't be disturbed. He would rearrange the furniture in hotel
rooms to give him room to practice at night.
	   It all paid off Sunday in what amounted to match play against
Stricker, two men in search of their first major championship, both
playing well enough to put a worthy collection of challengers at a
distance.
	   Singh finally got some breathing room when he saved par from the
bunker on No. 17 from about 18 feet (5.5 meters). Stricker couldn't
match him, blasting out of the same bunker to 15 feet (3 meters),
but grazing the putt past the left side of the hole to put
Stricker, of the United States, two strokes back.
	   All that stood between Singh and the Wanamaker Trophy was an
accurate drive on the 475-yard (145-meter) finishing hole, and he
split the middle.
	   Stricker closed with a 70 for 273. Steve Elkington, the 1995
champion held back all year by health problems, shot 67 and
finished third at 274.
	   Mark O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan
in 1953 to win three majors in one season, was five strokes back in
a tie for fourth after a string of three bogies on the sixth,
seventh and eighth holes offset an early charge that pulled him
within two strokes of the lead.
	   Soft but steady rain fell throughout the morning, making it
easier to attack the flags. But those who made a charge either
started too far behind or made their move too late.
	   Elkington was the only one who got seriously close.
	   Just like in 1995, when his 64 was the lowest closing round ever
by a PGA champion, Elkington stormed down the stretch and got to 7
under with a birdie on the par-3 17th.
	   But his drive found the right rough on the 18th and he took
bogey.
	   Nick Price, trying to join Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen as a
three-time PGA champion, tied the course record with a bogey-free
65. He was 5 under for day after an eagle on No. 11, but could do
no better than par over the last seven holes and finished five back
at 276, along with O'Meara and Frank Lickliter.
	   O'Meara, Davis Love III and Tiger Woods all had something to
prove, and all of them had their chances.
	   O'Meara, impervious to the pressure of chasing Hogan, raised
hopes once again with an eagle on the par-5 second hole and a
birdie on No. 5, the roars echoing through the forest of firs at
Sahalee.
	   But he missed the next three greens and all three of the short
par-saving putts to fall back to 2 under, well out of the hunt.
Still, his tie for fourth was the best finish of the nine previous
players who came to the PGA with a chance to win their third major

finished in a tie for 10th at 279.

Dominican Congress opens with political split

largest party has lost its majority. No pickup. New to some
points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Dominican
Republic's Congress opened its session Sunday, and the majority
party immediately split over a leadership dispute.
	   Ten members of the liberal Dominican Revolutionary Party
announced they were forming an opposition faction in the lower
House of Deputies. They split because the party had chosen Winston
Arnaud to preside over the chamber instead of the incumbent leader,
Rafael Peguero Mendez.
	   The party's share of seats fell from 83 to 73, causing it to
lose its majority in the 149-member house.
	   Also Sunday, the centrist Dominican Liberation Party of
President Leonel Fernandez and the conservative Social Christian
Reformist Party of former President Joaquin Balaguer announced a
limited alliance.
	   Together they helped re-elect Peguero to the presidency of the
House of Deputies. Peguero beat Arnaud by three votes.
	   Revolutionary Party lawmakers left the House chamber in protest
and called an emergency meeting of the party's officers.
	   Their supporters protested the split by burning tires near the
Congressional Palace. The demonstrators accused Fernandez of
``snatching away'' the presidency of the House.
	   Riot police extinguished the tires while fending off bottles
thrown by demonstrators.
	   The political jockeying signaled hope for the president, who has
been frustrated in his attempts to pass his free-market reforms.
The Reformist Party had supported Fernandez's candidacy in the 1996
elections, but the relationship had soured after his victory.
	   Ramon Alburquerque of the Revolutionary Party was elected
president of the Senate.

	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ The AT-and-T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, suspended in January by bad weather, will resume
Monday with Tom Watson and Tim Herron tied for the lead.
	   The tournament was plagued by torrential rain and wind strong
enough to snap treetops when it began in late January on the Pebble
Beach, Poppy Hills and Spyglass Hill courses.
	   Players managed to squeeze in two soggy rounds Thursday through
Saturday, and organizers reduced the event to 54 holes. But heavy
rains wiped out play 1 1-2 hours after tee-off on Sunday, and again
on Monday when officials tried to extend it by a day.
	   The third round was reset for March 2, then rescheduled for this
Monday _ the day after the PGA Championship ends at the Sahalee
Country Club near Seattle.
	   Of the 168 pros who started the tournament, 135 are expected to
return to Pebble Beach for the final round.
	   The AT-and-T tournament chartered a plane to take players from
Seattle to Monterey on Sunday night. Those continuing to the next
tour stop, the International in Denver, will get another chartered
flight on Monday night.
	   Watson, at 10-under 134, won the Pebble Beach tournament in 1977
and 1978. If he wins this year, the two-decade separation between
victories would be a tourney record.
	   ``I have a chance to win a golf tournament, albeit a little
late,'' Watson said of the delayed finish.
	   Among those not returning are Tiger Woods, who finished the
second round 14 strokes off the lead, and Jack Nicklaus.
	   PGA Tour officials said it's the first time a portion of a
tournament has been played, then completed months later. But they
said that's better than the alternative.
	   ``Two years ago, it was completely rained out,'' PGA Tour media
official James Cramer said of the 1996 Pebble Beach event, which
was canceled because of rain. ``The last thing anybody wanted was
for that to happen again.''
	   The tournament was washed out after two rounds in 1996, making
it the first PGA Tour event that could not be completed since 1949.
	   There have been other tournaments delayed for months by the
weather. In 1991, the Independent Insurance Agent Open in Texas was
wiped out in early April and rescheduled for late October.
	   But this year's Pebble Beach tournament is different in that it
was halfway completed when it had to be halted for six months.
	   Monday's round will begin at 1600 GMT and is expected to be
completed four hours later, when the Pebble Beach and Poppy Hills
courses will be turned back to recreational golfers _ some of whom
made reservations years in advance.
	   Spyglass Hill will host the Northern California amateur
championship, the first round of which will begin as soon as the
pros are done.
	   When play was interrupted six months ago, water had collected on
the greens and shots were disappearing into the muck. Waves from
the Pacific Ocean were crashing onto the 18th fairway of the Pebble
Beach course.
	   Because of the lousy weather, golfers were allowed to pick up
their ball, clean it and place it within a club's length of where
it landed.
	   The lift, clean and place rule will be in force again on Monday,
but not due to the weather this time. The tourney's conclusion is
coming one day after the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, a
vintage car show, wraps up.
	   ``By midnight the night before, they're going to get all these
cars off the 18th fairway,'' tournament spokeswoman Cathy Scherzer
said. ``Because we have the lift, clean and place rule in place,
we're not going to have a problem with tire marks on the
fairways.''

Park wins U.S. Women's Amateur

<TEXT>
	   ANN ARBOR, Michigan (AP) _ Grace Park won the 94th U.S. Women's
Amateur Championship on Sunday, routing U.S. Women's Open runner-up
Jenny Chuasiriporn 7 and 6 in the 36-hole championship match.
	   ``First of all, it feels awesome,'' said Park, a sophomore at
Arizona State. ``I'm happy. I think everybody knows I'm happy. I've
been working so hard the last couple of years, and this year it
seems to have paid off.''
	   Park, 19, who moved to Phoenix from South Korea seven years ago
to develop her game, became the first player since Patty Berg in
1938 to sweep the United States' major amateur women's tournaments.
Park also won the Women's Western Amateur and the Trans-National
championship.
	   Chuasiriporn settled for second place for the second time in a
major United States Golf Association tournament. Last month, she
lost to another South Korean, LPGA star Se Ri Pak, on the 20th hole
of a playoff in the U.S. Women's Open.
	   ``I have a pair of these now,'' Chuasiriporn said as she
accepted the runner-up medal.
	   Park consistently drove the ball at least 250 yards (meters) and
up to 300 all week on the Barton Hills Country Club course.
	   ``That's an advantage to have, but what it came down to winning
the championship was my putting,'' Park said.
	   Park won the first three holes, with a birdie on No. 2 and pars
on Nos. 1 and 3. She took a 4-up lead with a par on the par-5
ninth.
	   The lead ballooned to six when Park birdied the long par-3 16th.
She gave one back at 18, when she couldn't get up and down from a
greenside bunker and conceded Chuasiriporn's birdie.
	   Park was 6-up at the turn in the second 18, and made it seven
with a par on No. 10. The players halved the next two holes to end
the match.
	   ``I made a lot of pars and a few birdies,'' Park said. ``I was
just trying to be consistent.''

 &UR; Eds: Items include Israeli television commercial, Jay Leno, Bill
Cosby, and Pete Townshend. Some items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A TV commercial for a new Israeli
laundry detergent claims that the product is so good it can get
stains out of anything, including the most famous dress in
Washington.
	   In the ad for Biomet 2000, two secret agents in dark blue suits
are seen breaking-in to the home of one ``Monica Levinsky,''
finding a stained white dress, and on orders from the highest
authority, they pull out the laundry detergent and wash away the
evidence.
	   Reporting the mission's success back to their boss, one agent
whispers into a walkie-talkie: ``It's whiter than white.'' But it
seems the agents have bungled the operation.
	   ``White? You were sent to take care of the blue dress!'' an
angry boss yells back.
	   The commercial was previewed on a news magazine show Sunday. The
detergent campaign is scheduled to air in Israel on Monday, when
President Bill Clinton goes before a grand jury to answer questions
regarding a relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   Mati Weinberg, a partner in the ad agency that produced the
commercial said shots of the president and his name had been
omitted. As for the woman, her last name is spelled on a sign
outside the house as Levinsky, rather than Lewinsky.
	   Weinberg said he thought consumers would be drawn to a product
with ``a connection to a good international story.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) _ U.S. entertainer Bill Cosby invoked
the name of his slain son, Ennis, to encourage youth workers.
	   Stumping for the Big Brothers-Big Sisters association, which
pairs disadvantaged youth with volunteer mentors, Cosby said
children get involved in classwork and after-school programs thanks
to adults who give their time.
	   ``I don't know how many of you really understand that these
children are doing something because they worked with an adult.
They believed in an adult,'' Cosby said Saturday.
	   As an example, Cosby remembered the selflessness of his son.
	   ``Ennis Cosby wanted to become a teacher, with a doctorate in
education. He wanted to go into the trenches,'' Cosby said.
	   Ennis Cosby's killer, Mikail Markhasev, was sentenced Tuesday in
California to life in prison without possibility of parole. Ennis
Cosby was shot in January 1997 while changing a flat tire in Los
Angeles.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BETHEL, New York (AP) _ The Who guitarist Pete Townshend
returned to Woodstock for its 29th anniversary show even though he
had a ``rotten time'' at the original 1969 rock music festival.
	   ``What brought me back is a sense of looking at the reality of
the whole thing and how it related to my career as an artist,''
Townshend said Saturday before taking the stage. ``It was the most
important concert (the Who) ever played.''
	   Up to that point, Townshend said, the Who was more of a
``singles band.'' The 1969 release of the album ``Tommy'' and the
exposure from Woodstock sparked U.S. interest.
	   ``Tommy'' sold more than 10 million copies.
	   ``What happened at (the original) Woodstock is that people
remembered `Tommy' and people remembered the Who,'' Townshend said.
	   Part of the reason Townshend didn't enjoy the original concert
was because he wasn't doing drugs at that point in his life and
they were being abused all around him. So, ``I just sneered at
everything.''
	   Townshend, appearing solo at the weekend anniversary show, said
he doesn't see much a future for the Who anymore.
	   ``It hasn't really existed for me since 1982,'' he said.
``Creatively, it's dead, dead, dead. I don't see anything there at
all.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NOVI, Michigan (AP) _ A former U.S. government intern is suing
Jay Leno over a gag on ``The Tonight Show'' based on a recruitment
brochure bearing her picture with President Bill Clinton and
boasting opportunities for ``hands-on experience.''
	   Carrie Photsios seeks more than dlrs 75,000 from Leno and three
other defendants, including the Detroit television station that
aired the show, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.
	   A photo used in an Albion College recruitment brochure shows Ms.
Photsios standing next to Clinton during her internship at the
Justice Department in Washington. Leno read the brochure mentioning
opportunities for ``hands-on experience'' on his show Feb. 9.
	   Ms. Photsios, 24, contends she suffered ``embarrassment,
humiliation and indignity.'' The 1996 Albion College honors
graduate endured numerous phone calls and jokes about the Leno
joke, said her attorney, Bill Colovos.
	   The Free Press had no reaction from Leno, but Michigan Press
Association attorney Dawn Phillips Hertz said since Leno's comments
clearly were in jest, the lawsuit ``is going nowhere.''
	   Colovos said the woman's right to privacy overrides Leno's First
Amendment rights. ``Carrie didn't ask for this,'' he said. ``She is
entitled to her privacy, the right to be let alone.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Returning to the capital Sunday from
meetings aimed at firming up his shaky regime, President Laurent
Kabila stepped up his attacks on Western governments and the press,
alleging a foreign plot to end his short rule. Kabila's comments
came as his army reportedly lost new ground to advancing rebels in
western Congo. Leaders of the rebel movement _ a coalition of Tutsi
fighters, Rwandan soldiers and disgruntled members of Kabila's army
_ said they had captured the western Congo river port town of
Matadi and were fighting to take up positions closer to Kinshasa.
(CONGO)
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined that terrorism will
not shatter Northern Ireland's fragile peace accord, Protestants
and Catholics united in uncomprehending grief Sunday over the car
bomb slaughter of 28 people. With several residents still missing
after the blast in Omagh, a religiously mixed town 70 miles (110
kilometers) west of Belfast, soldiers used heat-detecting equipment
Sunday to determine whether more bodies lay hidden in collapsed
buildings in ravaged Market Street. In Belfast, Irish Prime Minster
Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged to do
everything within their power to hunt down the bombers and keep the
peace process moving forward. Saturday's blast came less than three
months after voters in both parts of Ireland overwhelmingly
approved plans for a new Northern Ireland government with power
shared between its majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police have captured the village
of Junik, the main stronghold of ethnic Albanians fighting for
independence. Junik, near the border with Albania, was the
organizational, logistical and weapons distribution center for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of Kosovo
from Yugoslavia. Reporters visiting Junik on Sunday found the
village deserted except for about 15 people who were too old to
flee. Some houses were still smoldering, but most of the village
was intact. Most civilians fled the village ahead of the fighting.
The fall of Junik appears to be the finale of the Serb offensive to
quash the KLA. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Balloonist and millionaire adventurer
Steve Fossett was rescued early Monday off the Australian coast,
eight hours after his attempt to fly around the world ended when
his balloon went down in the shark-infested waters. The American
was found alive after ditching in the Coral Sea off Queensland
state, an Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman said.
Fossett was sighted at 8:10 a.m. by a French patrol aircraft that
dropped a lifeboat and Fossett climbed inside, the spokesman said.
He had flown a record 15,200 miles (24,460 kms), two-thirds of the
way of his planned journey. Fossett, who began his journey from
Argentina on Aug. 7, had at least another five days of travel
before he was expected to return to South America. (BALLOON QUEST)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In another apparent setback for
Colombia's besieged army, leftist rebels claimed to have killed
dozens of soldiers in a three-day battle in northwestern Colombia
that continued to rage on Sunday. The army also reported suffering
casualties in the fighting. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, speaking on the private Radionet network, said
the group had killed 53 soldiers, wounded 30 and taken 20 more
prisoner in the fighting in the municipality of Rio Sucio, in Choco
state, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Bogota. The
army said ``numerous'' soldiers and rebels had been killed and 19
soldiers wounded. The fighting began on Friday when some 600
guerrillas attacked soldiers from three counterinsurgency
battalions. (COLOMBIA-COMBAT)

De Swardt wins BostonCup singles

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Unseeded Mariaan de Swardt
rallied from a 5-1 third-set deficit Sunday to defeat
seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of Austria 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 to win
the BostonCup.
	   De Swardt, of South Africa, earned dlrs 27,000 and her first
championship on the WTA tour. She had defeated second-seeded Anke
Huber of Germany and third-seeded Lisa Raymond of the United States
earlier in the tournament.
	   ``I felt good coming into the final and I was confident,'' she
said. ``When I served I went for it.''
	   Schett took the opening set 6-3 and appeared poised to win when
she broke de Swardt in the seventh game of the second set. However,
de Swardt immediately broke back and with an improved backhand took
the second set in the tiebreaker.
	   But Schett surged out to a 5-1 lead in the last set and served
for the match. Then de Swardt suddenly rallied.
	   ``I thought she became tentative,'' de Swardt said of Schett.
``I knew it was hard, but I decided I would make her earn it. She
made some unforced errors and went for shots she hadn't tried
earlier in the match.''
	   Schett began to unravel.
	   She lost the service game for 5-2 and de Swardt held serve for
5-3. De Swardt broke Schett for 5-4 and fought off a match point in
the 10th game to even the match at 5-5.
	   ``I was tired, and with her powerful serve I knew I was in
trouble,'' Schett said.
	   De Swardt again broke Schett in the eleventh game and smashed
three aces in the deciding game to take the victory.
	   In the doubles match championship, Rennae Stubbs of Australia
teamed up with Raymond to defeat Mary Joe Fernandez of the United
States and de Swardt 6-4, 6-4.

Mass of pre-election political broadcasts in Brazil is turn-off,
</HEADLINE>
says survey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Just over half the electorate will
watch televised political advertisements by political candidates, a
published survey said Sunday. The apparent lack of interest could
help President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in his bid for
re-election.
	   Beginning Tuesday, television viewers will be bombarded with
more than two hours a day of free transmissions by candidates. The
commercials will run for six weeks, ending just before the Oct. 4
elections.
	   Market researchers Ibope found 42 per cent switch off or change
to a cable channel to escape the broadcasts, shown simultaneously
on all other stations. Fifty-two per cent usually continue
watching, but just 22 per cent of these tend to persevere to the
end.
	   Six percent did not have an opinion. The survey was published in
the O Globo newspaper.
	   The disinterest with the pre-election television slots may be
spell bad news for socialist Luiz Inacio da Silva, main rival of
center-left president Cardoso.
	   After a jump in support in June, recent polls show his
popularity appears to be waning because of a so far low-key
campaign.
	   Da Silva is to highlight hunger and joblessness in northeast
Brazil, caused by dry weather and what he charges is a lack of
government support, according to his campaign team.
	   Cardoso will use his first slot on Tuesday to reiterate his
resolve to fight the key election issue of unemployment, according
to the newspaper Folha De Sao Paulo
	   Cardoso will be one of the presidential and federal deputy
candidates entitled to screen time during a regular 50 minute
lunchtime and evening slot three days a week.
	   Governors, state deputy and senator candidates also seeking
election will also be running ads during the same period on three
other days of the week. Sunday is the only day of the rest.
	   The length of air time for each candidate, who must receive
permission to run from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, depends on
their position they stand for and the number of seats their party
has at that level of government.
	   The survey questioned 2,000 people across Brazil during the
first week of August. No margin for error was given.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Stern John came off the bench to score
three second-half goals in a 11-minute span, leading the Columbus
Crew over the Kansas City Wizards 5-3 Sunday.
	   John, a rookie forward, scored in the 71st, 79th and 81st
minutes, his third three-goal game of the season. His second goal
gave the Crew (11-12) a 4-3 lead.
	   Teammate Jeff Cunningham got the Crew's first goal in the sixth
minute. Columbus's other score came on an own goal by Sean Bowers.
	   Preki Radosavljevic scored in the 35th and 52nd minutes for
Kansas City (10-14), and Paul Rideout tied it at 3 in the 77th.
	   The Crew handed out 10,000 mini-soccer balls to fans before the
game. Play was disrupted, but not stopped, when the fans threw the
balls onto the field to celebrate the Crew's first goal and to
object to officials' calls.

Booker-Tate says it will manage Guyana Sugar for three more years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ British agricultural firm Booker-Tate
Ltd. said it has won a contract to continue managing Guyana's sugar
industry for another three years.
	   Details of the deal were not immediately available, and
government representatives could not be reached Sunday for comment.
	   Booker-Tate has managed the state-owned Guyana Sugar Corp. since
1990 under a restructuring program supervised by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
	   With average annual production levels of 255,000 tons, (230,000
metric tons), Guyana Sugar is the largest producer in the 15-nation
Caribbean Community.
	   The firm said it hopes to double production to 500,000 by
building new factories and putting more land under cultivation to
take advantage of a growing brown sugar market.
	   The demand for brown sugar has grown in part because of
increased sales of U.S. soft drinks to India and China, the company
said in a statement Sunday.
	   Caribbean Community members together produce about 850,000 tons
of sugar annually.

Male substance affects women's mood without being detected, study
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Breathing a substance related to
testosterone helped women maintain their mood level, even though
they couldn't smell it, new studies show.
	   It's the best evidence yet that undetected olfactory signals can
affect how people feel, said researcher Martha McClintock, a
psychologist at the University of Chicago.
	   She described studies led by her student Suma Jacob in a lecture
Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
	   The research focused on androstadienone (pronounced
``an-DROS-ta-DIE-en-own''), which a man's body produces by breaking
down testosterone. It's not clear yet whether men naturally give
this substance off into the air, where it could affect women,
McClintock said in an interview.
	   Two studies with a total of 41 women produced essentially
identical results. On two occasions, Jacob wiped a liquid on each
woman's upper lip. Each participant then filled out questionnaires
to track her mood over the next few hours. On one occasion, the
liquid contained the testosterone-related substance, and the other
time it didn't. Women didn't know which time they were exposed.
	   When women weren't exposed to androstadienone, their mood tended
to decline over the next two hours as the excitement of
participating in the experiment wore off and they got irritated
filling out questionnaires. But when they were exposed, this
decline in mood was largely blocked, McClintock said.
	   Another experiment found that a substance from women, a
breakdown product of estrogen, had similar effects, she said after
her lecture.
	   J. Bruce Overmier of the University of Minnesota called the
results with the male substance intriguing, and said it made sense
in a social animal like people. He also said the work needs
followup study.

	   MOMBO, Angola (AP) _ Palm fronds rustle in the breeze and a bird
trills, the only sounds in this Angolan hamlet after residents fled
during combat between UNITA rebels and government troops.
	   Two days after the firefight that killed two government
soldiers, spent bullet cartridges and a live grenade litter the
ground. The adobe walls of the huts are singed, their thatched
roofs charred. Scattered possessions _ a cooking pot, a chipped
enamel wash basin _ are evidence of hasty departures.
	   The clash in northeast Angola's Lunda Sul province is part of a
low-level bush war that ignited in June after UNITA and the
government accused each other of violating a 1994 U.N.-brokered
peace agreement.
	   It threatens to escalate into all-out war, like the conflict
before it that killed a half-million people and left the country in
ruins.
	   Since June, hundreds of people have died in ambushes and
massacres. U.N. helicopters have been shot at. Relief workers have
abandoned half the country's 18 provinces, some fleeing under fire.
	   Both sides are conscripting youths into their forces, witnesses
and human rights workers say.
	   Land mines are again being laid in a country that has more in
its soil _ estimates range from 9 million to 20 million _ than any
country except Afghanistan.
	   Prospects for reversing the downward spiral are growing slimmer.
	   The number of U.N. peacekeepers has shrunk from 7,000 in 1995 to
700. Their mandate expires Sept. 15, and patience is wearing thin.
The United Nations is unlikely to step in again with a massive
operation if war erupts.
	   ``Unless the two sides want to help themselves, we can't do
anything. We are not peace enforcers,'' said Indian Col. K.T.
Parnaik, chief of staff of the U.N. military observer mission.
	   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who is officially the opposition
leader but has never taken up his post in the capital, is said to
be bent on taking control of the government. The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday formally held UNITA responsible for the recent
surge in fighting.
	   In the crumbling seaside capital of Luanda, International Red
Cross delegate Francois de la Roche points at areas on a map of
Angola where, until recently, aid workers were helping repatriate
refugees, tend to the sick and run education programs. Now many
regions of Angola, a country twice the size of Texas, are areas to
which they do not travel.
	   ``Here my ex-pats no longer visit because of ambushes,'' de la
Roche said, pointing to the southwest. Then jabbing at another
spot: ``Here, there's been a lot of re-mining.''
	   ``Here,'' now pointing to central Angola, ``a clinic was
attacked and all the medicine was taken. They even took the window
panes.''
	   Just when many Angolans were beginning to return home after
spending years in refugee camps, the surge in fighting has halted
that and created 75,000 new refugees.
	   Almirante Nunga, his wife and six children abandoned their
village of Muriege, 60 miles east of the provincial capital of
Saurimo in Lunda Sul, in June when UNITA forces moved in, firing
into the air.
	   Nunga, speaking in front of his straw hut in a refugee camp
outside Saurimo, said the village's 16 policemen ran.
	   ``They were pulling civilian clothes over their uniforms,''
Nunga said. ``I asked one why he wasn't staying to fight and he
told me, `I'm afraid, just like you.'''
	   Mirroring tactics used elsewhere, UNITA _ an acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ expelled
everyone from Muriege except UNITA supporters, refugees say.
	   The ruling party _ the Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, or MPLA _ is doing the same. In many regions UNITA ceded to
the government under the peace plan, the party persecuted local
UNITA political leaders, the United Nations has confirmed, causing
UNITA to suspend such handovers.
	   ``The government's objective is clear: They want to exterminate
UNITA, the only viable opposition party in this country,'' Franco
Marcolino Nhany, a senior UNITA official, declared during an
interview.
	   The government, for its part, accuses UNITA of stalling the
peace process and notes that it has failed to demobilize as the
agreement called for.
	   During the Cold War, Washington supported UNITA against the
then-Marxist MPLA, who had Cuban troops and Russian arms on its
side. The stalemated sides agreed to hold elections in 1992.
	   UNITA, which came in second, refused to accept the results and
the war resumed for two more years.

Fiji hails hero Singh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Vijay Singh's U.S. PGA victory gave island
nation Fiji its greatest moment in international sport and drew
thrilled reaction at home.
	   There was no local television coverage of the event in Fiji and
the sport's leading official here heard the final stages of Singh's
victory via a telephone call to the United States.
	   Sir Timoci Tuivaga, president of the Fiji Golf Club and the
country's Chief Justice, was called by an old friend, Mahendra
Singh, who was watching the coverage in the United States. Mahendra
held the telephone to the television so Sir Timoci could hear the
commentary and Vijay Singh's interview.
	   ``It's thrilling news,'' Sir Timoci said. ``This is the highest
international sports achievement ever by a Fiji Islander sportsman.
It's the biggest win of all for Fiji _ a wonderful thing.''
	   Singh started his involvement in golf as a caddie at the Nadi
Airport Golf Club. Club president Krishna Chetty also heard second
hand in a phone call from a friend as the tournament wound up
Monday morning Fiji time..
	   ``We are very proud he has finally won a major and we hope other
Fijian golfers will emulate him,'' Chetty said.
	   Vijay Singh's father, Mohan Singh, watched the final round from
his home in Te Aroha, New Zealand.
	   ``It was wonderful to see him win a major tournament,'' Mohan
Singh said. ``He has been hitting the ball good. He spoke to me a
few days ago and seemed confident. I wished him all the best and
told him to keep his head down and just keep hitting the ball, and
he's done it.''
	   Vijay Singh went into the final round at the Sahalee Country
Club with a share of the lead with American Steve Stricker and shot
a final round 68 to win by two shots.
	   Mohan Singh admitted he was ``very nervous'' as he watched the
final holes.
	   Mohan Singh moved to New Zealand during the 1980s after a long
career as an engineer at Nadi airport. He was once the captain of
the Nadi Airport Golf Club, he was often accompanied on the course
by his son.
	   ``When Vijay was 10, he started caddying for me, pulling my
trundler, and later he began hitting golf balls,'' Mohan Singh
said.
	   ``He was hitting the ball well on a tough course and I knew
someday he would be good golfer, but I never thought he would win a
major tournament in the United States.''
	   Fiji has 10 golf courses, with only three of an international
standard, to serve tourists and a population of 800,000. There are
about 2,000 registered golfers in Fiji including 19 professionals.
	   Prime Minister Siteveni Rabuka is an avid golf player and fan.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A French military plane dropped a life
raft to American millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett on Monday
after he the balloon he was trying to fly around the world crashed
into the sea, authorities said.
	   The French plane reached the site where the balloon went down
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) off
Australia's east coast, at 8.40 a.m. local time (2240 GMT Sunday),
said Lieutenant Commander Guilbaud of the French navy in Noumea,
New Caledonia.
	   An Australian Defense Forces spokesman said Fossett was inside a
life raft when he was found, but transferred into the one dropped
to him.
	   Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Robin Poke said
the French aircraft was to continue to circle Fossett until an
Australian transport plane arrived from Sydney.
	   He said there was no sign of the balloon's capsule, which was
believed to have sunk. The Australian plane was to drop emergency
supplies to Fossett and remain with him until a ship arrived.
	   The New Zealand Navy tanker Endeavor had been instructed to make
the rescue, and was due at the site at about midnight Monday, an
Australian Defense Forces spokesman said, on condition of
anonymity.
	   Fossett had been two-thirds of the way through his effort. The
balloon was 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the Australian coast
heading toward its final destination of Argentina, in South
America, when contact was lost, said Alan Blount, director of
mission control for the journey at Washington University in St.
Louis, Missouri.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   About five hours before the locator sounded, meteorologist Bob
Rice had cautioned Fossett that he was approaching strong
thunderstorms and they would be nearly impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   The Australian and French aircraft are carrying survival gear
including a raft, water and first-aid supplies. Fossett was
equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the capsule of the
balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   Fossett had a massive stretch of the Pacific Ocean between
Australia and Argentina to go and had at least another five days of
travel before he was expected to reach South America, from where he
took off on Aug. 7.
	   Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth attempt to fly
around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and
raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   Robin Poke of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the
Royal Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 left Sydney about 6 a.m.
local time (2000 GMT), a short time after a satellite distress
signal was received from the balloon.
	   A French navy plane took off about the same time from Noumea,
New Caledonia, he said.
	   It was not immediately clear why a new raft was dropped to
Fossett.
	   Before Fossett was spotted, Poke said rescuers understood the
capsule of the balloon was seaworthy and that Fossett had a life
raft, sufficient food and water.
	   Australian rescue authorities were praised internationally last
year after saving yachtsmen Tony Bullimore of Britain and Frenchman
Thierry Dubois after their boats capsized separately in a ferocious
storm during the French-organized Vendee Globe nonstop solo
around-the-world yacht race.
	   The men's boats capsized in January 1997, about 2,000 miles
(3,200 kilometers) southwest of Australia and only 1,000 miles
(1,600 kilometers) north of Antarctica.

Israel increases military spending for first time since 1992
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the past decade, Israeli governments put
off the generals and allowed the military budget to slowly erode.
After all, tensions in the Mideast were easing and peace with the
Arabs expanding.
	   Now, for the first time since the peace process began, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has authorized a hike in
defense spending _ one that totals 2 billion Israeli shekels (dlrs
543 million), or about 6.5 percent over the current budget.
	   In seeking the increase, Netanyahu pointed to Iran's successful
test firing in July of the Shahab 3 missile, which can reach
Israel, and its efforts to build a nuclear weapon. He also fears a
lifting of United Nations sanctions on Iraq, which fired Scud
missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``It's in response to the latest developments in Iraq and Iran.
We have the means; we have the technology; we have the brain power;
we have the soldiers to give a proper defense against this,''
Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Critics, however, blame Netanyahu's hard-line government for a
change in atmosphere in the region and the rising possibility of
conflict with Arab neighbors.
	   ``For the first time in four years, there is now intelligence
information that a war is not impossible,'' Yossi Beilin, a leading
figure in the opposition Labor Party and an architect of the
Israel-PLO agreements.
	   ``Nothing could be more symbolic than this of the missed
opportunity under the Netanyahu government.''
	   Such critics argue that if Israel had pursued the peace policies
of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, relations with the Arab
world at large would now be warming.
	   Instead, experts say Israeli planners are now factoring in a
possible conflict with neighboring Egypt, which is significantly
expanding its military capabilities even though it has no obvious
enemies. With American aid, Egypt has replaced many of its Soviet
weapons systems with U.S. ones _ including the M1A1 Abrams tank.
	   Syria, according to Israeli officials, is developing its
chemical warfare capabilities and successfully tested a Scud C _ a
ground-to-ground missile that could reach most of Israel.
	   Relations with the Palestinians are also at a low ebb. The
likelihood of major riots or armed clashes with the 35,000-man
Palestinian paramilitary force has sharpened after Yasser Arafat's
threat to defy Israel and declare statehood next May.
	   But others think it is unfair to suggest that Netanyahu is to
blame for the spending increase or for the gloomy political
outlook.
	   Mark Heller, editor of the annual military balance published by
the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University,
said funds were necessary for missile defense projects, involving
not only the joint U.S.-Israeli Arrow anti-missile missile but
satellites as well.
	   ``The speculation lately is about space-based systems, certainly
for intelligence purposes if not more,'' Heller said.
	   Efraim Inbar, director of the strategic studies center at
Bar-Ilan University, said costly upgrades can wait no longer. The
air force needs to upgrade its transport fleet, acquire a fleet of
Longbow attack helicopters and plan for a new generation of fighter
planes while the army needs to replenish ammunition stocks and
upgrade its pay scales to compete with the high-tech sector.
	   ``I would say that the excuse, the political excuse, is the
increasing missile threat from Iran. But the defense establishment
has been pushing for an increase for some time,'' Inbar said.
	   Israel's defense budget for next year is 33.6 billion shekels,
or dlrs 9 billion, compared to the current 31.6 billion shekel
budget, or dlrs 8.457 billion.
	   That compares to an inflation-adjusted dlrs 7.4 billion dollars
in 1992, when the peace process began with an international
conference in Madrid. The budget has reached its current levels
because of changes in the shekel's exchange rate.
	   Arab countries' military budgets have held steady, although
spending plans have been curtailed by economic problems in key
countries like Syria, where the budget was dlrs 3.3 billion in
1994, the last year available.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have taken control of
the rebel ethnic Albanian's main logistical and weapons
distribution center, amid reports of clashes in parts of western
Kosovo.
	   Serb police reported Sunday they controlled the village of
Junik, near the border with Albania, after a 20-day siege.
According to Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, there were no
civilian casualties, because they fled the town before the fighting
began.
	   A police statement carried by state-run Tanjug news agency said
four policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers died in the
operation. There were no immediate reports of causalities on the
Albanian side.
	   Reporters who visited Junik Sunday found the village deserted,
except for about 15 elderly people who were too old to flee. Some
houses were still smoldering, but most of the village remained
intact.
	   Filic said that by wiping out the rebel stronghold, ``the
territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all directions.'
But since fighting began five months ago, gains by government
forces have proven difficult to maintain and it remained possible
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army could still regroup.
	   In recent weeks, government forces have forced the KLA from
several other key towns. On Sunday, the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center claimed fighting continued in Logja. Government
forces reportedly used tanks and helicopters to attack the village,
along with eight others in the area near Kosovo's second city of
Pec.
	   The KLA is fighting Serb security forces for the independence of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's
2 million people. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Last week, the militant organization named Adem Demaci as the
leader of its political wing. Demaci refuses to work with his arch
rival, moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, who is favored by the West.
	   The Serb government in Belgrade has invited Rugova's negotiating
team to start peace talks as early as next week.
	   But Rugova had said earlier the government offensive must stop
before he would return to the negotiating table. Rugova favors
independence, but lacks the support of the KLA because he opposes
the use of violence.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Reggie Sanders singled, doubled, tripled and
scored four runs Sunday as the Cincinnati Reds took advantage of
the Montreal Expos' ragged play to get a 8-1 victory and a series
sweep.
	   Brett Tomko (11-8) had a pair of hits, scored twice and pitched
seven innings to reach a Reds milestone. He's the first Cincinnati
pitcher to win 11 games in each of his first two seasons since Art
Fowler in 1954-55.
	   Sanders tripled, was hit by a pitch from Carl Pavano (4-6),
doubled and singled in his four plate appearances in the first five
innings. He scored each time, matching his career high, and came up
short of the cycle when he flew out to the warning track in the
seventh.
	   Pavano gave up six hits, three walks and five runs _ four earned
_ in his shortest start since June 22.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Cardinals 1
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire remained stuck on 47 homers, and
didn't walk, going 2-for-5 with two singles and three strikeouts
Sunday in the Cardinals' loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   McGwire, 26-for-111 (.234) since the All-Star break with 10
homers and 19 RBIs, was tied for the home run lead Sunday when the
Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit his 47th.
	   Pirates starter Francisco Cordova (11-10) gave up a two-out
single to McGwire with none on the first, struck him out with two
on in the third, fanned him to start the fifth and gave up a
two-out single in the seventh _ McGwire's 5,000th career at-bat.
	   Matt Morris (3-3) allowed three runs and eight hits in eight
innings.
 &UR; Cubs 2, Astros 1, 11 innings
	   In Houston, Sammy Sosa hit his 47th home run, tying Mark McGwire
for the major league lead, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Houston
Astros on pinch-hitter Manny Alexander's RBI single in the 11th
inning.
	   Kerry Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston with a one-hitter
on May 6, allowed the one run and three hits in eight innings,
struck out 11 and walked two.
	   Matt Karchner (1-0) pitched two hitless innings for the win. Rod
Beck got three outs for his 36th save. Jay Powell (4-5) took the
loss.
 &UR; Phillies 8, Rockies 7
	   In Denver, Bobby Estalella hit his first career grand slam and
Bobby Abreu added a two-run shot as the Philadelphia Phillies held
on to beat Colorado.
	   Mark Portugal (7-3) pitched five innings and allowed two runs,
one earned, striking out four to earn the victory. Mark Leiter
pitched the ninth for his 22nd save.
	   Pinch-hitter Jeff Reed hit a grand slam for the Rockies.
	   Colorado starter Jamey Wright (7-11) lasted three innings and
gave up five hits and seven runs. He was trying to win three
straight starts for the first time in his career.
 &UR; Padres 4, Brewers 0
	   In San Diego, Kevin Brown pitched a one-hitter for his third
shutout this year and struck out 11 to match his career high as San
Diego beat Milwaukee in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   Jeromy Burnitz singled with two out in the seventh to break up
yet another attempt at the Padres' first-ever no-hitter.
	   Brown (15-4) was coming off a 3-2 loss to the Marlins on Monday,
which snapped his club-record 11-game winning streak.
	   Milwaukee left-hander Rafael Roque (0-1), who was called up from
Triple-A Louisville to make his second career start, took the loss.
 &UR; Giants 3, Marlins 2
	   In San Francisco, Orel Hershiser won for the first time in six
starts and Jeff Kent had two run-scoring doubles as San Francisco
beat Florida to complete a three-game sweep.
	   Hershiser (9-8) survived 10 hits and a walk, allowing two runs
in six innings with six strikeouts. He had been 0-1 with four
no-decisions since July 15.
	   Robb Nen got three outs for his 31st save.
	   Jesus Sanchez (6-7) left after 3 1-3 innings after he bruised a
finger while fouling off a pitch.

Singh another first-time major winner at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to ADD quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Vijay Singh, the hardest worker in
golf, got a major payoff for his years of grinding.
	   He'd follow a four-hour round with four hours of practice, often
on the far end of the driving range so he wouldn't be bothered.
He'd rearrange the furniture in his hotel room, clearing the way
just so he could practice even more.
	   All those years of relentless work culminated Sunday in golf's
ultimate reward _ winning a major, the PGA Championship.
	   With a lucky bounce out of the trees, a spectacular recovery
from the woods and nerves of steel down the stretch in a steady
rain, Singh won with a 2-under-par 68 on Sahalee Country Club.
	   ``I've practiced so hard for this,'' Singh said. ``It's a dream
come true. What I did out there was unbelievable.''
	   His hands slick more from nervousness than a steady rain, Singh
two-putted for par on the 18th to finish at 9-under 271 for a
two-stroke victory over Steve Stricker.
	   It was the 10th time in 11 years that a player won his first
major championship at the PGA. This one, fittingly, fell to a
player whose name is Hindu for ``Victory.''
	   His wife and 8-year-old son, Qass, were waiting for him behind
the 18th green. Singh waved to the crowd and pointed his putter in
their direction when the final putt fell.
	   ``Once I got the ball on the green, the feeling was ... `I'm the
winner. I'm the champion,''' Singh said. ``Every year, you see
somebody walk up 18 and you wonder if that's ever going to be you.
	   ``I never expected it to happen like this.''
	   The stage was Sahalee, the drama a duel with Stricker, two
players in search of their first major who played well enough to
put a worthy collection of challengers too far behind to catch up.
	   Singh built a two-stroke lead at the turn and never buckled,
even when Stricker closed within one stroke and was on the verge of
catching him.
	   Singh finally got some breathing room when he saved par from the
bunker on No. 17 from about 18 feet (5.5 meters) and Stricker
couldn't match him.
	   Stricker blasted out of the same bunker to 15 feet (4.5 meters),
but the par putt grazed past the left side of the hole.
	   ``I was expecting him to make it, too,'' Singh said. ``That was
a sigh of relief because I could play a little bit more aggressive
and I knew he needed a birdie to catch me if I made bogey.''
	   All that stood between Singh and the Wanamaker Trophy was an
accurate drive on the 475-yard (434-meter) finishing hole, and he
split the middle.
	   Stricker closed with a 70 for 273. Steve Elkington, the 1995
champion held back all year by health problems, shot 67 and
finished third at 274.
	   ``I put up a good fight,'' Stricker said, choking back tears.
``It just didn't happen.''
	   Mark O'Meara, trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan
in 1953 to win three majors in one season, got within two strokes
of the lead until three straight bogeys ended his hopes. He
finished in a tie for fourth.
	   Soft but steady rain fell throughout the morning, making it
easier to attack the flags. But those who made a charge either
started too far behind or made their move too late.
	   Elkington was the only one who got seriously close.
	   Just like in 1995, when his 64 was the lowest closing round ever
by a PGA champion, Elkington stormed down the stretch and got to 7
under with a birdie on the par-3 17th.
	   But his drive found the right rough on the 18th and he took
bogey.
	   Nick Price, trying to join Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen as a
three-time PGA champion, tied the course record with a bogey-free
65. That was only good enough for a 276 and a tie for fourth with
O'Meara and Frank Lickliter.
	   O'Meara, Davis Love III and Tiger Woods all had something to
prove, and all of them had their chances.
	   Love was trying to become the first player to win back-to-back
at the PGA since Denny Shute in 1937. His chances were drowned in
the water on No. 5 with a double bogey. He had three late birdies
that put him at 277, along with Billy Mayfair.
	   Woods will have to wait until next year to squeeze another major
out of his awesome talent. Starting five strokes back, Woods made
up one stroke before making bogey on the three of the last four
holes on the front side to take himself out of the picture.
	   Woods, who opened with a 66, failed to break par the rest of the
week and played the par 5s only 1 under. He shot a 71 on Sunday and
finished in a tie for 10th at 279.
	   Singh, who won for the sixth time in America and 24th time
around the globe, earned dlrs 540,000 and ended a steak of five
straight majors won by American players. He also kept the Americans
from sweeping the majors for the first time since 1982.

	   St. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The old woman has lived in St.
Petersburg for nearly a third of its history. Like the city, she
has aged hard but gracefully.
	   She was there for the revolution, when Bolsheviks stormed the
Winter Palace and claimed an empire. Today, on the great Palace
Square, one of history's most bloodstained stages, teen-agers whirl
about on in-line skates.
	   She was there for the siege of World War II, when Nazi forces
surrounded the city and starved it for 900 days. A million people
died, more or less, and she remembers the bodies littering the
streets where, today, black Mercedes Benz automobiles carry
thug-like men in suits to chic restaurants.
	   For roughly 90 years, Valentina Vladimirovna Bobrovskaya has
lived in this elegant, tormented city, home of Dostoevsky and
Nijinsky, Peter the Great and the young Vladimir Lenin. She cannot
imagine a life lived elsewhere.
	   ``I went to Moscow once,'' she says, a bit gruffly. ``Didn't
like it much. That was before the war. People were so rude. I
didn't like the people, so I didn't like the city.''
	   Her companions _ three old ladies, sitting on two facing park
benches, taking the sun _ nod their agreement. It turns out,
though, that she's the only one who's ever been to Moscow.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   For a brief moment this summer, St. Petersburg was again on
center stage. The last czar, Nicholas II, was buried in the city's
Peter and Paul Cathedral, and Russians were reminded that this was
once the capital of a vast empire, the place from which all of
Russia's great power flowed.
	   It was a stirring moment. But it also was a reminder of how much
this city has slipped into the shadows of post-Soviet life.
	   One of the first acts of the Bolsheviks after the 1917
revolution was to return the capital to its ancient center, Moscow,
and relegate St. Petersburg to the status of Russia's second city _
second in size and importance, if not in attitude.
	   Since then, the divide has only grown, and since the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the creation of a market economy in Russia, it
has grown greater still.
	   Moscow is Russia's one and only boomtown. St. Petersburg still
exhibits dreams of grandeur, but they seem far-fetched, at best.
The city administration has envisioned it as the future financial
capital of Russia, a bizarre claim considering that the vast
majority of the country's wealth is centered in Moscow.
	   As Moscow has leapt ahead, St. Petersburg has languished. Tens
of thousands of people have gone jobless. Attempts to revive the
city's shipyard industry, its largest, have mostly failed. The city
has moved slowly in developing the tourist industry that would
appear to be its economic salvation. Its first post-Soviet mayor,
championed as Russia's great liberal hope, stands charged of
corruption.
	   And yet, walking the streets of the city just before midnight on
a summer evening, the setting sun glinting gold off the canals,
couples strolling along the great boulevards and along the banks of
the Neva River, one can't help but think that this remains a
glorious city, one of those rare places that somehow lift and
ennoble their inhabitants and give expression to the better side of
the human spirit.
	   ``St. Petersburg is such a city that from the moment of its
founding, the culture was alive and vibrant,'' said Timur Novikov,
an artist who leads a movement to return to classical styles of
art.
	   ``At no time was it stagnant, whether it was during the time of
the revolution or during the Second World War. And during the
recent years, none of the negative processes the city has gone
through have influenced the culture in St. Petersburg. It's just
the sophistication of the city.''
	   Even through the Soviet period, much of the old spirit of St.
Petersburg survived. Its sophistication can still be seen in its
architecture, theaters and museums, including one of the finest art
museums in the world, the Hermitage.
	   All these remain vital, but with a new gloss added by places
like Gostiny Dvor, an old department store that has been partly
transformed into a shopping ``gallery'' that is as much a museum as
a store.
	   Here, in shops facing creamy yellow porticoes alive with the
chatter of songbirds, St. Petersburg's new aristocracy can buy
women's shoes from Charles Jourdan for 2,000 rubles (dlrs 330) or a
jacket from Sonia Rykiel for 6,550 rubles (dlrs 1,090).

	   There's just one thing missing: customers.
	   ``This is the beginning,'' said Zoya Kozhevnikova, the manager
of the shopping center. For now, sales are modest but sufficient,
she insisted. ``We hope in the future there will be more and
more.''
	   Kozhevnikova is tall and blond and 23, with the features and
self-confidence of a fashion model. Her hair is tied in a pony
tail; she looks smartly elegant in a black Gianfranco Ferre blouse
and a short, black Escada skirt. She is a St. Petersburg native and
proud of it.
	   ``I adore St. Petersburg,'' she said in passable,
British-accented English. ``I like the classical things in fashion.
We are a conservative city _ maybe not conservative, but
intelligent. Our buildings are straight and elegant and classical.
St. Petersburg was always considered to be an intelligent city in
comparison to Moscow, which was just a big market before the
Revolution.''
	   Moscow these days resembles a big, often coarse market once
more. St. Petersburg remains classical, elegant _ and poor.
	   St. Petersburg and its suburbs have a population of 6.5 million,
roughly half that of Moscow. Last year, retail sales for St.
Petersburg and the surrounding region totaled just under dlrs 7
billion _ about one-sixth as much as in Moscow.
	   German Gref, a vice governor of St. Petersburg who is in charge
of land development, said it was unfair to compare the two cities.
Moscow gets far more support from the federal government, he said,
and gets tax revenue from the many national and international
companies with their Russian headquarters there.
	   ``Though it should be said,'' he conceded, ``that Moscow's
government does well with the money they get.''
	   He ticked off his administration's policies, which he considers
to be laying the foundation for strong economic growth: tax cuts
for corporate earnings, extra tax breaks for big investors, an
increase in government spending, restructuring of city-held
enterprises, development of the city's infrastructure and support
for the tourist industry.
	   The problem is, much of the administration's program is stuck in
the city legislature, the victim of a political feud between city
Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and top legislative leaders.
	   Anyway, said Christian Courbois, a spokesman for a group of
small international businesses in St. Petersburg, it all adds up to
``too little, too late.''
	   Foreign investment in St. Petersburg has stalled, he said. The
city's roads and ports are crumbling; the Customs Service is not
only corrupt but incompetent; the idea of a ``money culture'' is
just beginning to catch on.
	   In addition, he said, the city has done little to encourage
tourism, despite having so many attributes. There are no decent
mid-priced hotels; taxis and museums gouge foreigners, charging
them up to 10 times what they charge Russians. There is no city
tourist office, and virtually nothing in the way of international
marketing.
	   ``Tourism should be a huge, huge industry here,'' Courbois said.
``But it's going to take awhile. They've got to clean the city up.
They've got to protect tourists from getting ripped off.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   In an evening in St. Petersburg, it is possible to see things
scarcely dreamed about, even now, in much of Russia.
	   A group of teen-agers sit strumming guitars and drinking beer
along the Neva, their backs to the Winter Palace. In a park, two
young women lean against a pathway railing, kissing passionately.
Nearby looms a statue of Catherine the Great.
	   In a cafe, a young couple dressed in black sit smoking, sharing
the earphones from a portable cassette player, nodding their heads
in time to the music. A boutique window offers a display of
``Tsar'' perfume by Van Cleef and Arpels. The United Colors of
Benetton window displays this season's colors in St. Petersburg:
black and white.
	   Elegant and simple.
	   Classical.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Monday, following concerns Friday in New York trading about
economic stability in Russia. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 146.15 yen, up 1.27 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo, but lower than its late New York rate of 146.35 yen.
	   Persistent doubts about Russia's currency and economy led to a
surge in the dollar against the yen and other currencies in New
York on Friday, traders said.
	   But the dollar's gains were slowed after Eisuke Sakakibara, the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, warned authorities were ready to intervene should the
dollar rise to 147 yen.
	   Comments by Sakakibara _ known as ``Mr. Yen'' _ are taken
seriously in the currency markets.
	   Early Monday, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the International
Bureau at the Ministry of Finance, reiterated Japan's commitment to
defend the yen.
	   ``We have been saying we will act in foreign exchange markets
appropriately, as needed,'' Kuroda said, adding that the dollar has
grown too strong against the yen.
	   The dollar also drifted lower in Tokyo as U.S.-based funds
bought the yen to adjust positions, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average lost more ground early Monday after ending last week
at a seven-week low.
	   It fell 128.73 points, or 0.85 percent, to 14,995.20 in the
first half hour of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank 258.09
points, or 1.68 percent _ its lowest since June 24.
	   The market's dive stemmed, in part, from a worsening of
sentiment following a decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street
Friday, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 34.50 points, or 0.4
percent, at 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and 9.8
percent below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Investors are also worried about the fate of a set of bills
designed to stabilize Japan's shaky financial system, said Eiji
Tomaru, a manager at the investor information group at Kankaku
Securities.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized the government's banking
legislation as a taxpayer-funded bailout which doesn't punish inept
executives.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section retreated 5.71 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,163.09.
The TOPIX fell 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.155 percent from Friday's finish of 1.175
yen, pushing its price up to 112.08 yen from 111.94 yen.

	   St. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The old woman has lived in St.
Petersburg for nearly a third of its history. Like the city, she
has aged hard but gracefully.
	   She was there for the revolution, when Bolsheviks stormed the
Winter Palace and claimed an empire. Today, on the great Palace
Square, one of history's most bloodstained stages, teen-agers whirl
about on in-line skates.
	   She was there for the siege of World War II, when Nazi forces
surrounded the city and starved it for 900 days. A million people
died, more or less, and she remembers the bodies littering the
streets where, today, black Mercedes Benz automobiles carry
thug-like men in suits to chic restaurants.
	   For roughly 90 years, Valentina Vladimirovna Bobrovskaya has
lived in this elegant, tormented city, home of Dostoevsky and
Nijinsky, Peter the Great and the young Vladimir Lenin. She cannot
imagine a life lived elsewhere.
	   ``I went to Moscow once,'' she says, a bit gruffly. ``Didn't
like it much. That was before the war. People were so rude. I
didn't like the people, so I didn't like the city.''
	   Her companions _ three old ladies, sitting on two facing park
benches, taking the sun _ nod their agreement. It turns out,
though, that she's the only one who's ever been to Moscow.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   For a brief moment this summer, St. Petersburg was again on
center stage. The last czar, Nicholas II, was buried in the city's
Peter and Paul Cathedral, and Russians were reminded that this was
once the capital of a vast empire, the place from which all of
Russia's great power flowed.
	   It was a stirring moment. But it also was a reminder of how much
this city has slipped into the shadows of post-Soviet life.
	   One of the first acts of the Bolsheviks after the 1917
revolution was to return the capital to its ancient center, Moscow,
and relegate St. Petersburg to the status of Russia's second city _
second in size and importance, if not in attitude.
	   Since then, the divide has only grown, and since the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the creation of a market economy in Russia, it
has grown greater still.
	   Moscow is Russia's one and only boomtown. St. Petersburg still
exhibits dreams of grandeur, but they seem far-fetched, at best.
The city administration has envisioned it as the future financial
capital of Russia, a bizarre claim considering that the vast
majority of the country's wealth is centered in Moscow.
	   As Moscow has leapt ahead, St. Petersburg has languished. Tens
of thousands of people have gone jobless. Attempts to revive the
city's shipyard industry, its largest, have mostly failed. The city
has moved slowly in developing the tourist industry that would
appear to be its economic salvation. Its first post-Soviet mayor,
championed as Russia's great liberal hope, stands charged of
corruption.
	   And yet, walking the streets of the city just before midnight on
a summer evening, the setting sun glinting gold off the canals,
couples strolling along the great boulevards and along the banks of
the Neva River, one can't help but think that this remains a
glorious city, one of those rare places that somehow lift and
ennoble their inhabitants and give expression to the better side of
the human spirit.
	   ``St. Petersburg is such a city that from the moment of its
founding, the culture was alive and vibrant,'' said Timur Novikov,
an artist who leads a movement to return to classical styles of
art.
	   ``At no time was it stagnant, whether it was during the time of
the revolution or during the Second World War. And during the
recent years, none of the negative processes the city has gone
through have influenced the culture in St. Petersburg. It's just
the sophistication of the city.''
	   Even through the Soviet period, much of the old spirit of St.
Petersburg survived. Its sophistication can still be seen in its
architecture, theaters and museums, including one of the finest art
museums in the world, the Hermitage.
	   All these remain vital, but with a new gloss added by places
like Gostiny Dvor, an old department store that has been partly
transformed into a shopping ``gallery'' that is as much a museum as
a store.
	   Here, in shops facing creamy yellow porticoes alive with the
chatter of songbirds, St. Petersburg's new aristocracy can buy
women's shoes from Charles Jourdan for 2,000 rubles (dlrs 330) or a
jacket from Sonia Rykiel for 6,550 rubles (dlrs 1,090).

	   There's just one thing missing: customers.
	   ``This is the beginning,'' said Zoya Kozhevnikova, the manager
of the shopping center. For now, sales are modest but sufficient,
she insisted. ``We hope in the future there will be more and
more.''
	   Kozhevnikova is tall and blond and 23, with the features and
self-confidence of a fashion model. Her hair is tied in a pony
tail; she looks smartly elegant in a black Gianfranco Ferre blouse
and a short, black Escada skirt. She is a St. Petersburg native and
proud of it.
	   ``I adore St. Petersburg,'' she said in passable,
British-accented English. ``I like the classical things in fashion.
We are a conservative city _ maybe not conservative, but
intelligent. Our buildings are straight and elegant and classical.
St. Petersburg was always considered to be an intelligent city in
comparison to Moscow, which was just a big market before the
Revolution.''
	   Moscow these days resembles a big, often coarse market once
more. St. Petersburg remains classical, elegant _ and poor.
	   St. Petersburg and its suburbs have a population of 6.5 million,
roughly half that of Moscow. Last year, retail sales for St.
Petersburg and the surrounding region totaled just under dlrs 7
billion _ about one-sixth as much as in Moscow.
	   German Gref, a vice governor of St. Petersburg who is in charge
of land development, said it was unfair to compare the two cities.
Moscow gets far more support from the federal government, he said,
and gets tax revenue from the many national and international
companies with their Russian headquarters there.
	   ``Though it should be said,'' he conceded, ``that Moscow's
government does well with the money they get.''
	   He ticked off his administration's policies, which he considers
to be laying the foundation for strong economic growth: tax cuts
for corporate earnings, extra tax breaks for big investors, an
increase in government spending, restructuring of city-held
enterprises, development of the city's infrastructure and support
for the tourist industry.
	   The problem is, much of the administration's program is stuck in
the city legislature, the victim of a political feud between city
Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and top legislative leaders.
	   Anyway, said Christian Courbois, a spokesman for a group of
small international businesses in St. Petersburg, it all adds up to
``too little, too late.''
	   Foreign investment in St. Petersburg has stalled, he said. The
city's roads and ports are crumbling; the Customs Service is not
only corrupt but incompetent; the idea of a ``money culture'' is
just beginning to catch on.
	   In addition, he said, the city has done little to encourage
tourism, despite having so many attributes. There are no decent
mid-priced hotels; taxis and museums gouge foreigners, charging
them up to 10 times what they charge Russians. There is no city
tourist office, and virtually nothing in the way of international
marketing.
	   ``Tourism should be a huge, huge industry here,'' Courbois said.
``But it's going to take awhile. They've got to clean the city up.
They've got to protect tourists from getting ripped off.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   In an evening in St. Petersburg, it is possible to see things
scarcely dreamed about, even now, in much of Russia.
	   A group of teen-agers sit strumming guitars and drinking beer
along the Neva, their backs to the Winter Palace. In a park, two
young women lean against a pathway railing, kissing passionately.
Nearby looms a statue of Catherine the Great.
	   In a cafe, a young couple dressed in black sit smoking, sharing
the earphones from a portable cassette player, nodding their heads
in time to the music. A boutique window offers a display of
``Tsar'' perfume by Van Cleef and Arpels. The United Colors of
Benetton window displays this season's colors in St. Petersburg:
black and white.
	   Elegant and simple.
	   Classical.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A French military plane dropped a life
raft to American millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett on Monday
after the balloon he was trying to fly around the world crashed
into the sea, authorities said.
	   The French plane reached the site where the balloon went down
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, at 8.40 a.m. local time (2240 GMT Sunday),
said the French navy in Noumea, New Caledonia.
	   The French plane circled Fossett until its fuel began to run
low, and headed back to its home base in Noumea, New Caledonia,
Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Robin Poke said.
	   A Royal Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 was due in the
region at any time, and will try to drop a radio to Fossett, whose
medical condition is unknown, Poke said.
	   ``No one has had radio contact, we do not know his condition,''
Poke told The Associated Press.
	   The Australian plane was also carrying emergency supplies.
Pending fuel shortages, the Australian plane would remain with
Fossett until a ship arrived.
	   Three boats are in the area. A ketch, the Atlanta, was closest
and may reach Fossett by 5:50 p.m. local time (0730 GMT), Poke
said. The New Zealand Navy tanker Endeavor was steaming to the
rescue, and was due at the site at about midnight Monday (1400
GMT), a spokesman said, on condition of anonymity.
	   Fossett had been two-thirds of the way through his effort. The
balloon was 500 miles (800 km) off the Australian coast heading
toward its final destination of Argentina, in South America, when
contact was lost, said Alan Blount, director of mission control for
the journey at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   Australian Maritime Rescue Center spokesman Brian Hill told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that Fossett came down near the
Bellona Reefs, an uncharted region which could make ship navigation
and the rescue difficult.
	   But a New Zealand Navy spokesman said they did not expect to
have any problems making the rescue.
	   About five hours before Fossett's warning locator sounded,
meteorologist Bob Rice had cautioned the balloonist he was
approaching strong thunderstorms _ and that they would be nearly
impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the
capsule of the balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   Fossett had a massive stretch of the Pacific Ocean between
Australia and Argentina to go and had at least another five days of
travel before he was expected to reach South America, from where he
took off on Aug. 7.
	   Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth attempt to fly
around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and
raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   Poke said Australian aircraft left Sydney about 6 a.m. local
time (2000 GMT), a short time after a satellite distress signal was
received from the balloon.
	   The French plane took off about the same time from Noumea, he
said.
	   Australian rescue authorities were praised internationally last
year after saving yachtsmen Tony Bullimore of Britain and Frenchman
Thierry Dubois after their boats capsized separately in a ferocious
storm during the French-organized Vendee Globe nonstop solo
around-the-world yacht race.
	   The men's boats capsized in January 1997, about 2,000 miles
(3,200 kilometers) southwest of Australia and only 1,000 miles
(1,600 kilometers) north of Antarctica.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ If tourism represents St.
Petersburg's future, shipping represents its past.
	   Peter the Great was in love with the sea, and he made Russia a
maritime power. He built St. Petersburg to give the country an
outlet to the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea, and he put its
people to work building boats.
	   You can still see the cranes of the shipyards from vantage
points throughout the city, and it's still common to see groups of
young sailors, uniforms crisp and faces fresh, out for a stroll on
Nevsky Prospekt, the city's main street.
	   But the military shipbuilding industry, a titan in Soviet times,
has fallen on hard times.
	   According to officials of the city's shipbuilding trade union,
there are still 55,000 workers employed by 55 separate shipbuilding
enterprises in St. Petersburg.
	   There is scarcely any work for them. The Russian Navy can hardly
afford to expand or modernize its fleet, and foreign contracts have
been slow in coming, although there are contracts now to build
ships for China and India.
	   The unions have collaborated on a plan to consolidate the
industry into three enterprises, employing 15,000 workers. The rest
would be dismissed.
	   The union leaders are glum.
	   ``You should not pay too much attention to the appearance of the
city or its people,'' argued Leonid Vorontsov, vice chairman of the
shipbuilding union, over tea in his office. ``People always try to
look nice, and to be optimistic. In the time of the siege during
World War II, people still had weddings and were still living. It's
the same nowadays.''

Tokyo Stock Exchange suspends trading in Glaxo Wellcome shares

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of Glaxo Wellcome PLC on Monday after a news report said the
U.K.-based drugmaker is set to merge with SmithKline Beecham PLC.
	   The TSE suspended trading of Glaxo's shares and convertible
bonds until the report could be confirmed, said Ayoko Nagao, a
spokeswoman for the exchange.
	   On Sunday, the Press Association reported that merger talks
between the two British pharmaceutical giants may soon restart
after being broken off in February.
	   A deal would have created the world's largest drug maker and
most expensive merger to date. The two companies have an estimate
market value of dlrs 166 billion.
	   Spokesmen in London for both companies refused to comment, the
report said.
	   Glaxo is one of 60 foreign companies listed on the TSE.

Franchitti wins first race; Zanardi charges to second

 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELKHART LAKE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Dario Franchitti was getting
tired of hearing about his potential to win races.
	   Last month at Toronto, the 25-year-old from Scotland was leading
by a big margin with 16 laps remaining when he made a mistake,
spinning out and winding up 20th.
	   A week ago, at Lexington, Ohio, he started from the pole and was
knocked out of the race on the second turn by Bryan Herta.
	   This time, he was able to avoid the problems that plagued all
the other contenders, pulling away to an easy victory Sunday in the
Texaco-Havoline 200 at Road America.
	   ``It really kind of dawned on me that we could win it after our
last (pit) stop when I saw the pitboard said `Plus-10,''' explained
Franchitti, referring to the message from his Team KOOL Green crew
that he had a lead of more than 10 seconds.
	   ``That was the same thing it said in Toronto before I went
out,'' he added, grinning widely. ``This time, I just took it easy
after that. I was slowing down because I thought, `If they catch me
a second a lap, no problem. I was just trying to be as gentle with
the car as possible.''
	   Franchitti, in his second year of Champ Car racing, beat
defending series champion and current points leader Alex Zanardi to
the finish line by 7.102 seconds _ nearly the length of the last
straightaway. Franchitti averaged 127.145 mph (204.61 kph).
	   ``Hopefully, it's the first of many,'' noted Franchitti, who
said his last win of any kind came in a touring car race at Suzuka,
Japan, in 1996. ``To win a race, you just have to get it right.''
	   The youngster, making only his 30th career start, led the last
21 of 50 laps around the 4.048-mile (6.51 kms), 14-turn circuit.
Franchitti took the lead when Bobby Rahal made his final pit stop
of the afternoon.
	   Franchitti made his third and last pit stop at the end of lap
42, holding the lead and coming off pit road with a margin of
11.673 seconds over Michael Andretti.
	   Andretti, who walked away from a spectacular tumbling crash a
week earlier at Mid-Ohio, was fending off Zanardi in the battle for
second on the last lap when his left rear tire exploded on the back
straightaway.
	   That sent his Swift-Ford pounding into a concrete barrier and
then a tire wall at over 190 mph (305 kph). The former CART
champion, frustrated and angry, was again able to walk away without
injury.
	   That left Zanardi to cruise to the finish line, taking the 16
points for second place and building his season margin over the
teammate Jimmy Vasser _ who finished ninth _ to 80 points with only
five of 19 races remaining. Each race has a maximum of 22 points,
including one for leading the most laps and one for winning the
pole.
	   Despite his second-place finish, it was another tough afternoon
for the Italian driver, who was fined dlrs 50,000 and one
championship point for ``taking unjustified risks'' twice during
the race at Mid-Ohio.
	   On the second turn of the first lap, Gil de Ferran ran into the
rear of Scott Pruett's car near the front of the bunched 28-car
field. Several other drivers braked and swerved to avoid the
aftermath and Zanardi slammed hard into the rear of Al Unser Jr.
	   Unser, who started fifth, slid off into a gravel pit, where he
was hit again by the spinning car of Patrick Carpentier, ending the
day for both drivers.
	   ``I don't really know what happened,'' said Zanardi, already on
probation for the incidents at Mid-Ohio. ``I'm so sorry. I spent
the whole race thinking about that.
	   ``I saw a lot of smoke and I hit the brakes as hard as I could
and ran into the rear of his car very hard. I just hit him.''
	   Wally Dallenbach, the chief steward, reviewed the first-lap
incident and said there would be no penalties assessed. Dallenbach
said he was convinced Zanardi tried to take evasive action.
	   Zanardi damaged his tires in the incident and had to pit on lap
eight. He fell all the way to 24th, but was able to regain much of
the lost ground when Andrei Ribeiro's car stopped on the track on
lap nine, bringing out a full-course caution that prompted most of
the leaders to make their first pit stops.
	   The hard-charging Zanardi was 10th by lap 14 and had moved to
fifth by lap 18.
	   ``Everything came into place,'' he said. ``I was driving hard
and other people just had troubles or had a different pit
strategy.''
	   Herta, who started next to pole-winner Andretti in second, came
away without injury from a bizarre and dangerous mishap on the 11th
lap.
	   Herta, who chose to stay on the track while several other early
leaders pitted, was out front for a restart on lap 11 after the
first full-course caution period. Teammate and boss Rahal passed
Herta for the lead and Herta, who said his engine was starting to
go, was trying to hold off Greg Moore when he drove too deep into
fifth turn, a tight left-hander.
	   Herta tapped the rear of Rahal's car and spun. He wound up
sitting backward just off the track surface.
	   As safety workers approached the stopped car, they were suddenly
sent scrambling as rookie Alex Barron also slid off course. Herta,
looking right at the runaway, tucked in his arms and ducked his
head before Barron's car slid to a stop on top of his.
	   Barron's car touched Herta's hands, but neither driver was
injured.
	   Moore took the lead moments later as Rahal made his first pit
stop, but his strategy, trying to finish the race on two stops,
went awry. The Canadian driver's gearbox broke as he tried to leave
the pits following his first stop at the end of lap 18.
	   De Ferran also was unlucky, blowing up his engine while running
third on lap 43.
	   Christian Fittipaldi wound up a distant third, trailing
Franchitti across the finish line by 43.922 seconds. Rookie Tony
Kanaan was fourth, followed by Adrian Fernandez, Paul Tracy, Mark
Blundell and Rahal, who is retiring as a driver at the end of the
season.

 &UR; A breif history of St. Petersburg &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG (AP) _ Founded in 1703 by Peter the Great as a
northern outpost in Russia's war against Sweden, St. Petersburg
became Russia's capital in 1712. It was a planned city, designed by
some of Europe's finest architects as a bold yet refined imperial
city _ Russia holding a mirror to the best of European culture.
	   Those bourgeois attributes were what persuaded the Bolsheviks to
abandon St. Petersburg as the capital in 1918 and return the seat
of power to Moscow. The American journalist John Reed, whose
sympathies lay with the Bolsheviks, called it an ``artificial''
city that poorly represented the real Russia.
	   Later, the communists would ``honor'' the old capital by naming
it after the first Soviet leader.
	   Today, Lenin's legacy has been largely stripped away, at least
superficially. Leningrad became St. Petersburg again in 1991, and
seems once again to be the city of the two ``Great'' czars, Peter
and Catherine. It's getting harder all the time to find a statue
depicting the man with the famous goatee.

Little Northern Ireland town struggles with enormity of loss

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As Northern Ireland's leaders
vowed vengeance on the bombers who killed at least 28 men, women
and children, the little town of Omagh struggled to come to grips
with its entry into the province's grim history books.
	   Each of the town's 2,000 residents seemed to have a story to
tell Sunday, offered in flat tones of disbelief: A school chum who
won't be in class next month. A father and son who no longer will
enliven a neighborhood. A shopkeeper who never again will greet
customers with a ready smile.
	   ``I don't understand why I'm living,'' said Jim Sharkey, who was
knocked off his feet at his newsstand on bustling Market Street
when the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday in the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's history.
	   Three generations of one family are gone: Avril Monaghan, 30,
her 18-month-old daughter Maura and her mother Mary Grimes, 65, who
had been visiting from nearby towns to shop on Market Street. Mrs.
Monaghan was pregnant with twins.
	   A 12-year-old boy from Madrid who was visiting Ireland to learn
English died, as did his female teacher twice his age. The two
Spaniards had decided at the last minute to put off visiting a
historical park to do some shopping.
	   Also killed was 39-year-old Philomena Skelton, who had been
seeking a school uniform for her youngest daughter. Kevin Skelton
marveled that when he went to the morgue to formally identify his
wife of 20 years, she ``hadn't a mark on her face.''
	   ``How does this town deal with this?'' asked the Rev. Michael
Keaveny of Omagh's Sacred Heart Catholic Church, outside the
makeshift headquarters responsible for tracking the dead, the
approximately 220 wounded and the handful of people still listed as
missing.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, emerged Sunday night from an hour-long meeting in
Belfast, about 70 miles (115 kms) east of Omagh, vowing to work
together to hunt down the bombers _ believed to belong to a
renegade Irish Republican Army offshoot opposed to April's peace
agreement.
	   ``The purpose of that bombing was to destroy the work, destroy
the hope and the agreement we built up,'' Blair said. ``Our
determination has got to be that these people will never win, and
that democracy will triumph over evil.''
	   Ronnie Flanagan, the head of Northern Ireland's police force,
planned to team up Monday with his Irish counterpart, Pat Bryne, to
urgently assess security across the island in the wake of the
bombing.
	   Their recommendations will be forwarded to Blair and Ahern, who
has refused to rule out the reintroduction of one of the most
draconian responses available to his government under emergency
powers _ the detention of terrorist suspects without trial.
	   Blair's spokesman would not discuss whether internment could
possibly be brought back in Northern Ireland, where legislation
would be necessary.
	   The talk of such drastic measures wasn't sparked just by the
sheer number of the dead and injured, many of whom lost limbs and
some of whom still may lose their lives.
	   Exacerbating the carnage _ and the outrage _ was the misleading
phoned warning that caused police to unwittingly herd a large
crowd, some attracted by a town festival, toward the full brunt of
the blast.
	   Mary McAleese, the first Northern Ireland native to be elected
president of the Irish Republic, traveled to Omagh on Sunday to
condemn the bombers as ``a posse of serial killers'' who planted
their device amid ``a scene of simple, humble innocence.''
	   Market Street remained sealed off, offering up frozen scenes of
quiet terror: A mangled baby carriage parked amid the rubble of a
collapsing storefront. Half-eaten meals abandoned on the tables of
a cafe. Diapers scattered pell-mell in the road.
	   Mairead Thompson brought her eight children from nearby
Londonderry to view the devastation, to show what hate can do.
	   She said she hopes for the best, but fears Omagh _ a religiously
mixed town that saw relatively little trouble before _ is forever
marked.
	   ``You can sense it already today, the change,'' she said,
sweeping her arm around to underscore the unnatural quiet of the
streets. ``The silence.''

Steinhauer storms through after disastrous 81 start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ An opening round 9-over 81 had
Sherri Steinhauer dreaming of a missed cut and an early flight home
from the Women's British Open.
	   When she collected the glass trophy and a winner's check for
100,000 pounds (dlrs 165,000) Sunday, she was still dreaming.
	   Steinhauer carded a final round 69 to win the championship by
one stroke from fellow American Brandie Burton and Sweden's Sophie
Gustafson at the tough links at Royal Lytham St Annes.
	   The Madison, Winsconsin, player followed her disastrous 81 with
a 72 and a 70 before she finished with a 3-under round. She also
left it late, taking the outright lead at the final hole and her
final putt only just dropping in.
	   ``This is like a dream,'' said Steinhauer, whose 156-yard
(142-meter) approach to the last gave her a straight 8-foot (2.5
meter) birdie putt.
	   ``When I walked up to make the putt, I looked at the leader
board and thought `this could win the British Open','' she said.
``I made a good strike but it barely made it. It was the last roll.
	   ``After my 81, the only thing I dreamed of was changing my
flight because I would have to leave early,'' Steinhauer said. ``At
that stage, my only real goal was making the cut.
	   ``Last night, I called my parents and my dad said: `Wouldn't it
be something for someone who shot 81 first day to go and win the
tournament?' I just laughed.''
	   After birdies at six, 11 and 13, she knew it was more than a
possibility because no one had made a break at the front and others
were falling out of contention.
	   Scotland's Janice Moodie, a U.S. Tour rookie who led the field
by one stroke going into the final round, missed six six-foot
(two-meter) putts during her 75. She finished 6-over in fourth
place.
	   ``I missed six that could have been,'' the Scot said. ``I was so
close. Two shots on that course was nothing.''
	   Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, finished
with a 71 and Gustafson carded a 70 for 5-over for the tournament
and a share of second.
	   Betsy King, one stroke off the lead at the start of the final
round, collected seven bogies in her 78 and she finished 9-over for
the championship and tied for sixth. Winner of 31 titles and more
money than anyone in the Tour's history, she's still looking for
her first victory of the year.
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, aiming to win the
title for the third time in four years, finished 8-over after a
final round 73 and took fifth place.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of four tournaments including two majors in
her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, wound up 20-over for the
championship and tied for 34th after a final round 77 to go with
scores of 78, 74 and 79.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean, who won the LPGA Championship and
the U.S. Women's Open, couldn't cope with the windy conditions and
the tough links course and managed only three birdies in 72 holes.

McEnroe overpowers Lloyd for Citibank Champions singles title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ John McEnroe overpowered John Lloyd
6-1, 6-2 to win the Citibank Champions and take over first place in
the senior tennis circuit's Nuveen Masters Point Standings.
	   The victory Sunday was McEnroe's third title of the season and
ninth since joining the senior circuit in 1995. It netted him dlrs
50,000 and his first championship in three tries before his
hometown New York fans.
	   The match was as lopsided as the score as McEnroe served six
aces, converted four of nine break point opportunities and was
never really challenged. He outslugged Lloyd from the baseline and
came in at will for easy volley winners.
	   ``Everything just flowed,'' McEnroe said. ``The shots came out
like the right answers. There were a couple times that I got
tentative, but I felt like I was about as aggressive as I could be.
I mixed my serve up and I placed it well.''
	   The Citibank Champions is the sixth event on the 1998-99 Nuveen
Tour and the ninth event on the ATP Tour-sanctioned worldwide
senior tennis circuit. The tour's next stop is in Paris Sept.
17-20.

Pakistan returns bombing suspect to Nairobi

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Pakistan has returned a suspect in the
East African U.S. embassy bombings to Nairobi, where a growing team
of FBI investigators was pressing ahead with a painstaking search
for evidence.
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said
Sunday that Mohammad Sadik Howaida was handed over to Kenyan
authorities last week, bypassing U.S. investigators in Pakistan.
	   A ministry spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival at
the Karachi airport from Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day twin bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and wounded at least 5,500 more.
	   A government source in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sadik was returned Friday to Nairobi, bypassing
U.S. investigators who had flown to Pakistan to question him.
	   Kenya's private KTN television reported that Howaida arrived
Sunday in Nairobi. The discrepancy could not immediately be
explained.
	   U.S. officials in Islamabad and Nairobi refused to discuss
Sadik.
	   ``This is a matter in which we are working very closely and very
hard with our Kenyan colleagues. I can't make any comment,'' said
the FBI's assistant agent-in-charge of the Nairobi investigation,
Hardrick Crawford. ``This is an ongoing investigation.''
	   The government source in Pakistan said the suspect told his
interrogators that a few other conspirators, who left Nairobi
earlier, had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan. He
had planned to do the same, he said.
	   The source told The Associated Press that investigators
suspected a link between Howaida and exiled Saudi multimillionaire
Osama bin Laden, who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for
the last two years.
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said
immigration officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged, and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   A ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab national''
without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually means
someone from the Middle East.
	   A day earlier, U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents
were headed to Pakistan to question the man.
	   But Altaf said no foreigners were allowed to interrogate
Howaida. The government source said Pakistani officials refused
U.S. officials who came to Karachi access to the suspect, and they
had to follow him to Kenya on another plane.
	   At the site of the bombing, meanwhile, U.S. investigators in
helmets and gloves were going through the damaged embassy building
over the weekend, occasionally pulling out magnifying glasses to
inspect something before tossing it out the window onto a heap
below.
	   Newsweek magazine reported that investigators have found a
220-kilogram (100-pound) steel driveshaft believed to have belonged
to the pickup truck that carried the bomb to the embassy in
Nairobi. The shaft, found a kilometer (more than a half-mile) from
the site, contains part of the vehicle identification number, the
magazine said, quoting unidentified sources.
	   In Washington, FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman would not comment
on the report.
	   The FBI has more than 200 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
and more agents arrived in Nairobi on Sunday to assist in the probe
into the worst-ever attack on a U.S. embassy.
	   Even nine days after the bombing, thousands of Kenyans still
lined up at police barricades erected in a wide circle around the
bombing site, gazing quietly at the wreckage.
	   Kenyan police have said they detained about five people for
questioning in the case.
	   Pakistan's national newspaper, The News, quoting unidentified
government sources Sunday, said Sadik confessed to planning the
bombings. The News said he was helped in Kenya by sympathizers with
connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Before the bombings, a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly
vowed to strike America interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania. That group is considered the successor to the
groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In a show of support for both East Africans and embassy staffers
abroad, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was planning
brief stops Tuesday in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.

Schumacher wins Hungarian Grand Prix, closes gap in championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ On a tight, twisting circuit where
overtaking is virtually impossible, Michael Schumacher had a daring
plan for coming from behind: make one more pit stop.
	   The plan was risky but probably the only one that had a chance
of succeeding.
	   The three-stop strategy allowed Schumacher to capture the
Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday in his Ferrari and close the gap in
the Formula One championship.
	   ``I thought we would be competitive today but I never dreamed I
would leave Hungary having closed the championship gap from 16 to
just seven points,'' said Schumacher, who started from the third
place on the grid.
	   Mika Hakkinen of Finland, the leader in the drivers' standings,
experienced handling problems after falling behind Schumacher and
finished one lap behind in sixth place.
	   He now has 77 points, while Schumacher has 70, with four races
to go. Each win is worth 10 points.
	   Hakkinen, like all drivers except Schumacher, made two pit
stops. The Finn started from the pole position, but was unable to
keep up in his failing McLaren-Mercedes after the second pit stop.
	   Schumacher took the lead on lap 47 in the 77-lap race, after all
top drivers went into the pits for the second time.
	   With less fuel to weigh him down, Schumacher quickly built up a
big lead and when he completed his third pit stop on lap 62, he was
still five seconds ahead of David Coulthard.
	   Coulthard, a Briton in the second McLaren, finished second,
while Jacques Villeneuve of Canada, winner here in 1996 and 1997
and Formula One champion last year, finished third for the second
race in a row in a Williams.
	   Schumacher completed the race distance of 305.844 kilometers
(190.043 miles) in one hour, 45 minutes, 25.550 seconds, averaging
a speed of just over 174 kilometers (104 miles) per hour.
	   Schumacher also recorded the fastest lap on the 3.9-kilometer
(2.4-mile) Hungaroring of one minute, 19.286 seconds.
	   ``It was one of the nicest victories I've had, it was
outstanding,'' said the 29-year-old German ace after his fifth
victory of the season.
	   Schumacher, who has won two championships in other cars, is
seeking to become the first Ferrari driver to win the title since
Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   Sunday's victory lifted Schumacher past Nigel Mansell into third
place on the all-time list with 32 career wins. The retired Alain
Prost has 51 and the late Ayrton Senna 41.
	   Schumacher's triumph came almost to the day of the 10th
anniversary of the death of Enzo Ferrari, the patriarch of the
famous racing team who died Aug. 14, 1988.
	   ``It was one of my most emotional wins, thanks to the reaction
of all the Ferrari fans,'' said Schumacher, who snapped Hakkinen's
two-race winning streak.
	   ``The team picked the right strategy, although at first I was
not quite sure if our plan would work out,'' said Schumacher, who
had dropped to fourth after his first pit stop.
	   Former champion Damon Hill of Britain, twice a winner here, was
fourth in a Jordan, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany was
fifth in the second Williams.
	   The next race is Aug. 30 in Belgium, where Schumacher celebrated
his first Formula One victory in 1992 and where he has won four
times.
	   ``The championship is now wide open,'' Schumacher said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In another setback for a besieged
Colombian army, dozens of soldiers were killed and captured in
clashes with leftist rebels in northwestern Colombia that raged
throughout the weekend.
	   Gen. Martin Carreno, commander of the army's 17th Brigade
involved in the combat, said at least 60 soldiers and rebels died
and 19 soldiers were wounded. The fighting began Friday and
continued Sunday afternoon in a remote part of the municipality of
Riosucio, in Choco state.
	   Carreno did not say how many of the dead were soldiers.
	   In a statement read on Radionet radio station, guerrillas from
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said they had
killed 53 soldiers, wounded 30 and taken 20 more prisoners.
	   The battle began when about 600 guerrillas attacked soldiers
from three counterinsurgency battalions, the army reported. The
soldiers were patrolling the humid, low-lying jungle region, an
area near the Panama border intersected by rivers. About a month
ago, rebels reportedly began trying to regain territory there lost
last year to landowner-backed paramilitary groups.
	   A Red Cross official in nearby Apartado, Jorge Cardona, told The
Associated Press that at least 43 wounded soldiers had been
evacuated but that the number of deaths was unclear.
	   The latest combat occurred less than two weeks after one of the
most devastating offensives ever by rebels, who have been fighting
the government since the 1960s, and a week after President Andres
Pastrana named a new military high command.
	   In three days of nationwide attacks beginning Aug. 4, guerrillas
from the 15,000-member FARC and the 5,000-member National
Liberation Army destroyed a major anti-narcotics base, killed as
many as 143 soldiers and police, and captured 129 people.
	   Pastrana, who was inaugurated Aug. 7, has vowed to make peace
his government's top priority.

Little Northern Ireland town struggles with enormity of loss

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As Northern Ireland's leaders
vowed vengeance on the bombers who killed at least 28 men, women
and children, the little town of Omagh struggled to come to grips
with its entry into the province's grim history books.
	   Each of the town's 2,000 residents seemed to have a story to
tell Sunday, offered in flat tones of disbelief: A school chum who
won't be in class next month. A father and son who no longer will
enliven a neighborhood. A shopkeeper who never again will greet
customers with a ready smile.
	   ``I don't understand why I'm living,'' said Jim Sharkey, who was
knocked off his feet at his newsstand on bustling Market Street
when the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday in the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's history.
	   Three generations of one family are gone: Avril Monaghan, 30,
her 18-month-old daughter Maura and her mother Mary Grimes, 65, who
had been visiting from nearby towns to shop on Market Street. Mrs.
Monaghan was pregnant with twins.
	   A 12-year-old boy from Madrid who was visiting Ireland to learn
English died, as did his female teacher twice his age. The two
Spaniards had decided at the last minute to put off visiting a
historical park to do some shopping.
	   Also killed was 39-year-old Philomena Skelton, who had been
seeking a school uniform for her youngest daughter. Kevin Skelton
marveled that when he went to the morgue to formally identify his
wife of 20 years, she ``hadn't a mark on her face.''
	   ``How does this town deal with this?'' asked the Rev. Michael
Keaveny of Omagh's Sacred Heart Catholic Church, outside the
makeshift headquarters responsible for tracking the dead, the
approximately 220 wounded and the handful of people still listed as
missing.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, emerged Sunday night from an hour-long meeting in
Belfast, about 70 miles (115 kms) east of Omagh, vowing to work
together to hunt down the bombers _ believed to belong to a
renegade Irish Republican Army offshoot opposed to April's peace
agreement.
	   ``The purpose of that bombing was to destroy the work, destroy
the hope and the agreement we built up,'' Blair said. ``Our
determination has got to be that these people will never win, and
that democracy will triumph over evil.''
	   Later Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed his
condolences to the people of Northern Ireland during a 15-minute
telephone conversation with Blair.
	   ``The prime minister briefed the president on his conversations
with the political leaders there today,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. ``I think the president and prime minister shared
how personally difficult it is to deal with these experiences as
leaders.''

Brack outlasts field at PPIR

<TEXT>
	   FOUNTAIN, Colorado (AP) _ Kenny Brack, gambling that he had
enough fuel in a four-car dash to the finish, won the Indy Racing
League's Radisson 200 at Pikes Peak International Raceway.
	   Brack, posting his second straight victory on the IRL circuit,
stayed on the track for the final laps Sunday after leader Robbie
Buhl pitted for a splash of fuel on the 196th lap of the 200-lap
event on the one-mile (1.6 kms) oval.
	   Defending champion Tony Stewart, running a close third near the
end, also made a quick pit stop, and pole-sitter Billy Boat, in
fourth place, ran out of fuel on the track.
	   Brack, 32, of Karlstad, Sweden, said he pushed his fuel capacity
to the limit, running out on the final turn just yards from the
checkered flag.
	   ``In the fourth turn, I was out. I was coasting all the way
in,'' said Brack, who also won the IRL's last event at Charlotte on
July 25. ``It was pretty close, but close was good enough. We were
lucky and made it.''
	   Brack, who qualified fifth, was in seventh place at the halfway
point but moved up to second, behind Davey Hamilton, after 150
laps.
	   At Lap 174, six cars were within three seconds of the lead held
by Brack.
	   At Lap 188, Buhl passed Brack and increased his lead over Brack
to 5.8 seconds by the 195th lap. But Buhl was forced to pit,
allowing Brack to win with an average speed of 133.515 mph (214.86
kph).
	   Buhl was second, followed by Stewart, Stephan Gregoire and
Hamilton.
	   At the start, Jeff Ward, who qualified second, took advantage of
slowing pole-sitter Boat, who might have missed a gear, to take the
lead, with Stewart moving to second place and Boat fading to sixth.
	   Stewart made a high pass in traffic to overtake Ward on the 12th
lap, but Ward reclaimed the lead on the 24th. The front-runners
traded the lead twice more on laps 51 and 60, after which Stewart
made a pit stop.
	   Ward, getting extraordinary fuel mileage, managed to delay his
first pit stop until Arie Luyendyk's car broke down, bringing out a
caution flag on lap 74.
	   Ward, a former motocross champion who finished second in two IRL
races this season, padded his lead to 12 seconds over Buddy Lazier
when, running high on the track, he slammed the wall between Turns
1 and 2 on the 118th lap. Ward wasn't injured, but his day was
done.
	   Lazier then assumed the lead, but after a flurry of pit stops,
Davey Hamilton claimed the lead, with Brack second and Boat third.
	   Attendance at the 44,000-seat facility was announced as 32,537.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second game of Brewers-Padres doubleheader. Will
 &UR; Reds 8, Expos 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Reggie Sanders singled, doubled, tripled and
scored four runs Sunday as the Cincinnati Reds took advantage of
the Montreal Expos' ragged play to get a 8-1 victory and a series
sweep.
	   Brett Tomko (11-8) had a pair of hits, scored twice and pitched
seven innings to reach a Reds milestone. He's the first Cincinnati
pitcher to win 11 games in each of his first two seasons since Art
Fowler in 1954-55.
	   Sanders tripled, was hit by a pitch from Carl Pavano (4-6),
doubled and singled in his four plate appearances in the first five
innings. He scored each time, matching his career high, and came up
short of the cycle when he flew out to the warning track in the
seventh.
	   Pavano gave up six hits, three walks and five runs _ four earned
_ in his shortest start since June 22.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Cardinals 1
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire remained stuck on 47 homers, and
didn't walk, going 2-for-5 with two singles and three strikeouts
Sunday in the Cardinals' loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
	   McGwire, 26-for-111 (.234) since the All-Star break with 10
homers and 19 RBIs, was tied for the home run lead Sunday when the
Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit his 47th.
	   Pirates starter Francisco Cordova (11-10) gave up a two-out
single to McGwire with none on the first, struck him out with two
on in the third, fanned him to start the fifth and gave up a
two-out single in the seventh _ McGwire's 5,000th career at-bat.
	   Matt Morris (3-3) allowed three runs and eight hits in eight
innings.
 &UR; Cubs 2, Astros 1, 11 innings
	   In Houston, Sammy Sosa hit his 47th home run, tying Mark McGwire
for the major league lead, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Houston
Astros on pinch-hitter Manny Alexander's RBI single in the 11th
inning.
	   Kerry Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston with a one-hitter
on May 6, allowed the one run and three hits in eight innings,
struck out 11 and walked two.
	   Matt Karchner (1-0) pitched two hitless innings for the win. Rod
Beck got three outs for his 36th save. Jay Powell (4-5) took the
loss.
 &UR; Phillies 8, Rockies 7
	   In Denver, Bobby Estalella hit his first career grand slam and
Bobby Abreu added a two-run shot as the Philadelphia Phillies held
on to beat Colorado.
	   Mark Portugal (7-3) pitched five innings and allowed two runs,
one earned, striking out four to earn the victory. Mark Leiter
pitched the ninth for his 22nd save.
	   Pinch-hitter Jeff Reed hit a grand slam for the Rockies.
	   Colorado starter Jamey Wright (7-11) lasted three innings and
gave up five hits and seven runs. He was trying to win three
straight starts for the first time in his career.
 &UR; Padres 4, Brewers 0, 1st game
 &UR; Brewers 4, Padres 2, 2nd game
	   In San Diego, Kevin Brown pitched a one-hitter for his third
shutout this year and struck out 11 to match his career high as San
Diego beat Milwaukee in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   Jeromy Burnitz singled with two out in the seventh to break up
yet another attempt at the Padres' first-ever no-hitter.
	   Brown (15-4) was coming off a 3-2 loss to the Marlins on Monday,
which snapped his club-record 11-game winning streak.
	   Milwaukee left-hander Rafael Roque (0-1), who was called up from
Triple-A Louisville to make his second career start, took the loss.
	   The Brewers rallied to win the second game as Burnitz hit a
two-run homer and Geoff Jenkins had a solo shot. Bill Pulsipher
(1-0) struck out a career-high 10 in his second start since being
acquired from the New York Mets. Bob Wickman earned his 20th save.
Joey Hamilton (10-10) took the loss.
 &UR; Giants 3, Marlins 2
	   In San Francisco, Orel Hershiser won for the first time in six
starts and Jeff Kent had two run-scoring doubles as San Francisco
beat Florida to complete a three-game sweep.
	   Hershiser (9-8) survived 10 hits and a walk, allowing two runs
in six innings with six strikeouts. He had been 0-1 with four
no-decisions since July 15.
	   Robb Nen got three outs for his 31st save.
	   Jesus Sanchez (6-7) left after 3 1-3 innings after he bruised a
finger while fouling off a pitch.

Japanese prime minister reportedly expresses outrage over bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday he
was outraged by the terrorist bombing in Northern Ireland which
killed 28 people on Saturday, according to a local news report.
	   ``I'm absolutely furious about the incident that took place when
they had worked out peace at last and are starting to get it into
shape,'' Kyodo News quoted Obuchi as saying to reporters.
	   The blast came less than three months after voters in both parts
of Ireland overwhelmingly approved plans for a new Northern Ireland
government with power shared between its majority Protestants and
minority Roman Catholics.
	   Obuchi said Japan hopes the peace process will not be derailed
by the car-bomb attack, which has been blamed on Irish Republican
Army dissidents opposed to the new peace accord.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, bond and currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen in early
trading Monday, following concerns Friday in New York trading about
economic stability in Russia. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 146.15 yen, up 1.27 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo, but lower than its late New York rate of 146.35 yen.
	   Persistent doubts about Russia's currency and economy led to a
surge in the dollar against the yen and other currencies in New
York on Friday, traders said.
	   But the dollar's gains were slowed after Eisuke Sakakibara, the
Japanese Finance Ministry's vice finance minister for international
affairs, warned authorities were ready to intervene should the
dollar rise to 147 yen.
	   Sakakibara is known as ``Mr. Yen'' because of his influence on
currency markets.
	   Early Monday, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the International
Bureau at the Ministry of Finance, said Japan remains committed to
defending the yen.
	   ``We have been saying we will act in foreign exchange markets
appropriately, as needed,'' Kuroda said, adding that the dollar has
grown too strong against the yen.
	   The dollar also drifted lower in Tokyo amid concerns the growing
sex scandal embroiling the White House may continue to preoccupy
Washington.
	   President Bill Clinton will testify before a grand jury later
Monday over the nature of his relations with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. Media have speculated that he may admit to
a limited sexual relationship.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average lost more ground early Monday after ending last week
at a seven-week low.
	   It fell 210.84 points, or 1.39 percent, to 14,913.09 at the
close of the morning session. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank
258.09 points, or 1.68 percent _ its lowest since June 24.
	   The market's dive stemmed, in part, from a worsening of
sentiment following a decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street
Friday, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 34.50 points, or 0.4
percent, at 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and 9.8
percent below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Investors are also worried about the fate of a set of bills
designed to stabilize Japan's shaky financial system, said Eiji
Tomaru, a manager at the investor information group at Kankaku
Securities Co.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized the government's banking
legislation as a taxpayer-funded bailout which doesn't punish inept
executives.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section retreated 12.83 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,155.97.
The TOPIX fell 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.160 percent from Friday's finish of 1.175
yen, pushing its price up to 112.04 yen from 111.94 yen.

Stolen painting in New Zealand recovered, one man arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A 19th-century painting worth U.S.
dlrs 1 million stolen from Auckland Art Gallery nine days ago has
been recovered, police said Monday.
	   Senior Sgt. Gary Allcock said he understood that one person had
been arrested over the theft of the 1874 oil, ``Still on Top,'' by
French-born artist Jacques-Joseph (James) Tissot, one of New
Zealand's most expensive and popular European works.
	   He said details would be disclosed later.
	   The painting valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1 million was stolen Aug.
9 by a man armed with a shotgun in a daring robbery at the Auckland
Art Gallery.
	   The man, clad in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, dark
visor and gloves, burst through the main door with a sawed-off
shotgun and a crowbar.
	   Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey
Gallery waving a firearm and yelling ``get down,'' and ``keep
back'' to staff and patrons.
	   She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to
the Lower Wellesley Gallery, where the painting was displayed.
	   The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on
the ground. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the
frame and take it off the backing board.
	   The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the
gallery into Albert Park, pursued by a member of the public. He was
believed to have climbed on a motorcycle and escaped via a nearby
highway.

Quakes continue to shake central Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook an area of
mountainous central Japan early Monday that has been rocked by a
series of similar temblors, the Japanese Meteorological Agency
said.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious damage.
	   The latest quake struck at about 10:15 a.m. local time (0115
GMT) and was centered in the sparsely inhabited Hida region of Gifu
prefecture, 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of Tokyo, the agency
said.
	   A total of 92 earthquakes have jolted the area since midnight
Sunday, but only one was strong enough to be felt by humans, it
said.
	   Thousands of tremors have been reported over the past few days
in Gifu and neighboring Nagano prefecture, including one Sunday
which triggered a landslide forcing 90 people to evacuate a hot
springs resort.
	   After an emergency meeting late last week, members of Japan's
Science and Technology Agency's seismological committee said the
earthquakes will likely continue for several more weeks.
	   The same area experienced similar spates of seismic activity in
1990 and 1967.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations,
sitting atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in
shares of Glaxo Wellcome PLC on Monday after a news report said the
U.K.-based drugmaker is set to merge with SmithKline Beecham PLC.
	   The TSE suspended trading of Glaxo's shares and convertible
bonds until the report could be confirmed, said Ayoko Nagao, a
spokeswoman for the exchange.
	   On Sunday, England's Press Association reported that merger
talks between the two British pharmaceutical giants may soon
restart after being broken off in February.
	   A deal would have created the world's largest drug maker and
most expensive merger to date. The two companies have an estimate
market value of dlrs 166 billion.
	   Spokesmen in London for both companies refused to comment, the
report said.
	   Glaxo is one of 60 foreign companies listed on the TSE.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bernie Williams hit a solo home run into the
upper deck with one out in the ninth inning Sunday and the New York
Yankees won their 90th game, beating the Texas Rangers 6-5.
	   At 90-30, the Yankees joined the 1944 St. Louis Cardinals as the
only teams in major league history to reach that win total in their
first 120 games.
	   New York finished 10-1 on its homestand, improving to 48-9 at
home. Williams connected off Xavier Hernandez (5-2) for his fourth

Simas struck out the side in the ninth for his 15th save. Jeff
Fassero (10-9) was the loser.
 &UR; Blue Jays 6, Angels 4

off the Angels on four runs and 10 hits in 8 2-3 innings.
	   Paul Quantrill, pitching despite a stiff back, got the final out
for his fourth save, retiring Gary Disarcina on a bouncer.
	   Jeff Juden (0-1), making his second start since the Angels
acquired him from Milwaukee on Aug. 7, gave up five runs and seven
hits in five innings. He is 0-6 in nine starts since June 26.
 &UR; Twins 6, Red Sox 3
	   In Boston, Matt Lawton tied a career high with four hits and
Eric Milton (7-9) started with five hitless innings as Minnesota

Entire Southern Hemisphere may soon become a sanctuary for whales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ All oceans in the Southern Hemisphere
may soon be declared a whale sanctuary, Australian officials said
Monday.
	   They were briefing reporters before a regional summit meeting of
South Pacific island nations next week at which a proposal to make
the South Pacific a vast sanctuary for the world's whales will be
debated.
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
expect Japan to oppose the idea even though it does most of its
hunting for minke whales in the North Pacific.
	   Japanese whalers have also hunted minke whales in Antarctic
waters, but one well-placed Australian official said he was not
aware of them hunting in these waters since 1993.
	   The Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean have already been
declared whale sanctuaries.
	   Australian officials said Brazil is planning to have the South
Atlantic declared a whale sanctuary.
	   But the officials admit that no boundaries have yet been set for
the proposed South Pacific whale sanctuary, which they hope will be
approved at a meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Pohnpei, the
capital of Micronesia, Aug. 21-28.
	   Australia and most other Western nations strongly support an end
to whaling throughout the world.
	   Japan and Norway do not.
	   Tokyo insists on its right under International Whaling
Commission rules to continue whaling for what it calls scientific
purposes _ though the rules say the meat cannot be wasted, and it
reaches Japanese consumers.
	   Australian officials expect strong support for the idea of a
South Pacific whale sanctuary.
	   They say the South Pacific island state of Tonga is already
developing a strong eco-tourism industry based on whale watching.
	   Whaling was once a major industry in the South Pacific but has
virtually stopped.
	   Fiji is expected to insist on the right to continue what it
calls traditional use of whale products.
	   But Fijians have not traditionally hunted whales, and the
products they used have come from naturally beached whales.
