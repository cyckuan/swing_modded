<HEADLINE> PC Makers Flocking to Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Computer companies are turning
to the populous Asia-Pacific region to find new fortunes, after
conquering the West.
</P>
<P>
"The market is exploding -- no doubt about that," said Steve
Haslett, a director of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard
Co.'s Far East operation. Hewlett-Packard business is about to
double what it was last year, according to Alto.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Asia-Pacific was the fastest-growing PC market in the
world, with overall sales growth in the mid-30 percent range,
analysts say. Other regions, including the U.S., offer higher
volume but slower growth -- in the mid-teens or single digits.
</P>
<P>
Because of its size, China is considered by many computer
makers as the most potential market. Dennis Philbin, an analyst
from the International Data Corp. (IDC), said that the huge land
and its 1.2 billion people could take years to fully tap.
</P>
<P>
IDC predicts China will spend nearly 35 billion U.S. dollars
annually on information technology by 2001. In 1996, it spent
slightly more than 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today, IDC estimates there is one computer per 200 people in
China, compared with one computer per 3.5 people in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Even if you get to 100 people per PC, you still have a massive
market relative to other countries of the world," said Phil Kelly,
president of Dell's Asia-Pacific group.
</P>
<P>
Computer makers tend to separate Japan from the rest of the
Asia-Pacific market because of that nation's unique PC market.
Japan's spending on computers, though greater than other Asian
countries combined, is largely based on products made at home.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea and Australia are also sophisticated
markets. People are taking home machines no less than a Pentium
running at 166 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific's market leader is Compaq Computer Corp. Samsung
Group of ROK is second, followed by International Business
Machines Corp. of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. took the lead in the world in information technology
spending. It spent 41.5 percent of the world's total of 610
billion U.S. dollars in 1996. Japan came as the second, spending
15.9 percent. The rest of Asian-Pacific countries and regions
spent only 7.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for Setting up First-Rate Book Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua Bookstore Chain should
be built into a first-rate national book distribution system to
help improve the quality of the Chinese nation and promote
socialist ethical and cultural progress, Premier Li Peng said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the call when meeting with representatives
from the bookstore's national chain at its 60th anniversary
celebration.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party and the State Council, Li congratulated and thanked all
those working in the chain as well as the representatives for
their contributions to China's development since its establishment
in a cave dwelling in the revolutionary base in Yan'an six decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Publication and distribution of books is a significant part of
the promotion of ethical and cultural progress in the country,
which is as important as economic development," the premier
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He urged Xinhua bookstores across the country to further
improve service quality in a time when China is building a
socialist market economy, and make greater contributions to the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The bookstore chain has grown into a national distribution
network of book and audio-video products, with more than 2,800
stores and 10,000-plus retail outlets, and has more than 100,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
At present, the chain is responsible for 90 percent of all the
books sold in China, and 80 percent of the total sales of the
books.
</P>
<P>
State leaders Li Tieying, Luo Gan and Hong Xuezhi also attended
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Leaves for Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left Washington today for talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to focus their talks on security
issues, including the American military presence in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto faces domestic pressure to reduce the U.S. military
presence on the southwestern island, for residents there are
unhappy about the existence of a large number of American troops.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is host of about two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops
stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Another topic likely to be discussed at the summit is trade
imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After his three-day stay in Washington, Hashimoto will leave
for Australia and New Zealand. He is scheduled to return home on
May 1.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Acknowledged by Zaireans as Honest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
acknowledged as a non-partisan facilitator and honest peace broker by
the fact that both the Zairean warring parties chose the country as a
venue for the peace talks, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said
today.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the remarks in the Natinonal Assembly when introducing a
debate on his budget vote, apparently referring to South Africa's
mediation efforts in seeking a lasting solution to the ongoing Zairean
civil war.
</P>
<P>
It was also a tribute to President Nelson Mandela, said Nzo.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has hosted several round talks between the
representatives of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader
Laurent Kabila in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is also the proposed venue for the first face-to-face
talks between Mobutu and Kabila, scheduled to be held this week.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with Kabila and consultations with Mobutu's special
envoy Honore Ngbanda last week, Mandela extended a formal invitation
to Mobutu to meet Kabila in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa has not yet received an official reply from
Mobutu to Mandela's invitation, indicating whether or not the proposed
direct talks will go ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda, who arrived in South Africa on Wednesday and had reportedly
met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Wednesday night, is widely
expected to be the man carrying Mobutu's reply to Mandela's
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, there is no official confirmation about what message
Ngbanda carried from Mobutu to South African mediators. enditem

<HEADLINE> Villenueve Criticises Grand Prix Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- World Championship leader Jacques
Villeneuve and Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine severely criticised
proposed Grand Prix 1998 rules changes in Imola, Italy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The International de l'Automobile (FIA) has ruled that the cars
must use grooved tyres to slow them down next year. Villeneuve
tested the tyres last week and described the results Thursday as a
joke.
</P>
<P>
"It was like driving a (junior) Formula Ford car, with a bit
more power and downforce. It's ridiculous to drive the pinnacle
of race cars like that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that if the rule was invoked, he and other drivers
might move to the rival U.S. CART World Series. Formula One
authorities encouraged the Williams team to hire Villeneuve after
he won the CART Championship and the Indy 500 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Ding Song Shocked As China Downs Slovenia 3-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 24 (Xinhua) -- World top defensive
player Ding Song suffered an upset loss to less-known Robert
Smrekar as China overcame Slovenia 3-1 at their opening men's team
match at the World Table Tennis Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Smrekar, rated 115th in the world, clinched a 12-21, 21-12,
21-15 victory over the world No. 7 after China's Olympic champion
Liu Guoliang won the first game against Sasa Ignjatovic in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Ding looked compeletly out of form as he failed to put up his
trademark chop-and-attack game.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chinese jumped to international stardom in the
1995 world championships, where he won a crucial point in China's
3-2 final victory over three-time world champion Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Ding also ousted 1991 world singles champion Jorgen Persson of
Sweden and then world No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive of Beigium en route
to finishing fourth in the last Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"Ding Song is no longer a secret to Europeans," said Chinese
head coach Cai Zhenhua. "They have been studying his style since
the 1995 championships."
</P>
<P>
"I won't lose confidence on him," the Chinese coach added.
</P>
<P>
World top player Kong Linghui regained lead for China as he
outplayed Gregor Skafar 21-11, 21-13.
</P>
<P>
Liu wrapped up China's victory with a 21-15, 21-11 win over
Smrekar.

<P>
SEOUL, April 24 (xinhua) -- South Korea rejected today
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s "3+1" proposal that
the two sides and the United States meet first before China joins
in.
</P>
<P>
Yoo Myung-hwan, Director General of the foreign ministry's
North American Affairs Bureau, was quoted by Yonhap News Agency as
saying that the South Korean government dismissed the proposal
because it is regarded as a part of Pyongyang's strategies to
solve issues on food aid and lifting U.S.economic sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hoped to discuss at the peace talks fundamental
ways for the North side to get out of its economic plight and food
shortage through direct inter-Korean economic cooperation, Yoo
said.
</P>
<P>
The "3+1" proposal was put forward by DPRK representative
during the pre-Four Party Talks contact in New York on April 20.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Eager to Develop Close Relations With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said here today that Iraq is eager to develop close
relations with Russia and praised the Russian efforts to try to
lift the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed Iraq's eagerness when meeting with the
visiting Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Deputy
Speaker Sergei Baburin, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that he appreciates Russia's support to Iraq's demands
to lift the seven-year-long embargo, which was imposed by the
U.N. Security Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also praised the Russian State Duma
for its friendly stance toward Iraq and its on-going calls to get
the embargo lifted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Baburin hailed Iraq's great achievements in its
reconstruction after the 1991 Gulf War and stressed that Russia
is willing to "cement ties of joint cooperation."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Sa'eed al-
Sahaf on Wednesday morning, Baburin expressed his support to Iraq in
running pilgrims flights.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iraq sent 104 elderly and sick pilgrims
in an aircraft to Mecca, Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. On Monday
and Tuesday, eight Iraqi military helicopters flew across the
no-fly zone in southern Iraq to an Iraqi-Saudi border area to fly
the pilgrims home.
</P>
<P>
Now the helicopters are waiting at Iraqi border city Aar'ar for
the returning of the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The Russian deputy speaker arrived in Baghdad on Monday with an
delegation at the invitation of the Iraqi National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The visit is designed to develop bilateral parliamentary
relations and enhance friendship and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Russia were traditional trade partners and they
enjoyed good relationship before the Gulf War. But Russia withdrew
from the Gulf area and its influence diminished as a result of
the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
But now Russia tries to make a come-back in this region and the
relations between the two countries are warming up. Russia and
Iraq signed "Vast Strategic Contract" on March 21 to develop
Iraq's western oil fields, which has proven reserves of almost 15
billion barrels crude oil and it is estimated to be the largest
oil field in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Urges Israel to Return to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nasser al-Kidwa, permanent
observer of Palestine to the UN, today urged Israel to stop
construction of the new colonial settlement in eastern Jerusalem
and return to the right path of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As the first speaker at the 10th Emergency Special Session of
the General Assembly which opened here this morning, the
Palestinian observer noted the current Israeli government had
adopted basic political guidelines contradicting the agreements
signed and dangerous actions threatening the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since its occupation in 1967 of Palestinian territory,
including Jerusalem, Israel had worked to change the legal status
and demographic composition of Jerusalem and of the occupied
Palestinian territory as a whole through the colonical settlement
of the land, he reviewed.
</P>
<P>
"This has been done in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907 and in
blatant defiance to relevant Security Council resolutions," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The right path was the implementation of the existing
agreements, including the implementation of all overdue
provisions and future obligations, the acceleration of the
negotiations for the final settlement within the framework of the
existing agreements and reaffirming compliance with those
agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We affirm that we are still committed to the peace process and
the agreements reached between the parties within its framework.
We are still ready to continue implementing our obligation in this
regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to adopt collective
measures which would guarantee the prohibition of assistance to
those who violate international law and the United Nations should
become engaged in observing the situation. All this should lead to
the immediate cessation of Israel's construction in Jabal Abu
Ghneim of eastern Jerusalem and of all other settlement
activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> China, Kyrgyz Presidents Vow to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is always willing to be "a
good friend, good neighbor and good partner" of Kyrgyzstan,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in talks with his Kyrgyz
counterpart Askar Akayev in Moscow today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang appreciated Kyrgyzstan's understanding and support for
China's position on some key issues including Taiwan, Tibet and
fighting against ethnic splittism, saying that the two neighbors
should strengthen cooperation on combating ethnic splittism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two countries have more and more in common,
and the long-term, stable development of friendly Sino-Kyrgyz
relations is both the strong desire of the two peoples and the
noble mission of the two countries' leaders.
</P>
<P>
Recalling Jiang's visit to Kyrgyzstan last year, Akayev said
the visit, a very successful one, has deeply impressed the Kyrgyz
people and forcefully enhanced the mutually beneficial cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has become a major trade partner of his
country, Akayev expressed satisfaction with the development of the
relations between China and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Regarding opposing splittism as a responsibility of the
international community, Akayev said that Kyrgyzstan unreservedly
denounces splittism and will take various measures to stop any
splittist activities against China in the country while increasing
cooperation with China in this field.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents met before signing an agreement on the
reduction of military forces along border areas between China,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hailed the agreement, which followed another agreement
signed a year ago on confidence building in the military field in
border areas of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the two documents, together with an agreement on border
areas between China and Kyrgyzstan, will not only be conducive to
consolidating and expanding the good-neighborly and friendly ties
but also be helpful to promoting prosperity and stability in
border areas between them.
</P>
<P>
They also set up a good model for establishing mutual trust
between nations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev agreed, saying the signing of the agreements filled the
whole Eurasian continent with a peaceful and friendly atmosphere.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- University of Zimbabwe students today
clashed with riot police as they embarked on a class boycott to press
their demands for payment of loans to all students.
</P>
<P>
The clashes left a trail of destruction. Rubble and litter
were strewn all over the campus, while roads were closed with
barricades made of rubbish bins, uprooted road signs and tree
branches.
</P>
<P>
Business at the institution had closed by nine a.m. as people
including the administrative staff fled from police teargas which
engulfed the whole campus.
</P>
<P>
A few students, however, still milled around the campus which
appeared to be calm by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
President of the Students Representative Council Learnmore Majongwe
told the Zimbabwe News Agency that students were riled by the
Ministry of Higher Education which had failed to meet their ultimatum
of a response to the students' demands within three days.
</P>
<P>
''We feel all students who applied for sponsorships must get money
because they are in need, but the ministry is insisting on vetting
them,'' said Majongwe.
</P>
<P>
The university has in the past been a scene of violence because of
the frequent running battles between students and the police. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Rising Prices of Staples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Prices of foodstuffs continued to
maintain an upward trend in Nigeria in the first quarter of this year
despite the deceleration of the overall inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) show
that the composite consumer price index stood at 2723.4 in February,
one percent up from 2697.7 recorded in January.
</P>
<P>
The January figure itself was a 1.1 percent rise from the 2668.8 in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
In the three-month period from December 1996 to February 1997,
according to FOS, the rise in the index was caused by upward movement
in the prices of food items, while prices of clothing, footwear,
household appliances and personal items fell slightly in most places.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate for February decelerated to 24.4 percent from 26.7
percent in January, a marked difference from the 28 percent in
December 1996 and 72 percent in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite the declining inflation rate, the increase in prices of
essentials reveals a dangerous trend in the country's economic life,
according to a FOS news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Items such as footwear, household appliances and even clothing can
be avoided by the poor class, while staples such as beans, yam and
plantains are essentials to the poor.
</P>
<P>
The result is that disposable income of the class continues to
diminish while the price decline in household appliances favors those
who can afford it, FOS said.

MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today hailed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
ongoing Russia tour as "a success."
</P>
<P>
Qian told a press conference here this afternoon that Jiang and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin discussed Wednesday the
bilateral political, military and economic relations as well as
major international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the heads of states was the fourth official

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides pledged to further promote
non-governmental exchanges and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that the agreement on reduction
of military forces in border areas between China and Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed today by President
Jiang and the other four presidents "is of great significance for
the peace and stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it is necessary for both China and Russia to
establish normal state-to-state relations, which will be most
beneficial to the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the current partnership between China and Russia
is neither a kind of alliance nor directed at any third party.
Instead, it will conduce to peace and stability of not only the
region but also the world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian is currently accompanying Jiang on a five-day visit to
Russia, which is scheduled to end on Saturday.

opened by Israeli forces at the town of kfar Tibnit from a nearby
position, according to the same sources.
</P>
<P>
The incidents took place less than 24 hours after a five-nation
committee supervising the implementation of a cease-fire in the
border area held a meeting in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura to discuss a complaint filed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that a roadside bomb which the Lebanese
guerrillas detonated, killed tow members of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon army militia and wounded one at Tair Harfa on April
14.
</P>
<P>
It added in the complaint that the three militiamen were on
vacation in a civilian vehicle when they were attacked by the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, during the Wednesday meeting in the headquarters of
the U.N. peace-keeping force in south Lebanon, the Lebanese
delegates argued that the operation was "legal" since it was aimed
at a vehicle transferring military men.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the cease-fire monitoring committee at
the end of its meeting simply said that "an exchange of views were
useful."
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the importance to "precisely comply with the
cease-fire understanding " which Israel and Lebanon reached on
April 26, 1996, barring the fighting parties in south Lebanon from
attacking civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
It was under the April understanding that the committee
comprising representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria
and the United States was set up.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery bombarded today vicinities of a number of
villages opposite the buffer enclave this morning, causing no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africans Strive to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The four-day 30th meeting of
World Tourism Organization (WTO) Regional Commission for Africa
entered its second day today. Participants will have a seminar on
safety and security for African quality tourism today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Africa recorded a 7 percent increase in arrivals in 1996 which
amounted to 20.6 million, whereas receipts rose more steeply with 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
As sub-regional level, North Africa remains the leading inter-
national tourist destination and recorded the highest receipts. In
that sub-region, Morocco posted the best results compared to 1995,
with increases of 3.8 percent in arrivals and 9.9 percent in
receipts.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa, which comes second, recorded a slower growth
rate with only a 3.1 percent increase in arrivals in 1996
compared to 1995, as opposed to a 17.4 increase in 1995 compared
to 1994. The same trend is observed in receipts which rose less
fast in 1996 than in 1995, at a rate of 8 percent, whereas the
growth rate in 1995 was 14.2 percent compared to 1994. South
Africa is still the sub-region's top tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
East Africa, where the fastest growth rate in arrivals in the
African region was recorded with 9 percent between 1995 and 1996,
occupies a third place. It also recorded the region's greatest gains
in tourism receipts in 1996 with 13.4 percent. Kenya recorded the
highest tourism receipts in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
West Africa recorded the second-
fastest growth rate in the African region for both arrivals and
receipts. However, central Africa remains the least-visited region.
Tourist arrivals and receipts in 1996 showed a downward trend
compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The above progress was the result of most African countries which
pay more attention to the industry and take a series of measures to
develop tourism. During the past year, five meetings related
to tourism were held in Africa, such as tourism training in Morocco,
tourims statistics in Morocco and Zimbabwe, the new information
technologies in Cote d'Ivoire and the management and financing of
wildlife parks for toruism in Tanzania. Meetings were also organized
in Lesotho, Tunisia, Senegal and Madagascar to promote the develop-
ment of tourism in Africa last year. A cultural tourism
program on ''the Slave Route'' was organized last year to enhance
awareness internatioanlly of the history of the slave trade and to
encourage tourists to discover the relevant sites and monuments
existing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, African tourism has indeed lagged behind of the world
tourism. The available statistics show that in 1996,
international tourist arrivals reached nearly 594 million, while
receipts from international travel climbed to 425 billion US
dollars. Africa's shares were only 20.6 million arrivals and 8
billion dollars receipts, representing only 3.5 percent and 1.8
percent of the world total respectively. Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada pointed out that ''this is all the more worrying
because as we all realize, in 1975 the corresponding figure for
Africa's share was 3.1 percent of global receipt, thus indicating
the fact since then there has been a precipitate decline in what
has already been a small share that africa had in the global
tourism market.''
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO forecasts, world tourism will continue to
grow by an average of 4 percent a year for the rest of the decade to
reach 700 million international arrivals and over 600 billion
dollars by the year 2000. African countries must catch up with the
world development trend and give priority to tourism industry. As
the meeting stressed, the meaningful and effective growth and
development of the tourism industry in Africa is heavily dependent,
among others, on improvement of infrastructures, the establishment
of adequate toruism facilities and the enhancement of intra-
African tourism as well as sub-regional cooperation in marketing
and promotion. Meanwhile, matters relating to peace and security
in the continent should also be given the priority.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Africa has great potentialities for development of its
tourism. Firstly, its scenic spots and historial sites as well as
its ancient folk customs, are destinations of international
arrivals. Secondly, tourism has been become main sources of foreign
exchange for many African countries and Africans have experiences
on development the industry. Thirdly, most of African countries gave
priority to develop tourism in recent years. They increased investmen
to the industry and encourage foreign and private investment. They
also strengthen cooepration among them in the industry. Fourthly,
the political situation in the continent is going stabler and stabler
in the past years and this is the pre-condition for development of
tourism in Africa. African tourism certainly can make greater
contribution to economic development in the continent if African
countries continue to create peace environment and fully use their
natural and manpower resources. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Slams UN Assembly's Debate of Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel today slammed the
United Nations General Assembly for holding a special debate on
its controversial Jewish settlement project in East Jerusalem's
Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Palestinian and Arab representatives, the
Assembly is holding a two-day special session late today to
debate the Har Homa project. This is the fourth time that the
international body has discussed the issue, which caused the
current deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Eitan Ben-Tsur, Director-General of Israeli Foreign Ministry,
said that the debate was "unnecessary and damaging". He criticized
the U.N. for misusing its role, stressing the differences between
Israel and the Palestinian side should only be resolved through
direct negotiations between them.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of issuing yet another condemnation of Israel, the
U.N. would be better served by using its influences to encourage
the parties to solve their differences in direct negotiations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has already debated the Har Homa
issue twice and the General Assembly once. But the United States
vetoed two Security Council resolutions which demanded Israel to
stop the controversial housing project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, the Palestinian representative to the U.N.
was proposing a draft resolution calling on all countries to
bar any assistance to Israeli public and private establishments
involved in the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
However, David Peleg, acting head of Israeli mission to the
U.N., told Israel Radio that the European Union (EU) is lobbying
for toning down the resolution. "It (the resolution) is expected
to be more moderate as a result of the EU lobbying efforts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the speakers will emphasize their support to the peace
process, and we will not support the draft resolution, which has
been prepared, which is very one-sided," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel began the Jewish Settlement construction work in Har Homa
of southeastern Jerusalem in late March, despite strong Palestinian
protests and international pressure. The peace process has since
grounded to a halt, leading to violent clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers across
the Palestinian territories.

achievments that have been realised in the co-operation over the past
one year and endorse the proposed EAC Development Strategy for
1997/2000.

co-operation into a comprehensive action program, spelling out
priority areas and time-frame for implementation," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>

mid-term program establishing a single market and investment area for
the region and giving priority to development of regional economic
infrastructure and enhancement of technical capabilities.
</P>
<P>

co-operation have been implemented in several areas including
immigration, finance, security, communications and transport, labour,
touurism, higher education and co-operation among national assemblies
of the three countries.  enditem

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Time and venue for the
long-awaited direct peace talks between Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila could be determined
soon, said South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly in Cape Town today, Pahad
said Kabila had reiterated his commitment to the South African
government on Wednesday that he is willing to meet Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mobutu's special envoy Honore Ngbanda arrived in
South Africa on Wednesday to convey a message to Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki that the Zairean government also remained committed
to such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, now remains only the question of when and where the
talks should be held, said the South African deputy foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said the South African government would have
consultations with Mahomed Sahnoun, United Nations Special Envoy
to Zaire and the Great Lakes region, and other interested
role-players to "finally determine the time and venue for this
very important summit."
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun was expected to return to South Africa tonight from
his visit to Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that Mobutu was willing to meet
Kabila, but the 66-year-old ailing president might not travel to
South Africa for the talks because of his ill health.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity all showed their beliefs that a negotiated solution

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Closer Sino-Russian Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the Sino-Russian economic and trade ties must be
improved to keep pace with the development of the political
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Talking with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin here
this afternoon, Jiang said cooperation in the economic and trade
field between the two countries enjoys exceptional geographic
advantages and the two economies are largely complementary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Chernomyrdin that both he and President Boris
Yeltsin have considered it necessary to make efforts to increase
economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, both our two countries should have farther
foresight on such an issue," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang held that the two countries are capable of launching
more large- and medium-sized long-term cooperation projects,
adding that a series of proposals have been put forward by the
Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include setting up economic and technological
development zones in Russia, opening a China trade center in
Moscow, establishing a coordination committee of border economic
and trade cooperation and signing a framework agreement on
Sino-Russian long-term trade, Jiang said, adding that he expects
the Russian side to consider those proposals positively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries can further expand cooperation
in the fields of nuclear energy, power generation, petroleum and
natural gas, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President expressed his hope that the two
countries' strategic coordination partnership will be deepened and
strengthened in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that Jiang's view on Sino-Russian economic
and trade ties is of guiding importance, to which the Russian side
attaches great importance.
</P>
<P>
At present, experts of the two countries are making feasibility
studies on some major projects and Russia is interested in taking
part in China's projects in nuclear power, petroleum, natural gas
and coal industries, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Russia has advanced technology in the fields of
space industry and pipeline transportation, Chernomyrdin said that
there exists great potential in economic, trade and technological
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Describing Jiang's visit to Russia as a milestone in bilateral
relations, Chernomyrdin said that it will remarkably facilitate
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang conveyed to Chernomyrdin greetings
from Chinese Premier Li Peng and said that Li expects to meet him
again. Chernomyrdin said that he expects to achieve positive
results during his coming visit to China, which is scheduled for
June.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Security Court Tries Israeli Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli textile worker and an
Egyptian charged with spying for the Jewish state stood trial at
the Egyptian Higher State Security Court today amid tight
security.
</P>
<P>
The court, after opening the first hearing, decided to adjourn
the case to May 18 while keeping the defendants in detention.
</P>
<P>
Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned
factory in Egypt, and Egyptian teacher Emad Abdul Hamid Ismail of
34, another defendant in the espionage case, pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
Azam, speaking from behind the bars at the first hearing
today, told reporters that he "is well-treated in prison" and has
been visited by his relatives and Israeli embassy officials here.
</P>
<P>
Azam, dressed in a long white robe, appeared in good health.
</P>
<P>
Ismail seemed a bit disturbed while swearing that the was
innocent, but he joined with Azam in expressing his confidence in
the "integrity" of the Egyptian judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli women, Zahra Yousef Greis and Mona Ahmed Shawahna,
who are at large in Israel, were tried in absentia with Azam and
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Policemen in riot gear were deployed inside and outside the
courtroom in the Bab el-Khalq area, which was crowded with
foreign and local reporters and people interested in the case.
</P>
<P>
The indictment bill said that Azam gave Ismail women's
underwar soaked in invisible ink to be used in sending secret
messages to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ismail was charged with helping the two women spies for
Israel's intelligence service Mossad in return for 1,000
U.S. dollars a month when he went to Israel in 1996 to conduct
training at a women's garments factory.
</P>
<P>
The bill demanded the arrest of Greis and Shawahna and asked
for the harshest possible penalty for all the defendants, which

Management and Resolution today donated 430,000 U.S. Dollars for
promoting Somalia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Ministry official Daniel Yifru said today
the project, a follow up of a two-month meeting of 26 Somali
factions, has won considerable support from the OAU Peace Fund.

He said the United Nations has given recognition to the Sodere
agreement, adding the U.N. Security Council yesterday responded
positively towards the implementation of the agreement.

<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The last convoy of Turkish
troops today left the Aegean city of Izmir for Albania to join a
multinational protection force to maintain security there, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that this was the third batch of the Turkish
troops to go to Albania within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The 310-strong Turkish force went to Tirana, capital of
Albania, by three airplanes of the Turkish Airlines for the
"Mission Alba," a move organized by the United Nations in a bid
to protect the security of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The first convoy of a 153-strong Turkish troops and six
vehicles went to Tirana by air last Wednesday and the second
batch of a 246-strong force together with four military ships
went to Albania last Sunday by sea.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is assigned to take charge of the security of Tirana,
the Tirana Airport and the northern part of Albania, and the
Turkish contingent is commanded by Marine Colonel Suleyman Bozkurt
with troops selected from specially-trained marine and commandos
of the Turkish Navy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Traffic Through Beira Corridor to Be Boosted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Traffic through Zimbabwe's
eastern gateway to the sea is expected to get a boost this year
from increased economic ties between the country and its
neighbor, Mozambique, the Beira Corridor Group (BCG) said today.
</P>
<P>
BCG Liaison Director Christopher Motley said the group, which
coordinates movement of traffic to the Mozambican port of Beira,
expected more Zimbabweans to use the corridor as several
bilateral agreements between the two neighbors came into effect.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Mozambique recently signed a joint commission
agreement which, among other things, cleared the way for the
long-awaited preferential trade agreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Satisfactory progress has also been made on the issue of road
transit and border charges and the transport ministers from both
sides are expected to meet next month to finalize negotiations on
a road transport services agreement.
</P>
<P>
Beira Port on the Indian Ocean handles cargo to and from the
southern African hinterland which ranges from foodstuff to coal.
</P>

It offers an important alternative route to the sea for goods
from landlocked Botswana, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Opinion Polls Show Labor Still Well Ahead of Tory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The opinion polls conducted by
Gallup and MORI showed Labor's lead is still well ahead of Tories
at 20 and 21 points respectively, which contradicts an ICM poll
Tuesday showing it slipping to 5 points.
</P>
<P>
According to Gallup today, voters still think opposition leader
Tony Blair would make a better prime minister than John Major, are
still convinced Labor would manage the economy better than the
Tories and still prefer Labor to the Tories.
</P>
<P>
Equally important, the "fear factor" continues to work strongly
in Labor's favor.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of people are worried about the possible
consequences of a Labor government under Blair but they are even
more worried about the possible consequences of a fifth
consecutive Tory government.
</P>
<P>
Gallup's findings also suggest that Labor support has remained
remarkably steady since the campaign began.
</P>
<P>
In the 18 rounds of the rolling poll so far, the proportion of
voters backing Labor has never risen above 53 percent or fallen
below 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to today's MORI's poll, more than a quarter of the
public believe that it is time for a change at this election, even
though "the government has built strong foundations for Britain's
economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
This reflected in a break in the traditionally close link
between changes in the MORI economic optimism index and in levels
of party support.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the break, observers here said that this is the
most worrying finding for the Tories in view of the strength of
the economy and the improvement in the "feel-good" factor.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that many voters are determined to get rid of the
Tories almost regardless of other influences, they added.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Denies Hidding Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Liberian warlord Charles
Taylor said today that he knew nothing about the hidden weapons
found by west Africa's peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, in a town
previously controlled by his faction.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG announced on Wednesday it discovered a large quantity
of hidden arms in Nimba County bordering Cote d'Voire, including
bombs and ammunitions, anti-aircraft guns, 105 mm guns and
anti-tank guns.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor said: "I know nothing about the hidden arms and
ammunition, and we dissociate ourselves from this act."
</P>
<P>
"This country must be weapon-free, and we encourage those who
may know about hidden arms anywhere in the country to report them
to ECOMOG," he said on a radio station he controls in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that the hidden arms and
ammunition were found in the northeastern border village of
Butuo, through which Taylor and his disbanded National Patriotic
Front of Liberia militia launched the civil war from Cote d'Voire
on December 24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu said on Wednesday
that his force was still interrogating the persons found guarding
the weapons, and that once enough information was gathered,
Charles Taylor would be summoned for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Malu declined to mention what action he would take if Taylor
was eventually implicated, but said that the situation would not
be a threat to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the January 30 deadline for Liberian faction fighters to
surrenders their arms, the peacekeepers in early March discovered
several trucks of arms in the house of Alhaji Kromah, leader of
another former warring faction, the United Liberation Movement.
</P>
<P>
Kromah was first arrested and to be prosecuted but was later
pardoned by ECOMOG for the sake of the continuance of the peace
process in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Both Taylor and Kromah have resigned as vice-chairmen of
Liberia's ruling Council of State to run for the presidency in
the general elections scheduled for coming May 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today promised the Senate that he would withdraw from the Chemical
Weapons Treaty if the the pact inadvertently results in the spread
of of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the guarantee in a letter to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott in order to gain the ratification of the treaty
by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Lott said, "This commitment is
unprecedented." The assurances had affected his thinking although
he still remained uncommitted on how to vote for the pact, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lott and Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, have been lobbying for not approving the treaty,
demanding amendments to the document.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote later today on the convention,
which is to take effect on April 29 with or without the U.S.'
participation. A two-thirds majority would be needed for
approval.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Clinton said he was "prepared to withdraw from
the treaty" if other countries used its provisions to proliferate
chemical weapons technology and endanger U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
Article 10 and 11 of the treaty require contracting parties to
provide chemical weapons defenses and call for exchanges of
peaceful chemicals and technology among the parties.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter aims easing the concerns of the opponents
about the provisions. Lott and Helms insist that some countries
may use the provisions to spread poison gas and attack the U.S.
chemical weapons technology.

LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
widened to 758 million pounds (1.2 billion US dollars) in February
from January's 535 million pound (872 million dollar) shortfall,
which was revised down from 641 million pounds (1.04 billion

</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said today that the figures

Exports in February fell by 1.4 percent to 14.164 billion
pounds (23 billion dollars) while imports rose by 0.2 percent to

</P>
<P>
Economists said that this was the first official data to show
clearly that exports are suffering as the strength of sterling
makes British goods more expensive abroad.

The figures were in line with recent business surveys showing

<HEADLINE> Czech President Rejects Return of Sudeten-Germans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Czech President Vaclav
Havel today ruled out the return of Sudeten-Germans who were
expelled from former Czechoslovakia in 1945.
</P>
<P>
He told the German parliament Bundestag in a speech that his
country could not accept the return of Sudeten-Germans.
</P>
<P>
"Just as Germany today cannot bring back to life tens of
thousands of Czech Nazi victims and turn the clock back to
1938..., the Czech Republic cannot give back the old homeland of
the expelled Germans," said Havel.
</P>
<P>
Former Czechoslovakia expelled about 3 million Sudeten-Germans
from territories where they had lived for centuries after World
War II. They were accused of having been traitors backing Adolf
Hitler's carve-up and occupation of the country since 1938.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Sudeten-Germans, their expulsion was a case
of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
In a welcoming speech for Havel, parliamentary leader Rita
Suessmuth noted that a natural resolution of the issue could be
expected after the Czech Republic was admitted into the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
EU citizens can settle and work in any of the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are the most likely to
become new EU and NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Today in Prague, the Czech press agency CTK reported that
Jewish leaders boycotted the Havel speech in protest, saying that
Germany's financial compensation for Czech-Jews subjected to Nazi
persecution was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
The compensation totaling 165 million marks (96 million US
dollars) for Nazi victims in the Czech Republic was pledged in a
German-Czech joint declaration signed earlier this year by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, in
which both countries expressed regret for the excesses of the
past.
</P>
<P>
The document, which was approved by Bundestag last February,
has been greeted in Germany except by Sudetens, who were irritated
by the accord's failure to mention their right to resettlement in
the Czech Republic and measures for making up their losses of
properties.
</P>
<P>
Havel today also hailed the joint declaration in his address,
saying the accord had liberated German-Czech relations and created
a foundation for improving bilateral cooperation at the European
level. The Czech president called for efforts towards better
future relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Unity of Lebanese Labor Unions Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The unity of Lebanon's powerful
Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU) was threatened following today's
elections in which both two candidates for the chairmanship, one
backed by the government and another an outspoken dissenter,
claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the outcome of the elections at a press conference,
Minister of Labor Assaad Hardan described the polls in which the
pro-government trade unionist Ghaneem Zoghbi came out as a winner
as "legitimate."
</P>
<P>
"The elections which were held under the supervision of the
labor ministry were legitimate and what they resulted were
legitimate," Hardan said, noting that the elections were the only
one held "according to the rules and under the legal roof."
</P>
<P>
Zoghbi announced that 33 of totally 54 representatives from 27
trade unions voted in his favor, making him the new chairman
of the CTU.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the polls started in the confederation's
headquarters at exactly 11:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT) as scheduled and
under the Labor Ministry's supervision.
</P>
<P>
Elias Abu Rizk, the CTU's incumbent chairman, however,
announced that he obtained 24 votes from 44 representatives of 22
trade unions in the polls which were held hours before the
government-sponsored elections started.
</P>
<P>
"The labor ministry did not intervene because there was no role
for it in these elections and other elections except these are
illegal," added Abu Rizk, who has reportedly caused repeated
headaches for the government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday night, the government launched a tight security
dragnet across central Beirut, sealing off all approaches to the
CTU's headquarters at the residential neighborhood there.
</P>
<P>
Only officials of the Labor Ministry and the CTU were allowed
to get through the cordon to take part in what the leftist
Beirut daily As-Safir called an "unprecedented bone-breaking
showdown" between the government and the current leftist
leadership of the confederation under Abu Rizk.
</P>
<P>
Just five days before the elections taking place, the
ministry declared the admission of five new trade unions into the
confederation, upping the number of the 44-man electoral caucus to
54, a move which would inevitably strip Abu Rizk of any chance to
win the competition.
</P>
<P>
The desperate Abu Rizk claimed that the admission was unlawful
and insisted only the 44 representatives of the original 22 trade
unions be eligible voters.

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The prosecution today opened
its case in Denver against Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy
McVeigh, accusing him of murdering innocent men, women and
children in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chief prosecutor Joseph Hartzler told the jury of seven men and
five women that McVeigh wanted to send a message.
</P>
<P>
"The truck (carrying the bomb) was there to impose the will of
Timothy McVeigh on the rest of America," media reports quoted
Hartzler as telling the jurors.
</P>
<P>
He said McVeigh was going to carry out his plan "by murdering
innocent men, women and children... to see blood flow in the
streets of America."
</P>
<P>
McVeigh is accused of bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal
government building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people,
including 19 children. He has pleaded not guilty and faces death
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Security was heavy today around the federal complex that houses
the courthouse in downtown Denver.
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Richard Matsch explained the procedure of the
trial. He said that a television camera in the courtroom did not
show jurors' faces and was only telecasting the proceedings by
closed circuit to Oklahoma City.

<HEADLINE> US Republicans Urge More New Members in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. House of
Representatives Republicans today introduced a bill calling for
membership of Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that such countries not be left in any security
vacuum," said Benjamin Gilman, one of the bill's sponsors and
chairman of the International Relations Committee of the House.
</P>
<P>
"Our bill goes on to express the sense of Congress that
Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to join
NATO as soon as they satisfy all of the relevant criteria," Gilman
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The bill would require President Bill Clinton to seek NATO
membership for the countries and provide aid to help them meet
military and democratic policy requirements for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also declare U.S. policy against NATO's pledge
not to station nuclear weapons or permanent combat troops in the
new members.
</P>
<P>
Gilman said they introduced the bill because they "worry that
in the rush to mollify Russia, concessions may be made that could
jeopardize European security and the effectiveness of NATO" and
nations that may be left out of the first round of expansion could
be "in a security vacuum."
</P>
<P>
The alliance is to invite the first group of countries, most
likely Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia to join in
July at its special summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which is strongly opposed to the expansion, is
negotiating an agreement with NATO to set their future relations.

LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Just a week ahead of the May 1
election, the ruling Conservatives are fighting hard to gain
ground in the election campaign to achieve a miracle of fifth term
of office.
</P>
<P>
Making the economy center stage in their election campaign,

its spending plans of 12 billion pounds (19 billion dollars) that
would have to be filled by raising taxes.

If the Labor won, there would be an emergency July budget with
higher taxes or borrowing, Major said.

<P>
"Labor must level with the British people, tell the truth about
what they would do," Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Tony Blair insisted there would be no income
tax rises from his party.
</P>
<P>
Voters have a stark choice: a new start under Labor or the same
old Tories, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"New Labor means a new future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party, which is still lagging far behind the
Labor in polls and is trying desperately to take the initiative,
today also accused Blair of "despicable lies."
</P>
<P>
"Everything he says, every twist he makes, every word he speaks
is a deliberate deception planned months and months ago to divert
attention from the real issues," Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell
told reporters at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The tougher the questioning, the more he panics. The more he
panics, the more he lies -- bare-faced, despicable lies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major, at his daily news conference, appealed to voters to give
his government credit for Britain's low inflation and falling
employment and said Labor's itch to raise taxes risked derailing
the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
But Blair hit back, saying, "You have had 18 years to put this
country right, and we say 18 years is enough -- go."

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Called Upon to Ensure Access to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday, "in the strongest possible terms", called upon the
Zairean rebel force to ensure unrestricted access by all
humanitarian relief agencies for the provision of aid in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the rebel force, the Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire (ADFL), to guarantee the
safety of relief workers, refugees and other affected civilians in
their controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by President Antonio Monteiro of
Portugal, the council called upon the ADFL and the government of
Rwanda to cooperate fully and immediately with the United Nations
Commissioner for Refugees to enable an early implementation of the
repatriation plan for eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Expressing particular alarm over reports of massacres and other
serious violations of human rights in eastern Zaire, the Council
called upon the ADFL and others concerned in the region to
cooperate fully with and ensure unimpeded site-access for the
recently established United nations investigative mission.
</P>
<P>
The Council also reiterated its full support for the United
Nations five-point peace plan to bring about a negotiated
settlement for Zaire and called for an immediate cessation of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the government of Zaire and the ADFL to engage
seriously and fully in the search for a speedy political solution
to the problems in Zaire, including transitional arrangements
leading to the holding of democratic and free elections with the
participation of all parties.

<HEADLINE> US Woman Gives Birth to Healthy Baby Girl at 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A woman 63 years and nine months
old recently gave birth to a healthy baby girl, surpassing the
world record-holder who was a woman in Italy but younger by months
than the woman in the Los Angeles area of California.
</P>
<P>
This case, reported in the current issue of the journal
Fertility and Sterility, raised questions about whether there
should be an age limit for pregnancy and, if so, who decided that
a woman is too old to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
The woman was well past menopause, and she became pregnant
using a donated egg from a much younger woman. For long, medical
scientists have believed that women reached the age of 50 or so,
pregnancy wastage might be high, the uterus might not be fit to
carry a baby. But now the old woman' successful pregnancy
demonstrates that any woman who has a uterus can potentially
become pregnant with a donated egg, as long as it comes from a
relatively young woman. Women who have gone through menopause are
just as likely as younger women to become pregnant using donor
eggs and their babies are just as healthy.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croat Leaders Unhappy with Izetbegovic Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Top Bosnian Croat officials on
Thursday complained that the Muslim partners had not consulted
with them in sending a letter to the international community on
the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member of the Bosnian president,
Neven Tomic, deputy co-chairman of the council of ministers and
foreign minister Jadranko Prlic, said that they had learned only
through media that Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the presidency
and Haris Silajdzic presented the letter to representatives of the
Contact Group and other international circles on April 21.
</P>
<P>
The letter by Izetbegovic and Silajdzic expressed their
concerns over the slow implementation of Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The complaint by Croat leaders was raised in their letter to
the same representatives of the international community, according
to local TV and press reports.
</P>
<P>
The Croats' letter said that since no Croat official
participated in the drafting of the Izetbegovic-Silajdzic letter,
it represented only the position of one constitutive nation.
</P>
<P>
The Croat leaders also stressed that they did not agree with
all the stances in the letter presented by the Muslim side, who
listed nine areas where provisions of the Dayton accords are
either violated or implemented slowly.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Croat leaders' letter, Silajdzic said that
the differences between Croats and Muslims with regard to the
subject are more of style than in content.

<P>
SANAA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
reiterated here today that the parliamentary elections, due on
Sunday, will be conducted in a free and clean atmosphere on the
basis of equality among all political parties and forces in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, President Saleh said that
international observers from a number of friendly countries and
other non-governmental organizations will supervise the elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the new house of representatives to replace the old one
will embrace 301 members.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Yemen after elections, and the impact of the
boycott of elections by the Yemeni Socialist party, Saleh said
"the future of Yemen is bright."
</P>
<P>
He added that by boycotting the elections or the democratic
process, the main opposition Socialist party is isolating itself.
</P>
<P>
"We have welcomed the Socialist party and tried to help it ever
since July 7, 1994, when it proclaimed war and separation," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the ruling People's Congress Party and its
coalition partner the Islah Party have already divided the
constituences between them, the president said the two parties
will coordinate during the elections.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that all will be done to prevent any
friction from undermining the safety and cleanliness of the
election process.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections in Yemen will be contested by 12
parties for 301 seats.
</P>
<P>
Four parties are boycotting the elections -- namely, the Yemen
Socialist Party, the Unionist Grouping party, the League of
Yemenites, and the Union of Popular Forces.

<HEADLINE> Joint Jordanian-US Military Committee Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The joint Jordanian-U.S. military
committee concluded its works here today after reaching an
agreement preliminarily on providing Jordan with further military
requirements.
</P>
<P>
An official Jordanian source who declined to be named described
the two-day talks as successful and fruitful, saying that the
U.S. side had expressed the readiness to respond to all of
Jordan's military requests, in accordance with a definite program
to be examined later.
</P>
<P>
The same source affirmed that the two parties had worked out
a joint program for land, naval and air force exercises during the
current year, adding the scenes of these military exercises as
well as the volume of the participating forces had also been
determined.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. side had stressed during the
talks that the U.S. Administration was committed to its pledges
to deliver 16 fully-equipped F-16 fighters to Jordan and to
consider additional equipment to the warplanes before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The current session of the committee was jointly chaired by
Field Marshal Abdul Hafiz Mara'i Al Qaabana, chief of the General
Staff of the Royal Armed Forces of Jordan, and by Fred Smith,
U.S. First Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Smith arrived in the Jordanian capital of Amman Tuesday heading
an official delegation of the U.S. Defense and State Departments,
and left here this evening upon the conclusion of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. provided Jordan with a C-130H military cargo plane
last February, and in December last year, it also delivered arms
worth 100 million dollars to its Arab ally, including 18
helicopters, 50 tanks, military vehicles, two boats, 100
binoculars for night military reconnaissance, besides other
equipment, rifles and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In fact, U.S. President Bill Clinton has pledged to offer
300-million-U.S. dollar military assistance to strengthen the
capability of the Jordanian Armed Force.
</P>
<P>
The Arab kingdom has been granted non-NATO alliance status,
enabling it with more access to U.S. military equipment.

<HEADLINE> China To Form Independent Auditing Standards System by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Since 1994, the Chinese Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) has been busy setting
China's Independent Auditing Standards (CIASs) for the country's
certified public accountants.
</P>
<P>
So far, two sets of standards comprised of 27 rules have been
published, and the whole CIAS system is expected to be completed
around the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianming, Deputy Director of the Standards Division of
CICPA, made the announcement today in Beijing at the opening of an
international symposium titled "Into the 21st Century -- China's
Economic Reform and Liberalization of Accounting Services."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chen outlined China's current efforts to
formulate CIASs. In 1994, CICPA established a special task force,
China's Independent Auditing Standards Group, to carry out the
work, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objectives of setting CIASs include
establishing authoritative standards for Chinese public
accountants in performing independent audits, meant to define
their responsibilities and safeguard the legitimate rights and
interests of the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The group has consulted local accounting institutes and other
departments across the country during the process of formulating
the rules, Chen said. The group has always worked to introduce
mainstream international practices, adapt to China's situation and
give priority to international standards, he noted.
</P>
<P>
His speech also covered the differences between CIASs and
international standards.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is jointly sponsored by CICPA and the Hong
Kong Society of Accountants. Participants include Chinese and
overseas accounting experts and senior officials from the Chinese
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton
here at noon today and discuss bilateral relations including
defense and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Kunihiko Saito, Japan's ambassador in Washington, has said that
Hashimoto's talks with Clinton will cover four large areas. Apart
from the bilateral relationship, they will discuss Asia-Pacific
issues and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 100,000 U.S. troops deployed in Asia are
based in Japan. Moreover, Japan's ports and military airfields
would become as vital to the United States in a regional emergency
as did Saudi Arabian facilities during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Hashimoto and Clinton are expected to discuss a
longer-term review of U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation guidelines
that is slated to be completed by fall.
</P>
<P>
Trade issue is also expected on the agenda as the U.S. trade
deficit with Japan, though falling by 19 percent last year, is
likely to widen again due largely to a weak yen that makes
Japanese products cheaper and a strong dollar that makes U.S.-made
goods more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has urged Hashimoto in a letter to stabilize Tokyo's
financial system and reduce the country's trade deficit with the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Baker Arrives in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy to the
Western Sahara James Baker arrived here this morning from the
Moroccan capital Rabat on a short visit to Algeria for talks with
the country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Baker was received at the Algiers International Airport by
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf.
</P>
<P>
His tour of the region aims to conduct consultations with the
leaders of the region on obstacles facing the peace plan which was
initiated by the U.N. in 1992 to settle the Western Sahara
dispute, according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has long been pushing for a referendum among the
Western Saharans to determine if the former Spanish colony should
be independent from or intergrate with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Morocco claims the vast desert territory was part of Morocco
long before Spanish colonization and wants to base the referendum
among the land's current population.
</P>
<P>
However, the Polisario Front, which has been locked in a war
with Morocco for decades, insists the vote should be held among
74,000 residents counted in a 1974 Spanish census.
</P>
<P>
The Polisario Front is believed to have enjoyed support from
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters upon his arrival at the airport, Baker
said he would offer new proposals worked out by the U.N. Secretary
General on the Western Sahara peace process. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Baker, former United States Secretary of State, was nominated
by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan special envoy to the Western
Sahara with a view to getting the region out of the prevailing
no-peace no-war state.
</P>
<P>
The projected referendum was originally scheduled for 1992, but
the row among parties concerned delayed the process. The
U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in March 1993, urging
the polling to be held by the end of that year. However, it
remains on paper so far.
</P>
<P>
Algiers is Baker's second leg in the tour, which will also lead
him to Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Baker held talks over the past two days with Moroccan King
Hassan II and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdullatif
Al-Filali. The talks were seen as a new U.N.move to push forward
the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, no details of the meetings were given.
</P>
<P>
Baker is scheduled to table a report on his tour to Annan
before the U.N. Security Council meets next month to decide on the
destination of the U.N. peace-keeping troops in the Western
Sahara. The term of the mission ends in May.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Talks About Tasks for Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Education reform is the key to
achieving China's goal for education development by the end of the
century, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said today in a public lecture.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid progress made in education since China adopted
the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, the country has set the
overall goal of first popularizing the nine-year compulsory
education system and eradicating illiteracy among young and
middle-aged people by the end of the century, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"This will lay the foundation for China's endeavor to improve
the quality of the whole nation and cultivate trans-century
personnel," noted Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that limited education funding presents the
biggest obstacle to accomplishing this goal in China, a developing
country with the world's largest population, and reform of its
education system to improve quality and efficiency is the only
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the eastern part of the country has nearly
reached the goal, and the government will focus its efforts on the
12 provinces in the central and western parts starting this year.
</P>
<P>
A major issue in elementary education is the shift from
"education aimed at achieving high exam scores" to "education for
improvement of students' quality," which is urgently needed for
China's elementary education system and is also a far-reaching
transformation goal in the field, the vice-premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that elementary education should be aimed at
developing all-round qualities in students, such as moral
standards, academic achievement, cultural accomplishments and
physical condition.

<P>
On the importance of occupational education, Li called it a
pillar for economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
He urged all of society to support the development of
occupational education, which is "of great significance to giving
the young more chances to become useful people, providing more job
opportunities, and helping deepen the reform of enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Under the overall planning and management of the government, he
added, enterprises, institutions and other social sectors are
responsible for establishing occupational training facilities in
China, with proper funding and support and other means from the
government.
</P>
<P>
China aims to have 60 percent to 70 percent of its middle
school graduates receive middle-level occupational education and
training, 30 to 40 percent of them enter high schools, and 40
percent of high school graduates admitted into colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the ongoing reform of the management over college
education, the vice-premier remarked, the quality and efficiency
of colleges and universities are being improved as a result of a
more reasonable distribution of teaching resources.
</P>
<P>
He called on leaders in different regions and government
departments, as well as those in colleges and universities, to
continue to promote the reform.
</P>
<P>
A good education system relies on qualified teachers, Li
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The key to improving teachers' overall quality is better
professional education for teachers, on-the-job training, and
sending more qualified young cadres in government departments to
help with teaching in less-developed areas for a certain period of
time, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged government departments to show more
concern for teachers' working and living conditions, including
ensuring salaries not below the standards for public servants as
stipulated by law, timely payment of wages, and adequate housing.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, China invested nearly 37 billion yuan (4.46
billion US dollars) in building some 740,000 apartments for
teachers, improving the average per capita housing space for
teachers' families from 6.6 sq m in 1992 to the present eight sq
m., according to the vice-premier.

<HEADLINE> Experts Optimistic over China's Economy Development in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts from top Chinese
universities and the state economic management departments have
expressed their optimism over the country's economic development
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the national economic goal of advancement
based on stability will be reached, and China's economy will be
ushered into a new era characterized by stable growth at an
"appropriately rapid speed."
</P>
<P>
They expressed their views at the "Spring Seminar on
Forecasting 1997 Economic Situations" which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
According to their analysis, there are a number of favorable
conditions for China's economic growth in 1997:
</P>
<P>
-- pressure of high inflation is eased after three years'
macro-economic control, and the country's "relatively stringent
financial policy" has shown its effectiveness;
</P>
<P>
-- market demands have been increased and are expected to rise
continuously;
</P>
<P>
-- major grain harvests in 1995 and 1996 have provided
sufficient guarantees for industrial production and rising of
people's living standards;
</P>
<P>
-- industries of transportation, energy and communications have
been strengthened to ease China's long-time bottleneck of the
development of the national economy;
</P>
<P>
-- foreign reserve has been up, which leaves the central
government better equipped to make use of the international market
and conduct macro-level economic control; and
</P>
<P>
-- the world economy is picking up, which is also conducive to
the sustained, rapid and healthy development of China's national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Scholars also pointed out the problems and contradictions China
still faces, such as the inability of quite a number of
state-owned enterprises to adapt to the market, as well as the
similarities of many places in regard to economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The annual seminars on forecasting China's economic development
 have been co-sponsored by the State Statistics Bureau, the China
Academy of Social Sciences and several economic management
departments of the state.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Vaccine Test Successful in Gambia to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A large field trial in Gambia has
shown that a conjugate vaccine against the bacterium Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib) prevents both pneumonia and meningitis
resulting from this bacterium in young children.
</P>
<P>
This information was contained in a press release by the World
Health Organization (WHO) today.
</P>
<P>
In the trial, 42,848 infants were assigned at random to receive
either the Hib polysaccharide-tetanus protein conjugate vaccine
(PRP-T) mixed with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP), or
DTP alone (the control group) at ages two, three and four months.
Children in the study who developed meningitis or pneumonia were
investigated to see if it was due to the Hib bacterium.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the study, 50 cases, proven by bacterial culture,
had been identified among children in the study. There were 20
cases among children who had received three doses of vaccine, 19
in the control group and one in those who had received the PRP-T
vaccine, indicating a vaccine efficacy in fully vaccinated
children of 95 percent. Consequently, the vaccine efficacy for the
prevention of Hib pneumonia was estimated to be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among children in the study there were 449 episodes of
pneumonia with severe x-ray changes. Those children who had
received PRP-T vaccine had 20 percent less of these episodes,
indicating that 20 percent of episodes of severe pneumonia in
those children were due to Hib and were prevented by the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
"The value of this vaccine in African infants has now been
proven. In Asia there are still doubts about the true burden of
Hib disease and this is currently under investigation," Dr Kim
Mulholland, of WHO's Child Health and Development (CHD) and
Vaccine Research and Development (VRD) programs, who was the
principal investigator in the study.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge ahead now is to provide this highly effective
vaccine at reasonable cost to the children who need it most, those
living in developing countries," he said.

HELSINKI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of the teams for the
1998 World Ice Hockey Championships will be increased to 16 from
12, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) said here on
Friday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The 16 teams in next year's championship will include the top
11 teams from this year's championship and host Switzerland,
Japan, B pool champions Belarus and two more teams from a

<HEADLINE> Bonn Vows to Bring Maglev Train in Operation in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- German Transportation Minister
Matthias Wissmann today reaffirmed Bonn's commitment to the
construction of a magnetic levitation rail link between Hamburg
and Berlin despite the soaring costs and an uncertain market.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the nay-saying, the Transrapid is on course,"
Wissmann said, referring to the high-speed magnetic levitation
train designed by a German engineer which can run at about 400
kilometer per hour.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been planning to build a 292-kilometer high-speed
railway link between Hamburg and Berlin using the Transrapid
train, which would cover the distance in about one hour.
</P>
<P>
However, a revised project study issued by Wissmann Friday
showed that the investment costs of the project would run up to
9.8 billion marks (5.7 billion U.S. dollars), 10 percent higher
than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
The report also lowered projections of annual revenues from
1.15 billion marks (670 million dollars) to between 700 to 900
million marks (411 to 529 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the future of the Transrapid link, three
construction firms have announced their pullout of the project,
leaving the private consortium which would operate the Transrapid
with just three companies -- Thyssen Industrie, Siemens and
Adtranz.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised plan, instead of the three construction
companies, now the German Railways (DB) will be in charge of
building the track, for which the German federal government will
provide 6.1 billion marks (3.5 billion dollars) in financing.
</P>
<P>
Wissmann said construction of the track would be opened to
European partners, with the DB serving as the contractor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DB would operate and market the overall
Transrapid system, Wissmann said, adding that the new concept had
been backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo
Waigel.
</P>
<P>
Opponents to the Transrapid include economic and transportation
experts who voiced concern over its costs and its ability to
attract enough passengers. Backers, however, believe that the
Transrapid could be a potential export hit.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the controversies, Wiessmann said the project would
create 18,000 jobs during the construction phase and 4,400
permanent jobs.

<HEADLINE> Bell Canada to Build Own Giant R&AMP;D Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest telephone company
Bell Canada will launch its own software research and development
lab within six weeks, according to president John McLennan.
</P>
<P>
Though details on the size or budget of the lab has not been
revealed, the lab will rank as "Canada's second-largest privately
owned R&AMP;D complex," McLennan was quoted as saying by today's Globe
and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bell is ready to invest "dramatically more money in R&AMP;D than
ever before," McLennan noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it would need a budget in the hundreds of
millions of dollars to be a player with the scope envisaged by the
president.
</P>
<P>
Bell Canada now owns a 30-percent stake in Canada's largest
private R&AMP;D complex, Ottawa-based Bell-Northern Research Ltd.
(BNR).
</P>
<P>
BNR employs over 17,000 scientists, engineers and technologists
worldwide and of that 9,000 are employed in Canada. Its budget
last year was more than 1.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proposed software lab won't be as large, but its
establishment stands to rank as one of most pivotal events for
Canada's high-tech sector since BNR was created.
</P>
<P>
Several factors have propelled Bell to form its own software
lab, including the advent of local competition, growth of the
Internet, the reduction of long-distance prices and greater
choices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Apart from creating new services for all of Canada's telephone
companies, the new lab will also generate numerous spinoffs and
tap lucrative export markets, McLennan said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Likely to Attain Self-Sufficiency in Salt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is likely to attain
self-sufficiency in salt this year as has been indicated by the
producers from different areas, industry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Salt production in Dutubdia, Maheskhali, Teknaf and Chokoria of
Chittagong and Cox's Bazar salt regions has already reached
523,ooo metric tons from December last to this month, said an
official of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation
(BSCIC).
</P>
<P>
"The salt production rate is quite satisfactory," the official
said, adding that more than 300,000 tons of salt was expected to
be produced over the next two months if weather remains favorable.
</P>
<P>
The salt production target for the fiscal 1996-97 was fixed at
800,000 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh's total demand for salt is 780,000 metric
tons. Of the total, 612,000 tons goes for human consumption,
55,000 tons for livestock and fish cultivation and 113,000 tons
for industrial raw materials and other purposes.

<HEADLINE> French Parties Start Campaign, Socialist Win Not Excluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- As France's ruling majority parties
and the opposition Socialist Party have kicked off their campaign
for the legislative elections scheduled for May 25 and June 1,
observers do not exclude a possible victory by the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party, today
turned down an invitation by the French Television One to have a
four-party debate with Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who is the
president of the ruling Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR),
Francois Leotard, head of RPR's ally of the Union for French
Democracy (UDF), and the national secretary of the Communist Party,
Robert Hue.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said he prefers a face-to-face debate with Juppe in
order to convey a clear message to the French people.
</P>
<P>
When starting his legislative campaign Thursday evening, the
Socialist leader described the balance sheet of the government
over the past two years as "a patent failure."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Juppe said Thursday evening during his campaign tour
in Marseille that the Socialist Party is a party which "mistakes
the century."
</P>
<P>
However, a close friend of President Jacques Chirac today
warned that the opposition Socialists could score a victory in the
elections, because of the strong opposition by the people to the
government's policy of launching the Euro "at all costs."
</P>
<P>
Writer Denis Tillinac told the daily Parisien today that one
should not "under-estimate" Jospin, who he said "is a very
valuable man" and understands "the fatal risk of Euro at all
costs."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if the French people feel that the
dissolution of parliament by President Chirac is only a "political
maneuver" aimed at securing the launching of the Euro, the ruling
majority will lose the elections.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a poll by the CSA polling institute published in Le
Nouvel Economiste showed that a majority of French people think
that Chirac has "renounced" the promises he made during the 1995
presidential election campaign in salary raise, employment and
health spending.
</P>
<P>
But a poll by the IPSOS institute published on Thursday said
that the ruling majority will maintain 292 seats in the 577-seat
National Assembly (parliament), where the absolute majority is 289
seats.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Help Pakistan Establish Debt Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will provide a loan of 300 million US dollar to the
Pakistani government for creating a long-term debt market as well
as a secondary market in the country.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry today in Karachi, Sadiq Zaidi, an ADB
representative, said the main cause of slow industrial progress in
Pakistan is absence of long-term credit policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to introduce capital market reforms in
Pakistan," he was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as
saying, adding that "ADB is trying to create a long-term debt
market to cater to the needs of local industry."
</P>
<P>
Investment schemes are not successful in Pakistan as the
country lacks a secondary market, he said. Many projects, started
with private investment, were gravely affected due to
non-availability of a secondary market, said Zaidi.
</P>
<P>
"We are advocating to create a secondary market so that the
development projects, for which investments are raised, may not be
affected," Zaidi added.

<HEADLINE> China To Immunize Children Among "Floating" People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China, observing National
Immunization Day, launched a nationwide campaign today to immunize
children who were not vaccinated against infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Medical workers across the country will deliver oral polio
vaccine to unvaccinated children under the age seven, or give them
injections of pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, and measles
vaccines, throughout the week to come.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will mainly target children among the migrant or
"floating" people, children whose births are not included in the
family planning quota, and those live in remote and poor areas,
according to Zhou Jun, an official with the Ministry of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Public Health and Beijing
municipal government, and representatives of the World Health
Organization and UNICEF participated in the vaccination activity
which was held in Huaxiang Town in Beijing's southern outskirts
today.
</P>
<P>
Local medics of the town, where many transient people live,
provided vaccines to children and handed out materials to spread
knowledge of immunization.
</P>
<P>
"We felt the urgency to conduct the vaccination program among
these children because they may become a potential risk to cause
outbreak of some infectious diseases," said Yin Dakui,
vice-minister of public health.
</P>
<P>
Low immunization coverage rate in some areas has led to rising
incidence of measles, and even a measles epidemic there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trends of migration from rural to urban areas in recent years
have brought many Chinese away from their hometowns, and also the
shelter of local health care and immunization system.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of awareness and other reasons, many young parents
among the floating people have no idea about whether or how to
immunize their children.
</P>
<P>
Some parents who have violated the family planning policy and
have more children often withhold facts about those children,
including their health data. Thus many children have no access to
prompt vaccination.
</P>
<P>
"We've urged local authorities responsible for immunization to
discover unvaccinated children and to immunize them," Zhou Jun
said.

<HEADLINE> EDI Center Goes into Operation in Tianjin Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An EDI (electronic data
interchange) Center went into operation today in Tianjin in north
China, making it the first port in China to be equipped with an
EDI system for international cargo container transport.
</P>
<P>
The center provides 24-hour graph and file transmission and
information-saving services, as well as bulletins for regular
cargo container shipping services, and import information.
</P>
<P>
Enabling data to be shared among department, industries,
regions and countries, the center will greatly alleviate port
congestion caused by delayed information, and improve the
efficiency of container traffic at the port.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin port invested a total of 10.07 million yuan (1.21
million US dollars) in setting up the center, which uses software
imported from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Electronic information transmission and operation systems are a
main part of China's endeavor to promote technological progress
and management modernization for international cargo container
transport at its ports.
</P>
<P>
China plans to expand transmission of electronic information to
four main ports of entry and 120 related units, and deal with 80

the Tula region, about 200 kilometers south of Moscow.

Exchanges in the cultural field between the two countries are
very important, he said.

Jiang spoke highly of Tolstoy's contribution to world
literature and said that Tolstoy's works, including "Peace and
War," "Resurrection" and others, were among his favorites.
</P>
<P>
"Tolstoy's works are treasures of not only the Russian people,
but also the Chinese people and the people all over the world,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
When Tolstoy's great-great-grandson said that he plans to
organize an exhibition in China to show Tolstoy's works and things
left, Jiang said that many Chinese will be glad to visit the
exhibition.

Jiang is currently on a five-day state visit to Russia, which
is to end tomorrow.

a dream sequence of seven points to win the deciding game,
anchoring the German women to a cliff-hanging victory over the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the World Table Tennis

Trailing 9-16, the German defensive player got seven points in
a row with consistent chopping play before she held the rival to
20-all. She suddenly changed her rhythm at the crucial moment,
catching Wil nonplused with two slow flat shots.
</P>

Schoepp put the European champion on track by beating DPR
Korea's top player Kim Hyon Hui 21-7, 21-12 in the opening game.

championships, won its opening two games on Thursday, beating
Chinese Taipei and Italy in straight sets. The DPR Korea didn't
send men players to Manchester.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes South Africa's Accession to Lome Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would bring new
strength and dynamism to the Lome Convention between the European
Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, a
senior EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner responsible for
relations with ACP countries, made the comment in Luxembourg after
the EU and ACP countries had agreed on the terms for South
Africa's membership of the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner congratulated the people and the government of
South Africa who "brought their country from isolation right into
the heart of ACP-EU family of states."
</P>
<P>
It was an event of "historical significance," he said, adding
that the Convention finally included all of sub-Saharan Africa 22
years after the signing of the first Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro also praised South Africa for its values of tolerance,
peace and multiculturalism, which he said were precisely the
source of the Lome Convention's commitments and its overarching
objective.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention lays down the political relations between
the 15 EU member states and the 70 ACP countries, most of which are
former colonies of European countries. It also regulates relations
in the area of trade and aid.
</P>
<P>
The Convention is founded on three principles -- partnership,
contracts and a combination of fields of cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Consultations Over Zaire Peace Talks Continue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South African negotiators are
consulting a wide range of roleplayers in Africa and elsewhere on
arrangements for the long-awaited direct talks between Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, an
informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel was quoted as
saying in Cape Town that consultations with interested roleplayers
continued, but he declined to give details of the issue, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela last week extended a formal invitation to
Mobutu, offering to host the first ever face-to-face talks between
Mobutu and Kabila in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Mobutu wanted a new venue closer to Zaire because he could
not travel to South Africa for the talks due to his ill health.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Special Envoy to Zaire and the Great Lakes region,
Mohamed Sahnoun, held discussions with South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria on Thursday over the timing and venue of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun refused to expand on his talks with Mbeki, but adding
negotiators were "still working" on when and where the proposed peace
talks should be held.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said Sahnoun had also spoken by phone earlier today to
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad, who was travelling from
Cape Town to Pretoria this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Subtantial consultations had also been held over the statement by
the United Nations Security Council this morning expressing alarm over
reports of massacres and other human rights violations in the
rebel-controlled eastern Zaire where thousands of malnourished Rwandan
refugees are currently camped. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Arm Proposes Anti-Dumping Duties on Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive arm of the European Union (EU), today proposed to impose
definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of grey cotton fabric.
</P>
<P>
The proposed punitive measure will cover EU member states'
imports from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and China.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's move was made after an in-depth investigation
into the possible impact of the anti-dumping duties on European
producers and users of cotton fabric.
</P>
<P>
The probe allegedly confirmed that cut-price imports have
caused European competitors to suffer a decline in sales, strong
downward pressure on prices and financial losses.
</P>
<P>
But officials lowered the dumping margin from 19 percent
to an average of some 15 percent and, citing the specific nature
and use of medical gauze, excluded the product from the duties.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the latest move, the European Commission decided last
November to impose provisional anti-dumping duties on imported
cotton fabric for a period of six months.

JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) has been urged to take concrete steps to ensure
gender issues were considered in all its policies and programs,
reported the South African Press Association today from Mbabane,
capital of Swaziland.
</P>

The Women in Development Southern Africa Awareness Project,

<P>
The workshop, being attended by more than 100 delegates from
southern African countries, reaffirmed the need to maintain
momentum in lobbying for gender issues to be considered in
national and regional policies.
</P>
<P>
The workshop also emphasised the need to revise legal instruments,
policies and programs, and adopt a more "gender sensitive" approach to
the matter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was an important follow-up to the Fourth United
Nations Conference on Women held last September in Beijing, capital of
the People's Republic of China. enditem

<HEADLINE> HK Mortgage Lending Slows Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new mortgage
lending continued to slow down in March, according to the results
of the latest monthly survey conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Gross new loans made during the month fell by 10.6 percent to
16.8 billion HK dollars (2.15 billion U.S. dollars), compared with
 a drop of 8.9 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The fall in gross loans made, coupled with a rise in repayment
of loans in the month, resulted in a slower rate of growth of
outstanding mortgage loans, which was 1.6 percent in March
compared with 2.7 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The average rate of growth of outstanding loans in the three
months to March also decreased to 30.1 percent from 34.3 percent
in the three months to February.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, new loans approved during the month rose by
17 percent to 21.1 billion HK dollars (2.71 billion U.S. dollars),
 in line with the revival of primary market activity in March.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA David Carse said, "The
slower pace of new mortgage lending in March was a reflection of
seasonal factors in February. Loan demand accelerated again in
March as more new properties were put up for sale, but there are
indications that market conditions have since cooled."

<HEADLINE> Flower Exports to Earn Uganda 65 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Flower exports will earn Uganda 65
million US dollars by the year 2001, reported the local daily
the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Flower exports earned the country 15 million dollars last year
while the figure was almost zero years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the progress is due to more land set
aside by the Ugandan government for flower growing in the country
and more cold stores set up for flower reservation. For instance,
a new cold storage was set up recently in Entebbe near Kampala
with a total capacity of 50 tons for flower reservation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Rejects Israeli Request for Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has turned down
repeated request by Israel for diplomatic ties as it is not
satisfied with the latter's attitude toward Palestine, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today.
</P>
<P>
"We've said it that we shall not have diplomatic ties with them
until they honor their agreement not to be hostile to the
Palestinians," he said during a question and answer session at a
symposium in Petaling Jaya adjacent to the capital city on "The
Islamic World and Global Cooperation: Preparing for the 21st
Century" which he opened earlier.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not given freedom to Palestine and "because of this
we don't want to have diplomatic ties with them," Mahathir said
when asked to clarify Malaysia's stand on ties with Israel in the
light of an Israeli team taking part in a recent international
cricket tournament here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir acknowledged that the presence of the Israeli
cricketers triggered public anger at the government although the
idea behind allowing them here was to open the eyes of the
Israelis to Islam's virtues upheld in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said it was never the intention to do something that would
put the Muslims at a disadvantage or to defeat the purpose of the
Palestinian struggle.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia has supported the Palestinian cause more
than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not betray the Islamic struggle, but fighting for a
cause does not simply mean exchanging gunfire. There are other
ways of doing it, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 participants, including politicians, academicians,
corporate leaders, government officials and journalists are
attending the three-day symposium jointly organized by the Oxford
Center for Islamic Studies and the Institute of Islamic
Understanding in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Liu Guoliang Owes Olympic Title to "Rosskopf" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis
player Zhang Yong is the man behind Liu Guoliang's Olympic
victories.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Zhang has been a sparring partner for Chinese
star players Liu Guoliang and Kong Linghui since joining the
national team in 1993. Playing an aggressive game in handshake
grip, the left-handed Zhang is the Chinese "Rosskopf" or "Gatien".
</P>
<P>
"I have to owe to Zhang my victory over German Jorg Rosskopf in
the Olympic Games," said the 20-year-old Liu, who had been held in
awe by Rosskopf before Zhang rebuilt his confidence.
</P>
<P>
Liu had taken sweet revenge over Rossokopf with a 3-1 victory
before he beat teammate Wang Tao to win China's first Olympic
men's singles title in Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
In the British Open early last year, Liu was so nervous in the
deciding fifth set against Rosskopf that he dropped his bat twice
to the ground and only got five points.
</P>
<P>
"Six months of playing against Zhang made a difference," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
During China's run-up for the Olympic Games and world
championships, the versatile Zhang imitates the ways that top
Europeans play.
</P>
<P>
Playing like Rosskopf and France's 1993 world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien, both left-handers, has become his specialty.
</P>
<P>
"When Chinese players are expected to face Rosskopf or Gatien
in a competition, they play against me first," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said Liu's Olympic victory over Rosskopf was the
biggest-ever reward for him.
</P>
<P>
"I have fulfilled my mission and proved my value in Liu's
Olympic victory," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the training partners in the Chinese team,
imitating western playing styles is a part-time job for Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who got a doubles silver medal in the 1993 national
championships, won the singles championship in the 1996 nationals
where Liu Guoliang and world No. 1 Kong Linghui also competed.
</P>
<P>
In the CCTV tennis tournament late last year, Zhang outlasted
world champion Kong 3-2.
</P>
<P>
"I have a poor record against Kong, but I have won half of the
matches against Liu in the training," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang holds a bigger ambition than beating Liu and Kong. "I am
young and I have confidence to be world champion by myself," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For Liu Wenhua, a training partner for the women's world No. 1
Deng Yaping, to be world champion is a goal beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Liu, called into the national team after
placing fifth in a national competition in 1989, helped Deng
regain the singles and doubles titles in the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Liu is an unknown hero for the Chinese women's dominance in
the world," said Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who plays topspin game in handshake style, said his skill
had been on a downtrend because his rivals lacked men's speed and
firepower.
</P>
<P>
"I always held an advantage when I played against Deng for the
first several years, but now I don't," Liu said. "Deng has
bettered her skills while I am on the decline. I has never reached
the last eight in national competition since 1989."
</P>
<P>
Liu holds no grudges as a stepping-stone for Chinese women's
players and he has recently refused a coaching offer from a
European club.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of what I am doing," Liu said. "When Deng and her
teammates beat their rivals, I am much happier than them."

a group of businessmen.
</P>

He said that talks were already underway for the establishment
of agricultural, industrial and trading zones with joint

<HEADLINE> Singapore Man Fined Heavily for Cigarettes Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A 42-year-old unemployed
Singapore man was fined 9.2 million Singapore dollars, or about
6.4 million U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate, for
smuggling in more than two tons of cigarettes, local television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fine handed out to Fong Weng Liong, the smuggler, was
believed to be the heaviest ever meted out and the man also
received a two-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, if he is unable to pay the fine, Fong will have to
serve another 63 months and 20 days' imprisonment in default, the
television report said.
</P>
<P>
Fong admitted to 22 charges relating to duty-unpaid cigarettes
while his accomplice Subramani Munusamy pleaded guilty to 16
similar charges. Together they had brought in more than 430,000
Singapore dollars' (about 298,600 U.S. dollars) worth of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The offense took place between February and April this year at
the Keppel Shipyard in the southern part of the Singapore island
where they bribed three security officers to allow the goods to be

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in China's Inland Areas Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Overseas business people are
encouraged to invest in central and western China, Sun Zhenyu,
vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said
today.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, while expanding foreign capital utilization in
the coastal regions, the Chinese government will increase its
investment in the central and western parts and will encourage and
actively promote foreign businesses to make investment in those
areas," Sun said at an international seminar on China's economic
reform and the liberalization of its accounting market.
</P>
<P>
He added that China's preferential policies toward the east and
coastal areas since the start of the economic reform and
opening-up drive in the late 1970s have been successful.
</P>
<P>
It is an important objective in China's strategy of economic
growth to gradually narrow the gap in economic development between
coastal regions and the central and western areas, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to deepen reform and the new situation brought
about by the economic development over the years have created new
opportunities for central and western China to open wider to the
rest of the world and to utilize more foreign investment, he told
participants of the seminar, which was co-sponsored by the Chinese
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Hong Kong
Society of Accountants.
</P>
<P>
Projects which can fully exploit the advantages of the central
and western areas in human and natural resources and which are in
line with the state industrial policy have been listed as areas
encouraged for foreign investment, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
He also said that restrictions on the projects limited for
foreign investment can be eased to a proper extent if the projects
can truly exploit the resource advantages of these regions and
they conform with the state industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
In yet another move to encourage overseas investment in central
and western China, the State Council in September 1996 granted
inland authorities more power, raising the amount of foreign
investment involved in each project which the authorities of the
inland provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can approve from
10 million US dollars to 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken will help simplify the procedure to approve
overseas-funded enterprises and thereby enable the inland areas to
attract more overseas capital, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China altogether approved the
establishment of 283,800 overseas-funded enterprises between 1979
and 1996, with contractual overseas investment totaling nearly 470
billion dollars. The amount actually utilized stood at 176.59
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has been the largest destination of foreign investment
among all developing countries since 1993, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Albanian FM Sees Little Chance for Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Arjan
Starova said here today that he did not regard restoration of a
monarchy in Albania as likely.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very slight possibility for that, but I don't think
such a choice will be made," Starova said after talks with his
German counterpart Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
The call for restoring a monarchy, and for a referendum to this
regard, was made by the exiled son of former Albanian king Zogu I,
Leka Zogu, during a recent visit to Albania.
</P>
<P>
However, Starova hoped the elections in Albania will go ahead
as scheduled on June 29, and said the preconditions for that would
be the end of chaos and restoration of public order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also stressed the needs for the
6,000-strong foreign troops now being deployed in Albania as part
of the eight-nation protection force to stay there until elections
were held.
</P>
<P>
"If the elections were postponed, which I don't think is
likely, of course, the multinational force would need a second
mandate because they are due to stay there for three months," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Liberalize Accounting Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to liberalize
its accounting services step by step, a senior accountant said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome all international accounting firms and foreign CPA
(certified public accountant) firms to do business in China. We
also welcome our fellow accountants in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
Macao to the mainland to seek business opportunities," Ding
Pingzhun, secretary general of the Chinese Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (CICPA), said today at an international seminar
on China's economic reform and the opening of its accountancy
market.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that China has opened its accounting services for a
long time. He noted that while opening up wider the accounting
market, the Chinese government is gradually improving the
regulation of the overseas accounting firms entering China.
</P>
<P>
"As in all other countries, the opening up of the Chinese
accounting market is not unconditional or without limitation,"
Ding told the seminar, which was co-sponsored by the CICPA and the
Hong Kong Society of Accountants.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese rules and regulations, qualified overseas
accounting firms can open representative offices or form joint
venture CPA firms in China. They are also permitted to recruit
member firms in China.
</P>
<P>
China's national unified CPA test was opened to overseas
applicants in 1994. To date, over 4,000 people from 12 countries
and regions have applied for the test.
</P>
<P>
So far, 14 overseas accounting agencies have opened 28
representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and a
number of other Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Local Laws Encourage Economic Growth in China's Ethnic Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The increase in the number of
local laws on politics, the economy, culture, and social life in
ethnic areas of China has helped economic growth and unity among
various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have adopted 123
laws since 1980, and another 113 specific regulations and 59 law
modifications or supplementary regulations have been passed.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region made 26 local laws in
1996, half of which deal with the economy. They include
agricultural technology, administration of state-owned farms, and
auditing collective groups in rural and pasture areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the total grain output of Inner Mongolia came to 15.35
billion kilograms, 4.8 billion kilograms more than that of 1995,
which put Inner Mongolia at the top place in the country in per
capita grain output.
</P>
<P>
In the Ningxia Autonomous Region, the people's congress drafted
land administration, environmental protection, and contract system
laws for rural areas. These measures helped local economic
growth. In 1996, the GDP in Ningxia was 19.4 billion yuan (2.4
billion dollars), 10.5 percent more than for 1995.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that economic development is not obtained at the
expense of the environment, many ethnic areas have drawn up
environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region made a series of regulations on
forest and wild animal protection, and on grassland, water
resources, and mining administration.
</P>
<P>
China has also developed a 2.4-million-strong team of cadres
from ethnic areas to help with the legislation. Special
regulations in ethnic areas have also helped increase the number
of school-age children in school. The rate in Inner Mongolia and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has risen to 98.5 percent, one
percentage point higher than the country's average.

<HEADLINE> China To Advance Reform of Accounting Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Accelerating reforms of the
accounting profession has become an important task facing the
whole nation in order to facilitate the standardized development
of Chinese securities market, a senior securities official said
today.
</P>
<P>
"To improve the technical and ethical standards of Chinese
accountants is the key to coordinating business reform and to
facilitating the development of the Chinese securities market,"
said Li Jiange, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), at an international seminar on accountancy.
</P>
<P>
The securities industry watchdog will improve the disclosure
system of listed companies, keep a tighter control over certified
public accountants and domestic and overseas accountanting firms
engaged in the securities sector, according to the vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
All these measures are aimed at fostering a team of Certified
Public Accountants (CPAs) of high calibre and ethical level,
making it a backbone force in a standardized and sustained
development of the securities market, noted Li.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, CPA's, in order to stay in the securities business
required special certification that was acquired only by taking a
national examination given by the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC and Ministry of Finance also conducted annual
check-ups of CPAs and accounting firms and imposed harsh penalties
on rule-breakers.
</P>
<P>
The accounting profession and the securities market have been
two interacting forces since the market took shape in 1991. As the
expansion of the securities market gained speed in 1992, China
made its first try to reform its accounting rules by promulgating
the "Accountanting Standards for Business Enterprises" and
"Accounting Regulations for Incorporated Business Enterprises,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced cooperation between the Chinese and overseas
securities regulators also made the accounting system in China
converge with international norms, and made it possible to assess
the performance of Chinese enterprises with international
accounting standards, thereby paving the way for Chinese
enterprises to be listed overseas.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Labor Movement Tries to Secure Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's labor movement, the
National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), is taking it as its aim in
the 21st century to ensure that workers have lifelong employment
and not prematurely shortened work life.
</P>
<P>
In a comment in NTUC News ahead of May Day next week, the labor
movement says Singapore's workers need to keep on improving
because the country's competitors won't be standing still.
</P>
<P>
Although an international risk analysis firm, BERI, has rated
Singapore's workforce as top, the NTUC says there is definitely
room for improvement. Singapore is not rated first in workers'
attitude and technical skills, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Singapore will also have to contend with competition from
developing economies like the neighboring countries which have the
benefit of a larger population and lower wages and land costs, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the workers in Singapore will have to train and
retrain so as to stay ahead of competition, it stressed.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President's Son Denies Allegations on Hanbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Kim Hyun-chul, son of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam, denied today taking bribes from the
collapsed Hanbo Group or committing any irregularities interfering
in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
During a testimony at the National Assembly where he served as
a witness, the 38-year-old junior Kim apologized to the people and
his father for causing public stir, saying "it's all because I did
not think or act properly."
</P>
<P>
However, except admitting to recommending certain people to his
father for government posts, he denied other public accusations
and his role behind massive bank loan arrangements for Hanbo and
systematic meddling in all personnel appointments.
</P>
<P>
"I will accept punishment if I am guilty of a crime. Legal
matters will be up to the prosecution," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He has been suspected of playing a leading role in brokering
huge bank loans for the now bankrupt Hanbo, taking 225 million
U.S. dollars in rebate in Hanbo's business contracts, and
interfering in ruling camp nominations for general elections and
government appointments.
</P>
<P>
The junior Kim's testimony is the highlight of the three-week
parliamentary hearing summoned to investigate the explosive Hanbo
graft scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kim was investigated in February for his alleged connections
with Hanbo, but prosecutors cleared his name citing lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Kim publicly apologized for the bribery
scandal and promised to keep his controversial son away from
politics.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes New Non-Racial Farmers' Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The new non-racial and
unified Kwazulu/Natal Agricultural Union would make a positive
contribution to reconciliation and reconstruction, President
Nelson Mandela said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony in Pietermaritzburg, Mandela said
the new union was of the great importance. It reflected and
promoted de-racializing agriculture and society in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The union joins the former Black Natal Agricultural Union, the
National African Farmers' Union, the South Coast Indian Farmers'
Association and the mainly White Kwazulu/Natal Farmers' Union.
</P>
<P>
It would help overcome historical divisions and would create
the possibility for all farmers to work together to eliminate the
inequalities of the past, a source said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela hoped this sign of growing cooperation between large
and small-scale farmers, following the formation of a similar
union in Eastern Cape Province, would be echoed elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said at the ceremony the new union would
bring together farmers from all races in the IFP-controlled
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this achievement cannot be over-emphasized,
as one cannot overstate the enormity of the challenges with which
your union is confronted," said Buthelezi.

HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total retail sales
decreased in value and volume in February, but increased for the

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of communications in
English-speaking western African countries have called on their
governments to deregulate the sector so as to boost its
development in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
A communique was issued at the end of a three-day workshop on
Internet in the Nigerian capital of Abuja on Thursday saying that
only the deregulation of the sector would guarantee the sector's
viability in the region and in sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministers, the deregulation of the
communications sector would stimulate growth and provide new
opportunities in education, trade, health care, job creation,
food security and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also adopted what they termed the "African
Information Society Initiative", an action framework to build the
continent's information and communication infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that governments should develop a framework
and mechanism to ensure the participation of all sectors in
coordinating and harmonizing the multiple efforts of the private
sector, non-governmental organizations and the media.
</P>
<P>
They suggested the establishment of a strong, independent
regulatory body to regulate the telecommunication sector,
membership of which should include delegates from government and
associations of industry, labor, academic, private and consumer.
</P>
<P>
The communique was signed by communications ministers from
Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Executive Council Members Declare Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Executive
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
have completed their declarations of interests which are now
available for public inspection upon request, a spokesman of the
HKSAR Chief Executive's Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a system of declaration of interests for
members of the Executive Council has been worked out with
reference to the current arrangements for Executive and
Legislative Councilors and senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said it has stricken a fine balance between the
accountability of the Executive Council and the members' right to
privacy.
</P>
<P>
The scope of declarable items for the members of the Executive
Council of the HKSAR is broadly similar to that under the existing
system. However, the members are required to make known the land
and property they own both locally and outside Hong Kong,
irrespective of their value and whether or not they are used for
self-occupation, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The members' investment activities in Hong Kong securities and
futures as well as in shareholdings of overseas companies which
carry out business activities in Hong Kong will be make known to
the chief executive on a confidential basis but will not be made
public, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currency transactions involving the Hong Kong dollar of a value
of over 200,000 HK dollars are an additional item to be reported
confidentially, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that in declaring land, property and
financial interests, the members should include those which are
held in the name of their spouse, children, other persons or
companies but are actually owned by themselves or in which they
have a beneficial interest.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 47 of the Basic Law, on assuming office, the
chief executive is required to make known his assets to the chief
justice of the Court of Final Appeal. Tung Chee Hwa will make the
declarations again on July 1, 1997, when he is sworn in as the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the declarations of interests, the members of
the HKSAR Executive Council are required to declare, also in an
open register, financial sponsorships they receive or overseas
sponsored visits they make as well as gifts worth over 2,000 HK
dollars to them or their spouses other than those given by their
relatives or on special occasions.
</P>
<P>
The sources of any gifts received will be kept confidential and
reported to the chief executive only, so as to protect the privacy
of the third party, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive has decided to declare publicly any gifts
presented to him during his tenure as the chief executive
irrespective of value, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gifts with commercial value will be disposed of through the
Treasury after July 1, 1997, and the proceeds will be donated to
charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
As regards items which Tung would like to retain, valuations
will be obtained from the Treasury and Tung will purchase them.
The proceeds will again be donated to charities, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Exports Expected to Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports are expected
to rebound rapidly from its long setbacks as prices of its key
export items have recovered, the Finance and Economy Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic forecast based on the recovering price of
petrochemical and steel products, semiconductors and other key
items, the Yohap News Agency quoted a ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the nation's invisible trade deficit narrowed last
month, and the current-account imbalance also showed rapid
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the value of the Japanese yen is expected to rebound
against the U.S. dollar. The revaluation will offer good
opportunities to South Korea, which has a similar export structure
to Japan, to increase its exports.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and the United States reportedly think it
disadvantageous to its economy to let the current exchange rate
remain for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar has recently been moving in the range between
125 yen and 126 yen.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current-account deficit in February was 2.45
billion U.S. dollars, down from 3.14 billion dollars in
January. The figure in March is expected to be below 2 billion
dollars and that of April will be even lower, said ministry
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said today he
hoped to maintain the momentum for the relations between the
Chinese and Philippines armed forces and further enhance mutual
trust, understanding, and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who is also a member of China's Central Military
Commission, made the remark here this afternoon when meeting with

<P>
He said that China and the Philippines are two friendly
neighbors, and bilateral relations have witnessed a smooth
development in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace Process Stands Still in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in the southern
Philippines has run into another stalemate with the third round of
preliminary peace talks between the government and a major Muslim
rebel group having ended Thursday without any substantive
progress.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting in Catobato city in western
Mindanao, negotiators from the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) failed to touch upon issues regarding a
wider truce in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had planned to discuss the conditions to be
provided by both sides for a comprehensive cease-fire covering the
entire Mindanao region to ensure that the on-going peace talks
would not be derailed by sporadic fighting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded low-level peace talks, initially scheduled
to open on April 9, had been postponed twice because of renewed
exchange of shelling between the government troops and MILF rebels
in Buldon town, Maguindanao Province, early this month.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the technical committees of both sides only
agreed to continue implementing an interim cease-fire in Buldon,
signed this January, to prevent an escalation of tension there.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to leave the issue of extending this local truce to
other areas of Mindanao to the next meeting, which will be held in
early May.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also failed to put an end to their row over which
side should be responsible for the March 16 Buldon bomb attack at
a school, which killed 10 students and one teacher.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has demanded that the government look into the
incident, for which it said the military should be blamed. But the
military has bluntly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said there is a long way to go for Manila and the
MILF to start formal peace talks since the two sides, which began
their first-ever preliminary talks in January, have so far been
wide apart on the conditions for the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Gaafar, chairman of the MILF's peace panel, said
earlier this week that unless both sides forge an expanded truce,
no formal negotiations could take off.
</P>
<P>
During the second round of initial talks with the government in
February, the MILF presented four conditions for ending
hostilities between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
These conditions include the military's adherence to the
Articles of War of the Geneva Convention, a halt to troop
deployment in Mindanao, recognition of MILF-held territories and
the immediate pullout of troops near MILF camps.
</P>
<P>
The government has not formally replied to these conditions and
so far failed to provide its own stance for a comprehensive
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
But Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo Acedara earlier
made it clear that the government can not regard MILF-controlled
areas as separate territory and refused to pull out troops
deployed near MILF bastions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reopening of the peace talks, tension remains high
in the towns of Buldon, Sirawai and Carmen, where the government
and MILF fighters have faced a standoff during recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Col. Rodolfo Garcia, head of the 603rd Infantry Brigade based
in Buldon, said the situation in this town of 25,000 remains
volatile and armed conflicts may flare up at any time between MILF
rebels and government troops.
</P>
<P>
In Sirawai town, Zamboanga del Norte Province, government
troops continued their pursuit of fleeing MILF elements after
capturing a major MILF camp in the town. Clashes between
government troops and the MILF in Sirawai have claimed at least 35
lives in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government has sought to sign a peace deal with the MILF to
end scattered incidents of rebellion in the interest of economic
development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Economy in the southern Philippines has long lagged behind the
other parts of the country. Mindanao is rich in natural resources
but has long been neglected due to the decades-old separatist
Muslim movement there.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government
force in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The government signed a peace deal with the MNLF last
September, ending nearly three decades of war between the MNLF and
the government troops in the south. But the peace accord was
rejected by the MILF.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Small political parties in
Nepal will take to the streets to protest the Election
Commission's decision not to allow them to use their own symbols
for next month's local elections, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 17 parties decided at a Thursday meeting to
launch a legal and street struggle against the decision, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Under their protest program, the parties will organize a mass
rally in front of the compound of the Election Commission on
Sunday and call a nationwide general strike next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission Thursday decided to allow four national
parties, including the three ruling partners and the main
opposition party, to use their party symbols in the local
elections to be held next month.
</P>
<P>
But the commission also decided that candidates of small
parties, which won less than 3 percent of the total votes in last
elections, could only use symbols allocated by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Nepali voters will elect leaders of about 4,000 local
administration bodies throughout the country at village,
municipality and district levels beginning May 17.

CAIRO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian state budget includes further raises in
wages to approximately double the inflation rate, Minister of
Finance Mohieddin el-Ghareb told a parliamentary session recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is keen on achieving a balance
between wages and prices, adding that debt increases should not be
a concern because part of the privatization proceeds will be
allocated for paying back accumulated interest.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the government makes amendments
to the balance sheet only when the need arises, the Egyptian Al
Ahram weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank (WB) will take part in a giant project
to develop Egypt's western desert into a new industrial and
agricultural community.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking WB delegation has arrived in Cairo to review the
bank's participation in conducting the studies and key research
for the New Valley project, the Egyptian Al Ahram weekly reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Another WB delegation comprising of agricultural research
experts and professors has been examining the possibility of
financing the project.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon recorded a growth rate of 5 percent in the
first quarter of 1997 compared with 3 percent in 1996, the Daily
Star, the only English daily in Beirut, today quoted the Lebanese
central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter was positive and the main indicators show
good economic growth and inflation in Lebanese pounds under
control," said Riad Salame, governor of the Bank du Liban.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate stood at 9 percent in the first three
months this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate plunged to 3 percent in 1996 from 7 percent
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Salame said Thursday the surplus of 337 million U.S. dollars
in Lebanon's balance of payments in the first quarter was
"historic and encouraging" signs, which were accompanied by a
fall in interest rates on treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the Lebanese Bankers' Association
Thursday also indicated improving economic conditions with a
sharp rise in construction activity and new business start-ups.
</P>
<P>
Banking performance also registered a slight improvement in
total lending in Lebanese pound, which increased by 1.3 percent
in the public sector and 1.55 percent in the private sector, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign currencies lending, however, dropped by 1.33
percent, suggesting lower interest rates were having a positive
impact on dollarization.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that exports of manufactured products
recorded a 19 percent drop between January and February, while
imports of machinery and equipment fell by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Volume of shares on the Beirut Stock Exchange rose by 36
percent in February, amounting to 1.8 million shares traded,
with total value of 22.3 million dollars compared to 16.4
million dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly said
today the parliament would soon issue a general legislation
specifying privatization policies in the country, according to the
official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna).
</P>
<P>
Abdel Wahab Al-Haroun, rapporteur of the parliamentary
Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, said that the proposed
legislation would comprehensively organize the privatization laws
in terms of securing public funds and national manpower rights and
supervising bodies planning to invest in projects and utilities to
be privatized.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee had already consulted the ministries of
finance, trade and industry, the Kuwait Investment Authority
(KIA), the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as the
Kuwaiti Stock Exchanges and the Kuwaiti Economists Association on
the specifics of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's privatization plan starting in 1994 involves the
sale of public services and state holdings except the
state-owned oil sector which brings more than 80 percent of the
state revenues in the Gulf oil-rich state.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kuwait successfully implemented a program to sell the
state-owned stakes and shares to the private sector which,
Al-Haroun said, has helped in earning unprecedented revenues.

<P>
Under the three-year plan, the British firm will be in charge
of reorganizing the whole customs authorities, training personnel
there and revising all customs laws and operation regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, no staff will be fired with at least 100 to be
trained, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to cost about 35 million U.S. Dollars
from the British government and international donors.

<HEADLINE> Mandela: South Africa to Provide Syria with Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has expressed his determination to provide Syria with arms
despite opposition from the U.S., today's Syrian newspaper Al
Thawra reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Mandela said in an interview with Kuwaiti
daily Al Qabas published Thursday that "we owe Syria a big debt
and we have to express our gratitude by providing it with arms
needed to defend itself."
</P>
<P>
The president further stated that "Syria is one of the few
countries that stood by our side in our struggle for liberation of
the apartheid rule in South Africa. We are now in a position to
reward it with something against whatever it has extended to us."
</P>
<P>
Mandela also stated that "had it not been the support of those
friendly countries, including Syria, we would never have been able
to attain what we have achieved in South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Washington had exerted great pressure on South Africa to compel
it to refrain from providing Syria with modern arms and technology.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had earlier affirmed that his country would sell arms
to Syria and would not submit to any threats.
</P>
<P>
But he revealed neither the volume of such arms nor their
kind and value.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki held discussions with U.N. special envoy
Mohamed Sahnoun in Pretoria Thursday on the proposed Zairean
peace talks, an informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Sahnoun focused on the timing and venue of
face-to-face talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and
rebel leader Laurent Kabila, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun, who arrived in South Africa on Thursday from Namibia,
declined to give details about the talks. However, he told
reporters that negotiators from the Zairean warring sides were
"still working" on the venue of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun is due to meet South African Deputy Foreign Minister
Aziz Pahad today for more talks on the same issue, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad told parliament Thursday that Mobutu was still committed
to the meeting with Kabila, but suggested that a time and venue
should be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has offered to host the
talks in his country, but Mobutu reportedly wants a venue closer
to Zaire, as he is suffering from cancer and feels unable to
travel long distances.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Sceptical Over Easing British Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the European
Union (EU) has expressed deep doubt over British proposals on
relaxing a global ban on British beef exports, questioning the
reliability of the British program, the BBC television reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's ruling Conservative government, lagging behind the
main opposition Labor party in all opinion polls in the run-up to
the May 1 general election, is desperate to achieve an early
lifting of the year-long beef ban to boost flagging Conservative
morale.
</P>
<P>
In February, the British government proposed to establish a
"certified herd scheme" to identify cows from BSE-free herds which
could then be exported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major last week appealed to his EU partners
to put an end to the beef trade embargo and he even dropped the
hint that he would sack his Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg if
he won the general election.
</P>
<P>
However, the BBC television reported that it had received a
copy of a letter which was written by two EU commissioners to Hogg
casting serious doubts over the British scheme.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler and Consumer Affairs
Commissioner Emma Bonino questioned in the letter whether British
farmers' records could be trusted to prove that some cows were
BSE-free.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that a recently set-up central
computerized system of keeping track of healthy cows could not be
considered as reliable at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a world-wide ban on British beef exports last
March when the British government admitted possible links between
mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation bloc,
have repeatedly ruled out any early easing of the ban, saying more
veterinary inspections were needed to examine whether Britain had
complied fully with last year's Florence agreement which provided
a framework for a ban lifting.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Listed as "Advanced Economy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Washington-based
International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently classified Hong Kong as
an "advanced economy" along with the United States, Germany,
France and Japan and several other countries and regions, Hong
Kong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The classification in the fund's latest World Economic Outlook
report is based on the fact that Hong Kong and the other four
places "share a number of important industrial economy
characteristics." The characteristics include per capita income
levels well within the range indicated by the group of industrial
economies, well-developed financial markets and diversified
economic structures with relatively large and rapidly growing
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The report said the IMF dropped the "old industrial economy"
label to reflect the "declining share of employment in
manufacturing common to all the economies."
</P>
<P>
The same IMF report forecasts a 9.5-percent growth for China
this year, with inflation remaining at 6 percent and an economy
set for continued expansion.
</P>
<P>
It noted that given the inextricable links between Hong Kong
and China's mainland further growth for the territory in the years
ahead is beyond question.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli Soldiers were
wounded in heavy exchanges of fire in south Lebanon early this
morning between Lebanese Muslim guerrillas on the one hand, and
Israeli forces and their South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia allies
on the other.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that Israeli artillery
fired more than 40 shells at vicinities of villages opposite the
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, directed their mortar shells and light weapons fire at
positions of the Israeli and SLA militia in the eastern and
central sectors of the occupied zone, the anonymous sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the south Lebanon-based U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) said the two fighting sides traded fire over
Thursday night and the exchanges began to die down early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not confirm reports that Katyusha rockets
were used by the guerrillas in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
SLA militia sources said guerrillas fired three salvoes of
rockets into the Israeli outposts of Marqaba and Blat deeply
inside the buffer zone at dawn, wounding two Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
This was the first casualties the Israeli occupation forces
in south Lebanon sustained since this month.
</P>
<P>
Two SLA militiamen were also lightly wounded and sent to
hospital in Marjauoun, the largest town in the
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" carved by the Jewish state
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Three Lebanese civilians were wounded in Israeli helicopter
and artillery raids at a village on the edge of the occupied
zone Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Masoud, a police sergeant on leave, was wounded in
the shoulder and trader Daoud Idriss in the leg when two Israeli
helicopters strafed Kfar Tibnit at 1:15 p.m., one of the five
crossings between the border strip and the rest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army sources in Jerusalem said the pair were injured
by a group of "terrorists" who fired machineguns and mortars at
Israeli positions in the buffer enclave. Israeli soldiers fired
back, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Ismail Doughman, 17. was also wounded in his right leg
in Kfar Tibnit by a bullet fired from the Israeli outpost of Ali
AI-Taher which overlooks the village.
</P>
<P>
The dawn clashes added to six died and 32 wounded the Israeli
casualties in south Lebanon since this year.

<HEADLINE> Lip-Reading Helps Understanding of Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Watching a person's lips when he
speaks helps you to understand what he is saying, whether you can
hear him or not, according to the result of a brain scanner
experiment published today.
</P>
<P>
A team of British scientists using a brain scanner says
lip-reading activates the auditory cortex, the same brain region
that is involved in hearing.
</P>
<P>
The team became interested in how lip-reading helps us to
understand language after finding out that some deaf
schizophrenics "hear" voices when seeing a speaker mouthing at
them. That seemed to suggest that hearing and vision were linked
in some way.
</P>
<P>
Roots of the "hallucinations" may lie in the auditory cortex in
the light of studies of normal-hearing people reported in the
journal Science by Gemma Calvert, a psychologist from Oxford,
Prof. Tony David of the Institute of Psychiatry, and Prof. Ruth
Campbell of University College, London.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unexpected and intriguing finding, since this is
the first demonstration that visual information alone can activate
brain regions that are otherwise engaged by sound," Calvert said.
"Research provides a further illustration of how novel brain
imaging techniques can inform us about how the brain deals with
understanding speech."

<P>
The KIA has managed the government's privatization programs so
far.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's privatization plan starting in 1994 involves the
sale of public services and state holdings except the
state-owned oil sector which brings more than 80 percent of the
state revenues in the Gulf oil-rich state.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kuwait successfully implemented a program to sell the
state-owned stakes and shares to the private sector which,
Al-Haroun said, has helped in earning unprecedented revenues.
</P>
<P>
"State ownership in firms and sectors that are candidates for
privatization, apart from the oil sector, is estimated at 3.62
billion Kuwaiti dinars (11.95 billion U.S. dollars)," an
official of the Kuwaiti Finance Ministry told Xinhua earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that since September 1994, the state
had sold shares worth over 700 million dinars (2.3 billion
dollars) in more than 20 local firms under the first phase of the
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
A draft law by the government to move to the next and more
controversial stage of privatizing heavily subsidized utility
firms, including water, electricity and telecommunications which
used to provide employment for Kuwaitis, was sent to parliament
last month.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan said on April 4
that the Kuwaiti government temporarily put on hold the
privatization program to "avoid any negative consequences that
may result from privatization had the guarantees not been
taken."
</P>
<P>
Al-Haroun hoped to privatize all the government-owned
companies where the government has an absolute majority of shares
after legislating the privatization law which would secure rights
of the Kuwaiti manpower and monitor all privatization
transactions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti parliamentary Financial and Economic Affairs
Committee turned down, during a recent meeting, a draft law for
the set up of a Kuwaiti Telecommunication Company because the
parliament was intended to establish a general legislation
governing the privatization of public utilities.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Myanmar Refugees Return from Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- With a batch of 39 Rohingyas of
eight families returned to their home in Myanmar Thursday, a total
of 228,000 Myanmar Muslims have returned home from Bangladesh in
the last seven year, said officials in Cox's Bazar district
bordering Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
A quarter million Rohingyas left their home in the western
state of Arakan in Myanmar early 1991 and crossed into Bangladesh,
imposing a pressure on its socio-economic and ecological
condition.
</P>
<P>
However, nobody knows when the last refugee will get back to
his paternal property by crossing the Naaf River that flows
between Myanmar and Bangladesh, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation began in August 1991 following a tripartite
agreement between Bangladesh, Myanmar and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
At present, 21,916 refugees, living in two camps in Teknaf and
Ukhia of Cox's Bazar, are waiting for their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Twenty other refugee camps at Ramu, Ukhia and Teknaf in Cox's
Bazar district and a part of Banadarban have been dismantled, said
 official sources.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is now negotiating with Yangon for a fresh meeting of
senior officials of the two countries to bring an end to the
problem, the sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of the country's most developed areas, has had some good
results in opening up the local economy.
</P>
<P>
It is the third biggest foreign-trade base in China and did
about 4.35 billion US dollars worth of foreign trade in the first
quarter of this year alone, a nearly 51.5 percent rise over the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The local foreign trade is expected to help the province, which
is short of resources, increase its GDP by 12 percent and fixed
assets investment by 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has more than 30,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, over half of which are operating and involved in
processing industry.
</P>
<P>
These have contributed a great deal to local economic growth,
doing more than 2.1 billion US dollars worth of foreign trade
during the first three months, double the figure for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The province also intends to expand foreign technology
cooperation, and will send more laborers abroad for overseas
projects. During the first quarter, it signed 260 million US
dollars worth of contracts involving foreign technology.
</P>
<P>
The three-month period also saw approximately 200,000 overseas
visitors to the province, a 32 percent rise from the same period

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels to Resume Peace Talks in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Peace panels of the Philippine
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will meet
again on May 13-14 to discuss a comprehensive ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
This was decided by the two sides at the end of their third
round of low-level talks at a university in southern Mindanao. The
talks failed to produce any substantial result.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
today that the May talks will also hopefully break the impasse on
the issue of pulling back government and rebel troops in Buldon,
where thousands of soldiers and rebels are facing a standoff.
</P>
<P>
"Though the (recent) meeting was friendly and cordial, we were
not able to agree on the pull back of forces," Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, said after a visit to Buldon Thursday that the
military has not yet implemented the four-kilometer pull back he
recommended.
</P>
<P>
"It will only start after a general ceasefire in Buldon and
other areas in Mindanao has been agreed and signed by both
panels," said Acedera who also explained his Buldon visit was in
no way related to the April 23-24 talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government signed an interim truce in February
after a number of military clashes. However, the ceasefire
agreement was often violated with new fighting.
</P>
<P>
The MILF insists that a comprehensive ceasefire expanded to the
whole Mindanao should be reached before entering formal peace
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
A breakaway group of the mainstream Moro National Liberation
Front which signed a peace agreement with the government last
year, the MILF is now the biggest rebel group in the country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Economic Growth Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon recorded a growth rate
of 5 percent in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 3 percent
in 1996, the Daily Star, the only English daily in Beirut, today
quoted the Lebanese central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter was positive and the main indicators show
good economic growth and inflation in Lebanese pounds under
control," said Riad Salame, governor of the Bank du Liban.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate stood at 9 percent in the first three
months this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate plunged to 3 percent in 1996 from 7 percent
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Salame said Thursday the surplus of 337 million U.S. dollars
in Lebanon's balance of payments in the first quarter was
"historic and encouraging" signs, which were accompanied by a
fall in interest rates on treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the Lebanese Bankers' Association
Thursday also indicated improving economic conditions with a
sharp rise in construction activity and new business start-ups.
</P>
<P>
Banking performance also registered a slight improvement in
total lending in Lebanese pound, which increased by 1.3 percent
in the public sector and 1.55 percent in the private sector, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign currencies lending, however, dropped by 1.33
percent, suggesting lower interest rates were having a positive
impact on dollarization.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that exports of manufactured products
recorded a 19 percent drop between January and February, while
imports of machinery and equipment fell by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Volume of shares on the Beirut Stock Exchange rose by 36
percent in February, amounting to 1.8 million shares traded,
with total value of 22.3 million dollars compared to 16.4
million dollars in January.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Genes Enabling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered a group of genes that make tomatoes resistant to wilt
disease, according to a report by the latest issue of the Plant
Cell.
</P>
<P>
The findings by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science
is expected to speed up the breeding of new disease-resistant
varieties and reduce the need for chemical spraying.
</P>
<P>
Wild tomatoes are naturally resistant to wilt disease spread
by the soil-borne Fusarium oxysporum fungus (Lycopersici
strain). Once a widespread blight plaguing tomato crops, Fusarium
wilt disease is largely brought under control through classical
breeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
However, breeding new varieties through this method is a
laborious process that can take years because it entails
producing many successive generations of hybrid plants in which
the undesirable traits have been eliminated but the beneficial
ones retained.
</P>
<P>
The new study facilitates this process by providing molecular
markers allowing breeders to simply trace the genetic makeup of
new hybrids rather than test for it at each stage. The findings
also pave the way for genetically engineered new varieties with
an optimal mixture of desired properties.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of genes that endow plants with natural
resistance to disorders such as wilt disease, farmers must rely
on extensive chemical spraying and soil treatment," says
Prof. Fluhr, a member of the Weizmann Institute's Plant Genetics
Department.
</P>
<P>
"By imparting natural self-defense capabilities to plants, we
reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals entering the
environment", the professor added.
</P>
<P>
The newly identified genes are also of primary importance
because they form the plant's first line of defense against
Fusarium attack. Acting as regulatory switches, they induce the
release of various defensive agents such as destructive oxygen
molecules that bombard the disease-causing organism, or enzymes
that chew away at it.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover," Fluhr says, "the methodology we have helped for
isolating resistance genes should make it possible to design new
resistance genes and transfer them to various crops where they
are lacking."
</P>
<P>
The Weizmann Institute of Science is a major center of
scientific research and graduate study located in Rehovot in
central Israel. Its 2,400 scientists, students and support staff
are engaged in more than 850 research projects across the
spectrum of contemporary science.

Chinese airlines had 8.06 billion ton/kms, 55.55 million
passengers, and 1.15 million tons of cargoes.
</P>
<P>
Air freight will grow at a faster rate than passenger traffic
in China for a long time to come and steps are being taken to meet
the growing demand. These include market research on cargo flow,
opening air freight routes, building freight bases, using more
agents for faster service, air-land and sea-air transportation,
and a computerized network to improve sales, movement, and
storage, Shen told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
John L. Fugh, the president of McDonnell Douglas-China, said
that he was glad that such an important conference could be held
in Beijing. "With the rapid economic growth in China and in other
Asian countries, the demand for air freight will become even
huger. We hope the conference can help air companies and related
departments to have a better knowledge of the market demand so as
to seize the chances."
</P>
<P>
Ed Bavaria, deputy president of Douglas Aircraft Co., said at
the conference that the rapid economic development in China has
accelerated the growth of air transportation, and the air
transportation market shows great potential.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Chinese Province Increasing Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province is trying to improve the stagnant conditions
in trade and economic cooperation with Far East and Siberia in
Russian.
</P>
<P>
Harbin is the closest city to Russia and has worked out a plan
to promote trade and economic cooperation with Siberia and
Russia's far east. The plan lists the Russian cities of
Yekaterinburg, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Nakhodka as major
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for trade volume to increase to two billion US
dollars worth annually by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders say that the city's measures dovetail with
Russia's strategy to develop its eastern areas and advance
economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian trade saw a decline in 1994 because of trade
policy adjustments, market changes, and the poor quality of some
Chinese goods, said Zeng Xianfu, deputy director of the Harbin
City Bureau of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangtao, Harbin's mayor, paid an official visit last year
to Russia and worked with local governments to set up a
Sino-Russian Economic Coordinating Committee to remove obstacles
to further trade.
</P>
<P>
There are good prospects for increasing industrial and
agricultural cooperation in the far east area and northeast
China. The Russians say they hope China will join in the effort to
open up the resource-rich area, which could boost regional
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Harbin plans to have regular displays of quality and name-brand
goods in the Far East and in Siberia to re-gain the market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Probe Foreign Exchange Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government said on
Thursday it might be forced to introduce appropriate measures to
curtail persistent increase in foreign exchange demand and ensure
that all disbursements are properly accounted for.
</P>
<P>
It is observed this reflects the government's concern over the
excessive demand for foreign exchange which overshot projection
for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Lt.-Gen. Mohammed Haladu who gave the
warning said that the phenomenal increase in foreign exchange
demand was "unacceptable" especially against the background that
no cogent reasons were given by banks and end users to justify
the trend.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the impact of that demand has not been
positively felt in the productive sectors of the economy, but
limited to demands for basic travel allowance which in most cases
are counter productive," the minister said, quoted by press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian banks and end users get foreign exchange mainly
through the autonomous foreign exchange market (AFEM). They bid
for foreign exchange they require at the weekly session of the
AFEM in accordance with the exchange rate set by the Central Bank
of Nigeria, which intervenes the weekly session with an aim of
stabilizing the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has in fact adopted some measures to curtail
excessive demand for foreign exchange this year. Among the
measures are the directive to banks to submit document to back up
their request for foreign exchange in the first 13 sessions of
the AFEM and the devaluation of the naira from 80 to 85 to one
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite the measures, the demand has consistently been on the
high side, prompting the central bank to swoop on some banks last
week to check their books.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, demand for foreign exchange rose from
76,234 dollars in the first AFEM session in January to 71.164
million dollars last week, when aggregate demand came to 922
million.
</P>
<P>
Total projected outlay for the funding of AFEM is 2.7 billion
dollars for the whole of this year.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mao's Hometown See Great Changes in Their Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- When Mao Qiman and Xie Yingming
wed in 1977 in Shaoshan Village, the home of late Chairman Mao
Zedong in central China's Hunan Province, they only had a one-room
house to live in.
</P>
<P>
Now however, Mao Qiman, a former farmer who is now a
contractor, owns a two-storey building valued at more than 100,000
yuan (12,000 US dollars). His family has a color TV, refrigerator,
and washing machine that Chinese urbanites have, but also a car
and a mobile telephone that only richer folk have.
</P>
<P>
Mao Shiyu, the party secretary of 450-family village, says that
over 30 percent of its households are as rich as Mao Qiman, thanks
to the reform and opening-up policy of the late '70s, as well as
the fame of the late great leader.
</P>
<P>
Mao Shiyu says that farmers in his village become wealthier by
using its status as a state-level tourism spot, by selling tourist
goods, and opening restaurants and hotels, to augment their
farming.
</P>
<P>
The village has 130 small hotels and restaurants and more than
300 booths selling tourist goods. Some farmers also work for a
building company or run a transportation business.
</P>
<P>
Per capita net income of Shaoshan villagers got up to 5,200
yuan (650 dollars), 2.7 percent higher than the country's average
in rural areas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Seventy years ago, Hunanese farmers started a movement and
demanded that their basic food and clothing needs be met. Mao
Zedong, who toured mountainous Hunan at that time to study the
situation, described to local people an imaginary future for their
homeland, saying there would be highways built chessboard style,
with every village being served by the spiderweb-like traffic and
power grid.
</P>
<P>
In visiting Shaoshan now, one can see that the imagination made
by Mao 70 years ago was not fertile enough to include all the
changes that have taken place by now.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng Chuqiao, mayor of Shaoshan City, nearly 90
percent of the farmers in his city have moved into several-story
buildings. The old farm houses of the past are seldom seen.
</P>
<P>
In the city, every village has paved roads, 99.8 percent of the
rural households have electricity, 80 percent of the villages have
program-controlled telephone service, 94 percent of the rural
households have color TV sets, and each village has a reading
room. The whole Shaoshan City, including the Shaoshan Village, is
leading a happy life.

<HEADLINE> Economists Forecast Moderately Fast Growth in China in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's national economy is
expected to maintain the trend of moderately rapid growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year, inflation will be brought under effective control,
the income and spending of residents will continue to increase
steadily, the state revenues will rise, and the foreign trade
sector will accelerate.
</P>
<P>
These predictions were delivered here today in a report by a
group of economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
and the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the report, entitled "Analysis and Forecasts of China's
Economic Situation (Spring of 1997 Report)," the economists show
their cautious optimism about the country's economic situation in
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the growth of China's gross domestic
product may reach 10 percent, a bit higher over the figure of 9.7
percent in the previous year, while investment in fixed assets is
expected to match the previous year's level of 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economists predict a five percent inflation rate of retail
prices and a seven percent rise in the prices of consumer goods
and services, while the per-capita incomes of urban and rural
residents are projected to increase by 4.9 percent and 5.3
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The state exchequer is expected to receive 869 billion yuan and
to spend 912 billion in 1997, up 16.6 percent and 15.2 percent
respectively, resulting in a deficit of 53 billion yuan.
</P>

Dhaka, April 25 (Xinhua)--- Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh

<HEADLINE> Nepali Group Demands Scrapping of Rhino Gift Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A local environmental group
here has demanded the government to immediately scrap a plan to
give two rhinos to Britain as a gift, a press release said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists (NFEJ) said in its
press release that it is not right to send rhinos, an endangered
species in Nepal, abroad when the country lacks a clear and
transparent policy on wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government pledged two years ago to dispatch two
female unicorn rhinos to the London Zoo of Britain as gifts for
the purpose of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
According to the NFEJ, final preparations for trapping two
rhinos in the Chitwan National Wildlife Park in West Nepal have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
An NFEJ delegation with Environment Minister Vidya Bhandari
Thursday demanding an immediate halt to the preparations under way
for sending the rhinos to Britain, it said.
</P>
<P>
The NFEJ is expected to submit a written appeal today to Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and concerned ministers for
aborting the rhino gift plan until the government formulates a
transparent policy regarding such cases.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Urged to Join By-Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Thursday called upon the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) to take part in by-elections to help strengthen the
electoral process, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon the opposition to join the elections, instead of
boycotting those," she told a coordination meeting in Gopalganj
City, about 100 kilometers southwest of the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition BNP has been boycotting all by-elections
since the defeat of its candidates in the Laksmipur and
Mirersharai constituencies vacated by its chairperson Begum
Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said her government was taking all steps to
ensure transparency and accountability of the electoral system
and, to that end, giving training to the election officials.
</P>
<P>
For the neutrality of election, neither she nor any minister of
her government went to any constituency as per the request of the
Election Commission, Sheikh Hasina added.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the call made by the prime minister, BNP Secretary
General Abdul Mannan said Thursday night that there is no
possibility of holding a fair election under the present partisan
chief election commissioner, Abu Hena.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to join the forthcoming by-election in the
Manikganj-3 constituency, provided the chief election commissioner
resigns," said the opposition leader.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Stocks slumped with low turnover on
the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) Thursday, ending yet another
negative week in a shaky and volatile market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark DSE all share price index fell 31.86 points, or
3.02 percent, closing at 1022.20, the lowest in recent times.
</P>
<P>
During the last trading week from last Saturday to Thursday,
the DSE price index rose on two days and fell on three days,
overall shedding 90.89 points or 9.57 percent, opening at 1113.00
and closing at 1022.20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market capitalization decreased to 85.08 billion
taka (about 2.13 billion U.S. dollars), which was 7.64 billion
taka (about 191 million dollars) lower than the balance of the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the week's lackluster trade was marked by
retail sales pressure matched by retail limit buy orders with
price dictated by the buyers.

<P>
There were no bulk sales offers or bulk buy orders, they added.
</P>
<P>
On the last trading day Thursday, 86 issues declined in value,

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- With the demand for power
increasing by the day, India's power sector requires huge
investment, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that the capacity addition required for
the next 10 years would be 111,500 megawatts (mw), of which 44,000
mw is estimated during 1996-2001 and an additional 67,500 mw
during 2001-2006.
</P>
<P>
The total investment required for building the required
infrastructure for power would be about 6,244 billion rupees
(175.88 billion U.S. dollars) at fixed prices, of which 2,464
billion rupees (69.4 billion dollars) would be required between
1996 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Keeping in view the enormous size of the financial resources
required and the inability of the government to fund the same
through budgetary allocations, the Indian Electricity Act (1910)
and the Electricity (Supply) Act (1948) were amended to bring
about new legal, administrative and financial environment for
private enterprise in the power sector.

<HEADLINE> Russian Firms Cheated of Big Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Six Russian companies involved in
a joint venture in Thailand have accused their local partner of
cheating them of 980,000 U.S. dollars, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian firms under the Krasnoyarsk Group, recently decided
to take the matter to the press after their complaints were
ignored by local law enforcement authorities, the Bangkok Post
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian firms signed an agreement to set up a joint venture
named Thaisib International in May 1992 with its local partner the
Almaz Group to build a factory to manufacture garments for export
to Russia, Europe, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Russians alleged that they put 980,000 dollars in two
installments into the venture to purchase land for the factory and
the rest to be used as equity.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that in 1994, they found that the joint
venture located in Bangkok was not operational any more and it was
registered with a capital of only 2 million baht (80,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Their local partner told them that a factory was being built in
Samutprakan Province, yet the Russians said they found no land had
been purchased for the factory and their attempts to seek
clarification ran into a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
The Russian firms last May took the matter to the Economic
Crime Investigation Division of the Thai Police Department, which
has so far failed to take any action against their local partner,
the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> 9.1-Percent Industrial Growth Recorded in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- India has recorded a
9.1-percent overall industrial growth rate in the first eight
months of the 1996-97 fiscal year, responding favorably to the
policy changes, reforms and incentives offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The industrial growth, which was 0.6 percent in 1991-92, rose

a change from earlier years when growth used to be led by the
consumer durables sector.
</P>
<P>
The growth also became broad-based and spread to all sectors,
said the statistics handbook.
</P>
<P>
According to the CII release, the small-scale sector
contributed nearly 35 percent of the total industrial output apart
from being a major player in export and employment.

<HEADLINE> China Fosters More Minority Nationality Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has given great attention to
training and selecting officials of ethnic groups and so far has
formed a 2.48-million-strong troop of national minority officials.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1947, China founded its first autonomous region in
northern China's Inner Mongolia and later spread its practice of
regional autonomy of minority nationalities in its other parts.
</P>
<P>
The fostering and selecting of ethic groups' officials is one
of the major parts of the regional autonomy policy.
</P>
<P>
Guan Xiumei, 33, deputy director of a Hohhot woolen mill, was
an ordinary worker of ethic Manchu group 16 years ago. Hohhot was
the regional capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. She
was promoted to a factory cadre after being a spinner for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
She was selected as a national model worker when she was a
spinner and showed talent in work arrangement.
</P>
<P>
After her promotion, the high school graduate completed a
three-year study of courses arranged by a correspondence
university during her spare time.
</P>
<P>
Guan Xiumei told Xinhua that "I was too shy to meet with
reporters when I just became a cadre of my factory. And I would
blush when talking with strangers. Now I would like to answer any
of your questions confidently."
</P>
<P>
Most of workers and factory cadres expressed satisfaction with
Guan's performance.
</P>
<P>
Guan is only one example of millions of China's minority
nationality officials. China has 55 minority nationalities and
Manchu nationality is of them.
</P>
<P>
In early 1950s, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had only
registered less than 300 national minority officials. The number
has reached 163,000, or 23.3 percent of the region's total, which
exceeds the ratio between the minority population and Han people
in the region.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has set up five autonomous region, 30 autonomous
prefectures, and 121 autonomous counties or banners, with a
minority population of 103 million.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regions include Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The leading government officials of the autonomous areas are
all ethnic minorities. In Tibet, the number of Tibetan officials and
officials of other ethnic groups accounts for 70 percent of the
region's total. In the Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Yanbian in
northeast China, the Korean population accounts for 39.9 percent
of the prefecture's total while the number of Korean officials
accounts for 45.9. The number of Korean officials at prefecture
level accounts for 53.9 of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the government at various
levels have been treating the promotion of minority officials as a
strategic task. They send national minority officials to cadre
schools, secondary schools, or universities for systematic
trainings and send some of them to study abroad or make overseas
investigation tours.
</P>
<P>
So far, 66.2 percent of the minority officials have specialized
technical skills and many of them are professors, researchers,
senior technicians, physicians-in-charge, or experts in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Among hundreds of academicians of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, China's top natural sciences research institution, 11
are of Mongolian, Manchu, Hui, or other ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Following a two-day heated
debate, the United States Senate today ratified the Chemical
Weapons Convention enabling it to participate in the treaty when
it takes effect on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The approval is a big foreign policy victory for President Bill
Clinton, who has pushed hard for the ratification of the treaty by
launching a high-profile lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which has been signed by 164 countries and ratified
by 74, was approved in the Senate by a vote of 74 against 26. It
was more than the necessary two-thirds majority for treaty
approval.
</P>
<P>
All Democrats voted for the treaty while Republican were
divided.
</P>
<P>
The treaty bans the use, development, production, stockpiling
and transfer of chemical weapons and requires the destruction of
existing stockpiles in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote, the administration allies succeeded in
eliminating a killer amendment proposed by the opponents of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The senate voted 71-29 to reject the amendment that would bar
the U.S. ratification until Iran, Iraq and Syria had accepted the
pact.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the treaty came after Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, one of the leading critics, reversed his
position and turned to support the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the U.S. is marginally better off with it (the
treaty) than without it," said Lott in a Senate speech.
</P>
<P>
The ratification also benefited from a letter of Clinton to
Lott earlier today.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton promised the Senate that he would
withdraw from the Chemical Weapons Convention if the pact
inadvertently resulted in the spread of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Lott and Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, had been major opponents to the convention, which will
come into being on April 29 with or without U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Clinton said he was "prepared to withdraw from
the treaty" if other countries used its provisions to proliferate
chemical weapons technology and endanger U.S. security.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fast Thai Economic Recovery Not in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Continued fall by the private
investment index has indicated that Thailand's economy might not
stage a rebound in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The index dropped to 94.8 points in February, its lowest level
since 1992, compared to a peak of 125 points in mid-1995 when the
economy was buoyant.
</P>
<P>
Economic statistics for January and February announced by the
central bank Thursday showed that the country's economy is still
slow in turning around.
</P>
<P>
Exports, one of the main hopeful sectors for the country to
boost its economic growth, declined 0.3 percent year-on-year for
the first two months of this year, due mainly to agricultural
exports, which declined 17.6 percent and fishery exports dropped
6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing sector exports increased a mere 2.2 percent, and
high-technology goods increased only 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, labor-intensive goods decreased 9.9 percent and raw
material goods decreased 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The private investment index which declined to a low activity
level, brought about reduced imports of capital goods in February
by 8 percent, the third straight month of decline.
</P>
<P>
The poor economic performance for the first two months of this
year indicates that first quarter economic figures are likely to
remain as sluggish as the first two months.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say that the sluggishness could prompt the
central bank to revise downward its projected 6.9 percent economic
growth rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
To spur investment, an interest rate cut is necessary and
long-term interest rates may be allowed to fall in the second
quarter if they have no negative effect on the country's economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
However, bankers say even though the average interbank rate in
February was down to 8.34 percent from 14.94 percent in January,
it was too early to say that interest rates would decline.
</P>
<P>
Positive sides were that current account deficit in February
was the lowest in several months, at 14.7 billion baht (588
million U.S. dollars), down from 22.5 billion baht (900 million
dollars) in January, and inflation was 4.3 percent, lower than
earlier estimates for the entire year of 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although inflation seems to be improving at present, a rise in
civil servant salaries, likely to be 5 percent and to be
introduced in October, will bring about higher prices.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the country's economic growth, improved confidence
in the country's economy was required, said Kleothong Hetrakul,
director of the Economic Research Department of the Bank of
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Five-Nation Accord Significant, Says Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The agreement on mutual
reduction of military forces in border areas between China and
four countries - Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -
is of great significance for Central Asian nations, a Kyrgyz
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed in Moscow earlier today by presidents of the
five countries, consolidates regional security and constitutes
another step toward multinational cooperation, said the
capital-based Bishkek evening newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony and the subsequent press conference lasted
only a few hours, but heads of state of the five countries had
prepared for the day for a long time, it said.
</P>
<P>
The document, the first agreement of its kind in the
Asia-Pacific region, was a result of more than seven years of
negotiations between China and the four countries.
</P>
<P>
It followed an agreement on confidence-building in the military
field in border areas, signed by the five presidents in China's
largest city, Shanghai, in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statesmen and diplomats said the Shanghai document was a unique
accord which guaranteed peace and stability in Central Asia, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, which initialled the two agreements, had
contributed enormously to solving the border problems, the
newspaper said, adding that the other three nations had also
participated actively.
</P>
<P>
Under the Moscow agreement, valid until the end of the year
2020, all parties will reduce military forces in border areas to
the minimum level suiting only defensive needs, and in accord with
their good-neighborly and friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
China shares with the other four countries more than 7,000
kilometers of border lines.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Set to Solve Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
planning to establish an islandwide network of industrial estates
to solve her unemployment problem, according to Ministry of
Industrial Development sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a program is underway to provide 60,000
jobs under the first stage and 100,000 jobs under the second stage
of 10 industrial estates which have already been launched.
</P>
<P>
under this program a further 23 sites have been identified
following feasibility studies and environmental tests.
Entrepreneurs were keen to set up ventures at these sites.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted, "Basically there is a growing demand to
develop industrial sites which would help generate employment at
the provincial level."
</P>
<P>
A garment industrial estate at Karadeniya in the south was
opened recently. It would immediately provide jobs to 250 persons
and another 750 persons during its second stage.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has adopted various measures to solve
its unemployment problem in the past few years. However, there are
still over one million unemployed in the country.

<HEADLINE> Czech Foreign Trade Deficit Keeps Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade deficit of the
Czech Republic in the first quarter of this year stood at 40.2
billion Koruny (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), up 47.8 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, exports amounted to 148
billion Koruny (5.1 billion dollars) while imports exceeded 188
billion Koruny (6.5 billion dollars) as shown by the latest figures
provided by the National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Less competitive products, fewer demands from its main West
trading partners and unchecked imports by some domestic units all
contribute to the huge trade deficit in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 161 billion Koruny (5.6 billion dollars) deficit in 1996,
accounting for 8.5 percent of the gross domestic product, goes
beyond the generally-regarded security line.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the foreign trade deficit this year to break
through the 200 billion Koruny (6.9 billion dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government has worked out a set of measures to
encourage exports and restrict imports.
</P>
<P>
These measures include the setting up of a system under which
importers are required to deposit 20 percent of the total imports
in cash to the designated banks as guarantees. No interest will
be paid on the deposits. The system came into force on April 21.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Colombian
government's import control measures, the country's imports in the
first quarter of this year grew 5.5 percent over the same period
last year, to 5.213 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But import taxes, part of the government's economic emergency
measures to curb spending, had resulted in a moderate March import
bill of 1.668 billion dollars, 5.8 percent down from a year
before, the Colombian Foreign Trade Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the major exporter to Colombia in the
quarter, providing a third of the country's imports.

QUITO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A United States company has

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Sack Impotent Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
will soon sack a number of senior officials who have failed to
implement his Anti-Corruption Program.
</P>
<P>
Vasily Durdinets, chairman of the Coordination Committee
against Corruption and Organized Crime, said Kuchma had strongly
criticized leaders of some ministries and bodies for their
inability to implement the Anti-corruption Program.
</P>
<P>
He named the ministries of transport, economy, and coal
industry, and the Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts (administrative
regions).
</P>
<P>
Durdinets, also a deputy prime minister, added that Kuchma made
the criticisms at a meeting of the Coordination Committee today,
which was also attended by Director of the National Security
Bureau Vladimir Radchenko and Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of governemnt funds in the Donetsk Oblast and the
Lugansk Oblast cropped up two weeks after Kuchma instituted the
Anti-Corruption Program, which aims to investigate all government
officials by October 1, and fire those who are found to be related
to graft or criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
Durdinets proposed to Kuchma at the meeting of Coordination
Committee that Minister of Transport, Alexandr Zolotoverkh, and
Deputy Economic Minister Vladimir Naumenko should be dismissed due
to their failure to tackle graft in their ministries.
</P>
<P>
Durdinets said that since the Anti-Corruption Program came into
effect, criminal activities had shown a downward tendency and the
detection rate had increased.
</P>
<P>
However, Durdinets stressed that the overall situation in the
country was not reason for optimism, especially in places like
Kiev, Crimea and Odessa.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Calls for Protest against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) today urged all Russian authorities, parties
and organizations to protest on May 9 against expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
May 9 is the holiday for "Victory in the Anti-Fascist War."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma made the appeal following a vote, 253 for and 14
against. The appeal was drafted by the Anti-NATO Commission of the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The appeal said the Russian people should not ignore the
increasing external threat to their country when they celebrated
"Victory Day."
</P>
<P>
The alliance's eastward expansion would put Russia under "the
most serious military threat" in the recent 50 years, the appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the State Duma also issued a statement, urging
parliaments of NATO member states to "understand" Russia's concern
about NATO's eastward expansion, and take necessary measures to
avoid new confrontation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Italian Car Maker Performs Well in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian auto group Fiat earned
2.37 trillion lire (1.39 billion U.S. dollars) in net profit last
year, up 9.4 percent from 1995, the company said today.
</P>
<P>
The Turin-based group, Italy's largest private industrial
giant, said its turnover rose by 4 percent in 1996 to 78 trillion
lire (45.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's recent involvement into a corruption
scandal and its chairman Cesare Romiti's 18-month jail sentence
earlier this month, the board meeting today predicted equally good
results for this year.
</P>
<P>
It reported that turnover was up 4.4 percent to 20.8 trillion
lire (12.2 billion dollars) in the first quarter of this year. Car
sales rose by 25 percent in March and are expected to stay at the
same level in April.
</P>
<P>
"The group has reached its new objectives in spite of an
economic context which is difficult throughout the world," said
Cesare Romiti, the most prominent business figure convicted since
the government started an anti-corruption campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Romiti, along with a former finance director of Fiat, was
sentenced on April 9 on charges of falsifying accounts of more
than 30 billion lire (17.6 million dollars) since the 1980s to
make payments to political parties and top Fiat managers abroad.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Rome state prosecutor's office is asking the
two top executives to stand another trial for allegedly paying 300
billion lire (175.9 million dollars) bribes to political parties
between 1983 and 1992 to ensure construction contracts.

<HEADLINE> Pak Budget Size to Be 10 Percent Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's national budget for
the next fiscal year 1997-98 is likely to be announced with 10
percent increase in total volume and around 5.3 percent deficit of
the gross domestic product, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the first budget document which has been completed
by the budget wing, more than 560 billion rupees (about 14 billion
U.S. dollars) has been based on overall 10 percent increase on the
overall savings, informed sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the current year, domestic savings well surpassed the
target by scoring an additional 10 percent on what was fixed.
</P>
<P>
As a paradigm shift, the government has decided to manage
supply side of the capital flow rather than curtailing expenditure
and narrowing down budget deficit, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Based on this understanding, the basic document has been
prepared by suggesting curtailment in the civil non-development
expenditures, proportional increase in the development expenditure
to carry on an ambitious development policy, and meeting the
deficit through short-term bank and private borrowings, they said.
</P>
<P>
A 5.2 percent gap between sources and expenditures, which is
about 30 billion rupees (about 750 million U.S. dollars) would be
filled through bank and other private borrowings, they said. In
this connection, a dialogue is already underway with the Citybank
and private sources based in the Gulf and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Once again this year debt serving would consume the biggest
chunk of total resources amounting to 38 percent of the budget,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
To curtail the current running expenditure, the government has
planned to downsize its overall strength by more than 50 percent
and several ministries have also been planned to be merged, they
said. These measures would be announced in the first week of May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Using Double Medical Standards in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Red Cross officials recently
pointed out that the U.S.-funded researchers are practicing double
standards in their medical experiments in Thailand, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, who conducted anti-AIDS treatment tests on
pregnant women in Thailand, gave some mothers a placebo, which is
unacceptable by some U.S. patient advocacy groups as it might
result in unnecessary death of infants, according to the Bangkok
Post.
</P>
<P>
Prapan Phanuphak, director of the Thai Red Cross Society's
program on AIDS, noted that the U.S. was displaying double
standards when they funded researches to find cheaper alternative
to expensive treatments with AZT, a drug which helps prevent the
spread of AIDS from mother to baby.
</P>
<P>
Some AIDS experts in Thailand said that Thailand should adopt
research standards to prevent unethical medical experiments from
being conducted on Thais.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Ethical Committee recently approved a proposal by
the communicable diseases control U.S.-Thai collaboration center
to carry out a study to minimize the impact of AZT on mothers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Implement New Tax Despite Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 25 (Xinhua) --The Nepali government is
determined to implement the new Value Added Tax (VAT) later this
year despite strong opposition from business circles, Finance
Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
The government will not yield to any kind of protest against
the new tax regime which is to be imposed from November, the
minister said at a round-table discussion meeting on VAT held here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nepali businessmen have been staging protests in different
parts of the country against the VAT tax, which the government
expects to increase national revenue and prevent tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
They said Nepal's tax authorities and business community lack
adequate preparations for the new tax regime and the VAT would
adversely affect the overall economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were still misguided by the perception that they
can press the government to scrap VAT by staging protest programs,
the finance minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government will ensure businessmen's
competitive capacities under the VAT by widening the tax coverage
rather than increasing the average tax rate.
</P>
<P>
He accused some businessmen of spreading rumors of price hikes
after the VAT implementation among the general public.
</P>
<P>
Such rumors were baseless, the minister said, explaining that
the new VAT system will replace the existing hotel tax,
entertainment tax, sales tax and excise.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the government would double its tax revenue
to nearly 2 million U.S. dollars a year through implementing the
VAT regime.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Develop Geothermal Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will increase its
geothermal power generation capacity to above 2,800 megawatt (mw)
by 2004 from the current capacity of 307.5 mw, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The government planned to increase geothermal power generation
capacity by 2,500 mw by the end of the Seventh Five-year
Development Plan in 2003/2004, senior official of state
electricity company Pln Aswani Sjechumar said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Aswani told a seminar on geothermal power that this additional
power will increase the ratio of the geothermal power production
to the country's total power production to 12.5 percent in
2003/2004 from only 2 percent now, sources at the seminar said
today.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's power generation capacity from all power
sources was projected to increase to 39,737.5 mw by 2003/2004 from
14,998 mw at present.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a geothermal resource supply of over 20,000 mw,
making it one of the biggest in the world, but only 0.23 percent
of this has been developed.
</P>
<P>
Now, Indonesia has only four geothermal power plants in West
Java and North Sulawesi.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States saw a deficit
of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in its trade with Thailand last year,
a decrease of 824 million dollars or 16.3 percent from 1995.
</P>

The U.S. merchandise exports to Thailand posted 7.2 billion
dollars in value last year, an increase of 809 million dollars or
12.6 percent.

<P>
While the U.S. imports from Thailand recorded 11.3 billion
dollars, a decline of 15 million dollars or 0.1 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the stock of U.S. foreign direct
investment (FDI) in Thailand rose 22.9 percent to 4.6 billion
dollars in 1995 compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the U.S. FDI in Thailand is concentrated largely on

<P>
CARACAS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Four member countries of the
Andean Community trade bloc, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and
Venezuela, will create a commission to study the consequences of
Peru's withdrawal from the bloc.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Frenddy Rojas Parra, Venezuelan
development minister, who attended the recently concluded Andean
summit in Sucre, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community member nations all considered Peru's
participation important for the bloc, Rojas Parra said.
</P>
<P>
Peru announced on April 11 its decision to leave the group,
which was founded in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Peru claimed the group was not living up to its mission of
creating freer trade in the region. But the move came after other
members rejected its proposals for entering the group's common
external tariff.
</P>
<P>
During the recent summit, the Andean Community group pledged to
begin talks with Panama on an agreement incorporating Pananma in
the bloc in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The summit also confirmed the bloc's commitment to concluding
negotiations for a free trade agreement with South America's
biggest trade bloc, Mercosur, and joining negotiations for a Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Calls for Boosting Paddy Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General Than
Shwe has called for boosting paddy production in the country in
the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on boosting paddy production here
Thursday, Than Shwe, who is chairman of the Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council, stressed that the nation must be built
on the agriculture sector, official paper The New Light of Myanmar
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said paddy, the major crop of the nation, is fetching 40
percent of the nation's income, emphasizing the need for expanding
cultivation of profitable, major foreign exchange-earning crops
such as paddy, beans, cotton and sugarcane as well as edible oil
crops.
</P>
<P>
He also called for turning the remaining virgin and fallow land
 on the western sector of the Ayeyawaddy River, which is the major
 area for producing paddy, into farmland.
</P>
<P>
He further called for transformation of ideas, concepts and
techniques for increasing the output of major crops.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's paddy output in the
1995-96 fiscal year was recorded at 19 million tons, while its
rice export was at 353,100 tons.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of Myanmar's agriculture in the last
four fiscal years from 1992-93 to 1995-96 stood at 8.8 percent and
is targeted at 5.4 percent in the next five fiscal years from
1996-97 to 2000-01.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Australia Sign Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Australia signed an
agreement for an Australia-Indonesia development area (AIDA)
cooperation scheme Thursday in Ambon, capital of Maluke province,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
AIDA is a sub-regional economic zone linking northern Australia
with eastern Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
AIDA's main aim is to provide the private sector with a good
business climate.
</P>
<P>
The AIDA economic and trade cooperation scheme was made because
the Australian government believed Indonesia with its economic
growth now recorded at 7.5 percent a year would become a strong
country in the years to come, the reports quoted officials here as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Australia views the sub-regional cooperation agreement as
being mutually beneficial for the two countries," Indonesia's
Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto
said after the signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
"We can encourage our entrepreneurs to create joint venture
cooperation with their Australian counterparts to develop economic
growth through tourism, agriculture, education and culture,
mining, industries, trade and transportation," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto pledged to give AIDA equal status as other
sub-regional economic zones it was involved in through the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) like the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore growth triangle and
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer said
on the occasion that AIDA would enhance Australian firms'
profitability, create more jobs for Australians and benefit firms
and people in eastern Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia to Restrict Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government will take
measures to restrict imports from May 1, Minister of Finance
Sergej Kozlik told the press Wednesday in Bratislava, capital of
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, the importers are required to hand in 20
percent of the total imports in cash as guarantees, otherwise the
imported goods cannot clear the customs.
</P>
<P>
Import of non-alcoholic beverages will be restricted to 45
million liters per year; if necessary, import quotas will be
imposed on agricultural and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
These tentative actions were taken to reduce spiraling foreign
trade deficits in the country and it is noticed that they came
immediately after the Czech Republic announced measures to
restrict imports and encourage exports to reduce its own huge
trade deficits.
</P>
<P>
Kozlik said in restricting imports Slovakia is not retaliating
against Czechs, but is trying to reduce the adverse effect on the
Slovak economy inflicted by the czech measures.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fruit Exports Face Tough Measures from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is getting
tough with Thai plant imports found with pests and chemicals and
Thai farmers and fruit exporters are urged to take measures to
tackle the problem seriously.
</P>
<P>
The problem will escalate and Thai farmers and exporters will
be hurt if no solution is brought in, warned Thai Deputy
Agriculture Minister Krit Kongpetch Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand last year should have exported about 12-million-dollar
worth of orchid to the EU, but the actual export value was at 7.8
million dollars because many orchid exports were found without
pest-free certificates, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
France last year destroyed some Thai orchids found with pests
and sent officials to Thailand to solve the problem, the
newspapers quoted Thai agriculture officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Italy also seized and destroyed 4,000 tons of Thai orchids
found with pests during march 21-31 and is requiring Thailand, the
largest exporter of orchids to it, to solve the pest problem by
May, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
Krit urged Thai farmers and fruit exporters to cooperate in
overcoming the pest problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy is ready to help chaos-torn
Albania rebuild its judiciary and penitentiary system as well as
train Albanian policemen and magistrates.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Italian Justice Minister
Giovanni Maria Flick, following the conclusion of a two-day
Italian-Albanian justice ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Flick told reporters he would visit Albania when necessary to
get first hand knowledge about how to help the country.
</P>
<P>
Italy was also ready to start training a contingent of Albanian
policemen who would act as penitentiary guards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council of Magistrates, the self-ruling body of
Italy's independent judiciary, would help train Albanian
magistrates, he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Italian aid "indispensable", Albanian Justice
Minister Spartak Ngjela said of his country: "The state has
stopped working, the justice system has been destroyed physically
and institutionally."
</P>
<P>
There was only one court working in the Albanian capital, and
two or three in the other major cities, Ngjela added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of bilateral extradition treaty, Ngjela said
Albania would ratify the European convention on extradition.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the Easter weekend tragedy in
which up to 89 Albanian refugees died when their small boat
capsized after colliding with an Italian Navy corvette on the
lower Adriatic, Ngjela said: "It was an accident, not a political
issue."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Italian authorities for the recovery of the
sunken boat and the bodies of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Agree to Continue with Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to continue
implementing their interim ceasefire to prevent a showdown between
soldiers and rebels that would undermine the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached this consensus after holding the third
round of low-level talks on April 23-24 at a university in the
southern Mindanao, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF signed an interim truce after a
series of military clashes in February this year. However, the
agreement was often violated with both sides blaming each other
for provoking first.
</P>
<P>
As agreed upon in the latest talks, the two sides will continue
with this truce and will further discuss at the next meeting a
broader ceasefire to cover the whole area of Mindanao where
thousands of military troops and rebels are facing a standoff.
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Gaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
that unless both sides can forge the comprehensive ceasefire
agreement, the formal negotiations can not take off.
</P>
<P>
Gaafar said the MILF insisted that a four-point proposal it
raised earlier should be discussed in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes the military's adherence to the Article
of War of the Geneva Convention, a halt to army deployment in
Mindanao, recognition of MILF territories and the immediate
pull-out of troops from the conflicting area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticized for Absence From Drugs Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombian General
Attorney Alfonso Valdivieso today criticized the United States for
its absence from the meeting of an international drugs forum.
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso said that since the United States was one of the
countries with the largest number of drug users, there was no
reason for it to be absent.
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso chairs the International Forum of Anti-Drug
Experts which is holding a conference in Cartagena, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington's absence left many questions unanswered,
and all those attending the meeting, including Colombia, needed an
explanation from Washington.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the U.S. government acknowledge the efforts of the
drug-producing countries in fighting drug trafficking, and their
policies to eradicate illicit drug plants.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded from the U.S. government a clear commitment to
reducing drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
Drug experts from 20 countries are gathering in Cartagena for a
joint analysis of the mechanisms to reduce the demand and supply
of drugs at an international level.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting sponsored by Colombia's Foreign
Ministry, the experts are also expected to prepare a document to
be presented at the United Nations General Assembly in 1998.

and sent them to the Amazonia," said Menem.
</P>
<P>
"That was a definite proof that there is not any kind of
problem in the military field between Brazil and Argentina," he
added.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The first national fair for
investment and trade will make its debut in Xiamen on September
8-13, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation as saying that the
national fair is aimed at promoting and guiding investment
activities, while focusing on the quality of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 key projects for foreign investment and a
variety of commodities will be recommended to foreign business
persons by nearly 40 domestic groups participating in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair, dubbed China Fair for International Investment and
Trade (CFIIT), evolved from the annual Fujian Fair for Investment
and Trade, which has been held successfully since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The fair will help accelerate the development of trade and
economic co-operation between foreign countries and China's
central and western parts, as well as trade between foreign-funded
ventures in the country's coastal areas and those in relatively
under-developed areas. Positioned on the brink of the Taiwan
Straits, the fair will be conducive to economic and trade
co-operation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Taiwan business people have expressed their
intention to participate in CFIIT and also the Cross-Strait
Commodity Fair, which coincides with CFIIT.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's second largest recipient of foreign
investment for three consecutive years, Vice-Minister Sun Zhenyu
said.

President Diosadado Macapagal who died Monday night at the age of

The Philippine Journal:

<HEADLINE> Czech Foreign Trade Deficit Keeps Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade deficit of the
Czech Republic in the first quarter of this year stood at 40.2
billion Koruny (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), up 47.8 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, exports amounted to 148
billion Koruny (51 billion dollars) while imports exceeded 188
billion Koruny (65 billion dollars) as shown by the latest figures
provided by the National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Less competitive products, fewer demands from its main West
trading partners and unchecked imports by some domestic units all
contribute to the huge trade deficit in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The 161 billion Koruny (56 billion dollars) deficit in 1996,
accounting for 8.5 percent of the gross domestic product, goes
beyond the generally-regarded security line.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the foreign trade deficit this year to break
through the 200 billion Koruny (69 billion dollars) mark.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government has worked out a set of measures to
encourage exports and restrict imports.
</P>
<P>
These measures include the setting up of a system under which
importers are required to deposit 20 percent of the total imports
in cash to the designated banks as guarantees. No interest will
be paid on the deposits. The system came into force on April 21.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (43-44) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (43-44)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the relationship between the judiciary of the
Hong Kong SAR and its counterparts in other local districts of the
interior area?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Basic Law, no departments of the
central government and no province, autonomous region and
centrally-administered municipality may interfere in affairs to
be administered by the Hong Kong SAR on its own in accordance with
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR may, through consultations and in accordance
with law, maintain judicial relations with judicial organs of
other parts of the country, and they may render mutual assistance,
the Basic Law says.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme
People's Procuratorate and judicial organs of provinces,
autonomous regions and centrally-administered municipalities
cannot extend their judicial power to the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Criminal cases that occur in the Hong Kong SAR are subject to
the power of judicial organs of the Hong Kong SAR only. Similarly,
the judicial power of courts in the Hong Kong SAR cannot reach the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the relationship between the judiciary of the
Hong Kong SAR and its executive and legislative branches?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Judiciary independence is an important principle for
the juridical operation of the Hong Kong SAR. Judicial organs of
the Hong Kong SAR are independent of the SAR's executive and
legislative branches and will try cases independently, free from
any interference from any individuals and groups so as to achieve
judicial fairness. Members of the judiciary are immune from legal
action in the performance of their judicial duties.

<HEADLINE> World Faces No Immediate Major Financial Danger: IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) asserted today that he sees no immediate
danger of a financial crisis like that shock to international
markets in Mexico in later 1994.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, the Managing Director of the 181-nation IMF
made the remarks while addressing a press briefing here prior to
the joint spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said, "such crises are widely unpredictable," the IMF would
pay closer attention "to hot spots on the planet" so it doesn't
get caught by surprise again.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he sees no reason for alarm in Japan, where the
fund has maintained close contact with Japanese officials on
"putting their financial sector in order." Camdessus also said
South Korea, Thailand and Brazil do not face threatening financial
situations.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus has said the world's next financial problem will be a
banking crisis or will have a banking system weakness as a major
component.
</P>
<P>
On other topics, he welcomed the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's
March 25 decision to raise interest rates. It will send a prudent
signal to global financial markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief today also issued a statement applauding debt
relief package for Uganda. "I am certain that this will be an
extremely positive signal to the rest of the world, and I was
happy to hear that the Ugandan Minister of Planning and Economic
Development immediately reacted to this decision by warmly
welcoming this package of debt relief."
</P>
<P>
Under the package, Uganda is expected to receive about 340
million (in Net Present Value(NPV) terms or in April 1998 dollars)
from all its creditors, which represents a reduction of about 20
percent in Uganda's debt. The IMF share of this initiative is
about 70 million dollars. All multilateral creditors are expected
to reduce their claims on Uganda in NPV terms by about 20 percent.

Smrekar, rated 115th in the world, clinched a 12-21, 21-12,
21-15 victory over world No. 7 player after China's Olympic
champion Liu Guoliang won the first game.
</P>
<P>
Ding looked compeletly out of form as he failed to put up his
trademark chop-and-attack game.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Chinese jumped to international stardom in the
1995 world championships, where he snatched a crucial point in
China's 3-2 final victory over three-time world champion Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Ding also ousted 1991 world singles champion Jorgen Persson of
Sweden and then world No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive of Beigium en route
to finishing fourth in the last Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"Ding Song is no longer a secret to Europeans," said Chinese
head coach Cai Zhenhua. "They have been studying his style since
the 1995 championships."
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Kong Linghui and Olympic champion Liu Guoliang won
the last two rubbers for China.
</P>
<P>
In the most dramatic match of the day, Jean-Philippe Saive
saved Belgium by winning two games while his elder brother
Jean-Michael lost as many in the match against Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Philippe, ranked 50th in the world, upset world No. 4 Vladimir
Samsonov and blanked Evgueni Chtchetinine to help Belgium win 3-2.
</P>
<P>
World No. 8 Michael Saive, singles runner-up in the 1993
Worlds, was stunned 2-1 by Chtchetinine in the opening game.
Saive was so angry with his poor performance that he threw his bat
to the ground after the match.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Saive evened the score as he overcome one-set deficit
to beat Samsonov 13-21, 21-12, 21-19. The 20-year-old Samsonov, a
player willing to rally until his rival leaves an opening, found
Philippe's forehand topspins too strong to return.
</P>
<P>
Andras Podpinka put Belgium ahead with a 21-12, 21-10 victory
over Pavel Chomtchonak.
</P>
<P>
Michael Saive continued his poor form in the fourth game, lost
in straight sets to Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Philippe saved face for the Saives as he snatched the deciding
set over Chtchetinine 21-17, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"Philippe is a hero for the Belgium team," said Belgian head
coach Wang Dayong.
</P>
<P>
"His elder brother played poorly today, but Michael always
comes into shape late," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden rested world No. 2 Jan-Ove Waldner and No.15 Peter
Karlsson on Thursday as Jorgen Persson led Thomas Von Scheele and
Kayode Kadiri to beat Slovakia 3-1.

<P>
ATHENS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece today accepted the request
put forward by Romania in assisting the latter to dispatch its
troops to be stationed in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said at press
conference that the Romanian troops participating in the
Italian-led multinational security force in Albania would arrive
in Greece by ship and be transported to Albania by Greek vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"It is a development with considerable political significance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations approved the formation of a 5,000
multinational security force last month to oversee the
distribution of humanitarian aid to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Troops from eight countries such as Greece and Romania are
expected to implement the U.N.-mandated relief operations which
will last three months.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Contraceptive Pills Safe for Women with No Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A new study has shown that women
who have no predisposing risk factors for cardiovascular disease
are at a very low, if any, additional risk of heart attack from
the use of oral contraceptive pills, according to a press release
issued here today by the the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
"This study is important because it provide for the first time
reliable data on the risk of heart attack in pill users in
developing countries," says Dr Giuseppe Benagiano, director of a
special research program jointly sponsored by The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), The United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA), WHO and the World Bank, the United Nations. "It confirms
that young women in both developed and developing countries who
have no risk factors for cardiovascular disease can use the pill
safely."
</P>
<P>
However, the study has found that the risk of heart attack
rises substantially in pill users over 35 year of age if they
smoke or have high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
In pill users who smoked 10 or more cigarettes a day, the
relative risk of heart attack in the study was more than 20 times
higher than in women who did not smoke or did not use the pill. In
the case of pill users with a history of high blood pressure,
including during pregnancy, the overall relative risk of heart
attack was found to be 10 times higher than in those who did not
have high blood pressure or did not use the pill. These findings
in the study were similar in both developed and developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Peaceful Settlement of Mideast Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government had
all along stood for the settlement of the question of Jerusalem
through peaceful negotiations by the parties concerned on the
basis of the relevant UN resolutions, Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 10th Emergency Special Session of the UN
General Assembly this afternoon, Qin said the construction of
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem had brought the Middle East
peace process to another deadlock and tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We express grave concern over this development and once again
urge the Israeli government to immediately stop building Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to move out of the current difficulties and prevent
the whole Middle East peace process from going backwards, all
parties concerned must make efforts to remove obstruction and
obstacles and implement all the agreements reached as soon as
possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called the parties concerned to exercise restraint and keep
calm, cherish the hard-won peace situation and strictly observe
the agreements reached by Palestine and Israel so as to create
conditions for an early, fair, reasonable and lasting solution to
the Middle East question.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly
focuses on discussion of illegal Israeli actions in occupied East
Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory. It
is held, at the request of the Group of Arab States and state
members of the Non-Aligned Movement, under the 1950 General
Assembly resolution 377 (V), entitled "Uniting for peace."
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council held twice extensive discussions on
illegal Israeli actions and failed to adopt a resolution because
of U.S. vetos on March 7 and 21. Under such circumstances, the
General Assembly shall continue the matter with a view to making
appropriate recommendations to the members for collective
measures.

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomed a
treaty signed by China, Russia and three other Central Asian
countries over the reduction of their troops along a 4,300- mile
border, the State Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes the agreement signed between Russia
and China because we hope that Russia and China will fully
normalize their bilateral relationship and take efforts to make
sure that the long border between the two countries is stable and
peaceful," spokesman Burns said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
He also said a treaty signed by China's President Jiang Zemin
with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan "is a very
important treaty."
</P>
<P>
"This treaty leads to greater transparency in the military
relationships among those countries and we hope it will lead to an
improvement on the situation along that common border," he added.
</P>
<P>
Burns expressed his disagreement on press comments on a meeting
between President Jiang Zeming and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, which the press comments called was "some kind of
face-off with the United States."
</P>

"That's not how we see it." he said.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Costs EU 40 Billion Pounds Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- International fraud costs the
European Union (EU) more than 40 billion pounds (about 65 billion
U.S. dollars) a year largely because regulatory discrepancies
between EU countries are exploited by professional criminals,
according to a recent report.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced for the EU Commission by forensic
accountants at Deloitte and Touche, highlighted the increasing
sophistication of fraudsters by saying that there is now an
escalating technological "arms race" between criminals and their
victims.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that fraud within EU is of such a scale
that it has the power seriously to distort competition between
member states and can touch most individuals in the 15-nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone pays for fraud through higher taxes, higher prices
and shoddy goods, even if they are not direct victims," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Will Inglis, one of the authors of the report, was quoted by
press reports as saying: "There is a trend for organized criminals
to devote more effort to white-collar crime, because the risks are
lower and the rewards are higher."
</P>
<P>
The whole question of crime and fraud within Europe is expected
to be debated at the concluding session of the EU
Inter-Governmental Conference in Amsterdam in mid-June.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Hold Conference to Encourage Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program will hold a round-table conference here next week to
promote private investments and free trade in Africa, according to
a UNDP press release today.
</P>
<P>
During the conference from April 29 to 30, delegates from all
16 member states of OHADA (French acronym for Organization for the
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa) will meet potential
donors to put forward their plan to have the business law of the
members states coordinated.
</P>
<P>
The initiative comes after three years of steady economic
growth in the OHADA area, from around two percent in 1994 to four
percent in 1995 and five percent in 1996. Growth has been due
mostly to the renewed dynamism of crash crop exports such as
cotton seed, coffee, cocoa and groundnuts; tourism; forestry; and
mining output like oil, gold, diamonds, uranium, bauxite and
phosphates.
</P>
<P>
In order to reinforce the positive economic trends, OHADA
countries need to attract private investment. OHADA's total
financing requirements come to 50 million U.S. dollars over a
period of 12 years. Half the sum will come from member states. The
other half will be sought from donors.
</P>
<P>
OHADA's main objective is therefore to ensure legal and
judicial security for foreign and national private investors
operating in the member countries. To achieve this, it relies on
three mechanisms:
</P>
<P>
- Introduction of uniform modern law for all member states;
</P>
<P>
- Establishment of a common, independent judicial institution
responsible for settling business disputes effectively, rapidly
and transparently;
</P>
<P>
- Establishment of a school of magistrature responsible for
providing advanced training to magistrates and legal staff.
</P>
<P>
According to UNDP, the potential for private investment in
Africa is growing due to the strict policies of structural
adjustment which are being enacted, including the privatization of
public enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"OHADA is a concrete measure designed to address this problem
and should be encouraged," says Alan Doss, acting Director of
UNDP's Regional Bureau for Africa. "UNDP lends full support to the
OHADA program which falls in line with our agency's main objective
to reduce global poverty. Creating a dynamic business environment
in Africa is an important initial step towards improving the life
conditions of millions of people in one of the world's poorest
regions."
</P>
<P>
OHADA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central
African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea,
Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Chad,
Togo.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Session Call on Restoring Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Most speakers addressing a
special session of the UN General Assembly today called on Israel
to end its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest
of the occupied Palestinian territories so as to save the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 10th Emergency Special Session
of the General Assembly, Razail Ismail, president of the assembly
and permanent representative of Malaysia, said that the emergency
special session reflected the conviction of the membership that
there existed an increasingly grave situation involving peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, the Security Council had twice and
General Assembly once, held extensive discussions on the illegal
Israeli actions in the occupied East Jerusalem and rest of the
occupied Palestinian territories. The session also underlined the
resolve of member states to seek recourse in the Assembly to
resolve the issue with all peaceful means, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first speaker at the special session was Nasser al-Kidwa,
permanent observer of Palestine. After reviewing the events since
the occupation in 1967 of Palestinian territory, he said that
Israeli actions had flagrantly violated the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949, the Hague Regulations of 1907 and UN
resolutions, including 24 Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Ibra Deguene Ka of Senegal, Chairman of the Committee on the
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, said
that the committee deeply regretted the reasons for the present
emergency special session, namely, Israel's intransigence with
regard to its policy of settlement in the Palestinian territories
occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government should recognize that the quest for
justice in the region was not only a response to Palestinian and
Arab demands. It was also in Israel's interest if it desired
peaceful co-existence with its neighbors," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Bin Hamad al-Khalifa of Qatar criticized U.S. unfair use
of the veto which had encouraged Israel to continue its defiance
of the international community and to begin construction of the
settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
Samodra Sriwidjaja of Indonesia said that the commencement of
the building of a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim was not an
isolated event. It was a link in a long chain of illegal acts
committed against the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
"Israel could not be exempted from the principles of
international law and the provisions of the United Nations
Charter, and it could not base its existence and security on the
denial of Palestinians' right to self-determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Elaraby stressed that the Jewish
settlements were a strong blow to Security Council resolution 242
(1967), and the land for peace formula derived from that
resolution. In addition, it was not fair to ask the Palestinians
to negotiate what was a fait accompli, which was the establishment
of the settlements themselves. Israel's actions cast doubt on the
credibility of its desire for peace and attacked the basis for
peace.
</P>
<P>
Slaheddine Abdelllah of Tunisia said that Jerusalem was the
"touchstone" of the Palestinian question. Israel should live up to
its commitments and end its futile attempt to change the
character of the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The international community must take up its responsibility to
ensure the achievement of peace. The Assembly must adopt a
resolution demanding that Israel halt its construction of
settlements and respect international agreements and conventions,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Calls for More Say for Smaller States in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Prime Minister
Constantinos Simitis today called for more say for smaller
countries during the process of the European Union (EU) reform.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who is on a six-day visit to Germany, met German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today in Bonn with discussions focusing on
the EU's ongoing reform conference known as the Inter-Governmental
Conference (IGC).
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues on the IGC agenda is to consider
streamlining the way of decision-making by the 15-member EU in
order to prepare it, among other things, for taking in new members
from Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has been backing an expansion of majority voting instead
of the current system which gives each member the right of veto.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that while his government supported more use of
majority voting, it also wanted to maintain the right of veto for
issues which would effect vital national interests.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that the same membership requirements apply to
all EU countries when the EU makes the decision in May 1998 on
which countries will be able to qualify for the planned single
European currency, the Euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Simitis admitted that his country would not be able to make the
first wave to join the Euro in 1999, but is prepared to join the
club in the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Appear Likely to Approve Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate would most
likely approve the Chemical Weapons Convention during a vote
scheduled later today as a leading Republican opponent changes his
position to support the pact.
</P>
<P>
Trent Lott, the Senate Majority Leader, said he would vote for
the treaty after President Bill Clinton promised the Senate that
he would withdraw from the Chemical Weapons Treaty (CWC) if the
the pact inadvertently results in the spread of of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the promise in a letter to Lott, which is part of
a campaign launched by the administration for the ratification of
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Lott told a news conference, "This commitment is
unprecedented," adding that the assurances had affected his
thinking although he still remained uncommitted on how to vote for
the pact.
</P>
<P>
Lott and Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, have been lobbying for not approving the treaty,
demanding amendments to the document.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote later today on the convention,
which is to take effect on April 29 with or without the U.S.'s
participation. A two-thirds majority would be needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Clinton said he was "prepared to withdraw from
the treaty" if other countries used its provisions to proliferate
chemical weapons technology and endanger U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
Article 10 and 11 of the treaty require contracting parties to
provide chemical weapons defenses and call for exchanges of
peaceful chemicals and technology among the parties.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter aims at easing the concerns of the opponents
about the provisions. Lott and Helms insist that some countries
may use the provisions to spread poison gas and attack the U.S.
chemical weapons technology.

<HEADLINE> Report: Medicare Feared Bankrupt in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Medicare trustees say the
nation's hospital insurance trust fund can last only four years.
</P>
<P>
The latest projected lifespan of the system represents a
negligible change from last year's forecast.
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said,
"Today's report makes clear that the time to act to preserve
Medicare is now. With insolvency only four years away, the
administration and the Congress have no time to waste."
</P>
<P>
Without immediate legislation, the government-funded health
insurance program will be unable to pay for hospital services,
hospices and home health agencies for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Budget negotiations between the White House and Congress are
stuck partly because of differing views by Democrats and
Republicans on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Democrats contended the Republican was seeking to
slash Medicare spending for the elderly at least in part to
