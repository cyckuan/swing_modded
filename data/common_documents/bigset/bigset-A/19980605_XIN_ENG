<HEADLINE> Boeing to Close Toronto Plant in Late 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Aerospace giant Boeing Co. is
expected to close its Toronto area plant in late 1999 with the
loss of more than 2,000 highly skilled jobs, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official decision to close the plant. But
George Capern, president of the Canadian division, has confirmed
that it is "the logical conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Boeing has almost twice the factory space it needs following
its purchase of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. last year, which owned
the Toronto plant.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is picking the best plant from each company and closing
the rest. There is nothing that can be done to save the plant,
Capern said.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto plant was one of the most important in the
McDonnell Douglas aviation empire. It made the wings for every
DC-8, DC-9 and DC-10 jetliner in the world, and for the newer
equivalents of the latter two.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, Boeing decided to cut production of most
McDonnell Douglas aircraft and close the plants they were made in.
</P>
<P>
The company has already announced that the production of the
MD-80 and MD-90 jetliners will end early next year with the loss
of 800 Toronto-area jobs.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the MD-11 would die in late 1999, ending jobs
for another 600 Canadian workers.

undermined and the international non-proliferation regime is faced
with a critical test," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is thus all the more imperative for the Permanent Five to
demonstrate strong political will, and, in the interest of peace
and stability in which we share a common stake, explore ways to
reverse the nuclear arms race in South Asia, consolidate the
international non-proliferation regime and prevent the escalation
of tension in South Asia," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vehicle Sales Jump in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The sales of cars and trucks in
the United States surpassed 1.5 million in May, a 12.1 percent
rise over the same month last year, the New York Times said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Car sales went up 6.9 percent while light-truck sales rose 18.4
percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by hefty price cuts, the seasonally adjusted annual
selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and
trucks in the year to last month, the highest level since October
1987.
</P>
<P>
Sales were driven up also by attractive incentive programs.
Automakers spent as much as 1,600 U.S. dollars a vehicle on
incentives in May, up from about 1,100 dollars a year ago,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, General Motors sent certificates worth 500 to
1,000 dollars to previous buyers of G.M. products for the purchase
50 different models, above and beyond other cash rebates and
low-interest loan incentives.
</P>
<P>
General Motors said Thursday that its sales of cars and trucks
grew by 12.4 percent compared with May 1997, with truck sales up
by 19.2 percent and cars by seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Ford reported a 1.2 percent growth in the sales of cars and
trucks in the year to May 1997, with its car sales falling by by
5.5 percent but truck sales soaring by 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said Tuesday that it had its best month yet in May,
selling 250,031 cars and trucks, a 27 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and German automakers also reported strong sales in
the U.S. in May.

PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The biggest union of striking pilots
of Air France, the SNPL, said Thursday afternoon that they are
nearing a deal with the company's management.
</P>
<P>
But the SNPL refused to confirm reports that the pilots were
ready to accept a reduction of their salaries in exchange for
obligation for the shares of the company in a limited period of
time, the major dispute between the pilots and the management.
</P>
<P>
The pilots and the management will resume full talks this
evening and are expected to reach a deal after four days of strike
that greatly paralyzed the long-haul flights of Air France and
forced the company to cancel from 60 to 70 percent of the short
and medium-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
All French political leaders have called on the two sides to
reach an agreement as soon as possible, with the World Cup
football finals only being six days away.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Former FM Offered Deputy Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's former foreign
minister, Kelebone Maope, who was surprisingly excluded from
Lesotho's new cabinet, has been offered the position of deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I have been offered this position and there is a likelihood
that I will be joining cabinet next week," South African Press
Association (SAPA) Thursday quoted Maope as saying in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
Another surprise exclusion, former prime minister Ntsu
Mokhehle's brother Shakhane, has been offered the portfolio of
works and transport, and he is likely to accept it soon, said
SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Maope and Mokhehle were excluded from the cabinet announced by
Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili on Wednesday, apparently
because they declined ministerial posts in protest against
certain appointments to the cabinet, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a source close to Maope and Mokhehle as saying
that they were not happy with the suggested composition of the
cabinet and the lack of consultation by the prime minister in the
process of appointing ministers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Mosisili said a deputy prime minister had
not been appointed yet as he was still consulting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Two portfolios -- works and transport and agriculture,
cooperatives and land reclamation -- had also not been filled but
the matter was receiving attention, Mosisili said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen cabinet ministers were sworn in Thursday morning by
Chief Justice Joseph Kheola in the presence of King Letsie III.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet was formed after the ruling LCD won a sweeping
victory in the mountain kingdom's May 23 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Ailing former prime minister Ntsu Mokhehle announced
resignation on May 28, paving the way for Mosisili, Mokhehle's
deputy, to step into his shoes.

<HEADLINE> Vote May Be Called on Israeli-Palestinian Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Thursday that progress has been made towards a
redeployment agreement with the Palestinians, and he did not rule
out the possibility of a referendum on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are "very
close" toward an agreement on Israeli pullback from the West Bank
in order to revive the peace process, informed sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that despite the
progress, he did not know when and if an agreement would be
signed. Meanwhile, he dismissed as "out of date" Israeli press
reports on a revised United States proposal.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility of
presenting the agreement for a referendum, which was called for by
far-right wingers in his Likud coalition.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, head of the extremist Knesset (Parliament)
group Land of Israel Front, demanded that Netanyahu "go to the
people" with any redeployment agreement he reached with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A deal may be "nearer than any one thinks," he said. If so, the
right wing will commit itself to voting no-confidence on the prime
minister, he warned.
</P>
<P>
But his idea for a referendum was categorically rejected by
coalition whip Meir Shetrit. There is no need for a referendum
since it would only postpone the actual progress in the talks, he
said. "It is quite clear that most of the people in Israel would
like to see the peace process going on," he added.
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the Palestinians will undoubtedly be approved
by the Knesset "by a large majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shetrit acknowledged that the coalition is likely to fall
apart over this issue but stressed that "this is the risk we must
take."
</P>
<P>
Sources have said that Netanyahu was trying to combine the
three stages of redeployment into a 15 percent pullback, and if it
was accepted by the U.S. and the Palestinians, he would make
further concessions.
</P>
<P>
But according to the reported U.S. proposal, in a period of 12
weeks divided into three phases, 12 percent of Israeli controlled
territory Area C will go to jointly controlled Area B; 1 percent
of Area C will go to Area A under Palestinian control; and an
additional 14.2 percent of Area B will go to Area A.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported earlier Thursday that U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross was holding talks in London with senior Palestinian
officials Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala)
over the revised U.S. proposal.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Sees Benefit In Improving Employability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British firms recognize that
providing more on-the-job training helps productivity and
encourages staff to remain with the company.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two thirds of firms already train employees beyond the
needs of their current job, according to the latest edition of CBI
News (Confederation of British Industry).
</P>
<P>
Initial findings by a major CBI survey, Employment Trends, have
found that increasing employees' employability can have benefit in
terms of better skills, adaptability, motivation, and retention of
staff.
</P>
<P>
The survey findings also reveal that companies'working patterns
are becoming more flexible. Forty-one percent of firms are using
more contract workers, 47 per cent more temporary staff, and 38
per cent more flexible working hours.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four percent of organizations have also reported that
they feel that job security has decreased over the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Adair Turner, CBI Director General,
said: "These changes towards greater flexibility have been vital
to the UK's improved record on unemployment."
</P>
<P>
"Individuals' confidence in their own employability is the key
antidote to job insecurity, enabling them to see labor market
flexibility as liberating rather than threatening," he added.
</P>
<P>
CBI identifies three key "interests vitally concerned with
achieving employability":
</P>
<P>
- The individual: it is individuals who are or become
employable and an "employable individual has the qualities and
competencies that employers need.
</P>
<P>
- Society: Increased employability is key to helping flexible
labor markets work effectively, leading to both higher potential
growth and greater social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
- Business interest: Companies that focus on employees'
employability can benefit from having, among other things,a better
skilled, productive and adaptable workforce.

<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade in key industrial shares on
the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the second largest one in Africa,
Thursday remained firm, pushing the index 54 points up to 7,436.
</P>
<P>
The market has been bullish for the past four days on the back
of firming tobacco prices which are helping to stablize the
Zimbabwean Dollar, and this week's release of the first tranche
of a 176 million U.S. Dollars stand-by balance of payment support
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In minings, the index lost 41 points to close at 369.
</P>
<P>
But brokers were cautious about the market's recovery, saying
it was fragile and would not be sustainable, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think this is sustainable because in mid-July we
are likely to witness hostile wage negotiations which might put a
dent on the current rally," said an analyst from Quincor James
Capel Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
"There is also an overhanging fuel price hike which will
obviously trigger a wave of price increases in other
commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doubts emerged in the market about the government's
ability to meet the stringent targets tied to the IMF aid,
raising fears that the country may fail to secure the remaining
tranches.

<HEADLINE> International Panel Soon to Probe into Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- An international panel set up
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) is to visit Rwanda
soon for investigation into the 1994 genocide in that country,
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The panel will also attend a solemn ceremony in memory of the
victims of the genocide after arriving in Rwanda, Salim told the
68th ordinary session of the OAU council of ministers opened here
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief announced Wednesday the composition of the
7-member international panel of eminent personalities, three of
whom are from outside Africa, to investigate the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda and surrounding events.
</P>
<P>
It will also visit other countries of the Great Lakes region
and elsewhere as appropriate, said Salim, who is here to attend
the coming OAU summit scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
He therefore appealed to member states and all other states
and institutions concerned to extend full cooperation to the
panel to enable it to discharge its important responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed," said Salim, "the knowledge of what went wrong and
what was not done to prevent the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, is
critical for us, particularly as part of our efforts to prevent
future occurrence of a tragedy of such magnitude."
</P>
<P>
"For the Great Lakes Region, this is absolutely essential as
we continue to receive very disturbing news of the killings and
massacres of innocent people by some of those who are believed to
have been involved in the planning and execution of the genocide
in Rwanda," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU chief, the investigation will address,
among other things, issues such as the root cause of the genocide
in Rwanda, the circumstances in which the genocide took place and
its consequences in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The roles of states and non-state actors before, during and
after the genocide will also be included in the investigation to
be carried out by the panel, scheduled for inauguration this
September.
</P>
<P>
A special trust fund was also established to support the work
of the panel and ensure its independence, while the establishment
of a panel support group made up of experts and advisors from a
multi-disciplinary background and with the requisite knowledge and
experience of the region is underway.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Zimbabwe Clear Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi Thursday commissioned demining equipment worth more than
500,000 U.S. Dollars which was donated by the U.S. government for
clearing mines in areas around Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
A joint demining training exercise between the U.S. and
Zimbabwean engineering troops started in Victoria Falls in west
Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said landmine problems in Zimbabwe continued to claim
lives of innocent civilians 18 years after independence and
government efforts to undertake the clearing exercise had been
impaired by the meager financial resources.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Attache Majes Cobb said the U.S. government's
object was to assist Zimbabwe in establishing a fully functional
demining office.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing the resources and technology that will
facilitate the expansion of what has already been a very
successful command center of the Zimbabwe national army," Cobb
said.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Warns Against Israeli Barring Yassin's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the militant Islamic
resistance movement Hamas Thursday warned Israel not to bar its
founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin from returning to the Palestinian
self-rule area, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahamoud Azahar, Hamas leader in Gaza Strip, told reporters
that if Israel does not allow Yassin to return, there will be a
new wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would like to remind Israel how many soldiers
were kidnaped and killed by Hamas to gain Yassin's release from
jail.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Wednesday that
Yassin could be barred from returning to Gaza following his
regional tour and that the issue is now under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, also the spiritual leader of Hamas, was released from
Israeli jail last October after serving 10 years of a life
sentence for ordering the killing of Palestinians who collaborated
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since his release, Yassin has repeatedly called on Palestinians
to intensify their fight against Israel. He currently is visiting
Arab and Islamic states and raising funds for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Palestinian court in Gaza has
order the release of Abdel Aziz Rantisi, Hamas spokesman in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi was arrested two months ago after he blamed the
Palestinian National Authority for involvement in the death of
Hamas chief bomb-maker Mohei Eddine Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Enjoys High Degree Autonomy: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of China's Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said here Thursday that
the HKSAR has been enjoying a high degree of autonomy and freedom
on issues unrelated to defense and foreign affairs after its
handover to China last July.
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted to tell you without any hesitation the political
transition has certainly gone very, very well," Anson Chan, Chief
Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR, said in a speech at the
Japan National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the region's sluggish economy to a "contagion
effect" from the Asian crisis, Chan said that the HKSAR will
continue to take measures to revitalize business, adding that
medium-and long-term prospects remain excellent because of solid
economic fundamentals and abundant foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also continues to benefit as the gateway of the
strong mainland economy, which "has remained immune so far" to the
Asian crisis, she said.
</P>
<P>
As for Japan, Chan urged Tokyo to revitalize its weak economy
and play a key role in helping Asian economies recover from their
year-long financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and other Asian nations are looking for signs of
Japan's economic recovery as the "key player and the largest
creditor," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who is in Tokyo to promote tourism, said the HKSAR would
take several measures including cheaper hotel costs to encourage
Japanese tourists to return there.
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourists, one of the major sources of Hong Kong's
economic growth, have declined sharply in number over the past
year following a big tour boom before Hong Kong's reversion last
year.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR lanuched a tourism promotion campaign in Tokyo this
week. The campaign, entitled "Hong Kong: New Era, New
Opportunities," includes a fashion show and a week-long festival
featuring Hong Kong products.

<HEADLINE> Kurils No Hinder to Russian Ties: Japanese Admiral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Japanese Chairman of
the Council of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Kazuya Natsukawa,
Thursday expressed confidence that the territorial dispute over
the Kuril Islands with Russia would not hinder the bilateral
partnership.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the Japanese admiral said Russia
and Japan could broaden military ties disregarding the issues of
disputed territories and the conclusion of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Natsukawa said the strategic importance of the Kuril Islands
depends on the situation in the region. "Therefore, we must forge
trust to rule out conflict situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Broader bilateral military contacts exerted a positive
influence not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but worldwide, the
Japanese officer said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, it was premature to speak of a Russian-Japanese
strategic partnership. He said the strategic partnership could
evolve as a result of efforts made by the Asian Pacific countries
to enhance regional security.
</P>
<P>
Natsukawa also denied a claim that Japan intends to buy Russian
Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets for its defense forces.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, two Japanese pilots who had been trained to
fly Su-27 fighters in Russia this spring praised the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Natsukawa arrived in Moscow on May 30 for an eight-day official
visit. He has met Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Chief
of General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin.

<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Thursday
travelled to the northern German town of Eschede to see himself
the site of the worst-ever German train crash which killed at
least 92 people so far.
</P>
<P>
Deeply depressed by the tragedy, Kohl pledged that the federal
government would make all efforts to help the victims.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who cut short a visit to Italy after knowing of the
accident, also warned against making premature judgements about
the cause of the train crash before thorough investigations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German rail authorities has put a temporary
speed limit of 160 kilometers an hour on all ICE high speed trains
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The ICE train involved in the crash on Wednesday was travelling
at about 200 kilometers an hour when it suddenly derailed and
slammed into a road bridge at Eschede.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers using five heavy cranes started to lift a final
huge chunk of the collapsed bridge from two train carriages still
buried under the debris. More victims are feared to be trapped in
the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The German Red Cross officials said that over 20,000 people had
followed an appeal and turned out to donate blood for those
injured during the crash. The latest official reports said that
there were 58 people still being treated in hospitals, 43 of them
with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The disaster also aroused shocks around the world with
condolence messages continuing to pour in on Thursday. Flags at
public buildings in Germany are flying at half mask to mourn the
victims.

<HEADLINE> Demirel Asks Chirac to Correct Legislature's Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
Thursday sent a letter to his French counterpart Jacques Chirac,
asking him to use his power to correct French legislature's draft
law on the alleged Armenian genocide.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan
at a weekly press conference here. Demirel in his letter said he
would express the views of the Turkish side concerning the bill
adopted by France's National Assembly on May 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, French lawmakers unanimously approved the bill
stating that "France publicly recognizes the Armenian genocide of
1915."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has denied that the deaths of some 1.5 million
Armenians in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923 constituted a
genocide, insisting that massacres occurred on both sides as the
result of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We know that there are sad events in the history of all
countries," Demirel told Chirac in his letter.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historical reality that both Turkish and Armenian
people died during the revolt and violence of the Armenian side
against the Ottoman Empire," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added this was because of "foreign provocations in 1915 and
consequently the efforts for trying to locate the Armenians in the
regions not engaged in the First World War."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the bill of the French National Assembly has the
attribute of provoking terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"This bill, which offended both Turkey and nearly 300,000
Turkish people living in France, won't be useful for anyone except
those who want to disturb the improving Turkish-French relations
and the establishment of peace and stability in the Caucasus.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Trade Ties Good for Both: U.S. Business Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade relations
between the United States and China are important and have already
generated great benefits for both countries, although there is
still room for improvement, says an American business leader.
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, Robert A. Kapp, president of
the U.S.-China Business Council, said he believed that business
and economic matters will certainly, and should be, on the agenda in
the forthcoming Beijing summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's China visit scheduled for late June, the first by a
U.S. president in nearly a decade, is a chance to continue the
process of building a stronger relationship between the United
States and China, Kapp said.
</P>
<P>
On many fronts, the process cannot be completed by the visit,
but, "we should benefit from the return visit by the president to
China following President Jiang's visit here last October," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We see this visit as an important block in the construction of
a larger structure which will continue to be built in the long
years after the president's visit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kapp said he assumed that the two presidents will have an
opportunity to discuss all of the essential ingredients of the
successful relationship between the two countries, of the points
the two sides agree on and the points they do not agree on.
</P>
<P>
Trade is a point on which the two sides agree and disagree,
said Kapp, who became council chairman in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Neither side would deny that the economic and trade relations
between the two countries are important and have already generated
great benefit for both countries," he said. "But also, neither
side would deny that the trade relations today are not all they
should be," he said. "There is room for improvement in economic
and trade relations between our two countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
Kapp said the two sides have had extensive discussions about
the possibility of concluding individual commercial transactions
either before or during the visit, some of which would involve
opportunities for American companies to create sizable sales with
China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope these transactions might be concluded," said Kapp,
whose council represent more than 300 American businesses. But, he
said, the signals are still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the WTO, Kapp said he believed that
intensive negotiations have taken place on many aspects to the WTO
question in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"But so far we don't see clear evidence of enough agreement on
enough questions between the two sides as to be able to be sure
that the summit will have a meaningful statement on this subject."
</P>
<P>
"We very much hope that there will be," he said, but there had
not been enough progress to justify that statement.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status,
Kapp said regrettably neither American friends nor China should
take MFN for granted.
</P>
<P>
He said he had anticipated that there would be some bombshell,
some explosion of controversy over the U.S.-China relations in the
United States either before the president's visit, or before the
annual MFN decision, or both, and it's no secret that that
bombshell has now burst.
</P>
<P>
However, Kapp said he was "reasonably confident", China's MFN
status will be retained, but it will again be the subject of
heated controversy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to allegations involving satellite technology, Kapp
said many different questions and problems have been merged
together into a single controversy.
</P>
<P>
There is only a leaked story, he said. That matter needs to be
cleared up.

Kapp said he thought the discussions in the American congress
certainly has elements of American domestic politics which
certainly caused a heightened level of controversy surrounding the
president's trip to China.
</P>
<P>
"I find the whole thing regrettable and we, as the business
community, are very concerned about the casual acceptance of the
allegations as facts. But at the same time, it is impossible to
pretend that the controversy does not exist. And it would be
necessary to find as quickly as possible a clear fact on the most
difficult aspects of this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kapp said the he thought the two governments should be prepared
to take reciprocal and unilateral steps to meet the concern of the
other side.
</P>
<P>
It is not always necessary to have a big fight to have one side
lose and the other side win, he said. "In fact that would never
happen." But there is room for each side to take decisions on
their own sovereignty without being told to do so by the other
side. That will make a real contribution to a better relationship.
</P>
<P>
The two governments are now in good if rather formal contact
with each other, Kapp said. In addition, one hopes that in spite
of all the political controversies, each government will be able
to take unilateral measures in response perhaps to the unilateral
measures taken by the other side to remove some of the inherent
and difficult issues on the table. "That is my greatest hope," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kapp expressed the hope that the visit of President Clinton to
China will be an opportunity for many Americans, through
television, to get to know more about China.
</P>
<P>
Describing China as an "immense and complex reality", Kapp said
he hoped President Clinton's visit will serve as an occasion for
many Americans to become a little bit more broadly informed about
life today in China.

<HEADLINE> IPE Proposes Complete Overhaul Of Electricity Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) Thursday proposed to the UK Government a thorough
restructuring of the electricity market in order to ensure that
consumers pay a fair price for their supplies.
</P>
<P>
The IPE urged the government to allow fuel sources to compete
on an equitable basis by reforming electricity trading
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that it also asked to abolish the moratorium on the
construction of gas fired generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep market stable, the IPE said that the
government should take measures to avoid distorting the market
through artificial support as is being discussed for coal.
</P>
<P>
The IPE also asked the government to consider divesting the
major generators of some of their capacity in order to allow
effective competition to develop.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, Chief Executive of the IPE said, "With the
current OFFER review of trading arrangements, the UK has a unique
opportunity to introduce a truly competitive market in the
generation and supply of electricity."
</P>
<P>
"This could provide a lead to the rest of Europe. This
opportunity must not be wasted and we recommend radical action to
ensure that the needs and rights of consumers are satisfied," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The IPE is Europe's leading energy futures and options
exchange, trading Brent Crude, Gas Oil and Natural Gas products
worth between 1 and 2 billion U.S. dollars every day.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia-Eritrea Crisis Causes Concern at OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The escalating crisis between
Ethiopia and Eritrea has caused much concern and become one of
the important issues at the current 68th ordinary session of the
Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
opened here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim described this
unfortunate development as a severe setback to the effort for
peace, security and stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Since the eruption of the crisis, i have maintained close
contacts with both parties as well as with African leaders whom i
have encouraged to assist in defusing the tension prevailing
between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki earlier in Addis Ababa and
Asmara, he added, both leaders were conscious of the far-reaching
and devastating consequences of war and expressed their readiness
to explore all avenues to avoid the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The crisis situation has been deteriorating in the last few
days with reports of border skirmishes involving loss of life and
the situation is extremely grave, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General warned that a military confrontation
could only bring about suffering and destruction to both
countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
"It is a conflict which no one can win. There can only be
losers. And the losers will not only be Ethiopia and Eritrea or
for that matter the Horn of Africa Region but the continent as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general therefore urged to the leaders of both
countries to exercise maximum restraint, to put an end to the
fighting and explore ways for an early and peaceful solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea demands
greater determination among OAU member states to act in concert
and requires increased resources to enable the organization to
fulfil its responsibilities, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday recommended the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia for six months.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council of the United Nations,
the Secretary-General proposed that the mandate of the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), which expires at
the end of August this year, be extended until February 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief noted that UNPREDEP' presence had prevented the
spillover of conflicts elsewhere in the region to the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. He added that the Force's presence
continues to have a stabilizing effect and to contribute
significantly to generating dialogue among the various political
forces and ethnic communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the deterioration of the situation
in Kosovo has had a negative impact on the fulfillment of the
mandate of UNPREDEP, which is already stretched to the limit along
the borders with Albania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said he intends to submit proposals to the
Security Council by July 15 for the possible strengthening of
UNPREDEP'a overall capacity.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Libya Thursday examined the
current level of their trade exchange and explored ways of
enhancing future cooperation, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaily, after
meeting with Libyan Secretary of Economy and Trade Abdel-Hafez
el-Ziletny here, described Egyptian-Libyan relations as close, but
said that the economic relationship did not measure up to the
political one.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have already signed 11 pacts covering different
domains, including economic integration, investment promotion and
the prevention of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Libyan trade exchange stood at 145 million
U.S. dollars in 1997, including 70 million dollars of Egyptian
exports to Libya. Gowaily described the volume of two-way trade as
"quite a limited sum considering the capabilities of their
markets."
</P>
<P>
Up to 90 percent of Libya's exports to Egypt are made up of
various types of iron products in addition to petrochemicals,
while Egypt's exports are limited to agricultural and food
products, textiles, medicines and leather products, he said.
</P>
<P>
To infuse more vigor into bilateral relations, Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi had planned to start a visit to Egypt last
Tuesday, but the trip has been postponed indefinitely without
explanation.

NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Minister of Agriculture,
Natural Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous Thursday
stressed the need for protecting Cyprus' seas and the ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the International Environment Day Friday,
Themistocleous said this year's theme - protection of the ocean -
is especially important for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We must concentrate our efforts on keeping our seas pure and
clean and as a consequence safeguard the functioning of the
coastal and marine ecosystems," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that protecting the environment depends on
balanced and correct development, noting that this factor has a
special importance to Cyprus, where the division of the island has
increased environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974, when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities, after a coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

another will maintain the same pension rights as if they had
switched employers in the original country.
</P>
<P>
"When workers move from one member state to another they are
now going to have their rights preserved in so far as their
contributions to supplementary pensions are concerned," European
Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said after the ministers
council meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that complementary pensions are becoming
more important to workers. "They (complementary pensions) are
used much more than in the past in protecting standards of living
for workers," said Flynn.
</P>
<P>
Between 80 and 90 percent of workers employed in the private
sector are members of supplementary pension schemes in the
Netherlands, Denmark and France.
</P>
<P>
Right now, however, people who move from one job to another
across the European Union can expect losing some or even all of
their supplementary pension rights.

<TEXT>
<P>

(P5) began their meeting here Thursday evening on the situation in
South Asia following the recent nuclear testing by India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will try "to arrest the nuclear arms race in
South Asia and restore the peace and stability in this region,"
said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in his opening remarks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> OAU Hails Reduction of Members' Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Thursday
described the financial situation of the 53-member body as
"positive and encouraging".
</P>
<P>
"The financial situation of the organization has continued to
improve since the Harare sessions" last year, Salim told the 68th
ordinary session of the OAU council of ministers being held here
in the capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The continued determined efforts of member states aimed at
honoring their financial obligations to OAU, particularly at
clearing their arrears, have led to the reduction by almost half
of arrears over the last years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who sees the development as a major progress to feed
the pan-African organization, did not give concrete figures to
show the arrears of some member states.
</P>
<P>
A financial report circulated here earlier said OAU is now
owed more than 48 million U.S. Dollars in contribution arrears,
which represents about 150 percent of the continental
organization's current budget of some 31.2 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said 20 of the 53 member states were up to date in
their contributions by May 21 this year, while six countries have
lost their right to speak at the 34th OAU summit opening next
Monday due to accumulated contribution arrears.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the organization, ministers and presidents
of countries that default in payments for three to 12 years are
barred from speaking during OAU meetings and prohibited from
presenting candidates for OAU posts.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the leaders of delegations from defaulting
countries will be requested to speak on issues directly
connected with their respective states, according to sources
here.
</P>
<P>
Another four countries will also be sanctioned unless they pay
all or part of their arrears before the end of the coming summit.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hopes Improved Turkish-EU Ties Helpful for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to Cyprus
David Madden said here Thursday that the improved relations
between the European Union (EU) and Turkey would assist efforts
for a political settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides, Madden said the forthcoming EU summit, due to be held
in Britain's Welsh capital Cardiff in mid-June, would offer an
opportunity to the 15 European leaders to discuss EU's
relationship with Turkey and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "if the relationship between the EU
and Turkey is put on a marginally better footing, that should be
helpful for our efforts in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Madden refrained from outlining the expectations for the
Cardiff summit with regard to Turkey, but he noted that the
period after the summit would be a "very good occasion to see
what the possibilities are on Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to think about Cyprus in any case whatever
the outcome of Cardiff is, whatever the Turkish reaction is,
because speaking of Cyprus, the goal remains to work toward a
political settlement," the British diplomat pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU would continue its peace efforts on
Cyprus and would not give up.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the talks with
Cypriot President Clerides in protest against the EU decision to
start accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he would not return to the negotiating
table unless his entity in northern Cyprus controlled by the
Turkish Cypriots is recognized and the Cypriot government
suspends the talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' purchase of the Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles, Madden dismissed suggestions that Britain
opposes the deployment of such missiles because the powerful radar
system accompanying them would be able to track down aircrafts
flying in and out of the two British bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power, has retained the two
military bases under its sovereign control since it granted Cyprus
independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, ordered by the Cypriot government from Russia in
January 1997, are expected to be delivered in mid-August this
year. The deal was opposed by countries including the United
States and Britain, while Turkey has threatened to strike the
missiles if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the aftermath of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges World Community to Protect Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat Thursday urged the international
community to protect the accords signed by the Palestinians and
Israel in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements that were signed in the U.S. White House under
the auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton and the international
community are not bilateral documents but international ones,"
Arafat said before leaving Sanaa after a short visit to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"I, therefore, call on the international community to protect
and preserve the agreements through bringing pressures on Israel
to force it to implement them sincerely and accurately," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this way we can make sure that the outcome of the Madrid
Peace Conference and the land-for-peace principle are substantial
and concrete things rather than verbal maxims," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here in the day for the visit, which is part of
his efforts to rally support from Arab countries for the convening
of an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Arafat met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh on the peace process and issues related to the proposed Arab
summit.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that Yemen supports the holding of an expanded Arab
summit in a bid to yield positive results that can consolidate
Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
The summit that Arafat has called for is intended to unify Arab
stances on the stalled Middle East peace process and the
challenges the Arab nation faces.
</P>
<P>
Saleh reiterated Yemen's backing for Palestinian people's
struggle to restore their legitimate rights and establish an
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed issues related to the deadlock of the
peace process due to the intransigence and extremism of the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis came to a
halt in March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing
unit in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.

Frankfurt, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and 13 foreign banks
have reached a debt rescheduling agreement involving dozens of
billions of U.S. dollars in credit owed by the country's banking
sector and private companies, negotiators said in Frankfurt
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed Thursday after four days of
negotiations at the Frankfurt headquarters of Germany's largest

offered an extension of up to four years in the repayment of 9.2
billion U.S. dollars of short-term debts due by the end of March,
1999.

The deal also foresees the creation of a rescheduling agency to
help Indonesia's private companies to get a grip on their foreign
debts which are estimated at about 60 billion dollars, said the
Deutsche Bank, which coordinated the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
These companies would be offered an eight-year extension in the
repayment of their liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the foreign banks also offered to help Indonesia in
financing its foreign trade. The repayment of Jarkata's trade
credit of between four to six billion dollars would be extended by
one year.

<HEADLINE> P5 Foreign Ministers Determined to Resolve Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the Security Council (P5) vowed to pursue
efforts to resolve disputes between India and Pakistan including
Kashmir in a joint communique issued at the end of their one-day
meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom and the United States held closed-door talks to coordinate
their response to the grave situation created by the nuclear tests
carried out last month by India and then by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers pledged that they will actively encourage India
and Pakistan to find mutually acceptable solutions, through direct
dialogue, that address the root causes of the tension, including
Kashmir, and to try to build confidence rather than seek
confrontation," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
They also urged both parties to avoid threatening military
movements, cross-border violations, or other provocative acts.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers affirm their readiness to assist India and
Pakistan, in a manner acceptable to both sides, in promoting
reconciliation and cooperation," it said.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the P5 could take actions
"individually or collectively" to foster peace and security in
South Asia. The possible actions include:
</P>
<P>
- To encourage India and Pakistan to adopt practical measures
to prevent an arms race;
</P>
<P>
- To prevent the export of equipment, materials or technology
that could in any way assist programs in India or Pakistan for
nuclear weapons or for ballistic missiles capable of delivering
such weapons;
</P>
<P>
- To do all they could to facilitate a reduction of tensions
between those states, and to provide assistance, at the request of
both parties, in the development and implementation of confidence-
and security-building measures.
</P>
<P>
The ministers pledged to work actively to build broad support
in the international community for the objectives they agreed
Thursday at the Geneva meeting, which are to strengthen peace and
stability in South Asia, to encourage restraint by India and
Pakistan, to promote the resolution of outstanding differences,
and to bolster the international non-proliferation regime.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls For Wider Efforts to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday called for greater
involvement of the international community in saving the faltering
Mideast peace process as the prospect for an Arab summit seemed
diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, political advisor to President Hosni Mubarak,
issued the appeal after meeting here with Arab league Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
"We want a European involvement and we want an expansion of the
circle of international support to the Arab position," he
said. "We are interested in the European Union, Russia, China and
countries that actively participated in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official said Arab countries do not intend to
oppose coordination with Washington in pushing forward the peace
process, which has been stalled for over one year due to Israel's
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly asked for a delay in holding the summit
in order to allow it more time to convince Israel to buy its
proposal on a 13.1 percent troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Baz said the Arab leaders would meet after the fate of the
American initiative is determined to "define what to ask from the
United States."
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, there have been intensive consultations on
whether and how an Arab summit should be held to work out a common
strategy to confront Israel's intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been traveling around the
region lobbying for support. However, differences over how to deal
with Israel prevented Arab countries from reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Syria, for example, wants a hardline Arab stance while Egypt
and Jordan, who signed peace with Israel, embrace more moderate
tones.
</P>
<P>
But Baz said the differences did not preclude a common Arab
stand. Cairo, Syrian capital Damascus and Saudi capital Riyadh
have been named as possible venues for the proposed summit.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rejects Starr's Request for Urgent Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday
turned down Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's emergency
request to settle two of the legal disputes with President Bill
Clinton that have delayed his investigation of an alleged affair
and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
The nine justices chose to allow the U.S. Court of Appeals to
make the first effort at resolving whether Clinton confidant Bruce
Lindsey and three Secret Service employees must answer Starr's
questions before a federal grand jury in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment is
denied without prejudice. It is assumed the Court of Appeals will
proceed expeditiously to decide this case," the high-court said in
a two-paragraph order.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a major setback in the independent counsel's
efforts to speed up an investigation delayed by numerous legal
challenges. The appeals court may hear arguments in both cases
next month. But any rulings could then be appealed to the Supreme
Court, making a final decision unlikely until next fall or Winter.
</P>
<P>
The White House had opposed the urgent appeal, saying the
issues were novel and an appeals court should be allowed to review
them first.
</P>
<P>
The high court has agreed only five times this century to
bypass the normal appeals process, including once a quarter
century ago in the Watergate investigation of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, the president's closest adviser and a deputy White
House counsel, has refused to answer prosecutors' questions before
a grand jury in 14 areas of the Lewinsky investigation, citing
attorney-client privilege. Lindsey says, however, he knows of no
wrongdoing inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
Citing an earlier appeals court ruling, Starr has argued that
government lawyers like Lindsey are not entitled to claim
attorney-client privilege when subpoenaed by a federal grand jury
to testify about criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
A judge sided with Starr and ordered Lindsey to testify,
prompting the appeal. The White House originally made an
additional claim of executive privilege is trying to block
Lindsey's testimony but earlier this week dropped that claim as
the matter moved to the high court.
</P>
<P>
The administration also has refused to allow two Secret Service
uniform officers and one agency lawyer to testify before the grand
jury investigating whether the president and Ms. Lewinsky had an
affair and tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating whether Clinton and Lewinsky lied under
oath when they denied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
that they had sexual relations. Prosecutors also want to know
whether Clinton and presidential friend Vernon Jordan encouraged
Lewinsky to lie by finding her a job and a lawyer, and whether
other presidential aides tried to obstruct the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan Peace Process Again in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yin Yongjian)
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The long lasting Angolan peace
process is now once again in crisis with no progress made in the
past two months due to the obstruction of the opposition National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to the new agenda passed by the the government and
UNITA on March 6, the peace process is due to conclude at the end
of March. However, since efforts were thwarted in establishing
national authority in the four "sensitive" regions of Bailundo,
Andulo, where the UNITA headquarters are located, and Nharea and
Mungo, the peace process is stopped.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, U.N. special envoy to Angola and a major
mediator in the peace process, then initiated a program to rid of
the crisis, stipulating that the Angolan government cease its
anti-UNITA propaganda, that it should not issue any news
concerning UNITA's army mobilization and sabotage without the
confirmation of the United Nations observers mission.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it ruled that UNITA must hand over the
above-mentioned four regions by May 31. However, UNITA violated
the rule with the excuse of insecurity and postpone the deadline
to the end of June, which met with strong opposition from the
Angolan government and observer countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite UNITA's announcement in early March that it had
demilitarized completely, evidence shows it still keeps army
units which were responsible for many armed attacks around the
country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the organization "doctors without frontiers" were
attacked in central Angola. In the 273 UNITA-occupied regions
where local authority was resumed, at least 40 have been snatched
back by the UNITA, including five cities.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, Angolan government spokesman in the joint
committee of the peace process, said Wednesday that if the UNITA
continues to obstruct the development of the peace process, the
government will take up measures which include the closure of
UNITA headquarters in Luanda, and decide whether UNITA MPs will
remain in the national assembly or whether its officials will
remain in the national unity and reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that his government might suspend the
joint committee of peace process unilaterally on the pretext that
UNITA failed to implement the Lusaka peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the current stalemate is mainly a
result of lack of mutual trust, especially on the part of UNITA.
Under the peace accord, UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi must come to
the capital Luanda, but he refused to do so citing no guarantee
of personal safety. He is now living either in Bailundo or
Andulo, the handover of which will render him "homeless."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will discuss the peace process in
Angola Friday. Beye has already left for New York to attend the
meeting. Analysts here believe that the Security Council meeting
might come up with a resolution to impose a third batch of
sanctions on the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
Although the peace process has been stalled, observers noted
that the difficulty is only temporary, for neither side wishes to
open fire once again. With the mediation of and pressure from
the international community, peace will become reality in the
end.

<HEADLINE> African Women to Play Role in Conflict Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The role of African women in
conflict prevention and resolution was underlined at the current
68th ordinary session of the council of ministers of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, the
African Women's Committee on Peace and Development will serve as
an advisory body on issues relating to gender and the involvement
of women in the mainstream of the continent's efforts aimed at
preventing, managing and resolving conflicts and their active
participation in decision making for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The committee was established at the 40th anniversary of the
U.N. Economic Commission of Africa (UNECA) in pursuance to a
decision of the OAU council of ministers earlier this year as
part of the effort to strengthen OAU's capacity to deal with
conflict situations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
African women can and should make contribution to the
promotion of peace and development, the OAU chief said at the
council session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Salim expressed regret at the rather modest contribution by
member states so far to the OAU peace fund for sustaining the
activities of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution and urged the council of ministers to
extend support and encouragement to the on-going process aimed at
enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of the OAU mechanism.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, African women have shown strong will and
enthusiasm for peace and development in the continent. As early
as in May, 1996, the African first ladies had expressed their
support to the cause of their husbands for peace and development
at the African First Ladies' summit in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Needs Further Cut Air Power in Gulf: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force general
Thursday called for additional reduction of air power in the Gulf
to a level at which the the U.S. forces were deployed in the
region before last November.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the size of that force reduced to a level
that we can sustain on an indefinite basis without undue stress
and strain on the force," Gen. Richard Hawley, chief of the Air
Combat Command, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently began cutting its military presence
in the Gulf to some 200 warplanes and one aircraft carrier, a
level reached last November before a major build-up in a face-off
with Baghdad over U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
But Hawley said operational stress was mounting in the
shrinking Air Force because of growing deployments to world
trouble spots, and he said deeper cuts could be made in the Gulf
for now. He advocated a reduction to pre-November Air Force
deployment level in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and elsewhere in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Air Force had proved its ability to get
aircraft to the Gulf from American bases within 48 hours if
necessary. So "we don't have to have our forces deployed on a
continuous basis in forward areas," he said.

<HEADLINE> Renewable Energy Helpful to Meet Greece's Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece will be able to cover 20
percent of its energy requirements if it uses renewable sources
such as water, aeolic and solar energy, the environmental
organization Greenpeace said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Stelios Psomas, head of
Greenpeace's Greek branch, said that adoption of the
organization's proposal for using renewable energy would help
lessen reliance on conventional fuel and reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace proposed that Greece should make institutional
and legislative changes to promote the exploitation of renewable
energy sources, to allocate public land for related investments,
to make incentives for consumers to use renewable energy, to set
an example by the public sector through its use of such sources in
public buildings and to brief consumers and productive classes on
forthcoming developments in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The organization stressed that Greece was in the advantageous
position of having enormous potential in all sources of renewable
energy.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the Tanzanian Ministry of
Health, will later this month start a 10-year program with
emphasis on reducing maternal death rate.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Denies Wrongdoings in Nazi Gold Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Deutsche Bank Thursday
denied charges that it had played a role in helping trade the
gold robbed from Holocaust victims during the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
The bank's remarks were made in reaction to a collective
lawsuit brought by Holocaust survivors in New York Wednesday which
reportedly claimed that the Deutsche Bank and another big German
bank -- Dresdner Bank -- had profited from personal assets like
gold teeth fillings, gold jewelry and coins seized by German
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Holocaust survivors also demanded 18 billion U.S. dollars
in compensations from the two biggest German banks.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank, however, said that an independent research
conducted by a British historian had showed that the gold received
by the Deutsche Bank from Nazi Germany's central bank had been
delivered in the form of bullions so that its origin was not
known.
</P>
<P>
Both the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank stressed Thursday that
they could not comment more specifically until they had seen the
lawsuit filed in New York.

<HEADLINE> One of Cyprus' Oldest Newspapers to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- One of Cyprus' oldest newspapers,
"Agon" (Struggle) will close down in fierce industrial competition
after 34 years of circulation.
</P>
<P>
"Agon" (Struggle), the Cyprus' only tabloid-style daily will
shut its door from next Monday, TV and radio stations reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Facing stiff competition from TV and radio as well as other
papers, the money-strapped newspaper was unable to pay the staff
for the past few months, said chief editor of the paper Panayiotis
Papademetris.
</P>
<P>
"Agon" was founded in 1964, four years after the island's
independence, by the current Justice Minister Nicos Koshis.
</P>
<P>
It was initially a magazine before it became a weekly
newspaper and a daily later.
</P>
<P>
Its circulation slumped from 4,500-5,500 a day to 2,500
following a rise in price last year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the Journalists Union of
Cyprus called for measures by the government and other interested
parties to protect publication of newspapers on the island.

<HEADLINE> Former US Pilot Traces Wartime Savior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Rex Barber, an 80-year old
former American pilot, has traced the Chinese boy who rescued him
when he was shot down near here in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Barber's fighter plane was shot down by a Japanese plane over
Dongting Lake in Central China's Hunan Province one day in
April 1944, and his life was saved by two Chinese boys.
</P>
<P>
For the past five decades Barber had always dreamed of finding
his Chinese saviors. Last April, he turned to Chinese news media
in the United States for help.
</P>
<P>
The old man, now living in Oregon State, told the newsmen that
when he parachuted from his stricken plane he broke both ankles
and both knees. Two Chinese teenagers helped him to hide from
pursuing Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
When the Hunan provincial government learned about the story, it
set up special groups in Yueyang, Yiyang and Changde cities to
search for the boys.
</P>
<P>
The local government of Yueyang County found that a 66-year-old
farmer named Rong Zhizhou was one of Barber's saviors.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Barber asked a friend named Dr. Ye to come
to China to see Rong.
</P>
<P>
Rong recollected how he and Shao Huangsheng, who has since
died, helped Barber to escape from the danger. These details were
confirmed by Barber.
</P>
<P>
Rong said that he and Shao were playing on the bank of Dongting
Lake near Rongjiawan Railway Station, when they saw an airplane
crash, and afterwards a huge "umbrella" with a foreign man falling
down.
</P>

Rong said that they guessed that the injured pilot must be a
foreigner helping the Chinese to fight the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
"We hid him in the reeds beside the lake side, and that way he
escaped being found by the Japanese soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rong and Shao then got some other people to carry the pilot to
a township office, where a doctor gave him treatment.
</P>
<P>
When Barber learned the details from Dr.Ye, he confirmed that
Rong and Shao were his saviors.
</P>
<P>
In a letter he wrote which arrived in Yueyang County yesterday,
Barber said that he and his family are looking forward to meeting
Rong in future and nothing can express his sincere gratitude to
the two Chinese boys.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Congratulates Anniversary of Russia-Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin on Friday
hailed the recent warming-up of Russia-Japan ties and said good
relations would benefit both peoples.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of congratulation to the Russia-Japan Society on
its 40th anniversary, Yeltsin praised the society for its
"significant contribution to the consolidation of various
contacts between citizens of the two countries, to the formation
of an interest in and respect for Japan and its people."
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent noticeable warming of the bilateral
relations and especially the positive results of his meeting
with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had made "a
beneficial impact on the society's activities," Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin told Interfax that Moscow would respond to
Japan's proposal on the Kuril Islands later.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to Hashimoto's suggestion that the
four islands be legally taken over by Tokyo but remain under
Russian control for some time, as reported by the Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
Russia has earlier announced that Yeltsin would respond "on
the essence of the proposal" during Hashimoto's official visit to
Moscow, scheduled for next fall, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> "Vegetable Basket Project" Provides Ample Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese urbanites are now having
ample supply of vegetables at reasonable price, as the national
"Vegetable Basket Project" is bearing fruits.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, the annual vegetable
output value of the country has amounted to 250 billion yuan
(30.12 billion US dollars), becoming the second money contributor
only after grain to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
At present, the China's per capita annual vegetable consumption
has reached 253 kg, more than double the figure of 119
kg 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable production structure has already shifted from the
traditionally "family garden type" into a mass production style.
</P>
<P>
Technology has helped increase the use of green house growing
and the variety hybridization. The operation of high technology
content has dramatically pushed up the income of vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Daily points out, the sector is still confronted
with problems and challenges such as the incongruity between the
comparatively small-scale production and the big market and the
problem of regional and seasonal oversupply.
</P>
<P>
"The vegetable market is basically a buyers' market;" the Daily
warns.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch said on
Friday that he will urge the next FIFA president to release all
best soccer players for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The head of the International Olympic Committee said that the
current under-23 format for Olympic soccer should be dropped to
open up the Olympics to all the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said he will discuss the matter with the winner of
next Monday's FIFA presidential election in Paris between Lennart
Johansson, head of the European federation UEFA, and FIFA
secretary general Sepp Blatter.
</P>
<P>
"This is something we have in our agenda to discuss with the
new president the possibility to increase the number of players
without the age limit," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, eager to guard the supremacy of its World Cup, has
restricted the Olympic soccer competition to players under the age
of 23, resulting in an influx of amateurs for the Olympic soccer
tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, the restriction was relaxed for the 1996 Atlanta Games
and the 2000 Sydney Games to allow teams to field three players
over 23.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe to Leave for OAU Summit Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
outgoing chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
will leave here Sunday for Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso,
to attend 34th OAU summit scheduled Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, set to emphasize the need to seek
African solutions to African problems, will center on the themes
of peace, security and stability as well as economic cooperation
and integration.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday it
was the contention of the OAU that Africa should lead and
increase its role in its security.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the OAU, while affirming that the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security rests with the United Nations, upholds that under
certain exceptional circumstances the organization could
undertake deployment for observation missions," the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, the OAU leaders were expected to look at
the heightened need for better transport, communications and
information technology sectors in view of the adoption of the
treaty establishing the African Economic Community, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who will hand over the OAU chairmanship to Blaise
Campaore, president of Burkina Faso, is expected to address the
summit mainly on issues of conflict management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge is already in
Ouagadougou where he is attending the council of ministers
meeting preparing an agenda for the OAU heads of state and
government assembly.

</P>
<P>
Mantilla, who took a gruelling first set when Moya dropped his
serve for the first time in the twelfth game, looked to be heading
for a surprise win when he went ahead 3-1 in the third. But he
lost his way as Moya surged back to win seven games in a row.
</P>
<P>
Moya thus extended his record to five wins in eight encounters
against Mantilla.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Scientists Embrace New CAS System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- "China should give top priority to
training young talented people, to bring their potential into full
play by letting them do pioneering research," said Guo Lingzhi, an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old structural geologist became a senior CAS
members today, along with 163 other academicians over 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing the senior member system into CAS is very
encouraging for young talented people, who should be the backbones
of CAS," said Guo, who now teaches Ph.D students at Nanjing
University.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent State Council decision, CAS and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) will adopt the senior
membership system as of July 1 this year. Under the system,
academicians of CAS and CAE will become senior members once they
turn 80 years old.
</P>
<P>
The senior members can participate in consultation activities
but should no longer stay in the leadership or take part in
nominating or electing new CAS and CAE members.
</P>
<P>
"I'm old and would rather devote my limited time and energy to
teaching," said Wang Zhizhuo, a specialist in remote
sensing technology and topography. "I'm proud that many of my
students have joined CAS."
</P>
<P>
At the advanced age of 89, Wang still reads in the library
every day. "My eyesight is failing, and I am no longer as
conversant with new software as my students are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most former academicians expressed their willingness to embrace
the senior membership system, which has been described by CAS
officials as "good for the health of old scientists."
</P>
<P>
Each of the senior members will get an annual stipend of 10,000
yuan (about 1,200 US dollars), while they still receive their full
salaries.

<HEADLINE> WTO Backs EU Computer Networking Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization's
(WTO) appeals tribunal overturned on Friday an original WTO
verdict against the European Union (EU) involving its row with the
United States over computer equipment classification.
</P>
<P>
The new verdict holds that the EU was in compliance with its
obligations under world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The case, filed by the United States, involved 425 million ecus
(381 million U.S. dollars) worth of U.S. local area network (LAN)
equipment exports to EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Disputes about the case arose in 1996 when the United States
filed a WTO complaint against the EU, alleging that Brussels had
violated WTO commitments by reclassifying LAN equipment into a
higher tariff category.
</P>
<P>
The United States holds that the LAN equipment should be in the
Automatic Data Processor (ADP) category, with a lower tariff duty.
</P>
<P>
The American side claimed that Britain and Ireland, two EU
members, had previously placed LAN equipment in a lower tariff
category, but in 1995 the equipment was placed in the higher
category throughout the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
Ireland and Britain raised tariffs on LAN networking equipment
from 4.9 percent to 7.5 percent after the EU adopted a regulation
in 1995 classifying the networking equipment as telecommunications
equipment, which carries a higher tariff duty.
</P>
<P>
The EU appealed to the WTO after the organization brought down
a verdict in favor of the U.S. complaint against Brussels, in
February.
</P>
<P>
The EU has said that LAN equipment should be classed as telecom
apparatus rather than as ADPs because its main function is to
transmit and communicate data.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government itself had also classified LAN products as
telecom apparatus at the time of the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations which ended formally in 1994, said the EU.
</P>
<P>
Under the global Information Technology Agreement, however,
tariffs on LAN equipment will be abolished by the year
2000.

The Yangtze, which runs through Hubei and another 10 provinces
and municipalities, is China's longest river, more than 6,300 km
long. It has one trillion cu m of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River valley, which has a population of more than
400 million, is one of the most economically developed areas in
China. But as economic activities increase, the river has been
threatened by worsening pollution.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that 15 billion tons of liquid sewage
is discharged in the river each year, about half of the national
total. Vessels on the river produce an average of more than 300
million tons of liquid waste each year.
</P>
<P>
Though the overall water quality is good, 22.4 percent of the
Yangtze river water has been polluted, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the worsening pollution, the Chinese government has
invested a large amount of funds in afforestation and water
conservancy projects.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of German Train Crash Rises to 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 96 people were killed in
Germany's worst railroad crash which occurred Wednesday morning
near the northern German town of Eschede, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two more bodies were found among the last wreckage of the
crashed train removed by rescue workers from debris early Friday
morning. Another body has also been recovered later this morning,
bringing the death total to 96.
</P>
<P>
The InterCity Express (ICE), Germany's fastest train, derailed
at 11:10 Wednesday morning and slammed into a road bridge near
Eschede, bringing hundreds of tons of concrete to crash down onto
the middle section of the train.
</P>
<P>
With two days passed, a broken wheel is now being treated as
the most likely cause for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Bonn on Friday, a Transport
Ministry spokesman, Veit Steinle, confirmed that investigators had
found a damaged wheel ring on the first carriage of train. The
ring is said to be the essential part to hold the wheel onto the
rail track.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be ruled out that the broken wheel has played a role
in the derailment," Steinle said.
</P>
<P>
Wheel parts that had been found Thursday about six kilometers
from the crash site indicated that a wheel might have broken
there, leading to the derailment afterwards, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also stressed that all other possible causes were
being investigated at the moment.
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, the German rail authorities Thursday pulled 60
ICE trains out of service to undergo mechanical checks. With no
technical defect found, 10 of them already went back into service
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany has now 104 ICE trains in operation. Those withdrawn
were the first-generation expresses in service since 1991. The
crashed train also belongs to this rank.

<HEADLINE> FILMART '98 Expected to Help Open New Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Participants of the coming Hong
Kong International Film Market (FILMART '98) are keen to open new
markets for their productions, especially in China's mainland,
Alan Wong, director of services of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the TDC, FILMART '98 set for June 24-26 this year
has attracted more than 50 international film and TV firms. Open
to trade visitors only, the event will offer a wide range of new
products from movies and TV programs to VCD/DVD production
technology.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's film industry is experiencing a difficult time,
especially after the Asian financial crisis. FILMART will serve as
a paramount platform for industry players to exchange information,
helping them catch up with the latest market situation in Asia and
to look for new business opportunities," Wong said at a press
preview here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Asian economic turmoil, we are still optimistic
about the market potential for film and TV production within the
region. The boom in Asian cable and satellite channels over the
last few years has created many opportunities for producers and
buyers to explore," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural event last year proved to be very successful,
Wong said. Both exhibitors and buyers agreed that it strengthened
Hong Kong's lead as an international distribution hub and a right
place to do film and TV business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The event's target has been expanded this year to include TV
and video buyers, particularly those from China's mainland. More
than 120 buyers from the mainland would participate in the
three-day event.
</P>
<P>
As the TV sector of China's mainland is expanding rapidly,
which provides a market with immense potential, FILMART '98 could
introduce new products to buyers from there, said Woody Tsung,
chief executive of the Hong Kong, Kowloon &AMP; New Territories Motion
Picture Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic slowdown is a reality to face, admitted
Raymond Wong, chairman of the Movie Producers and Distributors
Association of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"A decline in attendance for local films, coupled with the
Asian economic downturn, has prompted our producers to rethink our
strategies," he said. The only way out would be to find new
markets for their products and to produce a wider variety of films
to meet varied tastes of the audience, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A series of seminars will be held during FILMART '98 and video
screening booths will be introduced to enable buyers to view a
variety of titles with minimal distraction, according to the
organizers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Issues Regulations on Mini-Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will standardize the
management of mini-bus companies and their service with a specific
regulations that will go into effect on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The third meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eleventh
Municipal People's Congress today approved new administrative
regulations on the city's mini-buses.
</P>
<P>
Mini-buses, with eight to 19 passenger seats, often have
regular routes. They can be hailed anywhere on their routes.
</P>
<P>
These buses are considered a useful supplement to large
commuter buses and taxis, said Fu Bonan, chief of the Municipal
Administrative Commission.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had only 25 mini-buses in 1984. By 1997, however, the
city had about 4,100, employing 9,000 people. The municipal
government made 16 million yuan (about 1.93 million U.S. dollars)
in taxes collected from them in that year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, mini-buses transported more than 190 million
passengers on their 340 regular routes, the transportation
capacity accounting for 4.4 percent of the total passenger
transportation capacity of the city.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about mini-buses include lack of hygiene, dangerous
driving and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
The new 31-article regulations cover all these points of
contention.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Evacuate Forsaken Women From W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to
evacuate scores of its female nationals stranded in west Africa
after being abandoned by their husbands.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita
Thursday in Mali on his way to Burkina Faso for the annual summit
of the Organization for African Unity (OAU), the Times of Zambia
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moved by the plight of Zambian women who once married to west
African dealers in emeralds and other precious stones, Walubita
said the Zambian government has already started a program of
locating Zambians living abroad, especially those stranded in
west Africa, so that meaningful assistance can be given to them
in times of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that Zambians living in foreign
countries have been asked to register at nearest Zambian
embassies or high commissions.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry has already established a unit directly
responsible for this task, adding that it was high time the
Zambians abroad started benefiting from the goodwill of their
government.
</P>
<P>
A number of Zambian women are currently stranded in Senegal,
Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. They were lured to these
countries by the fantastic amounts of money which their husbands
were realizing from sales of precious stones, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The official number of the Zambian women living in Mali is
estimated at 30, although the actual figure could be higher. All
the women are married to the Malians.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Upgrade Health Centers Countrywide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to
upgrade about 400 health centers throughout the country,
especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Ben Chirwa, spokesman of Zambia's Central Board of Health,
disclosed Thursday that the board would improve the conditions of
service for all its health workers, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will give them better salaries, introduce rural
allowances, cater for housing and many more to encourage the
health workers operate in any area of Zambia," said Chirwa.
</P>
<P>
He noted that unlike in urban areas where medical personnel
will have to cater for their own transport and accommodation, the
rural staff will be given these facilities as incentives.
</P>
<P>
Chirwa added that staff will be sent to different rural health
centers immediately after a report to ascertain the needs of
personnel in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the rural areas are also critical
in the country's health system and therefore all the issues
concerned should be tackled seriously.
</P>
<P>
About 55 percent Zambians live in the rural areas where most
of the people are suffering from insufficient health care and
health personnel prefer to work in cities rather than in the poor
countryside.

"The government has no such plans," said a Foreign Office

<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tribunal of Grand Instance of
Paris Friday declared unacceptable a request by 30 deputies of the
European Parliament who disputed the way of distribution of
tickets of World Cup matches by France.
</P>
<P>
These deputies said that 2.5 million tickets distributed by the
French Committee of Organization of World Cup (CFO), the
International Federation of Football (FIFA) and the French
Federation of Football (FFF) are discriminatory because most of
them are reserved for French fans.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, who are from Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands,
Germany, Greece, Austria, Italy and Denmark, said that the
remaining 712,484 tickets be distributed to anyone who wishes to
watch the matches whatever his nationality.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the CFO, FIFA and FFF be condemned and
forced to pay 100,000 francs (16,666 U.S. dollars) for damage of
interests.
</P>
<P>
The court said that their request is not justified because they
themselves have not applied for the tickets, and therefore they
cannot take legal action in the interests of others or the general
public.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Concrete Steps to Curb Securities Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China's two stock exchanges -- in
Shanghai and Shenzhen -- publicized the revisions to their
respective securities trading rules today, with the aim of
checking reckless speculation more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The revised provisions clearly define the abnormal fluctuations
of stock prices based on their fluctuation range and turnover,
making it easier for the stock exchanges to make judgments and
suspend the trading of stocks showing abnormal performances.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said that the new provisions will be conducive
to curbing over-speculation on the stock market and protecting the
interests of individual investors through increasing the
transparency of the market.
</P>
<P>
China's securities market now boasts more than 800 listed
companies with a total capitalization of 2.08 trillion yuan at the
end of April.
</P>
<P>
But the volatility of some stock prices as a result of
excessive speculation remains a serious problem. Some
institutional and big investors manipulate the prices of some
stocks, which poses a serious threat to the standardization and
stability of the market.
</P>
<P>
The revised trading regulations should prevent such practices
by increasing the information transparency of stock market.
</P>
<P>
"Transparency, fairness and justice are the soul of the
securities market," said an official with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, adding that the revised regulations will
better help the market supervisors with their clearer definitions
and measurements of "abnormal fluctuations" of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities give top priority to the
standardization of the securities market. As an indication, they
are working hard on the long-awaited Securities Law to better
manage the still-immature stock market.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Import Maize This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe needs to import at least
600,000 tons of maize to cover a deficit of 300,000 tons and a
similar quantity to replenish the strategic grain reserve (SGR).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe this year produced only 1.5 million tons of maize,
well below the national consumption requirements of 1.8 million
tons, the Herald daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Martin
Muchero was quoted as saying that Zimbabwe would in real terms
have to import a total of 600,000 tons of maize, including the
300,000 tons needed to boost the SGR.
</P>
<P>
"We have made recommendations to the government to import in
the wake of a shortage we have on the market and we are still
waiting for it to come back to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The call by the GMB to import maize directly contradicts
statements made by Minister of Lands and Agriculture Kumbirai
Kangai in February this year that Zimbabwe would not import any
maize this year because the SGR had sufficient maize in stock.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Foundations May Shift Assets to State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three foundations
chaired by former President Soeharto will consider transferring
their assets to the state at the government's request, one of the
foundations' leaders said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If the government requests them (assets), we will consider the
request," Dharmais charity foundation deputy chief Sudharmono told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The foundations -- Supersemar, Dharmais and Dakab -- were set
up by Soeharto in 1974 to provide scholarships to students from
the lower-income group and help orphanages and cataract sufferers.
They now have assets totaling 2.4 trillion rupiah (about 240
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Each of the foundations has huge funds. But they are
meaningless to the government. Should the government confiscate
them? I don't think so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudharmono said he met with Soeharto on May 29 to discuss
issues concerning the three foundations following Soeharto's
resignation on May 21.
</P>
<P>
In response to calls for investigation in possible fraud,
corruption and collusion in the management of these foundations,
he said the foundations are open to foreign auditors.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to think about the high cost of inviting foreign
auditors," he said, adding that these foundations are audited by
local auditors every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit ended his China visit and left this east China
metropolis today.
</P>
<P>
During Ecevit's stay in the city, Chen Liangyu, executive
vice-mayor of Shanghai, held discussions with the Turkish guests
on behalf of Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the guests that the lingering Asian financial crisis
has had an adverse impact on Shanghai's exports and tourism. The
municipality, however, has made efforts to tackle the problem by
such measures as increasing investment in infrastructure and
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that he was impressed by the construction scale of
Shanghai and planned to encourage more Turkish investors to seek
cooperation with the city. He also said that he hoped the local
authorities would allow Turkish banks to set up branches in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit and his party were here as guests of the Chinese
government.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- New regulations on the protection
of ancient and rare trees were approved here today at a meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, scheduled to go into effect August 1, will
offer protection to 40,852 ancient and rare trees in the Chinese
capital.

<P>
Trees over 100 years old are regarded as ancient trees.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 6,213 trees more than 300 years old in
the city are unique to China.
</P>
<P>
As many of the ancient trees are found in places of
historic interest, like the Palace Museum, the Summer Palace and
the Temple of Heaven, they are also called living historical
relics.
</P>
<P>
The regulations ban seven kinds of damage to these trees,
including carving on their bark, driving nails into them, breaking
off their branches and cutting them down.
</P>
<P>
When an ancient tree dies, the fact must be reported to the
department in charge, the regulations stipulates. It also affirms
the previous measures taken by the Beijing municipal government to
protect ancient trees, such as establishing files and putting
explanatory labels on them.
</P>
<P>
Construction projects must avoid ancient trees, and if it is
necessary to transplant an ancient tree, permission must be
obtained beforehand from the municipal government, according to
the regulations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets Indian Refusal of Mediation Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday regretted that
India has rejected the offers of mediation from the U.N. secretary
general as well as Japan, Iran and Bangladesh to promote durable
peace and security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan supports the resumption of the bilateral talks with
India at the foreign secretary level on the basis of the agreement
reached in Islamabad last June," a Foreign Office spokesman said
in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"But it is evident now that the bilateral dialogue needs to be
implemented by a broader multilateral process to promote durable
peace and security in South Asia," the spokesman said. "It is
regrettable that India has rejected the offers of mediation from
the U.N. secretary general as well as Japan, Iran, Bangladesh and
others."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting of foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council held Thursday in
Geneva "reflects a recognition of the urgency for the world
community to address the security crisis in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
"We note with satisfaction that the meeting has adopted a
comprehensive approach to peace and security in South Asia and
addressed not only the non-proliferation issue but also the threat
to peace and security, including the need for a solution of the
core issue of Jammu and Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the initiative taken by the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to focus on the
tension and its root-cause in South Asia -- the core issue of
Jammu and Kashmir -- "should be seen as the beginning of a process
of active and continued involvement of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
"This process should be vigorously pursued until a just
settlement of the Kashmir issue is reached and culminated in a
Non-Aggression Pact between Pakistan and India," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Landslide Victory For Political Realignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The landslide victory by South Korean
ruling parties in Thursday's local elections is expected to
accelerate President Kim Dae-jung's drive for political
realignment aimed at controlling the National Assembly --
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition of the National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP) and the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) dealt a heavy blow
to the opposition Grand National Party (GNP) by winning 10 of 16
electoral districts in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections, which were held three months after President Kim
took office on February 25, were regarded as a reward for Kim. He
has been fighting against the worst economic crisis in the
country's history, and the GNP, the majority opposition in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which now has 149 seats of the 292-member parliament,
refused last March to approve President Kim's nomination of Kim
Jong-pil as prime minister of the country. Kim Jong-pil now serves
as acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Following the GNP's disapproval of Kim Jong-pil as cabinet
head, President Kim has repeatedly accused the GNP of failing to
cooperate with his government to overcome the continuing financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, the ruling camp sought a massive political
realignment aimed at taking over parliamentary control from the
GNP.
</P>
<P>
To date, it has successfully lured 11 GNP parliamentary members
to defect from the opposition. Three more defectors from the GNP
will break the opposition's control of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which lost last year's presidential elections due to
its then ruling government's economic mismanagement and an
infighting-induced split, continued exhibiting its political
shortcomings in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
"The GNP's failure in the local elections showed that South
Koreans are behind the Kim Dae-jung's government at the time when
the nation is in grave economic troubles," said an official of the
ruling camp after the local elections.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling coalition's sweeping victories in Seoul and its
surrounding Kyonggi and Inchon areas are seen especially as
continued support for Kim's efforts to overcome the crisis," said
a political analyst of Yonhap News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The population in Seoul, Kyonggi and Inchon accounts for nearly
one-third of the total population of the country.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the United States for a nine-day state visit
Friday, President Kim said he will speed up his reforms, including
reorganization of political parties, upon his return from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"To take the fate of our country into our own hands and carry
out economic reform effectively, I must say we have no choice but
to make active efforts for the reorganization of political
parties," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
With the triumph in the local elections, Kim will push ahead
with strong restructuring of politics and the economy to the
extent that satisfies South Koreans and the international
community, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Pilots Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Pilots of Philippine Airlines (PAL)
began a strike here Friday night over a dispute with the
management, causing the delay or cancellation of many flights.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines in a press release called the strike
illegal and in open defiance of two orders of the Department of
Labor and Employment which has already assumed jurisdiction over
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The airlines management apologized to the riding public for the
inconvenience caused by the untimely disruption of its operations.
It said it would strive to mount as many flights as possible.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for the current standoff is the case of Airbus
300 Captain Albino Collantes, whom the PAL management opted to
retire last year after he completed the minimum requirement of 20
years service with the company.
</P>
<P>
In two orders issued earlier, the Office of the Labor Secretary
warned the pilots against undertaking any action that would
exacerbate the situation.

<HEADLINE> 18 Killed During Fighting in Baidoa, Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were killed
and more than 25 others wounded as heavy fighting continues for
the third day Friday over the control of the important south
Somali town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The fighting pitted the Rahanwein Resistance Army militiamen
(RRA) against those of Hussein Mohamed Aidid's faction and most
of the deceased were killed inside the town.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, about 150 heavily armed militiamen
from the RRA forces launched a tactful attack on two fronts, one
on the town of Baidoa itself while the other wing, about 100 more
militiamen, had cut off the road between Mogadishu and Baidoa at
Manyafulka bridge, 7 km south of the town, to block any possible
reinforcement from Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The RRA attack had penetrated into the defense positions of
Aidid's men in the town of Baidoa Thursday night with
face-to-face clashes. Aidid's men merely maintained control of
the former presidential palace of the town while the RRA men
managed to take control of the rest of Baidoa. Militiamen from
both sides claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the
other.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the VHF radio reports Friday morning,
another fierce fighting broke out again in and outside the town.
Sources close to the militiamen of Hussein Aidid said the RRA men
were driven out of Baidoa toward their former militia bases
outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the RRA men still maintain the bridge of
Manyafulka which is a strategic point for the connection of
Baidoa to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the animosity had renewed among the two sides
is not known. However, RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle
said his men are motivated by the escalated looting and armed
robbery by Aidid's men on the Rahanwein people in the town.
</P>
<P>
This renewed hostility might also jeopardize the possibility
of the convening of the national reconciliation conference in the
town of Baidoa which is supposed to take place within three
months, according to an agreement of the faction leaders here in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
About 50 people are known to have died and more than 70
others, mainly civilians, are believed to have been wounded since
the fighting renewed three days ago. So far there's no official
word from Hussein Aidid's side over the fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, Aidid's top lieutenants characterize these serious
clashes as habitual minor incidents, skirmishes and hit-and-run
attacks by the RRA which would not hurt the stability of the town
nor affect the current peace movements in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Faces Tough Time in NBA Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- After losing four playoff games
and down 0-1 to the Utah Jazz, the Chicago Bulls seem to be in big
trouble heading into Game 2 of the NBA Finals later tonight in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman, who said he liked the nightlife of Las Vegas,
got a green light from coach Phil Jackson, taking an overnight
trip to the gambling city just hours after Wednesday night's 88-85
overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan kidded that some of his coach's spiritual
serenity is wearing off on the players.
</P>
<P>
"We're practicing smiling when we may be frustrated inside so
we can relieve some tension. It's an art form. It takes about 10
years."
</P>
<P>
A loss tonight would drop the Bulls to 0-2, a place Chicago has
never been in its run to five titles in this decade.
</P>
<P>
"I have an inner confidence about ourselves and what we are
capable of accomplishing," Jordan said. "One game does not
deteriorate like that. It's the ultimate apex of the season, but
you don't fight that apex with anger and frustration."
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek will start out guarding Jordan. Bryon Russell
and Shandon Anderson also will get their turns.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek insists he feels fine, but he looks as if his sore
Achilles' tendon is bothering him. Jordan is glad to feel that.
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, the Bulls got almost nothing from anyone other than
Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Toni Kukoc had a tough shooting game
and is counted on for a better showing tonight.
</P>
<P>
After tonight's game, the series shifts to Chicago's United
Center for Game 3 on Sunday.

NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) market lost 128.32 points to 3417.89 as
against Thursday's close of 3546.21.
</P>
<P>
The national index also went down by 63.26 points to 1513.94
from the previous close of 1577.2.
</P>
<P>
Equities crashed on the last day of the current settlement
bringing the sensitive index sharply down by more than 128 points
on the BSE market Friday on heavy bull liquidation and continued
selling pressure by foreign funds induced by Moody's warning about
the downward pressure on India's ratings.
</P>
<P>
The market took seriously a warning by Moody's investor service
that downward pressure on India's ratings has intensified due to
international sanctions imposed on the country after its nuclear
tests and lack of substantive measures in the 1998-99 budget to
attract foreign investments.

CAIRO -- More European Union (EU) countries have refused to
impose an estimated 20.6 percent anti-dumping fees on Egyptian
textiles, the Middle East News Agency reported Friday.

Under the EU quota, Egypt can export 20,000 tonnes crude textile
to these countries annually worth 400 million Egyptian pounds
(about 118 million U.S. dollars). In fact, Egypt's annual exports
of textiles and off-the-peg clothes to Europe exceeds 3 billion
pounds (882 million dollars). The quota is affected specially
after the EU's imposition of the anti-dumping fees in April.
</P>

Hagag said that an international lawyer has been authorized to
plead against the anti-dumping fees before the end of June.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 3.437 billion dollars were paid by the Turkish

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Friday used emergency laws to impose a censorship on
domestic and foreign media coverage of the country's civil war,
according to a news release from the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary C. de Silva said in the release that the
regulation on the "emergency prohibition of publication and
transmission of sensitive military information" went into effect
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government imposed a similar censorship in April
1996, but lifted it in October of that year.
</P>
<P>
A similar censorship on Colombo-based foreign media was also
imposed in September 1995, but within four days the authorities
ended the restriction for the foreign media but upheld it for
local publications.
</P>
<P>
The latest government move came a day after heavy fighting
broke out in the north of the island country, in which both
government troops and Tamil rebels claimed to have caused heavy
losses to the other side.
</P>
<P>
The release said any report about military operations without
the approval of the censor will constitute an offense punishable
under the emergency laws which allow the authorities to detain the
suspects for long periods. Army Deputy Chief of Staff Jaliya
Nammuni was appointed by the president as the chief censor.

PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Joao Havelange could
stay in power for another two years, said FIFA presidential
candidate Sepp Blatter here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, currently the FIFA sectretary general, said he had not
excluded the possibility that the 82-year-old Havelange may be
asked to stay on,
</P>
<P>
"It could happen," said Blatter. "We have considered it and
have not ruled it out."
</P>
<P>
Blatter and UEFA president Lennart Johansson, has been locked
in a two-way battle to take over the most powerful job in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Their struggle threatens to tear football apart and in order to
heal the wounds Havelange would be asked to delay his retirement.
</P>
<P>
Senior FIFA insiders have also refused to dismiss the idea that
Havelange, who has ruled world soccer iron-handedly for the past
24 years, could still be president when the congress finishes on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of nasty things said in the battle
between Blatter and Johansson. It is not good for football and
getting Havelange to stay on could give time for the wounds to
heal," said one official.
</P>
<P>
Havelange has consistently denied the possibility he would stay
on but few people doubted he could be persuaded to change his mind
if the majority of congress were in favour.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy in Better Shape: President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-Elect Joseph
Estrada Friday said the Philippine economy is in better shape than
some of its neighbors which also suffered from the regional
currency crisis and the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with the finance managers of the
outgoing Ramos administration at the central bank building,
Estrada said the Philippines' inflation rate remains "manageable."
</P>
<P>
The National Office of Statistics announced on the same day
that the country's inflation rate in May rose sharply to 9.2
percent from April's 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who had vowed to examine the status of the national
treasury, said the incoming secretaries of the Department of Trade
and Industry, the Department of Finance and other finance experts
will study whether there is a need to change the inflation rate
target of 7 to 8 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada said there is nothing to worry about the
amount of foreign debts his administration will have to face.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the country's total foreign debt had
reached 45 billion U.S. dollars as of the end of last year.
However, only 9 percent of the debts were classified as public
debts and the remaining were recorded as private debts.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed optimism that his administration will be able
to fulfill its financial obligations, particularly the settlement
of short-term debts which represent 18.6 percent of the foreign
loans incurred.
</P>
<P>
"We have a better chance of reviving our economy, compared to
our neighbors in Southeast Asia," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the Philippines is the least affected in
the regional financial crisis and would first come out of the woes
in the second half of this year.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide swoop by the police
since the beginning of this year has netted a large batch of
explosives held illegally.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from a dozen provinces and municipalities show that
by mid-May the police had inspected some 17,000 manufactures,
traders and users of explosives, and found 2,700 potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they sent notices to more than 1,400 units,
ordering them to solve those problems within a specified
time. Meanwhile, they revoked the licenses of another 110
units found guilty of serious breaches of the law.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer said that although all units with
connections with explosives are on the inspection list, attention
was focused on small mines and quarries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inspectors confiscated 196 tons of dynamite,
310,000 detonators and 300,000 m of fuse. They also closed down
577 unlicensed explosives manufacturers and 1,200 traders, and
punished 1,272 people involved.
</P>
<P>
The inspection concentrated on whether the units had proper
licenses to manufacture, trade in or utilize the explosives,
whether storehouses met the safety requirements, and whether the
related staff had received proper training and obtained

past five years, China has achieved an annual economic growth rate
of 10 percent or more, with the foreign currency reserves
exceeding 140 billion US dollars and other economic indices
hitting record highs. "That is the reason for the stable exchange
rate between the Renminbi and foreign currencies," Salvador said
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government's efforts to maintain the
stability of the Chinese currency as a contribution to the ongoing
recovery of other Asian economies is highly appreciated by
international society.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc, one of the world's biggest chemical companies,
has established six representative offices, 15 joint ventures and
three solely-owned subsidiaries in China since 1992, when the
company initiated a far-reaching investment plan here.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc's investment in China so far totals 450 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The French company generated 260 million US dollars in sales
revenues in China last year, and the figure is expected to reach
one billion US dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Salvador attributed the success of his China business to the
company's special development strategies which encourage
technology transfer and the localization of products, in addition
to promoting Chinese employees to high management positions.
</P>
<P>
"To win a bigger market share, it is necessary to make more
investment in business entities here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salvador acknowledged that foreign companies are sometimes
hindered by unequal competition, which is regarded a result of
the country's planned-economy heritage. However, their advantage
in technology and management style will help them to do good
business in China, as the central government is accelerating the
formation of a sound market order in accordance with international
practices, he said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges Palestinians to Continue Fighting for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Friday called on the Palestinian people to
continue their struggle for peace, self-determination and the
return of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued in Gaza by the PNA in a message marking the
31st anniversary of the 1967 War, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian
news service Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC)
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the Six Day War in 1967, Israeli forces captured the
Palestinian territories of Gaza Strip and West Bank as well as
Syria's Golan Heights and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The anniversary comes at a time -- the Israeli mentality of
expansion remains the same and Israel continues to reject
implementing the United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338 relating
to the Arab-Israeli conflict," the message said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its acceptance of peace negotiations, the current
Israeli government refuses to commit itself to the peace process,
particularly the land-for-peace formula, and rejects implementing
the signed agreements with the Palestinians, it added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA slammed Israel for continuing "its attempts to
judaize Palestinian lands which it occupied in 1967 through the
settlement campaign and the occupation of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
It also warned Israel that the failure to achieve a
comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian issue "means
the continuation of waves of violence and conflicts."
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat is scheduled to convene a weekly
PNA Cabinet meeting Friday evening in Gaza to discuss the latest
political developments in the region, his push for convening an
Arab summit to confront Israeli intransigence and the
international efforts to revive the peace process, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has just returned from visits to Oman, Yemen and Jordan
as part of his continued campaign to hold an Arab summit to
pressure Israel to carry out the long-delayed further troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
While most Arab leaders have agreed in principle to attend such
summit, no agreement has been reached on when, where and how it
would be held due to the differences among the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several other Palestinian parties and movements, such
as the People Party and the militant movement Islamic Jihad (Holy
War), also issued statements Friday, calling on Palestinian people
to continue their struggle until achieving national independence,
or the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as the capital.

entirely by India, he said the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan
are seen as a response to the threat from India.
</P>
<P>

called on parties concerned to join the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
unconditionally and not to take any action which will possibly
worsen the situation in the region, he continued.

<P>
Speaking of relations between the two countries and their armed
forces, Fu said that the the people of the two countries enjoy a
long history of friendship.

two armed forces thanks to the development of bilateral relations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He told Hagglund that the PLA is ready to advance cooperation
with the Finnish armed forces in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Hagglund said that Finland believes China is a responsible
large country and appreciates China's stand on the Asian financial
crisis and nuclear arms race in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Finnish armed forces are ready to
increase exchanges with their Chinese armed forces. He also

<HEADLINE> Ramos Accepts Solicitor General's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Friday accepted the resignation of Solicitor General Romeo
de la Cruz who sought the acquittal of former First Lady Imelda
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos designated Justice Secretary Silvestre
Bello III to replace de la Cruz on June 8.
</P>
<P>
De La Cruz Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to acquit Imelda
of her 12-year jail sentence for corruption handed down in 1993
and upheld by the Supreme Court in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The solicitor general made the appeal six days after submitting
his letter of resignation to President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
"I leave the Office of the Solicitor General with deepest
sorrow, for I have been with this office since 1974, starting as a
solicitor and rising through the ranks to my present position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Accepting de la Cruz' resignation, Ramos said he has exercised
his prerogative to make the effective date of the chief government
lawyer's resignation earlier.
</P>
<P>
"In your departure from government service, I am certain that
your deep sense of civic duty will remain and that, in your future
endeavors, you will continue to support our common vision of
Philippines 2000," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Former First Lady Imelda was appealing to the Supreme Court for
acquittal while on parole. She ran for the presidency but quit a
few days before the voting day on May 11, calling on her
supporters to vote for Vice President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the presidential candidate of the main opposition, the
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses), won overwhelmingly in the elections. He will assume
office on June 30 when Ramos' term expires.

<P>
Dar es Salaam, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese embassy has
donated a set of public address equipment worth one million
Shillings (about 15,000 U.S. Dollars) to Tanzania's Ministry of
Education and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, including an amplifier, four loudspeakers, two
microphones and two microphone stands, were presented by Chen
Yongshan, the cultural attache of the Chinese embassy, to Juma
Kapuya, the Minister of Education and Culture, in Dar es Salaam
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed thanks to the Chinese government,
saying China's assistance to Tanzania has always been "hearty."
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the opportunity, Kapuya called for more
cooperation in culture and education between the two countries,
an embassy source told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
The minister also discussed with Chen about the possibilities
of inviting Chinese acrobatic troupes to perform in Tanzania,
especially in areas outside the capital of Dar es Salaam. He
extended the wish that China train more acrobats for Tanzania as
the acrobatic show is welcomed here.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 Tanzanian children received training in
acrobatics in central China's Wuhan city during 1965 and 1969.
However, the group of acrobats are getting old while capable
budding acrobats are in acute shortage in the country, Chen
noted.

<P>
Also at the function, Kapuya invited Chinese Minister of
Culture to visit Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian King Warns Against Foreign Dictatorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Supreme Head of
State King Tuanku Ja'afar Friday warned against foreign powers
dictating the fate of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for the people to give up hope and to let
foreign powers dictate the fate of the nation," the king said in
his 75th birthday address to the nation broadcast over radio and
television Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The king said the country's currency, the ringgit's
depreciation and slump in the stock market, resulting from "moves
designed by foreigners," were unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said the level of advancement and economic
might, not the size of the military, that determines a country's
strength, holds true today as foreigners apply their economic
powers to crippling developing economies like Malaysia and
destroyed whatever progress the nation has achieved thus far.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said that in the wake of the country's economic
problems it is crucial that all parties preserve the prevailing
unity and refrain from compounding the difficulties by creating
ill feelings toward each other.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is not the time for us to be selfish. We should be
helping each other to go through the current hard times as we'll
only be a strong society if we are all united," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Malaysians to increase productivity and give
full backing to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in steering the
country toward a full recovery from the current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much satisfied with all the efforts being undertaken
by the government under the leadership of the prime minister," he
said. "I believe and am confident that the bold and firm steps
initiated by the government will bring good to the people and the
country."
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said he is pleased with the people's support for
the government's endeavors toward that end so far and reminded
them that the current situation calls for sacrifices and thrift on
their part.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to be spending like the way we did before.
Instead we should strive to increase national savings to
consolidate the country's reserves. It is my hope that all
Malaysians remain patient in going through this tribulation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The king said that for continued national prosperity,
Malaysians should be constantly sensitive to the customs and
religious peculiarities of the various racial groups so that
harmonious coexistence and tolerance could be preserved and
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The current economic problems should not be an excuse for
remaining inert but should instead prompt the people to put in
greater efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The king also advised the Malaysians to attend to and check
issues which are often linked to economic collapse from causing
the social fabric to disintegrate.

delivered a blow to UEFA President Lennart Johansson as it said on
Friday that it will back FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter's bid
to become the new president of the world ruling body FIFA at
Monday's Congress.

football nation it is our responsibility to make our position
clear in advance, particularly as so many other countries have
expressed interest in our view," said Wiseman.

"After careful deliberation, the Football Association is
therefore today announcing that England will cast its vote in

He made the remarks while visiting an on-going anti-drug
exhibition held here yesterday. Nearly 200 foreign diplomats to
China from dozens of countries visited the exhibition, which

banning drugs now.
</P>
<P>
Roderic Francis Wye, first Secretary of the British
Embassy in China, said that the youth was vulnerable to drug abuse
because they had scarce knowledge about it. It should be the focus
of all governments around the world to strengthen education on
youth about the harmfulness of drug abuse.
</P>

With exhibits including more than 1,000 pictures, 100 drug
objects and samples, the exhibition is regarded as the biggest

<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A foreign academician attending the
on-going biennial conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) called the
gathering of prestigious Chinese scientists as a chance for him to
breathe fresh air.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yuan-Cheng B. Fung, with the University of California,
San Diego, said the human society is now being ruled by the
utilitarianism at the turn of the century, and the intellectual
circle should carry forward the national tradition of shouldering
the historic task.
</P>
<P>
The three-minute speech made by the veteran biological engineer
won warm applause from the nearly 2,000 academicians present at
the five-day conference, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Another foreign academician of Chinese descent, Professor
Ho-Kwang Mao, introduced his mother, who used to work as a primary
school teacher, to the academicians.
</P>
<P>
Mao, geophysicist with the Carnegie Institute of Washington,

was awarded with the highest reputation in Chinese scientific
circle.
</P>
<P>
"As early as my childhood, Mother taught me to contribute to the
country and the society," he said, adding that more than half of
the research subjects he is chairing are participated by Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Professor C.W. Chu, with the University of Houston, said it is
of special significance to be a foreign academician of the CAS,
because it indicates the recognition of his achievement by a
country with a population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
For a scientist of Chinese descent, it is all the more a
special encouragement and inspiration, Chu said. He also pledged
to promote scientific exchanges between China and the United

by Friday across Nepal, the Department of Health said.
</P>
<P>
At least 28 people have died in the past two days, and most of
them were from Baglung district of western Nepal, the department
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The death toll may be much higher as figures from the remote
areas of the country are not available yet, it said.
</P>
<P>
The diseases have broken out especially in the underdeveloped
areas of the country, which lack clean drinking water, medicine,
health workers, food and awareness of disease prevention.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall On Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to fall on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) lost another 19.28 points to close at 1168.46 points
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stock prices went lower on widespread selling
by foreign investors eyeing plunging regional currencies on the
one hand and a hike in UK interest rates on the other.
</P>
<P>
"There was selling of property and bank shares from Japan,
Britain and the United States," one dealer said. "It was a
combination of short selling and dumping," the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
A 25-basis point hike in UK interest rates to 7.5 percent from
7.25 percent weighed on investors' minds, he added.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume dropped marginally to 112.97 million
units, valued at 207.6 million Singapore dollars (about 122.84
million U.S. dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 215 to 73,
while 303 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Land was the most actively
traded stock as it registered a turnover of 8.27 million units. It
was followed by local computer maker IPC which had 7.76 million
shares traded. Easyknit was next with 6.7 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
Oriental led the gainers of the day as it rose by 19 cents to
finish at 3.08 Singapore dollars. SeaView increased by 10 cents to
end at 4.1 Singapore dollars. Singapore Land was up by eight cents
to close at 3.06 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Genting 200 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.7 dollars to end at 4.1 Singapore dollars. Local
computer sound card maker Creative 50 fell by 70 cents to close at
29.3 Singapore dollars. SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) was down by
50 cents to finish at 12.6 Singapore dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Disappointed a rate cut was now
not on the agenda, the Australian sharemarket followed its weekly
trend by closing lower Friday with buyers remaining sidelined
ahead of a weekend.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 15.6 points down at 2642.8 in
tepid trade, with financial sector stocks notably weaker.
</P>
<P>
"It was a lackluster day. Just about every day this week has
been the same. People are really uncertain now and just sitting on
their hands," Hartley Poynton broker Craig Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
Comments by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane
overnight effectively killed off lingering hopes of an interest
rate cut and contributed to Friday's poor market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 30.5 points down at 4595.4,
with the banking index slipping more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
Leading the fall among the major banks was Westpac, which
dropped 25.6 cents, NAB dropped nine cents, ANZ was 8.7 cents
weaker, while Commonwealth fell 27.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
Retailer Coles Myer finished at its lowest level since November
1997 after losing another seven cents. Manufacturer Email
recovered from a fall soon after announcing a 28 percent fall in
net profit.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index lost 3.1 points to 1074.2, with the
gold sector finishing the week down after a fluctuating five days.
</P>
<P>
The gold index lost 13.9 points to 1114.1.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 221.76 million shares worth 671 million
Australian dollars (416.02 million U.S. dollars) with falls of 546
ahead of 373.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel's Coalition Crisis Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A new crisis is brewing in
Israel's coalition over the conversion bill, which reflects the
deepening social divide in the Jewish state caused by the
increased political weight by religious parties.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil was triggered early the week by the instruction by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Knesset (Parliament) Law
Committee to advance legislation of the conversion bill, which is
pending the second and third reading in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed the first reading in the Knesset last
year, affirmed the monopolistic power of the Orthodox-dominated
Chief Rabbinate, the highest religious authority, to carry out
the conversions.
</P>
<P>
At least three coalition factions, the immigrant party Yisrael
Baaliya, The Third Way and Tsomet, have expressed strong
objections to the bill. Some lawmakers from these parties even
threatened to bring down the government, if the bill becomes law,
citing it will violate the civil rights of the secular population.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the Neeman Committee's recommendations be
adopted, either by agreement or legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Neeman Committee, led by Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman,
was set up due to the outcry from the American Jews raised
following the passage of the conversion bill on its first reading
last year.
</P>
<P>
Following intensive inter-religious consultations, Neeman
formulated a compromise solution to the conversion issue. He
proposed setting up a joint conversion institute, which is
composed of Orthodox, Reform and Conservative rabbis, to allow
would-be converts to conduct Bible and Judaism study in different
ways, although the actual conversions would be carried out only by
Orthodox rabbis.
</P>
<P>
However, the far-right coalition parties still rejected
Neeman's compromise and demanded the conversion bill be passed in
its original form. They also threatened to bring down the
Likud-led government if Netanyahu fails to maintain the Orthodox
monopoly over conversions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to make intensive efforts to soothe the
anger on the two sections within his government so as to avoid its
downfall. He softened his tone on Thursday, saying that he
supports anchoring in law the compromise adopted by the Neeman
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The looming crisis in Netanyahu's coalition over the
conversion bill exposes one of Israel's most fundamental divides,
the struggle for power between secular and Orthodox segments of
society.
</P>
<P>
Although nearly 70 percent of Israel's 5 million Jews are
secular, the Orthodox Jews have sole control over performing
marriages, divorces and burials for all Jews in the country.
</P>
<P>
The religious and secular Jewish communities in Israel are
virtually living in separated places and conducting their lives in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
In the religious neighborhoods, police have to close the
streets in Shabath, the Jewish weekend beginning from sunset
Friday to sunset Saturday, so to prevent the secular traffic from
interfering with the Oxthodox Jews' prayers.
</P>
<P>
Tensions and even violent clashes often flared up between the
two sectors, when the secular Jews tried to prevent what they
called the religious coercion and violation of their rights by the
other side. Last year, the religious communities succeeded in the
partial closure of Bar Illan road, a major street in northern
Jerusalem, following years of struggle marked by violent clashes
with police and secular protesters.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections, three religious parties, all powerful
members of Netanyahu's government, drastically increased their
political influence by gaining 23 seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The new-found weight by the religious parties also contributed
to the difficulties facing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
because they are the leading force that opposes relinquishing
Israeli control over the Palestinian territories, which they
termed as part of the Greater Israel gifted by God to the Jews.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Still Below 61 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) made a massive 1-billion-plus effort to brace the ailing
Australian dollar Friday but the currency stubbornly continued to
wallow below 61.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar sank to 60.51 U.S. cents and close to its
lows of 60.45 U.S. cents, well down from 61.10 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The RBA started buying in the foreign exchange market mid
afternoon Thursday and managed to procure a bounce for the
currency, from 60.80 to 61.50.
</P>
<P>
But the speculators had other ideas and drove the unit back
down.
</P>
<P>
It scrambled back to 61.00 U.S. cents in morning trade as the
RBA continued its efforts and the Reserve Bank's governor vainly
talked about the need to understand the Australian economy's
strong fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
But the respite proved brief and U.S. hedge and mutual funds
continued to dump the local unit.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State bank's chief economist Craig James said he
understands the bank's frustrations but added that it was wasting
its time fighting the trend.
</P>
<P>
"History is littered with the failures of countries defending
their currencies," James remarked.
</P>
<P>
"The RBA is fighting a losing battle if it throws 1 billion to
2 billion Australian dollars to support it. It should let it go,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
James said that the RBA was in a difficult position because it
did not have much recourse to higher interest rates to support the
currency.
</P>
<P>
Tim Crawford, economist with St. George Bank, was a little more
encouraged by the Reserve Bank's support of the currency Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
"It may be only a slight kick higher but it has slowed a
downtrend," he said.
</P>
<P>
AAP chief economist Garry Shilson-Josling said the RBA had not
necessarily failed in its attempt to support the Australian dollar
overnight.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie is still weak in spite of the intervention, but
even if it does slip lower over the next week or so that won't
mean the intervention has failed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last intervened in May and January, when the unit
touched 61.69 U.S. cents and 63.18 respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates Friday, the local currency was nearly steady
but weakened against the German mark. It fell to 84.42 yen from
84.45 and to 1.0715 marks from 1.0792.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Close Down a Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government confirmed
Friday the reprocessing at Dounreay nuclear plant in the north of
Scotland is to be closed.
</P>
<P>
John Battle, Energy Minister at the Department of Trade and
Industry, said there was no economic case for work in the plant to
continue over the longer term.
</P>
<P>
He said the plant hoped to complete the commercial reprocessing
work by the year 2006 and then stop working entirely.
</P>
<P>
Dounreay has been criticized over a number of incidents in
recent months that have aroused concerns about its safety. They
included a power failure that led to a shutdown of parts of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent controversy about standards at the Caithness
plant, the government insists the operation was still "safe."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar's office said
earlier in the day that Dewar would make an announcement in
Edinburgh on Friday morning concerning the closure of the plant
along with Battle.
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been mounted for the shutdown of Dounreay plant
after recent official report said 170 kg of enriched uranium was
missing in the late 60s. The report has aroused fears among local
people in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday denied claims
that weapons-grade uranium had gone missing from Dounreay.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that the apparent loss of 170 kg of the
material from the Dounreay plant was merely a case of poor
accounting.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Enacts Amended Peacekeeping Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Councillors (the
upper house) on Friday approved and enacted a bill to allow
Japanese peacekeepers abroad to use weapons for self-defense on
the order of a commander in the field rather than by their own
individual discretion.
</P>
<P>
The law will go into effect in July as it has already cleared
the House of Representatives (the lower house).
</P>
<P>
The bill, which amends the current U.N. Peacekeeping Cooperation
Law, was adopted by a majority with support from the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the
Komei, and the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party
(SDP) opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
The SDP opposed the amendment over concern it would contradict
Japan's constitutional ban on the use of force overseas.
</P>
<P>
Japan adopted the peacekeeping law in 1992, opening the way for its
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to join U.N. peacekeeping operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
The current law, which leaves it up to each individual peacekeeper
to decide whether or not to use a weapon, has led to concern that
arbitrary use of weapons by individuals could disrupt the order of a
contingent and endanger peacekeepers' lives, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, the scope of peacekeeping operations is also
expanded to include election monitoring, not only by the United
Nations but also by regional organizations, such as the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Japan has sent its troops overseas for for several times since the
peacekeeping law was adopted.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Soars in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The protracted Asian currency crisis
pushed the Philippines' year-on-year inflation rate to a high of
9.2 percent in May 1998 from 7.8 percent recorded in April, the
National Statistics Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a report that all the commodity groups
registered higher year-on-year inflation rates except for that of
services whose 15.8-percent inflation in May dipped slightly from
15.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The May inflation rate was mainly pushed by the higher prices
for food, beverages and tobacco (FBT), and housing and repairs.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the FBT group rose to 7.6 percent in May
from 5.4 percent in April and that for housing and repairs up to
11.5 percent from 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao posted the highest
inflation rate at 14.8 percent in May while Western Visayas region
recorded the lowest rate at 6.9 percent.

SHENYANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A beeper that can record the
beatings of a heart, or "telephone transferring electrocardiogram
apparatus" as it is called, has gone into batch production.
</P>
<P>
The small-sized device to the welcome of patients with heart
trouble, provides basic information for doctors to treat these
patients.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Chinese Medical Sciences
University, the developer of the device, patients only have to put
three batteries in order and press the switch button when they are
in trouble, and the "beeper" will automatically record the
electrocardiogram of the abnormal heart movement.
</P>
<P>
Then, patients only need to make a phone call to a doctor and
replay the "beeper" so that the doctor can acquire related
information on a computerized network in hospital. Based on the
information obtained and what the patient said, doctors can offer
heart patients prompt advices on how to treat their ailments.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah to Reach Deal with Israel on Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli Muslim group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, will soon conclude a deal with Israel
to swap the remains of a killed Israeli soldier for Lebanese
prisoners held in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Voice of the People radio quoted Lebanese security
sources as saying that over the past few days, intensive and
tough negotiations had been conducting between the two sides
through the mediation of France.
</P>
<P>
Secret swap negotiations have started since a dozen of Israeli
commandos were killed during a botched raid on north of Israel's
so-called security zone in south Lebanon last September.
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to return 50 Lebanese prisoners held inside
Israel and the remains of more than 40 Hezbollah guerrillas in
return for the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in the botched
raid, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese sources said that the current negotiations focused on
a Lebanese important figure held in Israeli jail. Hezbollah has
asked Israel to put him on the swap list while Israel has not
agreed, saying unless the group provides some information about
an Israeli pilot missing during the failed raid in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Israel first exchanged the remains of two
Israeli soldiers for the bodies of 126 guerrillas under a
German-brokered deal in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli
troops since Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern
borders from cross border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Prefer Books To TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent study by the China
Publishers Association has found that more Chinese children are
turning to reading as a way to spend their free time.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 43 percent of Chinese children say they
prefer reading books, while 34 percent prefer TV, and 21 percent
are particularly interested in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The study has gone some way in easing people's worries about
children being influenced by the electronic media.
</P>
<P>
In some developed countries, children are so obsessed with TV
that sociologists are afraid that they are becoming illiterate in
the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
The study of 7,000 children and their parents nationwide found
that some 70 percent of Chinese children spend 30 minutes to two
hours reading every day, and half of them read one to three books
a week.
</P>
<P>
It also found that Chinese children become interested in books
when they are two to three years old.
</P>
<P>
Parental behavior is a key to children's behavior, the survey
found, and 70 percent of the books read by children were bought by
their parents. Many parents begin to buy books for their children
when they enter kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Most parents say that reading is one of the best ways to
increase children's knowledge, and they prefer getting their
children to read than watch TV or VCDs.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the natural sciences, fairy tales,
history, literature and the arts are subjects favored by Chinese
children.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Vows Tough Measures for Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
vowed Friday to take tough measures to collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
In a regular weekly radio address devoted to stabilizing the
country's financial market, Yeltsin said the tax policy would be
"maximally rigid".
</P>
<P>
"Time has come to demand and punish, up to criminal
responsibility," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "taxes not collected are wages not
received by people."
</P>
<P>
Russia was hit by a financial crisis late last month and the
government cited the huge deficit, partly due to lax tax
collection, as one of the causes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia should learn from the west, "where failure
to pay tax is one of the most serious crimes."
</P>
<P>
The state "has the right to expect that citizens take a
responsible attitude to their duty as conscientious payers of
taxes," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for joint efforts by all without exception --
those in power, the industrialists, the bankers and the
rank-and-file citizens," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin pointed out, "problems can not be resolved
with tough measures only."
</P>
<P>
"There is the need to create an effective and flexible tax
system convenient for all -- both for the state and the taxpayer,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
To stave off the financial difficulties, the government has
taken a number of steps to cut spending. Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko announced a staff cut of 30 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The government has also placed Eurobonds to raise funds.
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday that the country's
Eurobond placements this year might top 5 billion U.S. dollars,
much more than the earlier target of 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the financial crisis had been "noticeably defused"
but "the main work lies ahead".
</P>
<P>
"The development of the financial crisis poses a threat to the
stability of the Russian ruble and can entail price hikes and a
higher cost of living," Yeltsin said. "Of course we will not allow
this."
</P>
<P>
In his radio address, Yeltsin also criticized regional leaders
for housing themselves in posh mansions amid piling wage debts.

PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Ccouncil, which are also the world's five
officially recognized nuclear powers, Thursday issued a declaration
in Geneva calling on India and Pakistan not to make any more nuclear
and missle tests. They also agreed to cooperate to prevent a nuclear
and missile arms race in the Indian sub-continent and to reinforce
the treaty on non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
-- One day after the most grave train accident of Germany in 50
years took place, the German railway company Deutsche Bahn Thursday
put 60 first-generation fast speed ICE trains out of service. The
catastrophe of Eschede, which killed 94 people, could be caused by a
broken pad of wheels on a wagon located behind the motor-car.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the traffic of Air France remained disorganized, the
talks between unions of striking pilots and management resumed
Thursday evening. They were nearing an agreement on one of the
subjects of dispute -- the lowering of salary in exchange for the
company's stocks.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac Thursday attacked a plan introduced
by the left-dominated National Assembly to legalize ``contract
family,'' which would be made of a man and his mistress or between
homosexuals. He said that would ``denaturalize'' and ``trivialize''
the right of marriage, while promising to defend the role of
families in the French society as well as the Civil Code, including
the law on marriage.

<HEADLINE> More Laid-off Women Get New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 female workers
discharged by industrial enterprises in northeast China's Liaoning
Province in the course of economic restructuring have gone in for
their own businesses in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Lang Fang, a laid-off woman, started a chicken farm where she
bred turkey introduced from the United States. In the past three
years, she sold out one million turkeys, 100 pigs and 1,300
chickens, netting an annual profit of 100,000 yuan (12,000 US
dollars). She was conferred the title of "re-employment star" by
the local government not long ago.
</P>
<P>
Another laid-off woman, named Tan Liping, went to Shenyang's
outskirtan area to develop edible fungus together with her husband
after she lost her job. Later the couple set up a bio-product
research center and passed on the cultivation technique to local
villagers.
</P>
<P>
In Changsha, capital of central-south China's Hunan Province,
10,000 female workers, or one seventh of the laid-off women in the
city, have found new jobs with the help of the municipal women's
federation at various levels.
</P>
<P>
So far, they have opened 14 training courses where 700
laid-offs have learned one or two skills, and half of the trainees
have new jobs.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Close Six Overseas Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Friday decided to shut down
its embassies in Belgium, Uruguay, Cameroon, Zambia, Yugoslavia and
Saudi Arabia before September this year.
</P>
<P>
The closures are a part of the South Korean government's
restructuring of its overseas missions, of which, 20 embasssies or
consulates will be shut down before the end of this year due to the
ongoing financial crisis, said a spokesman of the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs and Trade Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry will also reduce its diplomat number
abroad, added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11 largest economy in the world, has been in
serious financial crisis created by corporate failures and bad loans
of financial institutions since late last year, which saw the nation's
per capita income down to 9,000 U.S. dollars from the previous year's
10,548 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai will visit Jordan Sunday for talks with King Hussein on
the peace process and bilateral security cooperation, a newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post said that details of
Mordechai's visit were finalized late Thursday night in
coordination with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's visit to Jordan was set following his talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo Tuesday. This was seen
as part of the Israeli efforts to fend off the pressure from
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been lobbying for
support for holding an Arab summit to formulate a common strategy
to confront Israel's intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister, widely-considered the leading dove
within the right-wing Israeli coalition, insists on a
double-digit withdrawal from the West Bank. He said in Cairo that
the implementation of the second redeployment could no longer be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Knesset (Parliament) Wednesday, he warned
that the deadlock in the peace process is likely to lead to
confrontation and violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, upon his return from visits to Oman, Yemen and Jordan
on the push for an Arab summit, said Thursday in Gaza that he
hoped for a decision on the Israeli second withdrawal no later
than mid-June. He said that under the United States initiative,
Israel has to make the decision on the redeployment no later than
middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli newspaper reports, the U.S. has presented
its revised plan on Israeli redeployment, which would enable the
Palestinian side to control about 40 percent of the West Bank
following a three-stage pullbacks within 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Another issue top on the agenda of Mordechai's talks with
Jordanian officials will be security cooperation and joint efforts
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has weakened its security ties with Israel since last
September when Israeli secret agency Mossad carried out a botched
assassination attempt to kill a Hamas leader in Amman.

<HEADLINE> China Pegs Oil Prices To International Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent decision by China's State
Council on prices of finished oil products took effect today,
following a decision to peg crude oil prices to the international
market on June 1.
</P>
<P>
This is a final move to free China's oil industry from the
planned economy and the start of what may be fierce competition on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
According to new pricing system, the benchmark price of
domestic crude oil will be in line with the monthly FOB price plus
tariff of similar crude oil on the international market and will
be announced at the beginning of each month by the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC). After China's oil prices
are pegged to the international market, the well-head price of
domestic crude oil will be about equal to that of imported
products, explains Huang Yan, General Manager of the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The price of refined oil will be set by the SDPC in accordance
with the average prices of petrol and diesel oil in different
parts of the country and internationally. The retail price of
finished oil products will be announced by CNPC and the China
National Petrochemical Corp. (SINOPEC).
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, finished oil products, natural gas, chemical
fertilizers, and automobiles were strictly controlled by the state
after China started its reform and opening-up policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
By bringing the price of crude oil and finished oil products in
line with international prices, China has demonstrated its
determination to increase its reforms and to open further to the
outside world, Huang says.
</P>
<P>
CNPC and SINOPEC were formed not long ago and are now two major
competitors in China's domestic oil market and they have
completely changed production, marketing, and domestic and foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
China is bringing its domestic oil price in line with
international prices at a time when they have slid to their lowest
point in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that this will bring with it
opportunities, but survival will be all the more difficult for
Chinese oil companies because they have to deal with domestic oil
market and price pressures as well as facing intense competition
from multinationals.
</P>
<P>
If they adapt, it will mean improved competitiveness for
domestic crude oil, a more standardized domestic oil market,
halting the smuggling of finished oil products, and changing the
difficult production and marketing process, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
They also say that the oil-price reforms this time will
completely change the long-standing government practice of setting
oil prices administratively in the planned economy and bring in a
new pricing system in line with international oil prices of the
market economy, which will have a major impact on the
market-awareness of oil and petrochemical companies.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, EU Plan Business Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Kenya's Export Promotion Council (EPC) have proposed a business
charter for raising the conduct of business to international
standards and restoring Kenya's trade reputation.
</P>
<P>
EU and EPC propose that the charter incorporates a code of
practice for all business and commercial contracts which would
establish a clear set of standards for the supply of goods and
performance of services, the East Africa Standard reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The charter would also raise expectations and change attitudes
concerning the transparency of contracts and accountability for
the use of resources in both public and private sectors,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"If it is to be effective, this charter would have to be
adopted and promoted at the highest levels of both sectors," said
a joint statement of EU and EPC.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that large improvements in policy
implementation to match the available policy framework were
needed.
</P>
<P>
"The charter, whose code of practice would include a statement
of principles with widespread application would also need the
full backing of the government," it said.
</P>
<P>
These principles would be adopted by all leading private and
public sector organizations and replicated with appropriate
adaptations by every concerned company and organization.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the companies and organizations dedicated to high
standards for the conduct of business, commerce and services
would be distinguished from those which did not adopt the
principles.
</P>
<P>
"A commercial contract reinforced with new legislation to
ensure proper accountability and transparency would be the prime
vehicle for the implementation and enforcement of the
principles," says the statement.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation is to ensure proper accountability and
transparency through provision for inspection and regular audit.
Proper arrangements for dealing with complaints and for seeking
legal redress in cases of dispute have also been recommended.
</P>
<P>
On the improvement of business ethics, the re-establishment of
a set of high standards for the conduct of business was passed as
the proper strategy.
</P>
<P>
It would be necessary to seek universal acceptance in both the
public and private sectors and to solicit a genuine commitment to
business ethics of the highest standards to be re-established in
consultation with the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The primary means of implementation would be through an
addition of a set of appropriate standards based on the agreed
principles to every business and commercial contract for both
domestic and export markets."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Urged To Eat More Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese nutritionists say that
children here need to eat more dairy products to improve their
general health, according to today's Guangming Daily, a national
newspaper designed for the country's intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The paper printed an open letter from some of China's best
known nutritionists to Chinese parents reminding young mothers and
fathers not to forget to give some dairy products to their
children every day.
</P>
<P>
A national study found that a lack of calcium was one of the
biggest problems with nutrition here, and that per capita
consumption of calcium was only half the recommended amount.
</P>
<P>
China produces 7.34 million tons of dairy products every year,
only 1.6 percent of the world's total, and per capita milk output
in China is 6.6 kilograms, only one-sixteenth of the world's
average.
</P>
<P>
At the recent '98 China Milk Science Forum, specialists
suggested a "Dairy Product Operation" scheme that called for
improved dairy industry controls and increased raising of dairy
cattle and sheep to bring per capita milk products consumption up
to 20 to 30 kilograms in the not too distant future.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Predicts U.S. Economic Trends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve will
hold off tightening even though the U.S. economy is booming, said
the Bank of America on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made by the bank's executive vice president
and chief economist John Wilson and senior economist Frank
McCormick.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. economy grew at a robust 4.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter of this year, it is expected to slow
down to 2.3 percent in the second quarter, causing the Fed to hold
off tightening monetary policy until this fall.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economic growth will likely rebound to 2.6 percent in
the third quarter and 2.9 percent in the fourth, as the negative
impact of the Asian crisis on the U.S. economy gradually wanes.
</P>
<P>
In response, they said, the Fed will push up the current
federal funds rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent at year-end.
</P>
<P>
Although the current unemployment rate is clearly driving up
wage inflation, it has not yet caused an increase in consumer
inflation, said the two economists.
</P>
<P>
Although the Fed is increasingly worried about inflation picking
up sometimes in the future, Wilson and McCormick said, the current
inflation picture could hardly be better, and therefore there is
virtually no support in the political and business communities for a
Fed tightening.
</P>
<P>
This strong public sentiment against tightening, together with the
expected economic slowdown in the second quarter, will likely keep the
Fed on hold until this fall, they concluded.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Fluctuates Over British Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market fluctuated
sharply in the past week mainly due to a British newspaper's
negative report on political uncertainties on the island.
</P>
<P>
Despite the single-day gains of 6.2 points on May 29 led to the
CISCO All-Share Index to close at 426.6 points and enforced the
market's attempt to reverse decisively its last five weeks'
downward course, the market plunged on Monday by 8.5 points.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the market continued losing ground, but it regained
by 3.3 percent on Wednesday following favorable comments from
government public figures that prompted investors to return to the
market. On Thursday, the market continued the surge by rising 5.3
percent, with the CISCO All-Share Index closing at 423.2 points.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly stock review released Friday by the
Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the
sharp fluctuation in the stock market was due to another blow
dealt on investment psychology by an article published by the
British paper "Sunday Times" that insinuated adverse developments
on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that there is a British "contingency plan"
to airlift 250,000 people from Cyprus on fears over a war if
the Cypriot government goes on with its plan to deploy the
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus stock market has lost 10.6 percent since it started
declining at the end of April, containing this year's gains at
8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this week shrunk to 6 million
Cyprus pounds (about 12 million U.S. dollars), from 7.9 million
pounds (about 15.8 million dollars) the week before.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The production and consumption of
substances that deplete the ozone layer is under restrict control
in China, according to the latest environmental situation report.
</P>
<P>
The increasing rate of the demand for substances harmful to the
ozone layer in China has been on the decrease since 1994, said the
annual report issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to November 1997, the Chinese government had made and
implemented more than 20 policies regarding ozone layer
protection. By the end of 1996, China had eliminated over 23,000
tons of ozone depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
The report said China by the end of 1997 had gained
international funds worth 270 million US dollars for over 230
projects to eliminate 60,000 tons of ozone depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will initiate a plan this year to ban the
production of Halon 1211 and Halon 1301, chemicals that deplete
ozone, by the year 2006 and 2010 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the annual production of Halon accounts for 14
percent of the country's total production of ozone depleting
substances.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A pilot dredging project on China's
Yellow River that was completed today after half a year of work,
paved the way for a massive dredging project on China's second
longest river.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River silts up with sand and mud easily. So, the
project on an 11-kilometer and a 13-kilometer stretch in the
estuary in Shandong Province took mud out of the river and used it
to reinforce the embankment and to transform low-lying
saline-alkaline land. A total of 5.4 million cubic meters of mud
was removed.
</P>
<P>
This is different from methods used in the past. The Water
Resources Ministry worked out a plan to send 100 large dredgers to
remove silt. The Yellow River project alone is estimated to cost
16.99 billion yuan (2 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Uses Nuclear Technology to Recycle Paper Mill Waste Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully applied nuclear technology in recycling waste water
from paper mills.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of nuclear fusion studies at the Sichuan-based
Southwest Research Institute of Physics attached to the China National
Nuclear Corporation developed a system that uses plasma to
purify and recycle paper mill waste water.
</P>
<P>
They said the system and research process are similar to that
of nuclear fusion studies. So far, only a few countries have the
technology.
</P>
<P>
The system has recently passed appraisal by experts.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they can produce soda, carbon powder and
burnable gas from the waste water with the system.
</P>
<P>
They said the recovered soda could be reused for paper making
while the gas and carbon powder could be utilized either as fuel
or raw materials for chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The disposed waste water will no longer cause pollution.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Sichuan Province is to build a demonstration
factory to recycle paper mill waste water with the nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the widely application of the system
could both benefit environmental protection and the production
of paper mills.

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Dollar Falls to Five-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar slumped
to the lowest level in five and half years on Friday after a
credit rating agency said it was reviewing the country's foreign
currency debt rating.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell over half a cent in trading with the American
dollar to crack the 52 U.S. cents mark, closing at 51.70 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall came after the international credit rating
agency Moody's said New Zealand's AA1 credit rating on foreign
currency bonds was on "review for downgrade."
</P>
<P>
The New York-based agency blamed New Zealand's growing current
account deficit - the difference between what a country earns and
spends internationally - for putting New Zealand on notice for a
downgrade.
</P>
<P>
A present, New Zealand' current deficit stood at 7.7 percent
of its GDP, and the Reserve Bank has predicted it would rise to
8.2 percent in the next half year before falling back to the
current level.
</P>
<P>
But Moody's indicated it was particularly concerned that the
deficit would remain at the current level for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
It said its review planned to focus on New Zealand's external
position, including any flow-on from Asia's financial crisis, the
strength of its domestic economy and the ability to boost savings.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China planted trees on an area of
5.2 million ha last year to put the country's total forest area at
130 million ha, according to China's newest environmental
situation report.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate is near 14 percent according to the
annual report, issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China closed hillsides of 3.8 million ha to
facilitate afforestation. And more than 2.5 billion trees was
planted by Chinese volunteers last year.
</P>
<P>
China is going ahead smoothly with forest shelterbelt
construction in northwestern, northern and northeastern China, the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal
regions, with more than two million ha of trees planted in those
areas last year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said China planted 260,000 ha of forests in the
middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the valleys of Liaohe
River, Zhujiang River and Huaihe River last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that China's forest area only
accounts for three to four percent of the world total, and the per
capita forest share in China is 0.114 ha, much lower than the
world average.
</P>
<P>
China's forests concentrate in northeastern and southwestern
areas, and timber forests are decreasing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 35,000 ha of forests were damaged by fires
and seven million ha of forests suffered from plant
diseases.

<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would trounce the
opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak in voting by immigrants
from the former Soviet Union, according to a poll commissioned by
Yisrael Baaliya (the Immigrant Party). His support among that
electorate has risen sharply in the last six months since he

</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>

meeting of coalition leaders that he did not rule out the
possibility of referendum on the second redeployment, his office
said that he had spoken "in jest". Knesset (Parliament) member
Michael Kleiner, who heads the far rightist group Land of Israel
Front in the Knesset, raised the idea of holding a referendum,
saying that the redeployment agreement goes against the platform
formulated by the Likud Party in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

elementary schools, high schools and colleges, will be
affected. But special education classes and matriculation exams

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Fall to 18-month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Wool prices crashed
through the 600 Australian cents (roughly 372 U.S. cents) barrier
to an 18-month low at this week's sales, exporters said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said prices
plunged 2.5 percent on average at sales in Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator slumped 16 cents to close at 584
cents a kilogram clean, the first time in 18 months the price fell
below 600 cents.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator remained at 549 cents/kg as there
were no sales in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
About 26.6 percent of the 60,486 bales offered were passed in.
</P>
<P>
"From the start of this season in July 1997, auction prices
have dropped by 15 percent on average in Australian currency terms
and by closer to 30 percent in U.S. dollar terms," the ACWE said
in its weekly wool report.
</P>
<P>
"To say that the price of wool today is very cheap in relative
terms would be an understatement, but this graphically illustrates
the weakness in global demand at the present time.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing to compound what is an extremely difficult market
environment are the problems associated with contractual defaults
where customers in a number of countries are now seeking
extensions of time to pay and renegotiation of prices under threat
of dishonoring contracts completely.
</P>
<P>
"This spreading 'disease' does nothing for maintaining
confidence or stability in international trading on wool," the
ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
About 52,921 bales are rostered for sale next week in Sydney
and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
Wool brokers Wesfarmers Dalgety said in its weekly Wool Review
that the 600-cent barrier was generally seen as a resistance
level.
</P>
<P>
"Weak demand was unable to support the small rostered quantity
and the level of uncertainty within the industry continues to
increase," the review said.
</P>
<P>
But small rostered quantities over the next three weeks and
growing demand for high tensile strength fine wool could help
stabilize prices at current prices.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Capital Helps Promote Agriculture in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Increasing inflow of overseas
capital is contributing greatly to the improvement of agricultural
production conditions and farmers' living standards in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A stretch of sandy wasteland, called Langpiziliang in Lingwu
county, for example, is now covered with lush green, alongside
with crisscross irrigation canals, fields, and newly-built houses,
due to a water diversion project from the Yellow River, financed
by 37 million US dollars of free-interest loans from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project, started in 1988, has by now helped cultivate more
than 33,000 hectares of irrigated farmland, resettled more than
50,000 farmers. And last year's grain output and farmers' income
in the areas went up 6 times and 90 percent, respectively,
compared with 1987.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the region has implemented more than 20
aid projects from the World Bank, the World Food Program (WFP),
the European Union, Germany, and Japan, involving more than one
billion yuan-worth of overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
WFP provided free grain aid worth 3.7 million US dollars to
some counties, including the suburban area of the region's
capital, Yinchuan, to develop fish raising in wasteland-turned
fishing ponds. As a result, the city now ranks first in northwest
China in terms of per-capita aquatic products.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Company Now Registering Panamanian Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Shipping Agency has
been approved by Panama Marine and Trade Service S.A. for
registering Panamanian ships or seamen.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese seamen going abroad continues to rise as
the international shipping grows. COSCO's Labor Export Company
sends more than 10,000 seamen abroad annually, mostly on foreign
vessels with Panamanian registry.
</P>
<P>
This registration work was previously handled by Panama and its
representatives in Japan and Hong Kong, but Shanghai Shipping's
new power will make registration and visas more convenient for
Chinese shipping companies and seamen. The Shanghai company can
also help with identity cards, health checkups, and mail service.
</P>
<P>
Panama has the biggest number of ships registered of any
country in the world, at 13,000, with an aggregate tonnage of 110
million DWT.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government has an open ship registration policy
and gives preferential treatment in taxation. Some Chinese ships
are registered in Panama.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and the London Club of
commercial creditors have signed an agreement on rescheduling a
70-million-U.S.-Dollar debt, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The signature formalizes a preliminary agreement reached on
February 12, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In February, BNP, which led the negotiations, said that 31.2
million U.S. Dollars out of the total figure was in past-due
interest from January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan signed earlier this week, Kenya's principal
debt will be restructured into 10-year bonds, with a three-year
grace period.
</P>
<P>
That new bond will pay fixed interest of 3.5 percent for the
first four and half years and will pay the London Inter-Bank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 13/16 percent thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the overdue interest will be forgiven and of the
remaining portion, 60 percent will be capitalized, or lumped into
the principal.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduled credits are all in U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Professor Praises Aid Projects in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- UNDP aid projects in China are doing
well, being properly managed, and reaching their goals, according
to Dr. Enjiang Cheng, an agronomy professor at Australia's
Adelaide University.
</P>
<P>
Cheng paid a week-long visit to a UNDP aid project in China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The local project officers are paid by the government, but they
work hard, are diligent, and help farmers, something that is
seldom seen in other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng visited more than 20 rural ethnic minority families
during his tour and praised local project officers' efforts to
help poor farmers and teach economic management and new
concepts.
</P>
<P>
Trine M. Lund-Jensen, UNDP resident representative in China,
who accompanied Cheng during his Xinjiang tour, was of the same
opinion. She said that Chinese officials show great concern for the
common people.
</P>
<P>
Her colleagues had the same impression, as was demonstrated at
a meeting at the UNDP Headquarters late last year, where there
were positive comments on the projects in China, she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has aid projects in 134 countries, and China is the
largest recipient. The UNDP began five-year projects in China in
1979, with 220 million US dollars in funds. Then that sum went
down to 150 million US dollars in 1997, because of China's
improved national strength, she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has focused on poverty eradication, sustained growth
for agriculture, grain production, environmental protection, and
social and economic reforms, but it in the future will turn to the
poor in cities and women in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It has a small-loan system for poverty relief, which was
introduced to China in 1991 and proved successful. The method is
now being expanded to all areas, said Zhang Ning, a Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation official.
</P>
<P>
"This is only one aspect of the success on China projects,"
Lund-Jensen said, "UNDP aims to gather the experience of every
country to form a new management concept, and make the new idea
work in local places."

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import Cereals for Food Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is requiring
3.4 billion Shillings (about 55 million U.S. Dollars) to import
cereals so as to alleviate a food deficit in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
It is the second successive year that Kenya has been forced to
import food, following unpredictable weather conditions,
according to the latest Nafaka News, a quarterly newsletter of
the National Cereals and Produce Board.
</P>
<P>
"In the year 1996/97 crop season, the country had to import
maize and wheat following failure of the short and long rains, an
exercise which both the Board and the private grain dealers were
involved in," the newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
A government assessment on the effects of the El-Nino weather
phenomenon has found that most farms, especially those in western
Kenya, were affected, leaving a shortfall of seven million bags
(90 kms per bag) of maize, according to the journal.
</P>
<P>
In the long rains during the year, Kenya's net production of
maize and wheat stood at 22.7 million bags and 2.5 million bags
respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Enhances Efforts in Biodiversity Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has scored rich achievements
in biodiversity protection after a decade of efforts, with the
number of giant pandas reaching 1,000, for instance, according to
the country's latest environmental report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report, issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration, said that the number of state-level nature
reserves has reached 124, with 18 added last year.
</P>
<P>
The country has also set up more than 200 breeding centers for
rare and endangered animals, and 920-plus nature reserves of
different levels, covering an area of some 77 million hectares,
accounting for 7.64 percent of China's landspace.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China has built 870 forestry parks, 171
zoos and 111 botanical gardens, providing effective protection of
more than 6,000 kinds of animals and 1,000 kinds of plants,
including the Chinese alligator, the cathaya argyrophylla and the
dove tree.
</P>
<P>
Four reserves in China were included in the Northeastern Asia
Crane Reserve Network, and another three were included in the
Eastern Asia--Australia Wading Bird Reserve Network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has fulfilled the requirements of
international treaties on biodiversity protection, and has
completed a report on China's biodiversity situation research and
a plan for its nature reserve development.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries with high biodiversity in the
world, with 30,000 species of higher plants, or one tenth of the
world's total, 250 species of gymnosperms, or 30 percent of the
world's total, and more than 6,000 species of vertebrates. In
addition, China has the world's biggest number in the kinds of
economic plants and domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that the country's biodiversity
is facing a serious threat because of pollution and damage of
ecology.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 species of angiosperms, 60 species of gymnosperms
and 400-plus species of vertebrates are threatened with
extinction.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Malaysia Targets Drug-Free by 2023 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has set a target that
by the year 2023, the country will be free from drug menace, for
which efforts are being intensified.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year plan involves a dual-pronged strategy to rid the
country of narcotic drugs -- one for reducing the demand for drugs
in the country and the other for cutting the sources for drug
supplies, Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the drug demand reduction strategy, Ong said
the stress is put on prevention, on awakening the public's
consciousness of drug menace.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary prevention entails creating drug-free schools first
which have been targeted to be realized within 15 years from now
on or by the year 2012, he said.
</P>
<P>
All primary and secondary schools throughout the country will
phase in the government's anti-drug preventive education program
for them first introduced in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
The program, spearheaded by the National Drug Agency (NDA)
under the supervision of the Home Ministry with the cooperation of
the police's Narcotics Department and the Education Ministry,
stresses on developing resilience against the temptations of drug
abuse among the youth.
</P>
<P>
He said proper preventive education will give students a
knowledge of the danger of drugs and the strength of character to
resist drug pushers.
</P>
<P>
A committee under the NDA on preventive education on drugs also
published a booklet "Know Drugs and Fight Against Drugs" and
already distributed to more than 8,000 schools in the country,
which is a compulsory book for all the schoolmasters to read, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for national prevention, activities such as exhibitions and
seminars are organized for the public participation to create
awareness of drug menace, in addition to anti-drug propaganda
through electronic and printed media, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to set up more than 80 service
centers at the county level to mainly provide consultations and
advises to people from all walks of life on how to get rid of
drugs or how to give up the bad habit of drug abuse, and half of
them are functioning, Ong said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government's long-term plan to produce a
generation free from drug abuse by the targeted year, a new
program, dubbed "A Day With The Community," was initiated recently
to enable drug-dependent individuals or family members to
rehabilitate themselves from drug menace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project will be carried out throughout the country
step by step, first in urban areas, then the suburbs and the rural
areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government, which spent more than 517 million ringgit (over
200 million U.S. dollars) to tackle the menace between 1984 and
1995, has allocated in the 7th Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) 73
million ringgit (28.2 million dollars) to carry out anti-drug
activities.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Malaysia Targets Drug-Free by 2023 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ong said Malaysia is not a drug producing country, drugs are
mostly smuggled in from the Golden Triangle, and to cut the
sources of drug supplies, police and other law enforcing agencies
have beefed up guards along the Malaysian-Thai border and the
coastal areas against traffickers.
</P>
<P>
To outlaw drug trafficking, he said Malaysia amended its
Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 in 1983, which carries the mandatory
death sentence on conviction. Any trafficker who is arrested with
15 grams of heroin or 40 grams of cocaine or 200 grams of opium in
his possession will be charged under the mandatory death sentence
clause, 39(B) of the Act, Ong added.
</P>
<P>
The police narcotics unit was upgraded in 1997 to strengthen
its role as the main law enforcing body for better enforcement,
the deputy home minister said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a total of 36,284 drug offenders, of which 17,342 were
first-time drug addicts, were detected in the country, against
30,598 addicts, of which 13,846 first timers, arrested in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 13,159 drug traffickers were arrested
under various laws of the country, against a total of 11,361
traffickers arrested in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The seizures of drugs in 1997 were also higher than those in
1996. In 1997, drugs seized by the authorities concerned included
276.15 kilograms of heroin, 150.3 kilograms of opium (raw and
refined) and 3,889 kilograms of hemp, compared with 256.83
kilograms of heroin, 2.64 kilograms of opium (raw and refined) and
1,425.73 kilograms of hemp seized in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ong said the above-mentioned figures also showed that drug
abuse remains a serious problem in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said what is more worrying is that the majority of the
surging number of addicts are youths between the ages of 20 and
39, sapping the nation's manpower potential.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction also harms the harmony of a family and the
society, results in more crimes as well as eats up the nation's
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ong, there are now 12,500 drug addicts in 27
government-run drug rehabilitation centers nationwide costing the
government 4,400 ringgit (about 1,100 U.S. dollars) per addict per
year for treatment and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Ong called for cooperation of the whole society in tackling the
drug menace and sought international cooperation in curbing drug
smuggling into and out of the country to help Malaysia realize its
set target.

<HEADLINE> Sex Offenses up in Kenya: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sex-related offenses are on the
increase in Kenya and there is need for a special police unit to
fight such crimes, according to Assistant Commissioner of Police
R.M. Kimundi.
</P>
<P>
As many as 334 cases of rape and 57 cases of defilement were
reported across the east African country in the past four months,
Kimundi said at a seminar ending Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day seminar on sexual offenses against women and
children, she also called for change in the law against abortion.
</P>
<P>
The seminar brings together judges, magistrates, lawyers and
women in the administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
During discussions, it was suggested that cases of sexual
offenses be investigated by women police officers, be heard by
women magistrates and be prosecuted by women prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge Justice Effie Owuor, who is also the
chairperson of Kenya Women Judges Association, called for the
enactment of laws governing marital rape.
</P>
<P>
Matrimonial rape ought to be criminalized, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Why should a person be hanged for robbery with violence while
those raping women and defiling children get away with lighter
sentences?" she questioned.
</P>
<P>
Police stations should be made more user-friendly and more
women officers should be trained to deal with victims of sexual
offenses, Owuor urged.

<HEADLINE> Educational Background of Rural Workers in Heilongjiang Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- As China's nine-year compulsory
education system spreads further afield, the educational
background of the labor force of northernmost Heilongjiang
Province has improved considerably in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of illiterate and semi-illiterate people in
Heilongjiang's work force has declined from 7.6 percent of the
total in 1996 to 3.7 percent now, according to an official survey
of rural people.
</P>
<P>
One of China's agricultural powerhouses, Heilongjiang has 17.29
million rural residents, almost half of the provincial population.
</P>
<P>
Some 51.5 percent of those surveyed have received junior middle
school education, up 9.2 percentage points from 1996. People with
senior middle school or higher education accounted for 10.8
percent, up slightly from two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, people with junior high school or
secondary vocational school education are mainly those in the
20-30 age group, while those with senior high school education
mainly belong to the 30-40 age group.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the relatively well-educated young people
will constitute the main force of Heilongjiang's rural workers in
the years ahead, a government official said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Children Become Animal Guardians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Grade-three primary school pupil
Yao Rong happily became the "guardian" of a cub cheetah from the
Shanghai Wildlife Park recently.
</P>
<P>
He is among the first group of young animal lovers in China's
largest manufacturing city to be given the symbolic title "animal
guardian". What he is supposed to do is to donate part of his
pocket money to the care of the animal, and serve as its keeper
for one day. He and his family can visit the Park free of charge
for one year.
</P>
<P>
"I love cheetah, since it is the best runner of the animal
world," said Yao with a smile.
</P>
<P>
"The animals are friends of human beings. I hope all school
boys and girls show concern to them," he added.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held on June 1, the International Children's
Day, in the Park in the Pudong New Area, for Yao and five other
kids to become the guardian of a cheetah, a tiger, an elephant, a
lesser panda, a red-crest crane, and a giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The story all started with a 10-year-old girl, Xie Yi, who
wrote a letter to departments concerned expressing her desire to
help rescue the south China tiger which are said to be on the
verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The letter met with a favorable response from all walks of life
in Shanghai, leading to the decision of the Park to let small
animal lovers to choose animals to attend.
</P>
<P>
By drawing lots, 36 children were chosen to be the first group
of guardians.
</P>
<P>
"We want to further arouse the awareness of animal protection
among children in Shanghai through the activity," Gu Huikang, the
general manager of the Park, said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Concerns Over Political Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The lingering concerns over
political instability are dying down in the Philippines as the
international community still kept a wary eye on neighboring
Indonesia following the forced resignation of former president
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Political stability, a major merit in the first five years of
the Ramos administration, has returned to the Philippines with the
winning presidential candidate in the May 11 elections being
proclaimed timely last week, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been haunted by the specter of political
uncertainty since early 1997 when supporters of outgoing President
Fidel Ramos launched a drive to amend the constitution to allow a
second term for him.
</P>
<P>
The concerns over possible political instability eased in late
1997 when Ramos was forced to give up the attempt to amend the
charter and vowed to hold the May 11 general elections as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
But such concerns did not fade away as many people doubted that
the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, led by Ramos, would be willing to
hand over power to the opposition if their presidential bet lost
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the elections, speculations mounted that there
could be no elections or a failure of elections because of
widely-expected massive cheating and widespread election violence.
</P>
<P>
The election jitters had sent the local currency and stock
markets tumbling for several weeks before the elections.
</P>
<P>
There were also prevailing concerns over another scenario that
the proclamation of the winning presidential candidate might be
deferred or even canceled if the popular but highly-controversial
opposition candidate, Vice President Joseph Estrada, led in the
race.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippines stood the test of the May 11 elections
which were held in an unprecedentedly peaceful and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
And the official counting of votes was conducted in a
surprisingly smooth way, leading to the timely proclamation of
Estrada as president-elect last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the May 11 polls highlighted the
country's political maturity which was achieved 12 years after the
demise of the 14-year-long dictatorship of former president
Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Both Ramos and the ruling party's presidential bet, Speaker of
the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia, should be accredited
much with the peaceful political scenario in the aftermath of the
elections, they said.
</P>
<P>
"President Ramos will bow out as one of the most admired chief
executives, having defied doomsday prophets who kept on harping on
alleged plots to perpetuate himself in power," a European diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who must step down on June 30 when his single
constitutionally-mandated six-year term expires, has done a lot in
guaranteeing peaceful, orderly and clean polls and keeping the
nation calm following the polls.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the May 11 ballots, seven major presidential
candidates signed a covenant for peaceful, orderly and clean polls
at the request of Ramos, playing a major role in stabilizing the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
After the elections, Ramos sent out a strong message against
any major chicanery in altering the election results that would
have outraged millions of poor Filipinos who have pinned their
dreams on Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Because of Ramos' gesture, De Venecia, who accused the Estrada
camp of massive cheating, said that he would not block the
proclamation of frontrunning Estrada, virtually conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Ramos' support, Congress finished the canvassing of
votes in three days and proclaimed Estrada as the winning
presidential contender last Friday, much earlier than many people
had expected, paving the way for a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, observers said that an agreement reached between
Ramos, de Venecia and Estrada on the establishment of "a
government of national unity" also contributed much to the current
peaceful situation.
</P>
<P>
Under the covenant, they agreed to forge a working coalition
between the ruling party and the Estrada-led main opposition LAMMP
(Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) party, effectively preventing
any possible confrontation between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Estrada's massive support gained in the
polls and his well-received initial cabinet line-up and political
and economic action agenda also helped the country achieve
political stability.
</P>
<P>
Estrada gained 39.8 percent support in the May 11 polls, giving
him a much broader mandate than that of Ramos who gained only 23.4
percent of votes in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In his initial list of cabinet members, Estrada appointed many
independent economists as his future cabinet men. He also promised
to adhere to Ramos-initiated economic reform policies, get rid of
graft and corruption, and lead the country out of the current
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
These moves have greatly eased concerns among the business
community which has doubted the ability of Estrada, a college
dropout, in governing the country, particularly its economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of power is now well under way in the country. A
special committee headed by Ramos' aide Aguirre was created to
facilitate the transfer. Ramos himself is busy briefing Estrada
and his incoming cabinet on the country's economic, defense and
diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The local financial markets have reacted positively to the
peaceful political climate in the country. Despite the sharp
depreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar in recent
weeks, the Philippine peso has been traded within the range of 38
to 40 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso, which had been stable for months, plunged to a low of
42 pesos to one dollar in the run-up to the May 11 elections
because of worries over political instability.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the Philippine economy, which has been
overshadowed by fears of political uncertainty since the start of
the charter-change drive in 1997, will benefit much from the
stabilizing political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sino-Thai Joint Move To Get Opium Growers To Change Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Thai drug control
experts reached an agreement recently to help Thai farmers get
away from raising opium poppies by teaching them to grow tropical
fruits.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Thai joint venture will be established to get farmers in
the northeastern part of Thailand, part of the notorious "Golden
Triangle", to grow 1,600 hectares of dahlias to produce dahlia
juice for export.
</P>
<P>
This is another move meant to help cope with the drug problem
world-wide after the two countries began cooperation a couple of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they will try to use dahlias as a substitute for
opium poppies in other parts of the Golden Triangle, if this pilot
project proves successful.
</P>
<P>
After decades of efforts, the area planted in opium poppies in
northern Thailand has gone from 20,000 hectares in the early 1960s
to less than 1,000 at present, according to Thai drug control
officials.

<HEADLINE> Plan Worked Out to Boost Thai Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- An action plan has been worked out
by Thailand's Export Development Committee to help accelerate the
country's sluggish exports, the Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Commerce Supachai Panitchpakdi, said Thursday that Thailand should
adjust its strategy and focus on new markets like the Middle East
and should lay emphasis on growing markets like the United States,
Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
The action plan came after the poor performance of Thai
exports, which showed a minus 2.4 percent growth in U.S. dollar
term during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The sluggishness was blamed mainly on the economic crisis which
has hit South Korea and Japan hard.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports to Japan in the first quarter of this year
fell 15.3 percent to 1.9 billion dollars from 2.2 billion dollars
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai exports to the United States increased by 18
percent to 2.8 billion dollars and to the European Union by 13.8
percent to 2.4 billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also decided to make a greater effort in
improving troubled industries, mainly gems and jewelry exports.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the opening of new export markets, easing
liquidity problems and enhancing the competitiveness of the
plunging industries were the three main strategies to help
accelerate exports.
</P>
<P>
He said the Commerce Ministry plans to organize a trade mission
to Japan in the second half of this year for talks with Japanese
executive-level officials to promote Thai goods and boost Thai
exports.
</P>
<P>
Similar trade delegations will also be sent to Eastern Europe
and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Project to Be Launched to Create Rural Jobs in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funding for the project, which is part of the 10 billion baht
(238 million dollar) social investment program, is expected to
come from the World Bank this July, the Nation quoted an official
from the Industry Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of the Rural Industrial Development Project
(PRID) will be implemented jointly by the government, private
sector and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
The project is distinguished in that it will create sustainable
jobs unlike other projects, such as construction of roads,
reservoirs and pathways.
</P>
<P>
Employment will continue after the project has been completed,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Industrial Promotion, the PRID
program will comprise 96 projects to create at least 3,000 jobs
that offer 3,000 to 10,000 baht (71.4 to 238 dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The plan is considered economically viable since it is
estimated that it will put 341 million baht (8.1 million dollars)
into the pockets of rural people with an investment cost of 224
million baht (5.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Companies participating in the program will have the incentive
of a loan at a low interest rate of between 6 and 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented manufacturing sectors, such as garments,
jewelry, footwear and leatherware are targeted.

<HEADLINE> Shrinking Markets Prompt Looser Labor Export Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is allowing
more businesses to export workers in a bid to revive the sluggish
labor market.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, Vietnam sent nearly
4,000 workers abroad, 800 less than the same period last year or
only 20 percent of the target set for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The severe Asian financial crisis is blamed for the sharp
drop. Japan and South Korea, the two biggest Vietnamese labor
importers, took a lot less Vietnamese workers this year because of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to boost labor export, the government is to
promulgate a new policy under which qualified businesses, apart
from those which are state-run, will be allowed to deal with labor
export.
</P>
<P>
The government will also step up its control over 53 state-run
businesses which are engaged in labor exporting.
</P>
<P>
Laos is another big Vietnamese labor market, having attracted
more than 12,000 Vietnamese workers.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese and Lao governments have agreed to revise their
labor cooperation to boost exports in order to meet the demands of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 25,000 Vietnamese are working in more than 30
countries, with 11,000 in South Korea and about 4,000 in Japan.

LANZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has been straightening out the development of its mineral
resources over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government signed contracts with a host of city
and prefecture governments for the better development of the
mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The province streamlined the structure of coal production in
Lanzhou and Baiyin and closed 24 mines to guarantee safety last
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it closed or suspended production in more than 600
mine pits after discovering 39 illegal mines, and penalized over
4.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A provincial mining bureau official said that Gansu will make
further adjustments in its mining industry, with emphasis placed
on adjusting the exploration of non-ferrous metals, coal, and gold
minerals and in major mining areas like Longnan, Baiyin, and
Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team to Review Aid Program to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will send a full team to Indonesia next week to evaluate the
continuation of its aid program following Asia Pacific Director
Hubert Neiss's visit to Jakarta last week, an IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had decided to sent a full team for talks with
Indonesian officials about preparations for the second evaluation
of the IMF aid package to the country, head of the IMF
Representative office for Indonesia Kadhim Al-Eyd, said in a press
release on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to review the state budget which has
already undergone amendments following the May 13-14 riots and the
replacement of the national leader, said Kadhim.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the IMF last April agreed to
several changes in economic indicators which are no longer
relevant to the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Both the IMF and Indonesian officials predicted Indonesia's
inflation at 47 percent and economic growth rate at minus five
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, many economic experts predicted Indonesia's inflation
could reach at least 80 percent and the economic growth rate at
minus 10 percent this year following the May 13-14 riots in
Jakarta and the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide 10 billion U.S.
dollars of the 43 billion dollar bailout fund which the agency
brokered to bail out Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has so far disbursed 4 billion dollars of the 10
billion dollars promised.
</P>
<P>
The second tranche of one billion dollars was initially
scheduled to be handed over to Indonesia on June 4, but delayed
because of the political turmoil which led to the resignation of
former president Soeharto.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- One hundred Chinese women were

environmental conservation, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) and the State

The units across the country were also given prizes yesterday
for their key role in helping carry out environmental awareness
activities.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) abducted 15 young girls
from their homes at Pesalai in the Batticaloa district, Eastern
Province of the country, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, about 20 Tigers Wednesday evening entered

The girls are between ages of 15 and 25. The armed LTTE cadres
alleged that they were being taken away for questioning about
their activities for government troops.
</P>
<P>
Some of the girls are reported to have escaped when the LTTE
cadres were confronted by the villagers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 15-year war for

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Protect Baht: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will intervene
in the foreign exchange markets and increase interest rates to
protect the baht and deter speculative attacks, central bank
governor Chatumongol Sonakul has said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank Thursday increased overnight interest rates in
the bond repurchase market by 100 basis points to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Friday quoted the governor as saying that
short-term interest rates would likely increase as well.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the baht was traded at 42.35/45 to the U.S. dollar,
compared with 42.1 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said if the baht remained around 40-45 to the U.S.
dollar, the economy would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Even so, he added, regulators would use interest rates and
intervention in the foreign exchange markets to smooth
fluctuations, selecting the most appropriate timing to maximize
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor stressed that the country's foreign
reserves, which stood at 29.5 billion dollars by the middle of
May, were sufficient to allow intervention.
</P>
<P>
Once exchange and inflation rates were stable, the central bank
would inject liquidity into the system, allowing interest rates to
ease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen complained that unaffordably high interest
rates have aggravated the liquidity problems they are confronted
with.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said consumer and wholesale inflation indices
remain high. If inflation slowed by 1-2 percentage points, it
would allow the central bank more flexibility to cut interest
rates and boost liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Thailand saw a 10.2 percent inflation rate in May. Under the
fourth letter of intent to the IMF, the country must keep the
inflation rate at 10.5 percent.

MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Russian
Federation announced Thursday that the State Bank Committee has
decided to lower the discount rate to 60 percent from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made because of the stabilized domestic
financial market, a Central Bank statement said.
</P>
<P>
In order to settle the financial crisis in late May, the bank
decided on May 27 to lift the discount rate from 50 percent to 150
percent.
</P>
<P>
Premier Sergei Kiriyenko said on Monday that the bank had made
the correct decision, but added that the rate should be lowered
when the financial market was stabilized.

<HEADLINE> Subterranean Development in 21st Century China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qihu, of the Chinese Academy
of Engineering (CAE), said that moving some department stores,
communications facilities, entertainment centers, workshops, and
warehouses below ground in China is inevitable in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qian, an academician of the CAE, explained that making better
use of underground space could take some of the pressure off the
limited amount of land in cities. When a country's per capita GNP
is above 500 U.S. dollars, it has entered an underground space
development phase and, when it goes above 1,000 U.S. dollars,
there will be a boom in underground space development, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's per-capita GNP is now exceeding the 600 U.S. dollar
mark, and in coastal regions, above 1,000 U.S. dollars, so Qian
sees a golden period in the country for subway projects.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that areas below ground should be regarded as
a kind of land resource and their development is an effective way
of guaranteeing continued development in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts, the number of China's cities is
expected to go from less than 700 at present to more than 1,000 in
the year 2010, and the urban population in the middle of the next
century will be 700 million more than it was in 1990.

Wednesday, is preparation for the UNISPACE III conference
scheduled for July 1999 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The session is attended by delegates from 61 members of COPUOS,
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Report Stable Incomes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Most urban and rural residents of
this, China's largest economic and financial center have reported
stable incomes and are satisfied with the current price levels, an
official survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
Some 60.6 percent of the survey respondents say that their
monthly income exceeds 800 yuan (about 100 US dollars). This is
11.2 percentage points higher than the comparable figure the
previous survey found three months ago.
</P>
<P>
About 20.7 percent of those surveyed say their income has
increased over the past three months, but this group is down 3.3
percentage points. The number of people who say that their
incomes have declined rose 1.9 percentage points to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 54.3 percent of the survey respondents say that their
incomes have remained almost unchanged in the past three months,
up 1.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The survey also finds that Shanghai residents are generally
satisfied with the present price levels, as 78.4 percent of those
surveyed consider that the current price levels are "acceptable and
normal".
</P>
<P>
Those who say that the current price levels are too high
account for 21.6 percent of all respondents.
</P>
<P>
On the future price trend, 67.7 percent of those
surveyed say prices will remain largely stable, up 3.1 percentage
points from the previous survey. Only 14.1 percent of the
respondents expect prices to go up rapidly, down 5.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that Shanghai residents have developed a
habit of diversifying their investments, with the first three
investment choices being savings, securities and insurance. The
group of people investing in securities show the most rapid
increase, surging 37 percentage points from three years ago, while
the rate of preference for savings declines.

<HEADLINE> China Opening Insurance Sector To Foreign Companies More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China is making an effort to open
its insurance sector more to foreign companies to have a more
mature and sounder insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has given 9 foreign-backed insurance
companies approval to do business in China. Foreign insurance
companies have 181 offices in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese insurance companies are facing greater competition and
will have to be better prepared for the market competition,
insiders say.
</P>
<P>
Poor performance by China's reinsurance market has affected the
insurance sector's development, according to Shi Jierong, deputy
general manager of the China Pacific Insurance Co., and he says
that some multinational reinsurance and brokerage companies
should be allowed to do business in China.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance companies would then have easier access to
international reinsurance at reduced costs, he adds.
</P>
<P>
The 22 Chinese and foreign insurance companies reported over
100 billion yuan in business last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that Chinese insurance companies pay little
attention to property insurance, a sector that has great potential
at a time when an increasing number of Chinese families are buying
houses and cars.

SHANGHAI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based East China
Steel Market has become the country's first institution to set up
a price index system aimed at curbing the dumping of steel
products on the market.
</P>
<P>
Eight companies have been listed as the first group of price
providers, and their prices will be regarded as references for the
clients. These firms are relatively powerful among the 300-plus

<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia must have sound
environmental policies if it is to sustain economic growth and
recovery, The Indonesian Observer Friday quoted an official of the
United Nations as saying.
</P>
<P>
The theme of Thursday's World Environment Day, "For Life on
Earth, Save our Seas", is very relevant to Indonesia given that
two-thirds of its territorial area is water, said Rajan, resident
representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In this world's largest archipelago, he said, 160 small islands
are ecologically at risk because of global warming and natural
disasters, while heavy sea traffic creates problems related to the
disposal of toxic and hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the National Institute of Sciences shows
that out of the country's 70,000 hectares of coral reefs, 41.78
percent of them have been damaged and only 6.2 percent are in
excellent condition.
</P>
<P>
Reports reveal that about 70 percent of 81,000 kilometers of
the Indonesian coastline has been damaged due to the widespread
and continuing destruction of mangroves that protect shores and
provide a breeding ground for various fish species.
</P>
<P>
Rajan said Indonesia faces a multitude of challenges including
economic recovery and political reforms, but it should be
remembered that significant environmental threats continue to
exist, compounded by the recurring El Nino phenomena, drought and
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, while providing support for recovery and reform,
UNDP will also continue to focus on the links between the economic
crisis and environmental protection," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Station Doing Celestial Research From Roof Of The World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have built the
world's highest observatory in the northern hemisphere, 4,300
meters above sea level on the Tibet Plateau at Yangbajan to do
research that is usually done by satellites and space stations.
</P>
<P>
Tan Youheng, a research fellow at the High Energy Physics
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that one
of its major objectives is to study the Milky Way and gamma
sources and gamma ray eruptions at the beginning of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will cooperate with Japan and Italy in installing a
solar neutron monitor and solar neutron telecopes at Yangbajan to
study high-energy particles in solar flares and to determine the
impact of the solar magnetic field on the earth, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is expected to be completed by the year
2002, will allow scientists at Yangbajan to make more sensitive
analyses than with the particle detectors on the Alpha space
station.
</P>
<P>
The CAS also plans to welcome cooperation from overseas
scientists in installation of six atmospheric Cerlenkov Imaging
Telescopes of 10-meter in diameter preceding 2010.
</P>
<P>
Cosmic rays come from high energy particles in outer space and
are the only material sample that man can get from the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China worked in cooperation with Japan and built a
cosmic ray observation station at Yangbajan in 1990. Tan
acknowledged that the new telescopes and the carpet observation
will make Yangbajan the only station in the world that can study a
cosmic ray in the sub-high-energy region and very-high-energy
region simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The thin atmosphere at the station gives it superior ground
observation conditions.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to invite a large number of well-known
scientists both at home and from overseas to come to conduct
exploratory researches at the station in the first decade of the
next century.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides 63-Million-U.S.-Dollar Aid to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
a credit of 63 million U.S. dollars to help Bosnia and Herzegovina
introduce key reforms in the management of its public finance.
</P>
<P>
The aid, or the public finance structural adjustment credit, is
the last of eight operations financed by the World Bank during the
current fiscal year to support the reconstruction of Bosnia's
war-ravaged economy, said the World Bank in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"This project constitutes an important milestone in the
country's post-conflict reconstruction program," said Christian
Poortman, World Bank director for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"It represents a move from reconstruction to consolidating
institution and policy reform," he added.
</P>
<P>
Good governance of public finance is a key condition for
establishing the market-driven economy which Bosnia needs to
achieve sustainable growth, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The credit for Bosnia will therefore help establish sound
public finance systems and implement reform policies at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
The project's first objective is to help the government prepare
and adopt budgets ensuring that it has adequate funding to meet
its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Other two objectives are: to help develop management capacity
in the country; and to help the authorities address the issue of
transparency and accountability in government budgetary
operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- This year's summer grain harvest is
being threatened by rains and locusts, warns today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted experts at the Central Meteorological
Observatory as saying that rain may hit the areas between the
Yellow and Yangtze rivers during the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has told farmers to cut grain as
soon as possible to the raid of rainfalls. The days around June
10 are normally the busiest time for farmers in the summer harvest.
</P>
<P>
The locust threat is very serious this year, sources at the
Ministry of Agriculture say.
</P>
<P>
Locusts will have matured by the latter part of June and will
then begin to move around. This is precisely the time when summer
grain is being dried outdoors and autumn crops are being planted.
</P>
<P>
This year, locusts are likely to ravage 800,000 ha of farmland
in nine provinces, predicted the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of China's annual grain output normally comes from
the summer harvest.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Urges NATO to Help Defuse Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO should take necessary measures to
prevent the Kosovo situation from worsening, German Foreign
Minister Claus Kinkel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Euro-Mediterranean conference of foreign
ministers in the Italian city of Palermo, Kinkel said, "We want to
avoid the transformation of Kosovo into a new Bosnia. We favor a
solution for the autonomy of the province but not separation."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group for ex-Yugoslavia will meet early next week
to discuss the Kosovo situation, Kinkel added.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said that the meeting,
to which China will be invited, could be held in London on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with 90 percent of its population being ethnic
Albanians, is a province in northern Serbia of Yugoslavia. Armed
conflicts broke out at the beginning of the year when
separatist-minded ethnic Albanians sought independence through
violence. The bloodshed has claimed hundreds of lives.

<HEADLINE> China's First Ocean Drilling In South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China will begin its ocean drilling
program next spring in the South China Sea to study climate
changes in East Asia using 30-million-year-old core samples,
according to Wang Pinxian, one of the program's co-chief
scientists.
</P>
<P>
He says it is part of the international Ocean Drilling Program
(ODP) and that China will drill six times between February 16 and
April 11.
</P>
<P>
The deep sea drilling will help scientists understand the
relations between the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and weather changes in
East Asia and may help predict future weather changes.
</P>
<P>
Wang says that one hypothesis has it that the upward movement
of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau causes an eastward movement of warm
moist air from the Indian Ocean, resulting in moist weather in the
southeastern part of China and cold and dry weather in northern
China.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is head of Tongji University's Marine Geology Lab,
says that weather changes on earth are very complicated and need
much more research.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries have participated in the ocean study
program. China joined the international Ocean Drilling Program two
months ago. The program's major contribution has been proving the
theory about the earth's plate motion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm to Launch Large-Scale Human Trials of AIDS Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A South San Francisco-based
biotechnology company will begin the world's first large-scale
trials of an AIDS vaccine this month, the Washington Post
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given the company,
VaxGen Inc., permission to test its experimental AIDS vaccine
called AIDSVAX on 5,000 American volunteers and 2,500 in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is a genetically engineered protein almost
identical to one found on the surface of the AIDS virus. In
theory, the vaccine trains white blood cells to produce antibodies
that recognize and attack the same protein, killing the virus.
</P>
<P>
An early version of the vaccine was safely tested on 1,200
humans. A new version, which is made from proteins found on two
different strains of the virus, has been tested on 120 humans, and
this is the one that will be used in the large-scale trials.
</P>
<P>
But there is a mounting consensus that antibodies alone are not
sufficient to stop the virus. A second defense system, consisting
of blood cells programmed to kill other cells infected by the
virus, may be needed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it could cost more than 30 million
U.S. dollars to conduct such a large-scale clinical trial. About
20 potential AIDS vaccines have been tested on humans, but until
now none has inspired enough confidence to attempt the costly
large-scale trials.
</P>
<P>
VaxGen was co-founded by legendary AIDS pioneer Donald Francis,
one of the first experts to recognize and alert public-health
officials to the coming AIDS epidemic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Urged to Resist Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress was urged on
Thursday by an influential business group to resist the use of
unilateral trade sanctions against foreign countries as an tool of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one U.S. laws and executive actions against 36 countries
have been adopted since 1993, the National Association of
Manufacturers (NAM) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Congress currently is considering 37 bills that
would impose unilateral economic sanctions of one form or other
against a number of countries, according to NAM.
</P>
<P>
Among those, 26 bills would specifically target 10 countries
while 11 other bills would target unlimited numbers of countries
with economic sanctions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a congressional budget report said existing
economic and trade sanctions have had little impact on the U.S.
economy, less than one billion U.S. dollars a year in lost annual
income on an economy approaching 6.6 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
NAM said that both Republicans and Democrats have equally used
sanctions for foreign policy objects.
</P>
<P>
The group argued that unilateral sanctions do not work and only
clear the way for competitors from Japan or other countries to
pick up more business.

<HEADLINE> Seles Sets Showdown with Vicario at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The three-time champion Monica Seles
stunned the world number one Martina Hingis, while two-time
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario edged fourth-seeded Lindsay
Davenport at the women's semi-finals at the French Open here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Seles, winner of 1990, 1991 and 1992 here,
controlled the situation with her powerful groundstrokes, beating
Hingis 6-3, 6-2 in just 69 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded American left-hander, playing in her first
tournament since the death of her father and coach Karolj Seles
last month, had never beaten the 17-year-old Swiss teenager in
their five previous encounters.
</P>
<P>
Seles will play Spain's Sanchez Vicario for the title on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, the 1989 and 1994 champion, earlier ousted
fourth-seeded American Davenport 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
"She surprised everyone today," Hingis said after her
defeat. "She played really well. Usually she makes more mistakes
than that, but not today."
</P>
<P>
Referring to her failure to win the title, Hingis
smiled: "Fortunately for me there's always a next year."
</P>
<P>
Hingis, beaten in last year's final by Iva Majoli of Croatia,
had been vying for the only major title that has so far eluded
her, but her loss on Thursday ended her hopes of capturing a
fourth consecutive Grand Slam title.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
European Union signed an agreement here on Thursday to cooperate
on antitrust investigation that crosses international borders.
</P>
<P>
The plan announced by the Justice Department and the Federal
Trade Commission and the EU outlines how the two sides will refer
antitrust cases to each other, avoiding duplication of costly
investigations and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Such cases take on special significance when a country wants to
sue a foreign company, which "may create political friction," said
EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert.
</P>
<P>
As an example, Van Miert noted that Europe recently decided not
to pursue a separate antitrust case against Microsoft Corp., which
the Justice Department sued May 18.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement recognizes that we are truly living in a global
economy, which makes cooperation with other governments
essential," Attorney General Janet Reno said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zheng Haixia, Most Valuable Player
when she led China to finish world runner-up four years ago in
Australia, sat on spectator stand, watching Japan playing Germany
in the second classification game of the women's world basketball
championship on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Her Chinese team had been edged by Hungary 95-93 in an overtime
before Japan hammered the host side 88-71.
</P>
<P>
The defeat means China and Haixia, who will play her second
WNBA season for the Sparkers after this dissappointing tournament,
have to settle for 11th place for the first time since the Asian
powerhouse made a world championship debut in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"It's sad," said the 2.04-meter center. "But I don't blame
anyone. We have young players in the team and I wasn't in form."
</P>
<P>
Playing just 22 minutes against Hungary, sixth place finisher
in group E of the second run, the four-time Olympian and five-time
world championship veteran scored 17 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Dongmei, also a key member of the Chinese team, hit a
game-high 29 points including 7 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
"We played a very close game against Hungary, but in the dying
minutes, they were better than us," said Ma Yuenan, head coach of
China, which trailed 40-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The score was equalled at 83-all with 35 seconds left in the
regulation time on Ma Chengqing's jump which forced an overtime.
</P>
<P>
Center Dora Kalmar-Nagy led Hungary with 20 points, followed by
forward Eva Seres in 17 points.
</P>
<P>
In the Japan-Germany game, the Japanese led all the way to take
a 48-43 halftime lead and then wrap up the victory.
</P>
<P>
Takako Kato scored 27 points for Japan and Mikilo Hagiwara
added 16. German's top scorer was Heiki Roth with 19 points and
six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Japan meets Hungary for ninth place while China takes on
Germany on Friday.

Brazil opened the game with a 31-21 run but the margin was cut

Lithuania rallied to make it 57-56 on guard Kara Wolters'
three-pointer with 8:22 to play. But the South Americans regained

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Draws "Road Map" for Iraq to Follow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, executive
chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Thursday gave a
list of priority tasks that Iraq has to fulfill in order to get
sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The list came after Butler briefed the Security Council of the
United Nations on its technical report on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. The brief began Wednesday morning and concluded
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The priority tasks, seen as a "road map" for Iraq to follow to
secure the lifting of the U.N. sanctions against it since 1990,
requires Iraq to meet, fully, its obligations to provide access to
all necessary materials, documents and information concerning the
areas of ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that if Iraq can give the highest quality of
cooperation in this regard, the UNSCOM can present the Security
Council of the United Nations a report in October that will be
quite different from the previous ones, and the UNSCOM can move
its work more faster.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM must certify all Iraq's chemical, biological weapons
and ballistic missiles have been accounted for and destroyed
before the Security Council can consider lifting sanctions that
have been in place since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who is due to visit Iraq from June 11 to 15, said he
would bring Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz a so-called
"road map" issue that Iraq must still fulfill.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Lines to Buy 27 Boeing 737 Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Korean Air Lines has agreed to
buy 27 new Boeing 737 jets at 1.35 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times, usually well-informed of Boeing's latest
developments, reported that Boeing and the airline will announce
the order next week, during South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's
state visit to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
The order would be a boost for Boeing, which said last week
weakening demand from Asia would force it to cut production of its
747 jumbo jet in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian airlines have abandoned plans to buy new aircraft or
delayed deliveries of order since the region's economic problems
began last summer.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Malaysian Airline System confirmed that it has
delayed by three years the delivery of most of the eight Boeing
777s and six 747-400s it was slated to receive this year through
2000. A day later, Taiwan's Eva Airways said it will postpone a
planned 900-million-dollar purchase of six long-range Airbus A340
aircraft and won't make any new aircraft purchases until 2000.

<HEADLINE> Germany Suspends 60 High-Speed Trains From Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's rail authorities said
Thursday that they had taken 60 high-speed trains out of service
to undergo a special inspection as a precaution after a train of
the same class derailed Wednesday and killed at least 93 people.
</P>
<P>
The move came after it has been speculated that a broken wheel
of the ill-fated ICE high-speed train may have played a role in
its derailment near the small rail station of the northern German
town of Eschede.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, investigators have found parts of
such a wheel five to six kilometers from the crash site, which
were said to be instrumental to hold the wheel onto the tracks.
Meanwhile damage have also been spotted on parts of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA reported that investigators of a
special commission are trying to find out whether the wheel parts
actually belong to the train that crashed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DPA also quoted survivors as saying that they had heard "a
rumbling noise" several minutes before the accident as well as "an
unnatural rattle" immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Horst Stuchy, president of the German Federal Railway Office
who participated in the investigations, also told the German ARD
television network that a broken wheel might had derailed one of
the 13 cars of the ICE train at a switch point 300 meters before
the crash site and led to the more serious tragedy afterwards.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed the exact cause had still to be clarified.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary to Visit Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley will take "the most unique" trade mission to the British
province of Northern Ireland Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, Daley said, "I will take what,
in some ways, may be the most unique, and in other ways, the most
important trade mission in my 16 months as secretary."
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of the Clinton administration's strategy to
promote peace in Northern Ireland, where the pro-Ireland
Christians and pro-Britain Protestants have ended a three-decade
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The trade mission to Northern Ireland and the border counties
is a strong statement by the United States government and the 17
business leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a statement of support for President Clinton's strong
commitment to the peace process and to all of the parties who are
working together to bring an end to the instability that has
occurred in Northern Ireland for so many years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley's delegation will travel to the Belfast area and to
Sligo, where they will meet with numerous governmental officials,
including Secretary of State for Northern Ireland "Mo" Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
They will meet with local business leaders and have discussions
with entrepreneurs, community leaders and also political leaders
in Northern Ireland, and also with students, business students
specifically.
</P>
<P>
"Our intent is to provide opportunities for these regional
leaders to persuade our delegation that Northern Ireland is a good
place to do business," said Daley.
</P>
<P>
"It is an opportunity for our delegates, many for the first
time, to see for themselves the potential and also the
difficulties of doing business in this part of the world," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was formed by eight Fortune 500 companies and
nine smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
An Irish peace agreement, which was signed in April, was
endorsed by voters in both Ireland and Northern Ireland last
month.

<HEADLINE> P5 FM Meeting on South Asia Successful: Tang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council (P5) at the foreign
minister level on the South Asian situation has been remarkably
successful, said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good beginning of a new process" to reduce tension in
the region triggered by India, Tang told reporters at the press
conference after the three-hour meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went
ahead with its nuclear tests. After the peace and stability in the
South Asian region was undermined, Pakistan also carried out its
own nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
During the closed-door meeting, Tang said, the foreign
ministers of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the
United States adopted a joint communique after exchanging views on
the current situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The five realized that they bear important responsibilities
towards world peace and security as the permanent members of the
Security Council, said Tang, who chaired the meeting as China is
the current rotating coordinator of the P5.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that what has been achieved
at the meeting shows that the P5 are determined to reduce the
tension in South Asia and defend the international
non-proliferation regime through concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the international community, with international
peace and security facing a severe challenge, should take a common
stand to urge India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear testing
immediately, to abandon their plans of nuclear weaponization and
to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the
Non-Proliferation Treaty unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and clear message should be given to all countries in
the world that in today's world, any country which attempts to
seek political and military gains by going nuclear will have
nothing to gain but everying to lose," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace and security in the South Asian region is
now in grave danger.
</P>
<P>
"The pressing step to the reduction of the tension is for India
and Pakistan to exercise reason and restraint, to resume dialogue
immediately and to look for ways to improve their relations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the cold war has been over for years, there is
no other sensible alternative but to settle differences between
states including border disputes by peaceful means, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that all at the meeting are satisfied with what
China, as the current coordinator, has done for the success of the
meeting with support and assistance from the other four.
</P>
<P>
In a world situation changing day by day, Tang said, China will
continue to make its contributions to the protection of peace and
the promotion of development in accordance with its long-standing
peaceful and independent diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Study: Blacks More Likely to Get Death Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Studies found that nearly all
the decision-makers in capital punishment cases in the United
States are white and blacks are far more likely to get a death
sentence than others convicted of similar crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Death Penalty Information Center released a report by
Jeffrey Pokorak of St. Mary's University School of Law in Texas,
which found that in the 38 states that permit death sentences, 98
percent of district attorneys are white. One percent each are
black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
A two-year study of Perican Bar Association and the United
Nations have found that black jurors have been unfairly barred
from serving on juries in capital cases and that the victims in
the cases are almost always white.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Establish Diplomatic Ties With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will establish
diplomatic relations with Sierra Leone, South African Foreign
Affairs Department said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday met with
his Sierra Leonean counterpart, Shama Banya, in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, during the Organization of African Unity
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The department said the decision came after the reinstallation
of the democratically-elected government of S. Leonean President Ahmed
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Nzo assured Sierra Leone's government that South Africa, as
one of the first countries to have condemned the take-over by the
illegal military junta in May last year, will steadfastly
support the government of President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"Let it be a signal to others that Africa will continue to
reject the illegal seizure of power from governments who have
been democratically elected," Nzo said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that South Africa will establish diplomatic
relations with Sierra Leone as soon as the necessary formalities
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Nzo committed South Africa to providing some form of
humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone once the
government there gave him an assessment of its immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we, as a fellow African country,
demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Sierra Leone in a
tangible and meaningful way."
</P>
<P>
Nzo also invited Banya to visit South Africa at a mutually
convenient date.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq May Still Have Biological Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq may still have
biological weapons and nerve gas, Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks after the Security Council of the
United Nations was given a technical briefing on Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction by Richard Butler, executive chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)in charge of destroying
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Richardson said the briefing by the
UNSCOM showed that "1, biological weapons may be in Iraq today. 2,
VX nerve agent weapons may be in Iraq today. 3, Iraq continues to
play hide-seek with UNSCOM. 4, Iraq is still hiding the documents
that would explain these weapons programs fully."
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter whether he still thought Iraq represents a
threat to neighboring countries, Richardson said, "We believe that
Iraq still represents a threat to its neighbors and this is why it
should be contained. And one way it can get out of this morass
that itself has created is to comply with fully with UNSCOM and UN
Security Council resolutions on weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Wednesday that Iraq has a lot of progress
to make to get the sanctions lifted.

UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Negative environmental
trends exist in some countries due to increasing human activities,
according to a report by the Washington-based World Resources
Institute.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on World Resources 1998-1999 released here

in much of the world. It gave the following details:
</P>
<P>
One third of the world's population already lives in countries
experiencing water stress;
</P>
<P>
An estimated 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are at risk
with Southeast Asia seeing over 80 percent of reefs at risk;
</P>
<P>
The world has lost nearly half of its original forests and
threats continue in the Brazilian Amazon where deforestation rates
reached a new high; and
</P>
<P>
Excessive use of fertilizers and fossil fuels is contributing
to a global glut of nitrogen with nutrient overload threatening
both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
