<HEADLINE> DPRK Works Hard for Agricultural Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has been working hard to ensure a good harvest
this year and prevent a repetition of last year's agricultural
disaster caused by unprecedented flooding.
</P>
<P>
Rice and maize, two of the country's main crops, are growing
well in many parts of the country after a busy spring planting
season, the government said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK suffered huge losses due to flooding last July and
August, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated 15 billion
U.S. dollars of damage.
</P>
<P>
The floods caused by torrential rain affected more than 5.2
million people in 12 provinces across the country, and destroyed
many homes, schools, hospitals, factories, dams, bridges, roads
railways and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK government has
attached great importance to farm production, directing
agricultural authorities to improve soil quality and ensure
adequate provision of machinery and fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Major Outflanked by Rival Ulster Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), warned today that his party's member of
parliament would vote against the British government if Prime
Minister John Major made concessions to the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and its political wing Sinn Fein over disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the largest Protestant party in Northern Ireland
in a statement claimed that "any backsliding by the prime minister
on the twin issues of the cease-fire and decommissioning would be
regarded as a fundamental breach of faith," according to reports
from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, his party would confirm that the government
was no longer acting in the best interests of the United Kingdom
as a whole, and Northern Ireland in particular.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, Trimble threatened that he would
recommend the UUP's members of parliament without hesitation to
oppose the government.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's threat carries weight as the UUP enjoys nine seats in
the House of Commons where Major has a mere one-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he wanted the government to agree to get the IRA
to surrender its arms at all-party talks on the future of Ulster
on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams accused Major of
ignoring Sinn Fein's "olive branch" of a commitment to peace and
refusing to confirm that if the IRA declared its new truce, that
would secure his seat at peace talks.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to launch Sinn Fein's manifesto for
elections on May 30, Adams complained that "it is disappointing
that there has been a predictably negative response from Downing
Street and Unionists" to his commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
But he also refused to say whether the IRA would revive its
shattered truce, a condition demanded by Britain, Ireland and the
United states for Sinn Fein to take part in the planned all-party
talks process on June 10.
</P>
<P>
He told Irish radio that he was "sick, sore and tired" of being
asked the question because "we are not the IRA."
</P>
<P>
Major instantly refuted Adams in parliament, saying that Sinn
Fein and the IRA were "both sides of the same coin."
</P>
<P>
He repeated the government's position that Sinn Fein could not
be admitted to all-party talks unless the IRA restored its
cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> LSE Plans to Cut Spending by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is
working on plans to cut costs by 20 percent and axe at least 300
jobs to cope with its loss of income from share settlement when
its automated system starts operating.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that 250 of the jobs are to
be lost as a direct result of the introduction of the new trading
system, which will be completed next spring.
</P>
<P>
The board of the exchange will discuss measures this week to
reduce last year's operating costs of 175 million pounds (263
million U.S. dollars) by about 35 million pounds (53 million
dollars), which is likely to lead to additional large job cuts.
</P>
<P>
The LSE has already reduced its staff to about 940 from a peak
of 2,800 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Other cost cutting could include reducing its annual
contributions to charity from the current 100,000 pounds (150,000
dollars), and consolidating staff among its buildings in the City.
</P>
<P>
According to the LSE, its staff costs are at their lowest level
in absolute terms since 1985, and are only 25 percent of total
costs. This ratio compares with 45 percent for the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Detailed plans for cuts will be considered by the board in
July. However, at its monthly meeting this Thursday, it is due to
approve figures showing that more than 10 million pounds (15
million dollars) has already been cut from annual costs in this
financial year.

Zemin said here today that China will work together with African
countries to open new chapters of Sino-African friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here this afternoon on the last leg of his
six-nation tour in Africa, made the remarks at the banquet hosted
by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he has seen with his own eyes the untiring efforts
the African countries and peoples have made in maintaining their
political stability and economic growth and the achievements they
have scored.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the African peoples who have won their
independence and liberation can surely accomplish the development

</P>
<P>
As a country with significant influence in Africa, Jiang added,
Zimbabwe is playing an active and constructive role in African and
even global affairs.

Through the concerted efforts, Jiang said, the friendly
relations and cooperation in various fields between China and
Zimbabwe will reach a new high.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Major Party Protests President's Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Awami (People's) League (AL), the
former largest opposition party in Bangladesh, held a protest
rally here today, denouncing the president's latest move against
senior army officers.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry under President Abdur Rahman Biswas Monday
ordered forced retirement of Chief of Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim for
"disobeying the government order and acting in a blatantly
insolent manner which is tantamount to rebellion against the
government."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two other senior army officers were also given forced
retirement.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally today, AL leader Sheikh Hasina accused the
president of actually pushing the country towards a bloody
confrontation in exercising his power with the Defense Ministry
within his fold.
</P>
<P>
She charged the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) for working behind the scene and devising ways to destroy
the country's democracy, elections and the people's rights of
franchise.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said the situation now speaks of two governments in
Bangladesh which is "totally impossible."
</P>
<P>
She urged the people to forge greater unity against the BNP and
stand prepared to "make any sacrifice" to resist "this anti-people
force" to pave the way for free and fair elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the BNP brought out a huge procession,
congratulating "the patriotic members of the army on thwarting the
conspiracy of a particular quarter to disrupt the democratic
process and the coming June 12 elections."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Dhaka that was made tense by Nasim's forced
retirement last night has been brought under control after Nasim
and other two senior army officers were placed under house
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Develop Towns Around Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A newly formed high-level council
in Nepal has decided to develop small towns around Kathmandu to
relieve the increasing pressure of the growing population and
unplanned urbanization in the capital city, a press release of the
council said today.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Valley Development Council, chaired by Prime
Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba with more than 20 ministers on it, is working
to formulate a concrete policy for planned development of the
capital area by involving all concerned sectors.
</P>
<P>
The council, set up last week, has drawn up a working policy to
prepare and enforce an extensive plan for decentralization and
transfer of administrative, industrial and educational
institutions in the Kathmandu area.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the government would develop small towns around
Kathmandu by selecting suitable and potential villages and improve
infrastructure facilities of the existing towns in the area.
</P>
<P>
Other plans of the council include conducting housing projects
with the participation of the private sector, implementing new
public transport systems and discouraging the entry into downtown
Kathmandu of pollution-generating vehicles, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
The council also plans to carry out programs to preserve the
country's ancient monasteries and temples with historical,
cultural and tourism values with a view to developing Kathmandu
into a cultural and tourist center, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Grachev Vows to Carry out Yeltsin's Military Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev said today that the fundamental reform of the army
launched in two decrees by President Boris Yeltsin last week would
be carried out, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry held a meeting Sunday to discuss
implementation of the decrees, said Grachev, who is on an
inspection tour in the Kurgan region in southwest Russia.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, in a move designed to be a vote-puller in the
forthcoming presidential election, Yeltsin issued a decree
abolishing the unpopular compulsory military service by 2000 and
switching national defense to an all-professional army.
</P>
<P>
The other decree states that only volunteers signing relevant
contracts are eligible to participate in military operations.
</P>
<P>
But many top military officers, including Grachev himself,
have in the past opposed the creation of a professional army,
saying that Russia could not pay for it.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's decrees have aroused strong protest from some
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe Yeltsin's reforms are an attempt to win
votes in the forthcoming presidential election. Conscription has
long been unpopular among potential conscripts and many parents
who have seen young men fighting and dying in Afghanistan and in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
It is also being seen as an offensive against Yeltsin's
strongest rival in the June election, communist Gennady Zyuganov,
who has accused the president of neglecting the army and
destroying Russia's military might.
</P>
<P>
All the major presidential candidates have put forward their
own military programs during the increasingly heated election
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Extension of MFN for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Monday that he had decided to extend unconditionally
Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trading status for China for another
year.
</P>
<P>
Describing the renewal of MFN as "a vote for America's
interests," and "not a referendum on all China's policies," he
said that he would work with the Republican-controlled Congress in
the weeks ahead to secure its approval.
</P>
<P>
"Revoking MFN and, in effect, severing our economic ties to
China, would drive us back into a period of mutual isolation and
recrimination that would harm America's interests, not advance
them," he told the Pacific Basin Economic Council which began its
29th International General Meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision on China's MFN, he noted that China is
the fastest growing market for American exports and American
interests "are directly at stake in promoting a secure, stable,
open and prosperous China."
</P>
<P>
"Our engagement policy means using the best tools we have,
incentives and disincentives alike, to advance core American
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the differences between the two countries, Clinton
stated that "when we disagree with China, we will continue to
defend our interests and to assert our values. But by engaging
China, we have achieved important benefits for our people and the
rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement followed on the heels of an earlier one
last week in which the Clinton administration threatened China
with the largest trade sanctions package in U.S. history. Some
calls this an attempt by Clinton to steer "a balanced course" in
his China policy. Others contend that Clinton's action was a
response to Senator Bob Dole, his leading presidential challenger
this year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech earlier this month, Dole, while declaring his
support for MFN renewal, attacked the administration for sending
conflicting messages and criticized Clinton's "conspicuous
absence" from the debate on this issue.
</P>
<P>
After Clinton formally notifies Congress, lawmakers in both
houses have 60 days to vote on MFN extension. If they choose to
reject it, the president can veto their rejection. A tough fight
is expected on the Capitol Hill, but opponents are unlikely to
muster enough votes to revoke MFN.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prosecution Demands 7-Year Sentence for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution today
demanded a seven-year prison term and 900,000 U.S.-dollar fine for a
former top aide to President Kim Young-sam accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hak-ro, President Kim's former secretary, was arrested in
March this year after allegations of bribery came to light.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also demanded a two-year and one-and-half-year
term for Chang's live-in girlfriend Kim Mi-ja and her brother Kim
Ui-ryung respectively on charges of illegal land acquisition
registration.
</P>
<P>
In the final hearing in the Seoul District Court here today,
Chang pleaded guilty and apologized for not having been a clean
and honest civil servant.
</P>
<P>
Chang has been charged with receiving 900,000 dollars from 17
domestic firms while serving as President Kim's aide, while Kim
Mi-ja and her brother were accused of buying land with Chang's
money and registering the land under false names to help Chang
conceal his illegally-amassed wealth.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to President Kim in 1977 and was his
"steward" for nearly 20 years. When Kim became president in February
1993, Chang was named presidential secretary in charge of Kim's
personal matters.
</P>
<P>
The president, who apologized to the nation after Chang was
arrested, has called for a heavy penalty in accordance with law.

PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian officials
discussed today with their Cambodian hosts about the feasibility
of building a Trans-Asia rail link.
</P>

The officials, led by Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong
Sik, arrived here yesterday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Trans-Asia rail link, proposed for the first time in the

Thailand and the three-nation Indochina.
</P>
<P>
The initiative regained momentum recently as countries in the
region, including Malaysia and Cambodia, have determined to push
forward their economic cooperation.
</P>

Today's talks, according to a senior Cambodian official, was a
follow-up to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
summit meeting in Bangkok on December 14-15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, seven ASEAN nations decided to cooperate on
developing the Mekong Basin in order to expedite the economic
development of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

During the meeting this morning, Malaysian and Cambodian
officials also discussed how to enhance bilateral cooperation,

<HEADLINE> Britain Threatens to Disrupt EU Business Over Beef Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major has
threatened to disrupt normal European Union (EU) business unless
rapid progress is made on lifting the global ban on British beef
product exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament this afternoon, Major said that Britain
would "not be able to agree on any matter of unanimity" of the EU
if the European Commission remained opposed to any relaxation of
the eight-week-ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Major made it clear that progress on the EU Inter-Governmental
Conference to reform the EU's institutions would not be possible
until a ban on British beef by-products had been lifted and a
clear framework was in place leading to a total lifting of the EU
ban.
</P>
<P>
"I say this with great reluctance. But the European Union
operates through goodwill. If we do not benefit from goodwill from
partners, clearly we cannot reciprocate," Major said.
</P>
<P>
On the EU summit due to be held in Florence, Italy, next month,
the British prime minister stressed that the EU summit "could not
proceed with our normal cooperation unless it faced up to the
crisis of confidence not only affecting consumers, but also
governments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Major said that the British government would start
legal action against the EU if a partial lifting of the ban was
not agreed by later this week.
</P>
<P>
EU veterinary experts from 15 of its member states rejected an
EU proposal to lift the ban on exports of British gelatin, tallow
and other beef by-products at a meeting in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries -- Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- constituted a blocking minority
at the EU standing Veterinary Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef exports on
March 27 after the British government admitted that there was a
possible link between the BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfelft-Jacob Disease.

A decision on whether to restart the reactor called "Unit 1"
will be taken on by the main designer and Bulgarian and EU experts.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, if the tests show that the safety of the
reactor needs to be improved, the necessary work will be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
With six nuclear reactors, the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant
generates nearly half of Bulgaria's electricity.
</P>
<P>
The EC is providing Bulgaria with aid worth 10 million ECU
(some 13 million U.S. dollars), to develop alternative sources of
electricity generation to enable the permanent closure of Kozloduy
Units 1-4.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is also providing financial support for the
tests.
</P>
<P>
The program is being funded by Phare, the EU's program which
supports economic transition in central and eastern Europe and
helps "associated" countries prepare for EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Party to Strengthen Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Funcinpec, the largest in the
nation's two-party coalition, is to reorganize in a bid to shore
up its strength, the Cambodia Daily newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Loy Sim Chheag, general secretary of Funcinpec, the Party of
the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful
and Cooperative Cambodia, said the party's steering committee
discussed the shake-up at a meeting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of work to do and we want to separate the
functions of our leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some observers say the reorganization signals a period of
serious self-examination within the party.
</P>
<P>
"Funinpec exhibits clear weakness," said one observer, and
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, president of the party
since its founding in 1992, is aware of it.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Yahya, a Funinpec delegate in the National Assembly, on
Monday echoed the need for a strengthened Funcinpec "in order to
(help the party) survive."
</P>
<P>
"We have to be well organized and disciplined...otherwise our
party is nothing," he warned.

<HEADLINE> World On Brink of Infectious Disease Crisis: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Infectious diseases, such as cholera
and malaria, are making a comeback, threatening a global health
crisis, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned today.
</P>
<P>
These diseases were widely thought to have been conquered, but
as vigilance has relaxed, new drug-resistant strains have
developed.
</P>
<P>
"We are standing on the brink of a global crisis in infectious
diseases," said Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
As many as 17 million people died last year from infectious
diseases, many of which have no treatment, cure or vaccine, the
WHO said at the launch of its World Health Report 1996.
</P>
<P>
New and highly infectious diseases such as Aids, which is still
incurable, are posing threats while antibiotics are losing their
effectiveness as resistant strains of bacteria develop.
</P>
<P>
Although many of these diseases are concentrated in developing
countries, industrialized countries such as Britain cannot be
complacent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The growth of international travel and population movements
mean that diseases can spread between continents within hours, the
report notes.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic: Dayton Agreement Must Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Vice-President
Biljana Plavsic said today that the Dayton peace agreement must be
honored as the Serb parliament has accepted it as a document.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament deputies were "aware of the significance of
the agreement and respected it," and it would be the basis of
their future activities, said Plavsic, who has just assumed most
of the duties of the Serb president.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is invaluable to us and we must not give it up
easily," the Tanjug news agency quoted the Serb leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
But she noted that the Serb leadership could not accept
anybody's attempt to implement the peace agreement at the cost of
the Serb people, or to change its elements to the detriment of any
side in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, who is believed to be a hardliner and close ally of
President Radovan Karadzic, said that after the prime minister was
reappointed, she was entrusted to contact with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to promote Republika Srpska in keeping with
the peace agreement and with decisions of the Serb parliament,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Lasting Political Settlement in Afghanistan Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A lasting political settlement in
Afghanistan was possible, said the UN special envoy to
Afghanistan, Mehmud Mestiri, today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in Pakistan's southern port city of
Karachi, the UN envoy said, "despite all obstacles and
difficulties, we should work hard together to achieve it,"
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Afghanistan is relatively calm at the
moment, tension continues to be high around Kabul which is under
siege of the Taliban, who regained their positions on the
outskirts of Kabul last October.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri said that the UN special mission is pursuing the goal
of forging an intra-Afghan dialogue among the major warring
leaders to establish an interim and transitional council for the
transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
The mission hopes to demilitarize Kabul to ensure smooth
functioning of the transitional authority and to form a national
and neutral security force, which could eventually serve as the
nucleus of a national army.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal is difficult to reach because of distrust
among the factional leaders, foreign interference and the
inadequate resources and logistical support for the UN special
mission.
</P>
<P>
Despite these formidable obstacles, he said the special mission
should press on with the goal of seeking genuine peace in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Japan Develops TV Sets Capable of Accessing Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese home electrical appliance
makers are scrambling to develop television technologies that
allow users to access the Internet on their TV screens,
Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although users can watch television programs on their personal
computers (PCs), home applicance makers feel it is high time to
develop "Internet television sets," Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Such sets could make their debut by the end of this year, the
news service quoted Japanese industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The makers are trying to develop remote control units that
enable users to access Internet home pages easily on TV screens,
so that would-be personal computer buyers will not be scared away
by complicated operating procedures, they said.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. is seeking to develop what it calls
"intelligent television" sets equipped with PC capabilities, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
The company is considering marketing a range of products of
various grades, from a high-end television capable of playing
CD-ROMs to a low-end model which only allows users to retrieve
Internet home pages.
</P>
<P>
Victor Co. of Japan said it is trying to meet the technical
challenge of allowing users to easily access gateways to the
Internet by means of telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Toshiba Corp., Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. said
they are also developing Internet television technologies, Kyodo
added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, China Seek Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
said the maintenance and development of friendly cooperative
relations between South Korea and China are not only beneficial to
the two countries, but also to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the visiting Chinese Supreme People's Court
delegation led by Ren Jianxin today, Kim also said economic and
trade cooperation between two countries has been developing
rapidly since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume is expected to reach 20 billion
U.S. dollars this year and will further increase in the future.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between the court and judicial
departments of South Korea and China will further enhance
relations between the two countries, the South Korean president
added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ren, president of the Chinese Supreme People's
Court, said that Kim's 1994 visit to China and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's 1995 visit to South Korea have pushed Beijing-Seoul
relations to a mature stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of his delegation's visit is to promote the
cooperation and friendship between the court and judicial
departments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ren met with his South Korean counterpart Yun Kwan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to embark on cooperation on the basis of
the principle of mutual respect, expansion of exchange,
enhancement of cooperation and promotion of development.
</P>

The 10-member Chinese delegation arrived here Monday for a
week-long visit at the invitation of Yun.

<HEADLINE> US Budget Deficit Expected to Decline in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. budget deficit in
fiscal 1996 is expected to decline as the government took in about
25 billion dollars more than expected in tax receipt last month,
U.S. government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the deficit will likely be cut to a range
of 125 billion dollars to 130 billion because of the revenue
windfall, The Washington Post reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which had projected in its budget
plan of fiscal 1996 that the deficit would be 140 billion dollars,
has not officially altered the projection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, June O'Neil, director of the U.S. Congressional
Budget Office (CBO), said Monday that her agency had lowered its
estimate for the fiscal 1996 deficit by 15 billion dollars to 130
billion. That will be well below fiscal 1995's deficit of 163.9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CBO did not lower its deficit estimate by the full 25
billion in unexpected tax receipt because about 10 billion of the
jump may have been quirks in the calendar.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the budget deficit means the U.S. government will
borrow less money in the coming months than it had anticipated and
the less borrowing could lead to a lower interest rate, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. budget deficit peaked at 290.4 billion dollars in
fiscal 1992. The CBO now agrees that the budget deficit will be
cut by half before the end of Clinton's first term of presidency.
</P>
<P>
If the deficit is no higher than 125 billion dollars this year,
that will be the smallest since 1982 when it was 79 billion. A
125-billion-dollar deficit would equal 1.7 percent of the gross
domestic product in the country.

<HEADLINE> Drought Threatens Fruit, Vegetable Supplies in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The cold spring weather and drought
are threatening supplies of home-grown vegetables and fruit in
Britain this summer, leading to high prices in the shops, said
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Many vegetable crops are already four or five weeks behind in
their development because of the cold spring.
</P>
<P>
According to the Institute of Hydrology, rainfall for the
13-month period from April 1995 to April 1996 was the fifth lowest
in 228 years of records. Water levels are still below normal in
many reservoirs across England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Agency said that farmers faced possible
restrictions on their use of water for irrigation from boreholes
and rivers.
</P>
<P>
Field crops from cauliflowers to potatoes, lettuces, onions and
soft fruit could all be hit by a shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
Tesco, the biggest supermarket group in Britain, said crops of
vegetables such as cauliflower and calabrese could suffer losses
worse than last summer's 30 percent fall in output.
</P>
<P>
"If it stays as dry through June and July, it will be at least
as bad," said Steven Rudge, Tesco's vegetable technology manager.
</P>
<P>
Prices for summer vegetables last year were 20 percent to 30
percent higher than average. Rudge said that it is unlikely to see
any deflation, and if anything, prices are likely to be moving
upwards.
</P>
<P>
Rudge said Tesco might turn to the Netherlands for limited
extra supplies of fruit and vegetables in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Modern Agriculture in Europe Harms Water Resources: UN/ECE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) said today that modern agriculture,
in which irrigation plays a key role, has led to depletion of water
resources and lowered water quality in many countries.
</P>
<P>
As results of irrigation policy for promoting farm production,
demand of water increased, groundwater resources declined and
droughts became more frequent, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, it said, irrigation accounts for 13 percent of all
water abstractions in France, 30 percent in Denmark, 57 percent in
Italy and 64 percent in Spain.
</P>
<P>
It said that Southern Europe posts the highest share of
irrigated land, namely 40 percent, up from 15 percent in the
mid-1960s. During the last 30 years, percentage of irrigated land
rose from 5 to 10 percent in Eastern Europe and from 10 to 25
percent in the western part.
</P>
<P>
The share remained low in the North, which is under 10 percent
currently.
</P>
<P>
Among the irrigation impacts is also the soil salinization, said
the UN/ECE. In Romania, for example, an estimated 200,000 hectares of
a total of 3.2 million hectares of irrigated land have become saline.
</P>
<P>
Intensifying farm production meanwhile undermines the quality of
water, implying that many water resources become unsuitable for
drinking, according to the Commission, which listed the intensive use
of fertilizers and pesticides among main causes.
</P>
<P>
It said in certain areas of Europe, agriculture is blamed for up to
80 percent of nitrogen load of waters, because 10 to 60 percent of
nitrogen fertilizers used ends up in groundwater, and that its use in
Europe grew by 75 percent during the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In France, its consumption rose by 78 percent from 1.4 million
tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes, the Commission added.
</P>
<P>
Roughly between 2 percent and 4 percent of the used pesticides
ends up in groundwater and surface water. In the worst cases, over
10 percent of the applied amount is found in the run-off water.
</P>
<P>
In countries such as Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States,
pesticide residues have been found in samples of groundwater and
surface water in quantities exceeding drinking-water standards, the
Commission pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Besides, inappropriate storage of livestock excreta, now handled as
slurry rather than straw manure, has left increasing amount of animal
manure into waters.
</P>
<P>
UN/ECE said in some regions of Europe, manure contributes to 20 to
40 percent of the phosphorus load of surface waters. This has led to
the eutrophication of inland waters in some parts of Europe with
severe impacts on aquatic life.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Kills 9 in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were killed
and about 45 injured when a powerful blast rocked a busy central
market in the southern part of the Indian capital this evening,
the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Kashmiri military outfits -- Jammu and Kashmir Islamic
Front and Llashkar-e-Sajjad -- claimed responsibility for the
blast, saying "they wanted to thwart the government's efforts to
hold (general) elections in (India-held) Kashmir and avenge the
killings in the valley."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has expressed
shock over the incident and Home Minister M.M. Joshi visited the
site as well as the hospitals where the injured have been
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Police said the blast was suspected to have been caused by an
explosive device kept inside a van without a number plate which
was parked outside some buildings at the heart of the central
market.
</P>
<P>
Today's blast is the second in the Indian capital since April
20 when an explosion brought down a low-budget hotel in central
Delhi, killing 17 persons.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Possible Change in Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Finance Ministry today
denied rumors aired by some currency dealers which said that the
Iraqi government might change its currency of Iraqi dinar.
</P>
<P>
A ministry source was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that those who spread the rumors could not stand the happiness of
the Iraqi people due to the success of the oil-for-food agreement
signed between Iraq and the U.N. in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi dinar jumped to 300 for one U.S. dollar on Monday
evening soon after the official announcement of the signing of an
understanding memorandum on Iraq's partial oil sale. The trading
price between U.S. dollar and Iraqi dinar in the black market
stood at 750 just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq agrees to enter negotiations with the U.N. for a
partial oil sale in exchange for badly needed food and medicine in
February, the Iraqi dinar has been up and down with the latest
development of the Iraq-U.N. talks.
</P>
<P>
The currency has become the most unstable at the local
market. Observers here said that the Iraqi dinar is not strong
enough currently to stand at such a low level due to the
deteriorating economic situation result from the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of the partial oil sale agreement with
U.N. Iraq can get little from the oil sale to buy humanitarian
supplies. Iraq has a long way to go to revive its war devastated
economy even the sanctions are totally lifted, said the
observers.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement would allow Iraq to sell oil for the
first time since international sanctions were imposed following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.N. would allow Iraq to sell
one-billion-dollar worth of oil every 90 days to buy food and
medicine so as to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Crackdown on Islamic Militants Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces today
arrested 19 suspects of the Islamic militants in the West bank,
reported Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
The action was carried out in villages around some Palestinian
self-ruled towns including Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown closely followed last week's arrest of Hassan
Salame, one of top leaders of the armed wing of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Security sources say that Salame had been interrogated by
agents of the General Security Service (GSS) in the Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Salame revealed information leading
to today's arrests.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is also part of Israel's efforts to rein in
Islamic fundamentalist groups before the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak told the cabinet Sunday
that the Islamic organizations were planning a string of violent
attacks aimed at killing a large number of Israelis, if possible
before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said there are other Hamas members who are
able to fill Salame's place and direct terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Arab Diplomats Perturbed by Crime in Johannesburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab diplomats here said
today the weekend attack on the Lebanese embassy in Johannesburg
was the second in ten days and that the South African
government's lack of security for diplomats "perturbed" them.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Lebanon's interim ambassador Charbel Stephan
was handcuffed and roughed up by thugs at his residence in
Johannesburg. They stole about 10,000 Rands (about 2500 U.S.
Dollars) and goods.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, robbers broke into the Lebanese embassy and stole
50,000 Rands worth of goods, including computer printers,
cameras, television sets and radios. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Arab Ambassadors is gravely perturbed and
concerned at the increased escalation of crime perpetrated
against the Arab diplomatic community, and a lack of any actual
tangible measures taken to protect diplomats and punish
criminals," the council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, the
council said, host countries are required to provide security at
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has said it has insufficient
manpower to protect individual diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad has appealed to the
Lebanese envoy not to leave South Africa. After the attack, the
envoy said he was going back to Beirut because he "felt safer" in
the war-torn capital of his home country than in Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister: Oil Prices Not to be Affected by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to the oil-for-food
deal between the U.N. and Iraq, Kuwait's Oil Minister Abdel Mohsen
said here today that Iraq's partial return to the world oil market
would not undermine the stability of prices so long as OPEC
maintains its production ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen was speaking at a press conference following a
parliament's session on the deal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Iraq on Monday signed an agreement
enabling Baghdad to resume oil exports for the first time in
almost six years to buy much-needed food and medicine for
sanctions-hit Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Iraq to sell 2 billions U.S. dollars
worth of oil over a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Iraq can export 700,000 barrels
of oil per day at the present rate.
</P>
<P>
The production of OPEC countries totaled 24.80 million barrels
per day in April, comparing with that of 24.67 million barrels per
day in last march, according to an OPEC monthly statistical report
issued on May 18.
</P>
<P>
The report expected the total world demand for this year would
reach 68.95 million barrels per day with an increase of 70,000
barrels per day.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Frederick Inderfurth, special envoy
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, arrived here today to meet with
leaders of the warring sides in a bid to promote the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the airport, Inderfurth said the international
community hoped the peace process in Angola would be sped up and
that the Lusaka peace agreement could be implemented
successfully.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has prolonged the length of its
investigation team in Angola to bring pressure on the two sides
so that they would carry out their promises, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Angolans could achieve lasting peace before the
U.N. peacekeepers leave, as they cannot remain in the country
forever.
</P>
<P>
He said during his stay here, he will meet with leaders of
both sides and exchange views on the problems facing the peace
process. This includes the assembly of the UNITA troops and the
handing over of their weapons, the return of government troops to
the barracks, the amassing of the rapid intervention police units
and the formation of the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth said it is only a step away from the lasting peace
and that this depends on the measures taken by the two sides in
the coming months.

<HEADLINE> UNCC Expects to Start Payment to Gulf War Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Compensation
Commission (UNCC) said today that it will start payment of
individual claims arising from the Gulf War two months after
receiving its first allocation from proceeds of Iraq's oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
UNCC Executive Secretary Carlos Alzamora told a press briefing
that the UNCC hopes the operation will be able to start as early
as in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The first installment expected will include 134 million U.S.
dollars for 50,000 claimants from 71 countries, mostly foreign
workers and the poor, of Category A -- departure from Iraq and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It will also cover 3,000 claims totaling 7 million dollars of
Category C -- individual losses up to 100,000 dollars, said
Alzamora at the briefing, which followed the signing Monday of a
U.N.-Iraqi memorandum on a Security Council resolution on lifting
the embargo on the oil export of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC would be able to receive around 100 million dollars a
month, or 30 percent of proceeds of Iraq's oil exports, under the
U.N. resolution in April last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Alzamora, before 1996, the UNCC also expects to
pay 2,500 dollars initially for every claimant.
</P>
<P>
According to Alzamora, five months after the first installment
will come the second installment of Category A, covering 163,000
claims from 70 countries, with a value of 406 million dollars, and
it will be followed by the second of Category C, paying 155
million dollars for 62,000 claimants from 68 countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far since the founding of the commission over
five years ago, claims in Category B -- death and serious injury,
some 6,000 claims worth 13.5 million dollars, have been paid off,
of a total of 2.6 million claims filed with an asserted value of
over 190 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On average, according to him, 80 percent of the asserted value
claimed in each case can be rewarded after assessment.
</P>
<P>
Claims so far resolved totaled 2.1 million, he added, and the
figure is expected to reach 2.4 million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Alzamora said payment of category D, E, F, respectively for
individual losses above 100,000 dollars, corporate and government
losses, will start in next July.
</P>
<P>
When will the whole payment work be fulfilled cannot be
foreseen, said the UNCC official, adding that only processing
claims in Category D, E, F, which is more difficult and complex,
will take not less than five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said a final resolution of payment of costs
claimed by companies for extinguishing oilfield fires can be
expected by the end of this year.

the isles.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's civilian
government of President Ahmad Kabbah has closed its consular
mission in Hong Kong ''with immediate effect'', Information and
Broadcasting Minister George Banda Thomas said this evening.
</P>
<P>
Banda Thomas said during a press briefing that when Hong Kong
is handed over to China in 1997, the Sierra Leonean ambassador in
Beijing will take over responsibility for the mission.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the decision to close the mission
was due to what he claimed was a ''gross misuse'' of the Hong
Kong Immigration Investment Program (HKIIP) which was started by
the civilian All People's Congress government in 1990 and
continued under the military regime up to March 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) left
interest rates unchanged today as economic growth and inflation in
U.S. remain moderate.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets policy for
the U.S. Fed, held a close-door meeting for more than four hours
today and announced its decision by saying "there is no
announcement".
</P>
<P>
It means that the U.S. Fed will keep the federal funds target
rate at 5.25 percent and its discount rate at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for
overnight loans and the discount rate is what the Fed charges
member banks for loans.
</P>
<P>
The Fed last lowered short-term interest rates at the end of
January, when it seemed the U.S. economy badly needed a boost to
avoid slipping into recession. At the time, many Fed watchers
expected another round of interest rate cuts in March or May.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. economy has gotten stronger than many had expected
since winter. With scattered signs of incipient inflation, U.S.
economy increased by a surprisingly strong annual rate of 2.8
percent in the first quarter comparing with a 0.5-percent gain in
the last three months of 1995. Analysts have abandoned their
earlier forecasts and some are expecting the Fed's next move will
instead be toward tighter money.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts think the U.S. Fed is unlikely to change
policy without overwhelming evidence of either sharply lower
output or escalating price increases for fear its actions would be
viewed as politically motivated in an election year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed had cut the short-term interest rates for three
times during last July to January to spur the slow-moving economy,
pushing the federal funds rate from 6 percent to 5.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> LSE Steps up Attacks on Insider Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is
about to start using artificial intelligence techniques, or
computers, to identify insider trading and market manipulation in
the city, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The LSE is installing software that will analyze all data on
share trading in the market from this August. It will identify any
patterns that indicate shares are being traded by insiders.
</P>
<P>
The exchange believes it will be the first in the world to use
technology capable of identifying the most sophisticated form of
insider trading, which involves the sharing of secret information
about future deals among professionals.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of an effort to strengthen the exchange's
defenses against market manipulation. It is also planning to bring
in 24-hour "halts" in trading of a company's share if there is an
unexplained move in a share price.
</P>
<P>
The software, which was developed by doctoral students in th
computer science department of University College, London, is
reportedly known as a "hybrid intelligence" system because it
combines neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms,
which replicate human thought patterns at high speed.
</P>
<P>
Richard Kilsby, director of market services at the LSE, said:
"We want to tackle the insidious forms of insider trading, which
were hard to identify by traditional examination of trading data
because they often did not move share prices."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- John F. Smith Jr, Chairman of the
General Motor Corporation, has called on the United States to
extend full trading privileges to China permanently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Detroit, the base of U.S. auto makers, on Monday,
Smith said that the long-term stability of American investment in
China depended on ending the annual debate over trade relations
and making China's current status permanently.
</P>
<P>
"Most-favored-nation status is the basis for a stable credible
economic policy toward China," Smith was quoted by the New York
Times today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the growth potential of Chinese market, John noted
that China's auto industry was still so much in its infancy that
American auto makers could catch up there. "China is the ideal
cornerstone for growth in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times commented that the strongly worded remarks
by John Smith were"a sign of how strongly many American business
executives feel about the need for access to the Chinese Market".

<HEADLINE> Christopher: U.S. to Fight Terrorism in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States is determined
to cooperate with Mideast nations in combating terrorism and
maintaining the peace process in the region, U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher pledged here today.
</P>
<P>
"America's most critical role...is defending the Middle East
peace process and the peacemakers against vicious attacks from
their enemies," Christopher told a meeting of the Washington
Institute of Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
He warned that terrorists and their supporters "are now engaged
in a systematic assault on Israel and on the peace process. Their
goal is clear: They seek to kill the very possibility of peace by
destroying every Israel's sense of personal security."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the enemies of peace "are escalating
their attacks for a very clear reason: The peace process is
succeeding."
</P>
<P>
"With every step toward peace that Israel and her neighbors
take, the enemies of peace grow more desperate and more
determined to lash out," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is determined to ensure that the enemies of
peace do not succeed," the U.S. Secretary stressed. "We will never
give in to their terror. We refuse to allow terrorists to
undermine our resolve or divert us from our goal of a real,
secure, lasting peace for Israel and all the peoples of the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
Christopher disclosed that the United States is providing
Israel with more than 100 million U.S. dollars in anti-terrorism
equipment and training while beginning to bolster the anti-terrorism
capability of the Palestinian Authority.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector to Be Basis of Russian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The private sector will become the
basis of Russian economy but the country will retain state-run
enterprises and improve the administration of state properties, a
leading government official said today.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Nikolayevich Soskovets told a
meeting on Russia's economic reforms that the government has so
far concentrated on reform of state-run enterprises, the setting
up of an industrial and financial base and anti-monopoly measures.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Russia still has to settle three major
economic issues -- its 58.2 billion U.S. dollar debt triangle, low
tax revenue and creating a better investment climate.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, investment in Russia
fell 10 percent over 1995 to 16.4 billion dollars, and most
enterprises are in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
Soskovets said the government's most serious challenge is to
reduce the negative effects of economic reforms and that "the
formation of a middle class will be the cornerstone of Russia's
stability."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Russian people's income fell 13 percent. But the
number of Russians living below the poverty line has dropped by 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Prosecution Demands 7-Year Sentence for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution today
demanded a seven-year prison term and 900,000 U.S.-dollar fine for
a former top aide to President Kim Young-sam accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chang Hak-ro, President Kim's former secretary, was arrested in
March this year after allegations of bribery came to light.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also demanded a two-year and one-and-half-year
term for Chang's live-in girlfriend Kim Mi-ja and her brother Kim
Ui-ryung respectively on charges of illegal land acquisition
registration.
</P>
<P>
In the final hearing in the Seoul District Court here today,
Chang pleaded guilty and apologized for not having been a clean
and honest civil servant.
</P>
<P>
Chang has been charged with receiving 900,000 dollars from 17
domestic firms while serving as President Kim's aide, while Kim
Mi-ja and her brother were accused of buying land with Chang's
money and registering the land under false names to help Chang
conceal his illegally-amassed wealth.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to President Kim in 1977 and was his
"steward" for nearly 20 years. When Kim became president in
February 1993, Chang was named presidential secretary in charge of
Kim's personal matters.
</P>
<P>
The president, who apologized to the nation after Chang was
arrested, has called for a heavy penalty in accordance with law.

<HEADLINE> EC Repeats Call for Easing Ban on UK Beef Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) today
repeated its call for a partial lifting of the eight-week
worldwide ban on British beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's recommendation, agreed by its 20-member
executive, is almost the same as that rejected by the EU's
standing veterinary committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the new proposal adds the proviso that the ban will not be
lifted until Britain has set up a system for veterinary control of
premises where the by-products -- gelatine, tallow and bull semen
-- are handled. Authorized products will also have to be labeled.
</P>
<P>
New, improved processing techniques will be applied in Britain
to gelatin and tallow obtained from bovine animals slaughtered in
the UK so as to eliminate any potential risk from BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy), or mad-cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's proposal will be sent to EU farm ministers at
an EU Council of Ministers on June 3.
</P>
<P>
"Once those measures are put into action the Commission considers
that it would no longer be necessary to maintain the export ban on
the UK beef by-products, notably gelatin, tallow and semen," an
EC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal was rejected by a meeting of the EU's
Standing Veterinary Committee on Monday, when seven member states
voted against the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
But these seven will not under the EU rules be able to block
the proposal at the June meeting unless they can persuade another
country to join them to get a simple majority against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The EU placed a worldwide ban on British beef exports on March
27, after a health scare over the possibility that the deadly
cattle brain disease BSE could be passed on to humans.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent series of lectures in Macao
to promote sex knowledge among adolescents has attracted many
students as well as adults.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Happy Family Promotion Association of Macao,
the lectures aim to let young people know the biological and
psychological changes during puberty and the proper way to handle
relations between male and female teenagers.
</P>
<P>
According to experts of the association, such lectures are
necessary as most parents in Macao are rather reserved on the idea
of "sex education" for their children while school teachers often
impart only the biological knowledge to the students.
</P>
<P>
"Such lectures will offer the youngsters a chance to freely ask
about their most puzzled questions, without the presence of
parents or teachers," said one expert.
</P>
<P>
"But in the long run, it is the parents who can teach their
children on questions of sex in a most naturally way," the expert
noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for More Energy Development in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called for better development of small hydro-electric power
stations and other forms of energy projects in rural China while
meeting with local officials in charge of energy production.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the total installed capacity of small
hydro-electric power stations in rural China increased ten million
kw, benefiting some 100 million rural people.
</P>
<P>
It is rather obvious that such stations have helped
people in impoverished areas to get rid of poverty, the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, another 300 rural counties will take
pioneering measures to promote the construction of such stations
with government and bank supports, he said, adding that favorable
electricity prices will also be worked out for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
In a country with 900 million rural people out of a total
population of 1.2 billion, energy production in rural areas is
important because it is related to every rural household and every
rural farmer, as well as rural economic and ideological
development, he said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Group Presses Repatriation of Nepali Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A national AIDS control
organization in Nepal today pressed its call for the repatriation
of more than 200 Nepali girls detained by Indian police since
their rescue from brothels in Bombay in February.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali National Network Against AIDS told a press
conference that representatives of various local organizations had
met Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba three months ago
requesting the government to seek the repatriation of these girls.
</P>
<P>
Despite Deuba's promise to form a task force soon to look into
the matter, work has not even started so far, the network charged.
</P>
<P>
According to the group, Indian police raided a number of
brothels in Bombay in early February and arrested 218 Nepalese
women. They have been held in several remand homes in India since
then.
</P>
<P>
The group said half of the detained Nepali women were children
and five of them died probably of AIDS-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were pregnant and had even given birth, it added.
</P>
<P>
The group urged the government to speed up the repatriation of
the stranded girls, negotiate with the Indian government to
protect thousands of Nepali women in Indian brothels, make
necessary arrangements for temporary shelter and medical treatment
for them and tighten security at the Nepal-India border to curb
women-trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Mayors to Build Better Cites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has urged
mayors of Chinese cities to do a better job in city management.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the call during a meeting with members of the
Chinese Association of Mayors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On future urban construction in China, Li Peng said that the
scope of cities should be put under control, because a city will
be hard to manage when it gets too large and there will be many
problems. Unlimited expansion of cities will no doubt encroach
upon arable land -- vegetable gardens in the first place, which
will affect food supply for city residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the scope of nationwide urban development should
be reassessed, and the size of cities should be determined
properly. In urban construction the existing urban area should be
fully utilized so as to save arable land, and the construction of
satellite towns should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
As traffic jam is a big problem in cities, Li said, top
priority should be given to the development of public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the construction of luxury buildings must be
kept under control, and more residential buildings should be built.
</P>
<P>
The premier also urged the mayors to pay great attention to the
production and marketing of vegetables, meat, eggs and milk to
ensure ample supply for urban residents.

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Attack on Aidid's Mogadishu Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
several others wounded today in a fighting over the control of
the radio of south Mogadishu strongman Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the clash was between opposing
militiamen of Aidid's own faction.
</P>
<P>
Angry mobs supporting former information director general of
Aidid's government Abdi Haji Gobdon launched the attack on the
radio station at the centre of Mogadishu, but were defeated
after an hour of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
Gobdon was recently sacked by General Aidid after a dispute
over the financial control of the radio station.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the fighting, more than four Eyr subclan
supporters of Gobdon were seen tied up with ropes at the former
presidential palace, which is near the radio station.
</P>
<P>
"These are not war prisoners, but militiamen who lost the
discipline," said one of the officials of Aidid's government.
</P>
<P>
"They will be punished for a few days and will be released
with their guns to defend their government since they are only
mutineers," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the radio station was prompted by Aidid's
latest decree on the replacements of more than a dozen middle
and low ranking officials with the radio station.

ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey welcomed the oil-for-food
deal between Iraq and the U.N. with the hope of opening of the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline and revitalizing its trade with Iraq,
the local press reported today.

<P>
Such a deal would not only bring humanitarian aid to the Iraqi
people who have been in a difficult situation, but also revitalize
Turkey's trade with Iraq, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said

The pipeline has been closed since Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, as part of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ugur Dogan, undersecretary at the Energy Ministry
characterized the development as "very positive" and "very
pleasing."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite hopes waning from time to time,
this was actually the result that had been expected in the end.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been lobbying for a long time for the pipeline
reopening.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara also showed some concern that the easing of
economic pressures in northern Iraq might lead Kurdish group there
to seeking more rights, thus cause negative impacts on Turkey's
rebel Kurds.

</P>
<P>
Pakistani Minister of Information and Broadcasting Khalid

</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Pakistan International Airline was the

</P>
<P>
"The Karakorum Highway is also a link between Pakistan and
China," he said, noting that Chinese people made great

</P>
<P>
"The people of Pakistan will not forget the contributions made
by China to Pakistan," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he has received the invitation to visit China in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"Some Pakistani journalists will go with me and write stories
about great China," he added.

Zhao Huaili, head of the five-member Chinese delegation and
vice president of China's Legal Daily, said he has been impressed

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 410,000 eligible Greek
Cypriots will vote Sunday in the parliamentary elections to choose
a new 56-seat House of Representative in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
About 413 candidates, representing seven parties and a
coalition, are contesting Sunday's elections to be held for the
first time under the system of direct proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
The coalition of the ruling rightwing Disy party with the
Liberal party, leftwing Akel, center-right Diko, socialist Edek,
and Adisok, an Akel splinter party, are going to fight for the
56-seat House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The new electoral system means that the electoral threshold is
between 6,500 and 6,800 votes, or 1.8 percent of valid votes,
depending on the district.
</P>
<P>
The direct proportional representation system seems to give the
smaller parties a better chance of getting a seat in the House
since all parties will take part in the first distribution of
seats.
</P>
<P>
The previous electoral system necessitated a party to garner
more than 8 percent of the votes and one seat in the first
distribution of seats to enter the House.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's polling will take place at 850 polling stations
nationwide, six more than that in the 1991 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Six parliamentary elections have taken place since the
establishment of the republic in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The last election were held in 1991 and contested by six
parties as well as independent candidates, but only four parties,
including a coalition, made it to the 56-seat House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 policemen are expected to take positions
Sunday to keep order.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will not
allow Indonesian women to join the miss universe contest, which
evaluates candidates based on physical beauty, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Women's Affairs Mien Sugandhi told reporters
after attending a meeting on people's welfare, that the
participation in beauty pageants does not only violate a decree of
the minister of education and culture but also lowers the dignity
of the Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
"We have been taken off guard with the sending of 1996 Miss
Indonesia Alya Rohali to the miss universe contest. Time and
again, we have stressed that the government prohibits the sending
of a representative to the miss universe contest," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, a group of Muslim students lodged a protest against
an Indonesian woman's participation in the recent miss universe
beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
"millions of Indonesian Muslims have been hurt with Alya
Rohali's participation in the miss universe pageantry," said the
students.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has the world's largest Islamic community, with
nearly 90 percent of its 195 million population declaring

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Lower Domestic Liquidity Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
is aiming for a 23.37 percent growth rate in domestic liquidity
this year, much lower than the 31.7 percent it originally
targeted.
</P>
<P>
Domestic liquidity or M3 refers to the sum of currency in
circulation and demand deposits plus quasi money such as savings
and time deposits and deposit substitutes (bills payable) and bank
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 23.37 percent growth, M3 should reach 939.4
billion pesos (37.58 billion US dollars) by the end of this year
from the 761.4 billion pesos (30.456 billion US dollars) level
posted at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The end-1995 M3 level was lower than the earlier proposed 1.002
trillion pesos (40.08 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has asked Manila to lower M3
growth, indicating that the increase in money in circulation does
not adequately translate into economic activities.
</P>
<P>
However, Manila feels that a too tight money supply may stifle
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Both the Philippine government and the IMF have agreed that the
country's economic growth is expected to be somewhere between 6.5
percent and 7.5 percent and average inflation between 7.5 percent
and 8.5 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> World's Fastest Superparallel Computer Developed in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scientists have developed
what they claim to be the world's fastest superparallel computer,
capable of making 300 billion calculations per second, the Yomiuri
Shimbun reported today.
</P>
<P>
The computer, which uses 1,024 microcomputers, is about 10
times faster than the best supercomputer currently in use and will
help scientists in their quest to understand the birth of
universe, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The computer was jointly developed by more than 30 experts from
Tsukuba University, Tokyo University, Electro-Communications
University and others at a cost of 1.6 billion yen (16 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers process data in a conveyor system, whereas
superparallel computers use microcomputers to simultaneously
process data, sharply reducing calculation time, said officials
from the Computation and Physical Science Center in Tsukuba
University.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to use the superparallel computer to simulate
conditions right after the birth of universe, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Such an experiment cannot be done with a supercomputer because
of the time required to make the calculations, and only an
approximation of the conditions has been available so far.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed superparallel computer will make it
possible to fully simulate the birth of universe, said Yoichi
Iwasaki, head of the research center.

<HEADLINE> China to Tackle Agricultural Development Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- In order to promote agricultural
development and ensure its modernization drive, China must deal
with seven matters, a top agricultural official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Whether agricultural reforms go well and a solid agricultural
foundation is laid out in the next five years is linked to a major
question, that is, whether the country's modernization drive will
have sufficient support," Vice-Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui
said at a seminar on rural reforms and agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the Central Party School of the
Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, the seven major issues are:
 1) How to maintain long-term and intermediate-term balance
between grain supply and demand, which is crucial for food supply
for the Chinese people;
 2) How to steadily raise farmers' income so as to protect and
make full use of their enthusiasm;
 3) How to continue rural reforms;
 4) How to speed up the industrialization process of agriculture;
 5) How to organize the orderly migration of rural surplus laborers;
 6) how to wipe out poverty completely; and
 7) How to readjust the relations between agriculture and the
national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Over 120 agricultural experts and local officials are expected
to discuss these issues at the two- to three-day symposium.

<HEADLINE> Ordinary Bulgarians' Wage Down, Lawmakers' Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian lawmakers' earn more than
twice the average city dweller and saw their average monthly
salary increase by 17 percent last month to some 237 U.S. dollars,
while ordinary city workers have seen theirs fall by the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
The value of the average wage for urban dwellers has fallen
from about 120 dollars to 100 dollars a month, due to the recent
sharp devaluation of the currency, the Standart Daily newspaper
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
That's 72 percent less than the 360 dollars the president,
prime minister and speaker of parliament earn, and 58 percent less
than the average member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average pension for more than 2 million
Bulgarian retirees fell to about 42 dollars, 18 percent of the
average lawmaker's salary.
</P>
<P>
MPs' salaries are expected to go up again in July as their pay
packets are adjusted every three months.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who join any parliamentary commissions also receive a
special allowance for attendance.
</P>
<P>
The lev, the Bulgarian currency, has been devalued by nearly a
half over the last two months, resulting in a huge hike in the
prices of consumer goods, especially imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Before devaluation, the national poverty line was set at
9301 levs (74.4 dollars) a month, about one-fifth of the current
wage of the president and 31.5 percent of the lawmakers'.

<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today reiterated that the June 12 parliamentary elections
would be held on schedule, dismissing concerns that the latest
mutiny attempt might disrupt the ambiance for the polls.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to former Chief of Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim tried
to stage a mutiny Monday following his forced retirement ordered
by the Defense Ministry under the president.
</P>
<P>
The attempt was thwarted after Nasim and five other senior
officers were put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
However, some political parties have accused Biswas of playing
a "bloody game" in favor of a conspiracy of the former ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party to foil the June 12 polls.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with US Ambassador to Dhaka David N. Merril today,
Biswas expressed confidence that the elections would be free, fair
and impartial with the help and cooperation of the people and the
political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The non-party caretaker government and the Election Commission
have been working conscientiously for the smooth and impartial
holding of the elections while all the preparations are going on
satisfactorily, the president stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A baby golden monkey born on April
19 at the Beijing Zoo is doing well, Head Keeper Feng Youqian told
reporters today.
</P>
<P>
"The mother is very fond and protective of her baby son," Feng
said. "At first, she didn't put it down even when she was eating,
let alone let others touch it."
</P>
<P>
But during the past few days the mother has relaxed somewhat,
and lets the baby walk and play by itself, so long as it does not
go too far.
</P>
<P>
Golden monkeys are found in the forest mountains of the three
southwest China provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou. They are
an endangered species under the state's first-class protection.
</P>
<P>
Normally they mate in autumn, and only one baby is born each
time following six months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Golden monkeys become sexually mature in four to six
years. Their life span can be as long as 16 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zoo has 13 golden monkeys, brought from Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces. Only three baby monkeys born in captivity have
survived.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the eight-year-old mother monkey
has given birth, and the little monkey is also the first one born
in the zoo this year.

</P>
<P>
Al-Suhaibani, who returned to Cairo today after attending a

This will not be realized in one step, but could take more than
10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the symposium, he said it suggested that the Arab economic
structure should be adjusted to the new economic world order.
</P>
<P>
Most participants of the symposium agreed that Arab countries
should work toward economic integration, al-Suhaibani said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), met with a
visiting delegation from the Kenya African National Union (KANU),
led by Moody Awori, a member of the Kenyan National Governing
Council, here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the friendship between the peoples of China and
Kenya has a long history, and bilateral relations have enjoyed
smooth development and will see an even greater growth in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
Qiao mentioned that Chinese President Jiang Zemin was given a
warm reception by President Daniel Arap Moi during his successful
visit to Kenya on the first leg of his ongoing tour of six African
nations.
</P>
<P>
China and Kenya are both developing countries which share
identical or similar views on many aspects of international
affairs, and they support and help each other on many
international issues, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can also learn from each other in promoting
their economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening up
drive, stressing that all countries have the right to choose their
own models of economic development according to their actual
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan people will certainly find a development path in
line with their country's national characteristics, Qiao continued.
</P>
<P>
Awori said that the two countries have long maintained friendly
relations of co-operation, and bilateral ties have witnessed rapid
development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan people are grateful for the long-term support they
have received from China and admire the great achievements that
China has made in its reform and opening-up process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
KANU has learned a lot from the experiences of the Communist
party of China (CPC) and is eager to reinforce its links with the
CPC, Awori told Qiao.

BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The world's population grew by 1.6
percent to nearly 5.8 billion last year, despite a slowdown in
the growth rate, a German population research fund has reported.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 87.7 million, was marginally lower than the 88
million increase in 1994, a local newspaper quoted the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The global birth rate has fallen 0.1 percentage points from 3.1
percent in 1994 to 3 percent last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the population of developing countries
has reached 4.5 billion, 80 percent of the total world population.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 95 percent of the world's births were in Asian,
African and Latin American countries and regions, while Europe's
population growth has been at a standstill for years.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that if the birth rate keeps declining at
last year's speed over the next 29 years, the global population in
2025 will be 8.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> "New Statistics Law Weapon Against Corruption" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The revised statistics law is a new
and sharp weapon against corruption in statistics work possibly
perpetrated by leaders of local governments and companies, said
the head of China's State Statistics Bureau here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Sai, director-general of the bureau, said that the new
version of the statistics law lays down specific measures for the
punishment of local officials of either governments or companies
who over-report or under-report figures for their personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
The new law has also added clauses to ensure the normal work of
statistics agencies and workers.
</P>
<P>
To win the trust and support of respondents in statistics work,
the law lays down specific measures to protect respondents'
commercial secrets. Meanwhile, it also rules out revelation of
China's state secrets and fraud in the name of making statistical
surveys.
</P>
<P>
While false reporting of statistics by some local governments
and companies has often taken place, figures at national level are
generally accurate and reliable, and basically reflect the trend
of development of the Chinese national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the State Statistics Bureau and its
provincial-level bureaus use a series of measures, which include
sample surveys and specially-targeted surveys as well as
scientific calculations, to detect dishonest reporting.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, he said, the accuracy and timeliness of
statistics are ensured by scientific and legal methods.

bringing the list to 328 or 14 percent of the total number of
counties in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period 138 counties were chosen to carry
out experiments in constructing energy facilities on the basis of
previous experiments in 18 counties.
</P>
<P>
Eight central governmental units, including the State Planning
Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture, have joined hands to
begin 6,000 projects involving power plant construction, bio-gas
installations and so on in the chosen counties since 1991.
</P>
<P>
After five years of efforts the regions have reached an
additional annual production capability of 10 million tons of
standard coal, accounting for ten percent of the total energy
consumption, and that of energy-saving capability has reached 11
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of firewood decreased to 26 percent last year
from 39 percent of the total fuel consumption in 1990. Meanwhile,
the percentage of forest cover has risen to 34 percent from 26.7
percent in the chosen counties.
</P>
<P>
The project has also had a positive impact on the environment,
as the use of bio-gas has successfully kept soil moist and also
improved its fertility.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu complained, there are still some problems plaguing
the project, citing the fact that some local government officials
pay little attention to it, and that some counties have poor
technological and managerial levels.

<HEADLINE> APEC to Standardize Three Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Sub-Committee on Standards and Conformance
(SCSC) has decided to make three products a priority in their
discussion on alignment of national standards with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Director Jesus Motoomull of the Philippine
Department of Trade and Industry at a press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The three products are electrical appliances including TV sets,
refrigerators and air conditioners, food labeling, and rubber
gloves and rubber condoms.
</P>
<P>
According to Motoomull, once the APEC Action Plans on standards
and conformance are put in place, all APEC member economies when
developing national standards for these products will align their
country's standards with relevant international standards set by
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
</P>
<P>
Motoomull said they have also come up with a short list of
other products to be added to the three and be taken up in the
August and October SCSC meetings.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Mass -Producing Genetic Engineering Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China has started to put into mass
production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat
liver diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing
University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b
interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public
Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic
engineering drug to be put into mass production in the
biotechnology section of the country's "863 Hi-Tech Plan".
</P>
<P>
China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for
scientific and technological development in 1978. Biotechnology
was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986,
when the "863" plan was introduced. So far, China has put onto the
market five genetic engineering drugs, and another dozen such
drugs are under research.
</P>
<P>
Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells and
internationally acknowledged as efficacious for the treatment of
liver diseases, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was
established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in
the "863" plan. He discovered for the first time that the white
blood cells of Chinese people, when attacked by viruses, will
produce "a 1" type instead of "a 2" type interferons. He
subsequently succeeded in developing recombinant a-1b interferon
-- the first interferon expressed by a gene isolated from healthy
Chinese leukocyte cells.
</P>
<P>
To put the interferon into mass production, the Shenzhen Kexing
Bioproducts Co. Ltd, China's largest genetic engineering medicine
production base, was set up in 1993 under the State Science and
Technology Commission.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets DPRK Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
this afternoon with Hong Song Nam, vice-premier of the
Administration Council of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), and they had a friendly conversation about issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Hong, Li said that China treasures the
traditional friendship between China and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is China's consistent policy to support the
maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, as
well as the consolidation and development of Sino-DPRK friendship
and co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and the DPRK share a long common border, Li
said, "We believe that through joint efforts the border will
forever be a bridge for bilateral friendship and co-operation."
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China's large-scale economic construction at
present demands a long, stable, and united domestic situation, as
well as a long-term and peaceful international environment,
especially a good-neighborly environment.
</P>
<P>
So, Li pointed out, China has adopted a policy emphasizing
good-neighborly friendship, hoping for the development of
long-term friendship and reciprocal co-operation with its
neighbors, including the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Expressing China's sympathy with the present difficulties
encountered by the DPRK, Li said he is convinced that the DPRK
people are bound to overcome the difficulties under the leadership
of Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that the DPRK people are pleased to see the great
achievements the Chinese people, closely ranking around the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at its
core, have made in their modernization drive, and hope for a
continuous development of bilateral friendship and relations of
co-operation, which was the desire of the late DPRK President Kim
Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that the DPRK appreciates the assistance provided by
the Chinese government and people when the DPRK is in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hong conveyed Kim Jong Il's and Kang Song
San's greetings to Li, and he also asked Li to pass on Kim Jong
Il's greetings to Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful of Winning GM Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine official today said his
government is hopeful that American car giant General Motors Corp.
(GM) will finally chose the Philippines over Thailand for its car
manufacturing project of one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro dismissed reports
that the GM is just using the Philippines as a leverage in its
negotiations with Thailand for the car facility.
</P>
<P>
"This could be a commercial strategy but I would not attribute
this Machiavellian strategy to a big company like the GM," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They are not using us as a pawn," he added.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said he was convinced that the GM has genuine
intentions in negotiating with the Philippines for its project.
</P>
<P>
"They conducted more discussions with us than with Thailand and
they have not moved since after concluding their discussions with
us," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The GM is expected to officially announce its decision by the
second week next month. The announcement is expected to be made
by high-level management.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Manila branded as a mere "psychological war" the
recent unofficial report that the GM is expected to choose
Thailand over the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a car manufacturing plant in either the
Philippines or Thailand will transform the host country into a GM
production base for car exports to the Asian Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The GM plans to produce 100,000 to 120,000 units of cars
annually, of which 80 percent are geared for exports.

<HEADLINE> China in Need of Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China needs to increase both the
number and the quality of its lawyers in the country's drive to
establish a market economy and improve its legal system, a Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Geng, vice-minister of justice, told a press conference
that China has more and better lawyers since the profession
regained its status as part of the country's judicial system in
1979. By the end of last year, China had more than 90,000 lawyers,
71.6 percent of whom have higher education degrees.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang said, China's actual demand for lawyers far
outstrips this figure, which means only seven lawyers for every
100,000 people, a figure much lower than that of many countries.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, there are three lawyers for each thousand
members of the population, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China wants to have 150,000 lawyers by the end of
the century, and 300,000 by 2010. "By then, China will have two
lawyers for every ten thousand people, roughly meeting its demand
for lawyers."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China needs to improve lawyers' professional
skills and ethical standards to better serve the public.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are not enough lawyers with master's
degrees or higher, and that some fail to perform their duties
because of lack of professional ability, or because of unethical
or even illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
Because of the large demand for lawyers, Zhang went on to say,
the Ministry of Justice has encouraged employees of legal
education and research institutes to work part-time as lawyers,
but he emphasized that employees of government departments,
according to the recently enacted law on lawyers, are, under no
circumstances, to be appointed as part-time lawyers, in order to
ensure the complete fairness of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislature has approved China's first law on
lawyers, which is to take effect on January 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Huge Power Plant to Be Built in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has recently signed an agreement with the U.S. firm DELMA and the
French company Electricite de France (EDF) on construction of a
power plant in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
DELMA, a California-based firm, will build the 170 million
U.S. dollars plant on the "Build, Own, Operate" system. The
company, aided by EDF, will finance, design, operate and maintain
the electric power plant facility and then sell the power they
build to the Palestinian Energy Authority (PEA) under a 20-year
power purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahman Hamad, president of the PEA, said that the
project aims to meet the increasing demand on electricity supply
in Gaza. The first stage of the two-phase project will be
completed by December this year, with the remainder expected to be
completed by March 1998. The plant will run at a power of 214.5
megawatts, and produce 28 percent cheaper rates than the Israel
Electric Corp. offers.
</P>
<P>
"The building of this plant is one of the most significant and
important projects in Gaza for many reasons," said Rafiq Maliha, a
PEA official and negotiator for the power plant project. "It's the
corner stone for building, industry and development," he
added.

MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today directed Cabinet Cluster B in charge of the country's
macro-economic issues to study and recommend a new target for the
per capita income for 1998 under the six-year Medium-Term

</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, this result has been corroborated by
parallel estimates of the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank
and other institutions monitoring and tracking the economic
progress in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
This achievement proves that the country is enjoying continuing
political stability, investor confidence and sustainable
development, said Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Pink Dolphin's Death Arouses Experts' Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Dolphin researchers in Hong Kong
are worried about the decreasing number of pink dolphins in the
territory's waters.
</P>
<P>
According to Local media, a pink dolphin was found dead on a
Lantau beach this week, the second death case found this year.
</P>
<P>
Dolphin researcher Chris Parsons warned that Hong Kong's small
population of dolphins could be extinct within the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said there were about 100 pink dolphins left in Hong Kong's
waters, but heavy shipping, pollution, over-fishing, building work
 and reclamation were taking their toll.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one dead pink dolphins have been found in the past two
years, but the total number of deaths is probably at least twice
that, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some are hit by boats, get caught in the propellers or
drowned in fishing nets. They also pick up diseases as basically
they are swimming around in sewage solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts called on the government and communities to take
protective measures for the dolphins.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that plans for a 1,200-hectare marine park for
the dolphins near Sha Chau are under public consultation.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Further Cut Tariffs for APEC Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to further cut tariffs as a "downpayment" to create a
free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region by 2010 for developed
economies and 2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
The proposed cuts are outlined in the "Provisional Action Plan"
submitted today to the second senior officials meeting of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which opened in Cebu.
</P>
<P>
A senior Philippine official said these cuts will be "over and
beyond" those already committed under the Uruguay Round Pact of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
By proposing a further phasedown in tariff rates, Manila does
"not necessarily lose its flexibility to modify (them) upwards
should the situation so warrant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed "Action Plan," the Philippines will expand
the coverage of the tariff binding but exclude items with
quantitative restrictions.
</P>
<P>
These restrictions, in line with GATT commitments, would have
to be replaced with maximum tariff shields.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is also committed to reducing the binding level
of 3,544 tariff lines from 10 percentage points above the rates
specified under an executive order implementing the import
liberalization program.
</P>
<P>
In line with its free-trade commitments, the Philippines has
unilaterally cut tariffs on a wide range of products.
</P>
<P>
Under the tariff restructuring program, Manila pledges to cut
duties on raw materials to three percent starting from July 1994
and those on finished products to 10 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Rates for all products will be lowered to a uniform five
percent by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Political Feature: Grachev Firing Reportedly Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev, one of President Boris Yeltsin's longest serving
supporters, is once again in the hot seat as speculation grows
that he will be sacked next month and replaced by General Boris
Gromov, former commander of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Times, citing "a well-informed source in the
Kremlin," said on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin will
announce Grachev's sacking during his trip to Chechnya later this
month and will replace him around June 3-4, less than two weeks
before the June 16 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
But a Kremlin spokesman would not confirm the newspaper's
claims, and no one in Grachev's office could be reached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman in Gromov's office at the State Duma
(the lower house of the Russian parliament) said he knew about the
reported promotion only from newspapers, and would not comment
further.
</P>
<P>
The sacking is seen by some as yet another move by Yeltsin to
win support from voters in the presidential poll, where he's
facing a strong challenge from communist rival Gennady Zuyganov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose campaign has been dogged by the conflict in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, plans to make Grachev the
sacrificial lamb for the failure federal forces to crush the
rebels, the collapse of military reform and the calamitous
situation of the army, the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Grachev, who once was almost forced to resign over the
incompetence of the army in Chechnya, has also allegedly been
involved in corruption along with other senior military officials.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the reformist Yabloko bloc, and
one of Yeltsin's main rivals in the presidential polls, has
demanded the heads of Cabinet ministers including Grachev as one
of the conditions of supporting Yeltsin in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, eager to win the backing of the liberal reformer to
ensure he beats his main rival communist Gennady Zuyganov,
offered last weekend to make some changes in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about Grachev's dismissal has grown over the pat
month after he told the Duma he had waited six days before
implementing Yeltsin's March 31 cease fire order in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Grachev has also opposed Yeltsin's plans to shake up the
inefficient army, including abolishing compulsory military service
and moving to an all-professional army.
</P>
<P>
However, he has agreed to implement the changes which were
announced in two presidential decrees last week,
</P>
<P>
It may be hard for Yeltsin to sack Grachev, who backed him in
August 1991, when Yeltsin gained power from the then Soviet Union
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Grachev also supported Yeltsin during the bloody conflict
between president and parliament in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
While Grachev's removal is likely to be popular among voters,
reaction within the military is less clear.
</P>
<P>
"There are personal ties between Grachev, who has already been
in charge for five years, and higher level officers, who are able
to influence the positions of their subordinates," the Moscow
Times quoted Mikhail Gerasyov of the Russian Academy of Sciences'
U.S.-Canada Institute.
</P>
<P>
Gromov, a hero of the Afghan war and currently a deputy in
the Duma, has had a high profile lately. He, rather than Grachev,
accompanied Yeltsin during a Victory Day trip to Volgograd
(Stalingrad) on May 9.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old former deputy defense minister, who has
publicly disagreed with Grachev on the war in Chechnya, commented
favorably about Yeltsin's decrees on professionalizing the armed
forces when he appeared on local television several times last
week.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, Gromov is now very close to the president,"
Gerasyov said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here say Gromov's appointment could help Yeltsin
politically.
</P>
<P>
"He's not as visible as he used to be, but I think his
reputation is basically good within the military and within
society in general," said Andrei Kortunov of the Russian Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"He's perceived as an honest person, as a person who has some
integrity. Besides, he's an Afghan (war) hero, and he might signal
a new beginning and that serious military reform is on the way."
</P>
<P>
With only three weeks to go to the election, the president has
little time left to make up his mind.

<HEADLINE> China Has 57 Foreign Law Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven foreign law firms have
opened offices in China, according to Zhang Geng, deputy minister
of justice.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made this announcement this morning at a press conference
on the Lawyers Law of the People's Republic of China, which was
passed last week by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, and is to come into effect
on January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
"As a major step in the reform of the country's legal services
system, the Ministry of Justice has given approval to a total of
57 foreign law firms to open offices in China since late 1992,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
These offices are located in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Haikou and Suzhou City in east China's Jiangsu Province,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing and Shanghai top these cities with 26 and 16 offices,
respectively," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called it "a fairly successful experiment" to permit the
opening of these offices, which, he said, can not only help China
to get more foreign investment, but also provide much good
experience for domestic law firms in the spheres of management and
operation.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of Justice said that the 57 law firms
are mainly from Canada, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Britain,
Germany, the US and France. Some of them are leaders in their own
countries, such as Baker &AMP; McKenzie and Coudert Brothers of the
US, and Gide Loyrette Mouel of France.
</P>
<P>
The major business of these offices is providing legal
assistance to investors and traders from their own countries.
They are not allowed to handle China's domestic legal affairs, but
can offer their services to the Chinese side in overseas legal
disputes.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the Lawyers' Affairs Division of
Beijing's Bureau of Justice, by the end of 1995 offices of foreign
law firms in the capital had paid a total of 18 million yuan (some
2.16 million US dollars) in taxes.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he said, the Coudert Brothers' Beijing office helped
the country to gain more than two billion US dollars in foreign
investment, while Gide Loyrette Mouel helped a Chinese company to
win a lawsuit against the European Union's anti-dumping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Geng said that, according to relevant articles in the new
Lawyers Law, his ministry is to formulate as soon as possible
concrete regulations on the management of the China offices of
foreign law firms.
</P>
<P>
"If approved and issued by the State Council, the regulations
will strengthen the management of China's legal services market,
which is busy opening to the outside world," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference Zhang also revealed that seven
Chinese law firms have already set up overseas branches in
countries including Russia, Singapore and the US.
</P>
<P>
"This is a move worth encouraging," he said, "as it can help
Chinese lawyers to improve their expertise and make themselves
better known to the rest of the world."

<HEADLINE> Kenya To Produce More Sugar This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's sugar production will rise
to 420,000 tons in 1996 from 386,000 tons last year,"the East
African Standard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"In overall terms, the cane supply situation has significantly
improved and all six factories have adequate supply of cane," a
Kenyan Sugar Authority (KSA) official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official who was not identified said a rapid increase in
sugar production is undermined by the inability of some of the
factories to crush cane at their rated capacity.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan sugar mills have the capacity of crushing 20,000 tons
of cane per day. These mills run for about 280 days per year and
operate for 24 hours daily.
</P>
<P>
"At a recovery rate of 9.0 tons of cane per ton of sugar,
kenya could produce approximately 600,000 tons of sugar a year.
However, due to constant break downs and lower recovery rates for
some of the factories, it has been difficult for Kenya to attain
that level," said the official.

<P>
KUNMING, Yunnan Province, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Liu Limin, China's
swimming world champion and world record holder, was not worried
about her form slump in the Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
Liu took the women's 100 and 200 meters butterfly titles at the
1994 world championships in Rome and set a world record in the 100
meters butterfly at last year's world short course swimming
championships in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
But at this year's Olympic trials, Liu Limin clocked only 59.57
seconds in the 100 meters and 2 minutes 9.88 in the 200 meters.
She only ranked fourth in both events, after her Japanese and
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident of making good performance at Atlanta. It has
been my dream to compete at Olympic Games. I will take the chance
and do my best."
</P>
<P>
Liu said she was not afraid of the high temperature and
humidity in Atlanta during the Olympic Games as she grew up in
Wuhan of central China, which has the similar summer like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Liu just finished a 20-day training session at the
high-altitude camp in Kunming. She trained 6 hours a day and swam
more than 16,000 meters everyday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ge was quite satisfied with the training session. As for
Liu Limin's current form, Zhao said: "She is ok now. The Olympic
trials are very important, but it is Olympic Games that Count."

<HEADLINE> Durian Helps Boost HK Air Cargo Throughput </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The durian season that falls into
 April helped Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) to
record a slight increase in throughput over the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
The air cargo carrier in April handled 5,300 tons of durian, a
southeast Asian fruit which has an offensive smell but a pleasant
taste.
</P>
<P>
Comprising imports, exports and transshipments, the throughput
for the month added up to 119,375 tons, narrowly surpassing
119,100 tons -- the figure of April last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from HACTL said that thanks to the tropical fruit, the
monthly handling output edged up by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Durian is imported to Hong Kong by air, with over 90 percent
from Thailand. It is estimated that Hong Kong consumers spent at
least 150 million HK dollars (19 million US dollars) on durian in
April.
</P>
<P>
HACTL throughput between January and April went up by 2.7
percent over the same period last year. Imports recorded the
biggest rise of 6.2 percent, while exports and transshipments
remain static.
</P>
<P>
The mishandling rate was one in nearly 50,000 shipments in
April, far lower than other airports in the world.
</P>
<P>
HACTL is the sole air cargo handling company in Hong Kong.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 hectares of forest is
destroyed annually in northern Iran due to fire and denudation, a
local report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam reported that the forest in northern
Iran is being consumed at a rate of more than 4 million cubic
meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Iran imports large quantity of wood, primarily from Russia and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Forests and Pastures Protection Office
said that the forestry organization has come up with a number of
measures to stop the destruction of forest.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most important thing is to educate the public
on how to use the forest in a rational way.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to establish a wireless radio
communication system in the northern forest, he added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to protect the forest, the Iranian
government is now trying to supply the local people with piped
natural gas to replace wood as a primary source of winter fuel in
the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A rare red wolf, listed in the
world's endangered species red book, has been found in Vietnam's
central province of Quang Tri, Vietnam News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A typical adult of the wolf, formally known as Cuon Alpinus
(Pallas), has fire-like red brown hair and weighs 16-35 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Red wolves appeared in midland areas of the province last year
and killed nearly 150 cattles. Due to lack of information on this
precious species, local people killed many of them.
</P>
<P>
The wolves are also reported to live in the northern mountain
province of Lao Cai and the central highland provinces of Gia Lai
and Kon Tum.
</P>
<P>
The existence of this rare wolf has been confirmed by a group

<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-man delegation of the
Turkish Oil Pipeline Company (BOTAS) is expected to go to Iraq
for the Turco-Iraqi technical talks on the reopening of the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline, Director General of BOTAS Mustafa
Murathan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Murathan said that there is not any problem for the Turkish
side and there is also not any serious problem for the Iraqi side
on the reopening of the pipeline, which was shut following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government and businessmen welcomed the
oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the United Nations. The
agreement would enable Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil
every six months to buy food and other supplies for its people
hard hit by the U.N. sanctions. Iraq is expected to export oil in
a month's time.
</P>
<P>
On March 8, Turkey and Iraq signed a memorandum of
understanding about the technical talks between the two countries
with the aim of reopening the twin-980-kilometer pipeline.
</P>
<P>
With the reopening of the pipeline, which carries Iraqi oil to
Turkey's Mediterranean coast, Turkey could gain transit fees of
20 million U.S. dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Turkish media said that Turkey could play a role in supplying
part of the humanitarian aid to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Leprosy Cases Down Under 1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has said that the number of leprosy cases worldwide has now
dropped below 1 million for the first time in record.
</P>
<P>
Latest data show 926,259 registered cases, suggesting a global
prevalence of 1.67 cases per 10,000 population, said the United
Nations specialized agency in a press release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Around the world, the leprosy problem has been reduced by 83
percent over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the achievement is a significant progress
in efforts towards the target of eliminating leprosy as a public
health problem by 2000 -- that is, reducing the number of cases in
the world to less than 1 per 10,000 population.
</P>
<P>
The WHO noted that 91 percent of the current cases have access
to multidrug therapy (MDT) -- the most effective treatment so far
which ensures the leprosy agent cannot develop drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
The organization said MDT has helped reduce leprosy prevalence
by 27 percent between 1994 and 1995, and a further 28 percent
between 1995 and this year.
</P>
<P>
The multidrug treatment has cured a cumulative total of about 8
million leprosy cases, with its coverage being extended to many
remote areas and hitting 91 percent in 1996, up from only 55
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over half a million new cases are being detected every year.
Globally, leprosy remains a public health problem in 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the leprosy problem now occurs in 16
countries, with India registering 560,000 cases, followed by
Brazil with 95,564 cases.
</P>
<P>
Other top endemic countries are Indonesia, Myanma, Nigeria,
Nepal, Bangladesh, Philippines, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Zaire,
Madagascar, Sudan, Tanzania, Guinea and Cambodia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has issued
an order to ban the publication of a critical weekly for feeding
foreign media with anti-Islamic Republic propaganda stuff.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran reported today that the weekly Payam
Daneshjoo, or the Message of Students, was charged with "raising
despairing topics and publishing unfounded and often slanderous
articles against people serving the country."
</P>
<P>
The Press Supervisory Committee affiliated to the Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ministry accused the weekly of providing
anti-Islamic Republic media with propaganda feed.
</P>
<P>
The daily today carried the details of the ban by the
committee, but it gave no details about the weekly.
</P>
<P>
The weekly, which had its publication license removed last
week, had been previously forced to close for the similar
reasons. It was allowed to resume publication in March after the
weekly submitted a written pledge that it would not engage in
"indecent journalist styles."

<HEADLINE> Australian Students Protest Against Funding Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of university students
in Australia today protested against planned federal funding cuts
in a reported build-up to a campaign to be launched on May 30 when
students and staff would walk out from universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that students at universities in
Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and other cities held rallies and
on-campus protests to highlight their opposition against the
proposed cuts of up to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fears of heavy budget cuts were heightened when the Australian
Vice- Chancellors Committee said Federal Education Minister Amanda
Vanstone told them to expect funding cuts of between five and 12
percent, as part of the government's search for eight billion
Australian dollars (six billion US dollars) in spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the National Union of Students called on the federal
government to live up to its pre-election promises not to cut
funding to universities.
</P>
<P>
The union said today's campaign joined by more than 2,000
students was a prelude to a national 24-hour strike of staff and
students on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Authority of Sydney University announced that staff recruiting
had been frozen amid fears the budget cuts may leave the
university more than 100 million Australian dollars (78 million US
dollars) out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
It is the second university in as many days to announce a staff
freeze amid uncertainty about federal funding after Queensland
University's staff freeze Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Hobart in the southern island of Tasmania, Vice Chancellor
of Tasmania University Don McNicol described the planned cuts as a
catastrophe when he led a protest of 1,500 students in a march
through the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
"We've never confronted a reduction of this kind, we've never
seen the whole system put into reverse gear," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Northern Land Council expressed concern that
aboriginal students may be disadvantaged by the planned cuts. It
urged Northern Territory University to ensure the aboriginal
students would not be disadvantaged.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to build a digital
data network linking its 500 major enterprises and 500
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
This, along with the construction of the golden card project,
which aims to improve information transmission between banks, will
offer promising opportunities for overseas firms to join in
China's telecommunications construction.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, minister of Posts and Telecommunications, outlined
the plans when meeting Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine and a 15-member UK telecommunications business
entourage.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the guests from the United Kingdom that China added 15
million telephone subscribers in 1995, pushing the total number of
telephone subscribers to 44.32 million, 3.63 million of whom are
mobile phone subscribers. China's telephone penetration rate has
now reached 4.66 percent while the urban figure amounts to 17
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the total number of telephone switchboards had come up
to 85.13 million lines by the end of last year, 98 percent of them
program-controlled. All municipalities and provincial, regional
capital cities, and even some counties in coastal areas, have
access to teleconference communication.
</P>
<P>
All the provincial capitals except Lhasa can now transmit
information via optical fiber and 86 percent of such transmissions
are digitalized.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, he said, telecommunications as an
important sector of the national economy, will witness rapid
growth in China.
</P>
<P>
The telephone penetration rate is expected to reach ten percent
nationwide, and above 30 percent in urban areas by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the visiting British guests that China plans to lay at
least 100,000 kilometers of optical fiber cables in the coming
five years and the number of telephone switchboards is expected to
double the 1995 figure by the year 2000, reaching 170 million
lines.
</P>
<P>
All management and software systems will be upgraded. This all
calls for accelerated cooperation between China and the rest of
the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said his ministry has already had an extensive cooperation
with British telecom companies such as Cable and Wireless Company
and British Telecom.
</P>
<P>
He said China has had cooperative relations with the Cable
and Wireless Company of Britain for over 100 years, and started a
cooperation maritime cable shipping joint venture; GPT of Britain
has started a joint venture in Shanghai's Pudong Area and British
Telecom has long standing cooperative relations with China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China has large telecommunications market, but the
country cannot rely solely on imported products. The future for
the British companies will be more promising if they can lead in
technology transfer and start joint ventures with Chinese
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the dozen businesspersons representing a dozen British
telecommunications enterprises gave brief accounts to their
companies and cooperation projects with China, the British Deputy
Prime Minister said the British companies will forge closer ties
with China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and work
more actively to explore the Chinese market.

MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has worked
out plans to support the development of the domestic packaging
materials industry, one of the country's 13 export-oriented
industries, Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar said
today.
</P>
<P>
Related measures were approved by the Board of Investments
after consultations with various private institutions and other

assistance to the packaging industry.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a "Philippine packaging course-diploma"
through the assistance of the education sector would be on the
second phase.
</P>
<P>
A Philippine export products excellence guide would be
undertaken on the third phase, which will interlink the government
authority with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase will be to promote exports through packaging
support.
</P>
<P>
Other measures will be adopted to seek the implementation of a
"packaging discards classification program," which will serve as
the vehicle for proper classification of packaging discards into
four basic categories -- paper, plastic, glass and metal.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Funds Sanitation Project For Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today approved a
57 million U.S. dollar loan to help improve sanitation for Metro
Manila's 8.9 million residents.
</P>
<P>
Manila's Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System will use
the loan to expand its sewage management program, thus enabling
the low-cost sewerage service to reduce the public health hazard
posed by the pollution in Manila's waterways and Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, to be carried out between 1996
and 1999, will acquire the information needed to design the
facilities by building a pilot treatment plant, desludging about
300,000 tanks, and assessing the characteristics and distribution
of the sewage. In addition, the project will rehabilitate Matro
Manila's separate sewage network and the Ayala treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the Manila Second Sewerage Project is
estimated at 76.2 million dollars. The World Bank's loan, which
will finance about 75 percent of the total project cost, will be
provided for a period of 20 years, with the Philippine government
acting as guarantor.

<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The second Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC)'s Senior Officials Meeting (SOM II) is off to a
good start, SOM vice chair Antonio Basilio said in a press
briefing this afternoon in Cebu, central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Basilio said all the 18 member economies have submitted their
individual action plans (IAPs), which details their commitment to
the Osaka agenda.
</P>
<P>
The 18 members are set to report their IAPs when they meet
tomorrow at a plenary. "The fact that the members are willing to
present IAPs before the plenary shows their confidence and
commitment in their IAPs," said Basilio.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Fedrico Macaranas,
concurrent chairman of SOM'96, said the submission of IAPs was
vital in the progress of the discussion on a credible and
comprehensive report to the APEC trade ministers meeting in New
Zealand in July.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of SOM II, there were speculations that some
members are reluctant to submit their IAPs in time to wait for
good bargain.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Council Speaker Stresses Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Council Speaker Abu
Ala has said that Palestinians will agree that Jerusalem should
remain a united city with open access for all, if Israel accepts
the principle of Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank, Gaza
and eastern part of Jerusalem, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala told the Israeli paper that sovereignty is the key to
resolving all outstanding issues and that Jerusalem is not the
most difficult of them. He added that the most difficult issues
are Palestinian refugees and the sharing of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala was one of the chief negotiators in the secret
PLO-Israel Oslo talks and he is expected to head the Palestinian
delegation to the final status talks on Jerusalem. Abu Ala was
elected to the PC in the east Jerusalem constituency.
</P>
<P>
He said since neither Israelis nor Palestinians are interested
in internationalizing Jerusalem, as suggested by the United
Nations, a compromise can be worked out.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala said that until now all negotiations on Jerusalem have
been held at unofficial levels and none of the proposals put
forward so far has proved acceptable to either side. Nonetheless,
he said, he would not dismiss them as mere intellectual exercises.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians want the eastern part of Jerusalem as capital of a
Palestinian state, while Israel vows to keep the city as the
undivided capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala said it was too early for the two sides to concede any
ground on Jerusalem since this would weaken their official
negotiating positions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in Taba, Egypt's Red
Sea resort, on May 5 to declare the beginning of the final status
talks, but it was only a symbolic session. Real negotiations will
take place after Israel's national elections due to be held on May
29.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Will Become Shake-Proof By Early Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Every major city in China will
become quakeproof by early next century.
</P>
<P>
With the country in the midst of seismic activity, and the
possibility of major earthquakes, the government has been eager to
devise projects to protect against big quakes.
</P>
<P>
Now officials have announced that all large and medium-sized
cities in China will become resistant to earthquakes measuring up
to six on the Richter scale by the early next century under a
ten-year project.
</P>
<P>
The project centers on precautions against earthquake and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
China will designate 21 priority seismological observation
areas for precaution against earthquakes and 14 priority cities
across the country in 1996, making these cities shake-proof to
earthquakes measuring up to six on the Richter scale by the end of
this century, an official with the State Seismological Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
China has been in the fifth period of frequent seismic activity
(beginning this century) since the late 1980s. During the Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000), China will experience more frequent
seismic activity, with the large possibility of suffering more
strong earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Achieving the shake-proof goal will bring great disaster relief
to the country, laying foundations for realizing China's strategic
goals of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Located in two seismic belts, China is one of the countries in
the world suffering from most frequent seismic activities.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 earthquakes measuring at or above six on the Richter
scale have been recorded in the country this century, killing as
many as 550,000 people, more than half of the total earthquake
casualties in the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has more than 700 seismological observation
stations across the country, some of them having adopted digital
technology. A set of high technologies such as GPS and satellite
remote sensing technology have also been applied in the field.
</P>
<P>
Earthquake forecasts in the northwest China's Qinghai Province
have been successful since the 1980s. The accurate forecasts of
the earthquake hitting border areas between China and Myanmar on
July 12, 1995 not only reduced the loss of human life and economic
losses, but also raised the morale of seismic circles both at home
and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Grants Rice Export Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 22 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam has granted quotas to 15
authorised rice exporting enterprises and other trading companies
in Mekong delta, said an official of the Ministry of Trade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that this aimed at boosting rice exports and
rice transactions in the southern 'rice basket' provinces,
ensuring that export targets are met by reducing the purchasing
burden on the 15 exporters.
</P>
<P>
The 15 exporters will fulfill 60 to 70 percent of the rice
export quotas while the remainder will be granted to companies
formerly entitled to export rice.
</P>
<P>
This led to a reduction in the number of authorised rice
exporters from 40 to 15, due to complaints that too many export
enterprises had caused chaos in rice markets.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has exported 580,000 tonnes of rice in the first
quarter of this year and aims to meet this year's target of two
million tonnes. The Ministry of Trade has already set a quota of
600,000 tonnes of rice for export in the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mekong delta farmers have been gladdened by a bumper spring
winter crop of three million tonnes, but have had to contend with
private dealers' forcing prices down to a point where they hardly
recover their investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign rice dealers have also been reported to have tried to
force prices down by prolonging the finalisation of sales
contracts, hoping that prices would drop as farmers become more
cash starved and are eager sell off their stockpiles.

TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry today

Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Turkish
Ambassador to Tehran Mithat Balkan was summoned to the Iranian

Turkish diplomat was alleged to kill two Iranian women -- Tahereh
Nabati, 49, and her daughter Margan Pirani, 19.
</P>

According to the report, the Turkish ambassador was called on
to carry out the necessary cooperation with relevant
organizations.
</P>

MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the
International Monetary Fund are expected to wrap up the second
review of the country's economic performance under an extended
fund facility program by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Sources involved in the ongoing talks disclosed today that both
sides are confident of reaching an agreement on all performance
criteria by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are still firming up the numbers on the monetary
program, sources said, but there is "broad agreement in
principle."
</P>
<P>
On the fiscal side, the IMF was confident that the government
would be able to attain its budget surplus target this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was also satisfied with Manila's action on the passage
of the comprehensive tax reform package, as well as on the energy
deregulation and removal of quantitative restrictions.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF urged the Philippine government to keep an eye
on its public sector position and inflation.
</P>
<P>
It also advised Manila to continue building up its reserves in
order to keep at par with the growth in imports and to have a
comfortable foreign exchange position to deal with any unexpected
shocks due to the volatile nature of foreign investment funds.

<HEADLINE> Three US Computer Giants Join Hands In Exploiting Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Three leading US computer
companies, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Microsoft and
Oracle, announced this week that they will cooperate in China to
bring more world-class computer technologies to the emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite union will introduce three 64-bit
technology-based computer systems to Guangzhou, Shanghai and
Beijing this week.
</P>
<P>
Included are the Unix cluster products, developed by DEC and
Oracle, DEC and Microsoft's Windows NT cluster products, and the
DEC Alpha high-performance server.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Lam, president of DEC China, said that it is the first
time that the latest technical breakthroughs are available in
China.
</P>
<P>
Among the formidable union, DEC is one of the largest computer
systems suppliers in the world, and Microsoft and Oracle are the
two strongest software makers in USA.
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious cooperation program is no more than a
fashionable market strategy to enhance their technical advantage
after a rapid expansion of market share in China over the past few
years, commented industrial analysts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An ally was launched between Motorola and Apple last March to
jointly manufacture the Macintosh PC operating systems in Nanjing,
capital of Jiangsu Province. And Microsoft also announced that it
would develop a Chinese version for its Windows NT software
together with Motorola and Legend Group, China's biggest computer
producer.
</P>
<P>
Lam said the trend of inter-company cooperation in the computer
industry is actually driven by the prevalent expectation of a
take-off in China's computer market.
</P>
<P>
Their recent commercial successes also give rise to the
optimism. He said that the DEC had sold 3,500 to 4,000 64-bit
technology-base computer systems to China over the past one and a
half years, turning out an annual growth of 70 percent, 10
percentage points higher than its global average.
</P>
<P>
Through a skyrocketing development over the past three years,
China's computer market will see a more rough competition among
foreign firms this year. To keep its leading market position, DEC
extended its agent network to cover more than 20 cities, and other
big names such as Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and IBM are expected
to follow suit soon.

<HEADLINE> Back To A Normal Life For Mental Patients in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of mentally ill people in
a Chinese city have returned to work as part of an initiative to
help them.
</P>
<P>
Company bosses in Hangzhou are banned from sacking workers
with mental disorders in the Zhejiang provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Instead the patients can be given free and effective treatment
to help them.
</P>
<P>
The result, say officials, is that almost no mentally ill
people caused trouble or public disturbances in the city during
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the period the relapse rate of mental illness has
dropped from 70 percent to 10 percent, and 1,000 mental patients
have fully recovered and returned to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
A social network had been formed by the neighborhood
committees, district and city governments to take care of people
suffering from mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
Recovery centers, in which mental patients can earn money by
doing jobs while receiving medical treatment, were set up
in 33 blocks, and special groups were formed in all factories
with over 500 employees to take care of mental patients.
</P>
<P>
The city government also made regulations forbidding any
enterprises from firing their mentally disordered employees, and
issued tax-free policies to the recovery centers.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood committees pay for the costs of doctors' visits
and medical expenses for the patients.
</P>
<P>
China Disabled Persons' Federation has opened training courses
in the city and films about the work with mental patients were
produced to publicize the city's efforts to treat and take care of
mental patients.

<HEADLINE> Grassland Use Becoming Efficient in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A program to make efficient use of
grassland resources in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has
been carried out in 26 cities and counties of the province. The
program was launched at the beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, about 293,000 ha of grasslands has been contracted to
people for development, with contract terms lasting 30 to 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The province, the largest milk producer in the country, has
grasslands totalling 4.3 million ha, mainly located in the Songnen
Plain, the upper reaches of the Heihe River and on the slopes of
the Dahinggan and Xiaohinggan mountains.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of grassland resources in the province
has been imbalanced. The Songnen Plain, in the western part, turns
out 70 percent of the province's livestock products.
</P>
<P>
Lack of management and leaving sheep and cattle to graze at
will have seriously damaged the grasslands on the Songnen Plain.
Of the 1.86 million ha of grassland on the plain, 1.46 million ha
suffer from soil deterioration, alkalinization and desertification.
</P>
<P>
Animal husbandry experts have warned that the overuse of
grassland resources will make the Songnen Plain completely barren.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 70 percent of the 2.46 million ha of
grasslands in other parts of the province has not been utilized.
</P>
<P>
In the development program foreign firms are also allowed to
contract grasslands. Foreign investment in the development of the
Heihe River plains and the Dahinggan and Xiaohinggan mountains has
bright prospects, said local animal husbandry officials.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Launches Huge Pollution Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A project costing 8.99 million US
dollars to curb water pollution in China's most seriously polluted
river has been launched in this capital of Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
With six million US dollars in a government loan from Norway and
16 million yuan from China's State Development Bank, the project
is the biggest of its kind since China vowed to clean the Huaihe
River by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River is one of the country's five-largest
rivers. Rising in Henan Province and crossing Anhui, Jiangsu and
Shandong provinces, it debouches into the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The project will replace the equipment of the Bengbu Alcohol
Plant which uses dried sweet potatoes as the raw material for
alcohol production with imported advanced equipment using corn.
</P>
<P>
The project will cut the plant's discharge of polluted water by
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity to produce 2,500 tons of alcohol, the plant
discharges half a million tons of untreated waste water containing
alcohol into the river every year, or 20 percent of Bengbu City's
total polluted water.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the local environmental protection department,
three other polluters, including the Bengbu Paper-Making Plant, are
investing in technological renovation projects to reduce their
discharge of polluted water into the river.
</P>
<P>
These projects, as well as the Bengbu Alcohol Plant renovation
project, will cut by half the total polluted water discharged by
the city into the river, local officials said.

potential to bridge the huge trade imbalance between the two
countries which at the moment favours Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of Ancient Kilns Brought to Light in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of well-preserved ancient
kilns have been discovered near Mount Miaopu in Dali City, in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Piles of tiles bearing unidentified inscriptions were
discovered in the kilns, which were dated by archeologists as
between the periods of the Nanzhao (737-902) and Dali (937-1253)
kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
The kilns are estimated to cover 5,000 sq m. Eighteen kilns
have already been identified in the 1,150-sq-m ruins. Most of the
kilns are well preserved, and their structures are clearly
visible. They are usually two to three m long and four m wide, and
cover areas of ten to 12 sq m each.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists judged by the Chinese character for "official" on
some titles that the kilns were run by the government, and other
symbols resembling Chinese characters were used by the locals of
Bai ethnic group to represent their national language.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists in Yunnan have previously discovered similar
tiles near Dali.
</P>
<P>
Dali served as the capital of both the Nanzhao and Dali
kingdoms, whose territory covered present-day Yunnan, southern
Sichuan Province, western Guizhou Province and the western part of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The archeological findings show that Yunnan had close ties with
central China during the eighth and 13th centuries, and had an
advanced economy and civilization, archeologists said.

PHNOM PENH, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) President Chea Sim has reportedly decided to travel to
Beijing on Friday to meet King Norodom Sihanouk.

<P>
Mulwanira said that the Ugandan Surveys and Mapping
Department, set up in 1903 to produce maps for water resources
development, geological exploitation, transport, communication
and urban infrastructure studies, has suffered from looting and
obsolete equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The commencement of the project was very opportune because
the turn-over of documentation will meet the rising demand at the
current rate of development of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project Manager Dominique Lasselin was quoted as saying
that the project is updating Uganda's carographic data base by
using satellites "spot" currently orbiting the earth taking
pictures of selected areas.
</P>
<P>
The other major aim of the project is to set up a land
information system, he added.

<HEADLINE> Checks Intensifed on Scrap Metal Imported Into Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Imported scrap metal being shipped
into northwest China is being strictly checked for radioactive
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Now officials have revealed that in the past year 13 tons of
scrap metals were found to be contaminated with radioactivity,
revealed Zhang Yuechun, head of the regional environmental
monitoring department.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China is now
paying closer attention to checks of imported used metals to
prevent any further radioactive polluted metals from getting into
the country.
</P>
<P>
The region introduced border examinations of imported used
metals for radioactive pollution in 1993, and came upon the first
pollution last year.
</P>
<P>
In late March last year, checks of the 2,500 tons of used metal
imported from Karzakhstan by technicians from the regional
environmental monitoring department found three tons of used
copper and iron with surface radiation surpassing safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Since April of last year checks have uncovered a further 13
tons of imported used metals with radioactive contamination.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that all the contamination detected was surface
radiation, and no radiation source has been found within the
metals. Most of the contaminated metal was returned to its place
of origin, and a small amount has been properly sealed.
</P>
<P>
In coordination with the regional imports and exports
inspection bureau, the department has recently completed a
research on radiation detection methods for imported used metals,
which can effectively help with the examination of large
quantities in a short time.
</P>
<P>
A recent inspection by a State Council team recognized
Xinjiang's technical ability to check polluted metals and its
efficiency in discovering such metals at the border in a short
time to ensure that the health of border residents will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is holding talks with countries
concerned to seek cooperation in the drive to stop radioactive
contaminated goods from getting onto the market.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation to control used imported metals is soon to be
implemented in Xinjiang, which stipulates that a company can only
import used metals after getting approval from the State
Environmental Protection Bureau, and environmental risk evaluation
must be conducted on processors of used metals.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Israel Likely to Benefit From Iraq-UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unofficial trade with
Iraq is expected to increase significantly with the U.N. decision
to allow Iraq to sell oil to buy food and medicine, According to
Israeli media reports.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted diplomatic sources as saying
that Israeli companies currently are estimated to be selling
about 2 million U.S. dollars worth of food and medicine, routed
through Jordan, to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In return, Iraq supplies Israel with oil, largely through
Jordan's port of Aqaba, which shares the Gulf of Elat with
Israel's port of Elat, said the sources, who have had indirect
contacts with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the partial lifting of U.N. embargo will
allow the unofficial trade between Israel and Iraq to blossom,
and one estimate is that Israel could increase its trade to 100
million U.S. dollars within a year.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official said local private firms are
conducting trade with virtually every state in the Arab world,
including Iraq and Libya, through third parties, and much of it is
done without Israeli government intervention.
</P>
<P>
"They do not ask us for help because they are doing business
themselves very nicely," said the official, "As a result, we do
not have an exact estimate, and what we do know is that Israel's
trade with the Arab world is at least hundreds of millions of
dollars."
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post also pointed out that Turkey, a key Israeli
ally and trading partner, will also benefit from the
U.N. decision regarding Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Israeli sources as saying that they could
tap into the brisk trade that is expected to develop between
Turkey and Iraq when Iraqi oil exports resume.
</P>
<P>
"The partial lifting of the embargo will enable oil to flow
through the pipeline to Turkey and also allow full Turkish exports
to Iraq," said Seyfi Tashan, director of the private Foreign
Policy Institute in Ankara, capital of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tashan is currently visiting Israel to attend a forum at
Israel's Bar-Ilan University's BESA Center for Strategic
Studies.

Of the 537 elected Lok Sabha seats, the BJP and its allies won
only 195.

DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's new chief of the army
staff Maj. Gen. Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman has taken over the
command and discipline in all ranks of the army has been restored,
according to a press release from the military.
</P>
<P>
The situation was tense in the army and the capital Dhaka on
Monday following the forced retirement of the former chief of the
army staff A.S.M. Nasim by the Defense Ministry under President
Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry accused Nasim of disobeying the government's order
and violating the rule of the army with "a ploy of rebellion" by
moving troops towards Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, Nasim and other five army
officers have been put under house arrest on charges of
involvement in the abortive mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops which had earlier moved from Bogra and
Momensingh in the north towards Dhaka were forced to return to
their respective barracks after President Biswas' appeal.
</P>
<P>
Normalcy has been restored in the capital and the army
headquarters in the Dhaka cantonment, although security measures
taken in and around the capital city on Monday remain in force.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have announced that the general election fixed on
June 12 will be held on schedule. "The Election Commission is
making all-out efforts to hold the coming polls in a free, fair
and neutral atmosphere within the stipulated time-frame," Chief
Election Commissioner Abu Hena said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Foreign Minister Reaffirms Intention to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Kasem S.
Kasemsri has reaffirmed his intention to resign, but added that it
is up to the prime minister when he was to leave.
</P>
<P>
Kasem is serving under the quota of the Nam Thai (Thai
leadership) party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan,
but has been under pressure to quit from his own party members on
the ground that he failed to be elected an MP during the general
elections last July.
</P>
<P>
Kasem was first Thai ambassador to China and permanent
secretary of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Before the Asia-Europe meeting in early March, Kasem told the
press of his decision to quit.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa reportedly requested
Kasem to stay on for the time being to help prepare his scheduled
foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
Although it was reported last week that the prime minister had
promised a cabinet reshuffle this weekend, now he appeared to be
vague on when the reshuffle would take place.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Soldiers' Mutiny in Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people have been killed
and more than 60 others wounded in a three-day soldiers' riot, the
second in one month, in the capital of the Central African
Republic, reports reaching here tonight said.
</P>
<P>
Tension was mounting in Bangui where gunshots could be heard
throughout the day today, the reports said. France and the United
States have responded swiftly by sending thousands of troops to
protect their nationals there.
</P>
<P>
The riot began on May 18 when about 250 soldiers took to the
streets in protest against a government order to disarm their unit
and demanding a formal amnesty for soldiers involved in another
riot last month.
</P>
<P>
The mutinous soldiers, equipped with light and heavy weapons,
have clashed fiercely with the presidential guard. They also held
hostage one cabinet minister, the army's chief of general staff,
the speaker of the National Assembly and the father of Prime
Minister Gabriel Koya-Gbenou.
</P>
<P>
But the reports said President Ange Patasse was safe with the
protection of his squad of bodyguards and the French troops
stationed in the country, and has appealed to the soldiers to
exercise restraint and hold dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations which started this morning have been on and off
and fruitless, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 French villas were plundered and France, which
maintains 1,300 troops in the former French colony, has sent 1,400
more servicemen there to protect its hundreds of nationals and
help them leave the country. The French troops are also helping
guard the republic's presidential palace and parliament building.
</P>
<P>
The United States also dispatched a group of Marines to Bangui
to protect its embassy and more than 300 Americans there.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, about 400 soldiers staged a two-day uprising to
demand immediate payment of their three months of overdue
salaries, leaving nine soldiers and civilians dead and more than
35 others injured. The uprising ended with a government promise to
pay the salaries in arrears and grant amnesty to all mutineers.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Engineers from Ukraine and Russia are
quickening the making of a new sample aircraft type AH-70 as the
scheduled trial flight draws nearer.
</P>
<P>
A first sample of AH-70 aircraft crashed last year after it
collided with the escort plane during the trial flight.
</P>
<P>
About 800 factories and departments from CIS nations have been
involved in the research and production of the plane.
</P>
<P>
AH-70, a kind of jumbo transport plane, is designed by the
Antonov Aviation Bureau of Ukraine using the world's latest
technology in aircraft making.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Committee
of Defense Industry of Russia decided to produce a second sample a
week after the crash.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Ukrainian government announced that
the trial flight of the second sample is scheduled to be conducted
in June-July, and decided to provide any possible help, including
financial help, to secure its success.

<P>
MADRID, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and Spain should defend
their common interests within the framework of the European Union
(EU), visiting Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Spanish Prime Minister Mario Aznar, Sampaio said
that both nations should work for European integration and try to
meet convergence criteria for joining the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
However, no country should rely totally on others for its own
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of EU's enlargement, Sampaio said he hoped
countries in central and eastern Europe would join the 15-member
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders also decided to renew negotiations on the use of
rivers running through the neighboring countries and try to reach
an agreement by the end of this year.

This is Sampaio's first visit as president to Spain. He will
return home on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Votes to Lower Gasoline Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- With gasoline prices
stabilizing, the U.S. House of Representatives voted today to
temporarily suspend a 4.3 cent-per-gallon tax increase imposed in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The vote, 301 to 108, came as the U.S. Energy Department
predicted that retail prices of gasoline would fall as much as 6
cents a gallon by Independence Day, July 4, even with no action on
federal tax levels.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline tax increase was imposed by President Bill Clinton
and the Democrat-controlled Congress three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Today's vote returns the tax to its pre-1993 level of 14 cents
a gallon through the end of the year. The tax would return to 18.3
cents a gallon if no further action is adopted by then.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have linked cutting the gasoline tax with raising the
federal minimum wage which has been opposed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has indicated he would sign both measures if they reach
his desk at around the same time.
</P>
<P>
"They ought to go hand in hand," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said today.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the temporary rollback will be about 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars. Some Democrats argued that reducing the gas tax
would increase the budget deficit and hurt energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey showed that gasoline prices in U.S. averaged
1.30 dollars per gallon nationally last week and were little
changed from the previous two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Vital for Agricultural Research: Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called on agricultural researchers from around the world to work
together to find ways to meet the increasing demand for
agricultural and forestry products.
</P>
<P>
Opening a mid-term meeting of the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Tuesday at the Merdeka
Palace here, the president said that it was imperative that
agricultural and forestry productivity should be increased and
pushed forward by technological progress.
</P>
<P>
"But finding new technologies like these requires
time-consuming research, lots of experts and large amounts of
money. Thus, in order to make this more efficient and effective,
it is important that research centers at the national and
international levels cooperate," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto added that technology transfer was also a crucial
aspect since developing countries had limited resources to promote
research.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, hosted by the Ministry of Forestry's
Research and Development Agency, will focus on evaluating and
assessing CGIAR's programs over the past year, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
CGIAR, which involves both the government and private sectors,
studies ways to increase natural resources productivity, to
maintain biological diversity and to promote technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1970, it oversees 17 research agencies,
including the West Java-based Center for International Forestry
Research (CIFOR), the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
and the International Center for Research into Agro-forestry.
</P>
<P>
CIFOR has research projects in the tropical rain-forests of
South America, Asia and Africa. In Indonesia, it conducts research
on 300,000 hectares of forest area in the Kayan Mentarang region
of East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's tropical rain-forests are the world's third largest
after Brazil and Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Survey: US Cities Face Shortages of Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States is facing
critical shortages of teachers in largest cities, and some urban
schools have to hire uncertified teachers, a survey says.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Recruiting New Teachers Inc.,
Council of the Great City Schools and the Council of the Great
City Colleges of Education, which comprises more than 60 schools
of education serving large city districts.
</P>
<P>
In many districts there was a pressing need for special
education, minority and bilingual education instructors, as well
as math, science and elementary teachers, said the survey to be
released Wednesday but disclosed by local media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Demand is so keen for such instructors and teachers in the Los
Angeles Unified School District that once one is hired, the
district immediately starts searching again.
</P>
<P>
Michael Acosta, administrator of employment operations for the
district, said, "What it causes us to do is to recruit people who
aren't fully credentialed -- they're working and training at the
same time."
</P>
<P>
The survey responded by 39 school districts found that 77
percent of the districts hire uncertified teachers; 64 percent let
uncertified teachers teach with emergency licenses; 40 percent
allow long-term substitutes to be hired; and 33 percent permit
teachers to use provisional licenses.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to get worse because of increasing
enrollment and rising teacher retirements.
</P>
<P>
The National Education Association officials predicted that
quite a large number of the nation's public school teachers today
are moving into their retirement years and the student population
is increasing rapidly due to the mini-baby boom and increased
immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department says that the teaching force will grow
from 2.5 million in 1980 to 3.3 million by the year 2002. And more
than 90 percent of the large city school districts surveyed said
that there was an immediate demand for minority teachers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Food Exports Increase Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Export performance of Thailand's
food product industry has been showing a steady improvement,
according to Sanit Vorapanya, director-general of the Department
of Export Promotion.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend is the result of a rebound in the world
economy and a surge in food consumption in many countries, Sanit
was quoted today by local newspaper the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is among the world's five biggest exporters of food
products. Its food exports were worth 141.7 billion baht (5.7
billion US dollars) in 1994, rising 5.8 percent to reach 149.87
billion baht (5.99 billion US dollars) in 1995. The target for
this year is 163.54 billion baht (6.54 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Processed goods such as canned, frozen and dried marine foods
account for about 70 percent of the total. Among other items are
fresh and processed vegetables and fruit, and frozen poultry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's chief exporter of frozen and canned
shrimp and canned tuna, and the second biggest canned pineapple
exporter after the Philippines.

BUENOS AIRES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
affirmed today that if there is any change in the status quo in
the Malvinas Island, it will suspend its negotiations with Britain

<P>
JAKARTA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian armed forces,
flattered by its recent "success" in ending the four-month hostage
crisis in Irian Jaya, plans to form an anti-terrorist unit,
according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The planned special unit is part of the army special force
(Kopassus), army chief of staff Gen. Hartono said on Tuesday in
Cimahi, West Java, about 150 kilometers southeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Hartono said the plan to form the anti-terrorist unit had been
made long before the May 15 operation to rescue the hostages in
Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Kopassus, the operation managed to free nine of
the remaining 11 captives held by the Free Papua Movement (OPM)
since January 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
The other two hostages were found dead with deep cuts in their
bodies during the rescue operation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Experts Concerned About Oil Surplus After UN-Iraq Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- European oil experts expressed
concern today that the international oil market may face risks if
the OPEC does not cut its output after Iraq's partial reentry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement Monday
allowing Iraq to export oil of 2 billion U.S. dollars in six
months to purchase humanitarian food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Varzi, an expert based in London, said the OPEC output
may rise from 26 million barrels per day now to 27 million in
September, making it difficult for the market to absorb the daily
supplies from Iraq of 700,000 barrels, unless there is a reduction
of price. Although the international demand is on the rise, he
explained, the output of non-OPEC oil producers are also
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the international oil market faces
risks if OPEC does not cut its output, Varzi warned.
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency, responsible for coordinating
world oil consumption, said the main difficulty with the OPEC is
that its members always accuse each other of refusing to cut
output, with none willing to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members increased their output to occupy the
3.14-million-barrel vacancy left by Iraq, which was banned from
oil export in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has taken urgent measures
to check all types of fresh food products imported from Malaysia
to prevent the spread of cholera from Malaysia to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials at Thai-Malaysian border checkpoints, airports

virus can be carried by fresh food products, especially seafood,
according to a senior public health ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Permanent Secretary of Public Health Chalong
Khuanha has warned the Thai public not to travel to Malaysia for
at least two weeks for fear that they may be infected with
cholera.
</P>
<P>
Cholera was reported last Friday in Penang and has spread to
four northern Malaysian states, with over 400 people hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has vowed to stop the spread of the disease within 10
days.

Chinese Communist Party's absolute leadership over armed forces,
according to today's Liberation Army Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted General Chi as saying: "At any time and under

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Delhi Blast Rises to 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a powerful bomb
blast in the Indian capital of Delhi on Tuesday evening has risen
to at least 15 with more than 50 injured, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
But some of the reports put the toll at least 25.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which shook several multi-storied buildings in the
crowded Lajpat Nagar Central Market in South Delhi, took place at
6:45 p.m. local time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire triggered off by the blast raged for two hours and
engulfed the area in the smoke.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the bomb used was suspected to have been
placed in a van which was parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the blast took place when the nation was observing
anti-terrorist day.
</P>
<P>
Two kashmiri militant outfits have claimed responsibility for
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to further increase as the rescue
operations continue to search for those trapped in the destroyed
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Trade Partners Criticize U.S. Policies on Trade Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. practice of unilateral trade
sanctions became the target of criticism from U.S. main Western
trading partners as an annual meeting of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) opened here today.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day ministerial meeting of the OECD, representatives
from Europe, Canada and Japan demanded that the United States
immediately stop its current practice of unilateral trade measures
which have been banned in principle since the founding of the
World Trade Organization in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said
Washington's stubborn adherence to unilateral sanctions against
other nations was ruthlessly censured by all present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Deputy-President of the Commission of the European Union Leon
Brittan pointed out that the U.S. policy of sanctions would harm
all international trade agreements and that the United States is
trying to impose what it likes onto other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French news agency, Agence France Presse, noted
that the United States has been sticking to its sanction policies
by threatening sanctions not only against China in a row over
intellectual property rights, but also against European countries,
Mexico and Canada for their close business relationship with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
By so doing, it said, Washington would inevitably incur strong
criticism from and anger among its main trading partners.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, representatives from the 27 OECD countries will
discuss the economic situations in Western industrialized
countries, the bloc's future role and how to coordinate member
countries' economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Moves Towards Soft Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy is showing clear
signs of moving towards a soft landing, said Finance Minister
Surakiart Sathirathai.
</P>
<P>
He said in his monthly report to the cabinet that the current
account deficit and inflation dropped significantly in the first
quarter, and that no further corrective measures were being
considered by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Surakiart was quoted today by local newspaper the Bangkok Post
as saying that inflation in April was 6.7 percent, down from 7.4
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first quarter, the current account deficit
averaged 27 billion baht (1.08 billion US dollars) per month, down
from the 33.4 billion baht (1.33 billion US dollars) in the fourth
quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit also dropped from an average of 38.8 billion baht
(1.55 billion US dollars) per month in the fourth quarter last
year to 35.6 billion baht (1.42 billion US dollars) in the first
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Surakiart added that in March, commercial bank deposits
exceeded bank credits for the first time since 1992, partly
because the government policy to restrict lending and encourage
increased savings was working.
</P>
<P>
The private investment index, 120 points in November, dropped
to 115.8 in March. The index is compiled from the levels of
capital imports, cement consumption, credit extensions for
construction and manufacturing, and foreign equity inflows into
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said he was confident the economy could
maintain growth without overheating. In the absence of changes in
external factors, the economy should continue its present slowdown
until the end of the year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Probes Guillain Barre Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan public health
authorities are looking into cases of a flaccid paralysis that
behaves clinically like the Guillain Barre syndrome to see if
there are any links between them.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has set up a task force to study in depth
all the cases that have appeared in the country and has sent the
first samples to laboratories abroad for test.
</P>
<P>
At least six people with the symptom have been hospitalized in
the capital city, Juan Jose Amador, epidemiology director of the
Health Ministry, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Guillain Barre syndrome, named after two French doctors who
discovered it in the last century, is a disease that affects the
upper and lower limbs of human beings.
</P>
<P>
In certain cases it could paralyze the muscles which control
breathing and may cause death of the patient without proper
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The health official asked those Nicaraguans to remain calm. There
can be no certainty that these patients have had the Guillain
Barre syndrome until the results of lab tests are available, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he noted, the disease is not caused by a virus, nor is
it a contagious one and no deaths from this symptom have been
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
"Genetic predisposition is what makes some people get it," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Amador said about 40 cases of flaccid paralysis are treated in
the country every year, 10 to 15 of which behave like the Guillain
Barre syndrome.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM: Chechnya Being Rebuilt Despite Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that the reconstruction of Chechnya is
going ahead despite a shortage of funds and continued fighting in
the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has allocated 221 billion roubles (about
44.4 million U.S. dollars) for the settlement of Chechen refugees
this year, he told the state commission set up to resolve the
Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million square meters of housing and 346 kilometers
of heating pipes have been rebuilt so far in the capital Grozny,
said Chernomyrdin, who is also head of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Eighty of the 149 enterprises in the republic have been in
operation since the beginning of the year, and 69 oil fields put
into production last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 8 million square meters of housing, schools
for 65,000 students and hospitals which could accomodate 9,000
patients have been destroyed since December 1994, when Russian
troops entered Chechnya to disarm separatist rebels, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and agricultural workforce had shrunk by 40
percent and 30 percent respectively, and natural gas production
had fallen off sharply, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Chechnya, Russian troops were reported to have
begun a fresh assault Monday night on the western rebel stronghold
of Bamut, a former Russian missile base with silos and tunnels
designed to withstand nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops had seized most of the hills around Bamut and
part of the village after pounding the base and a nearby village
for two days, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Robson to Sign Contract with FC Barcelona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British coach Bobby Robson arrived
in Barcelona on Tuesday to formally sign a contract with FC
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Robson, who is expected to sign a two-year contract with the
first division club, will take on the position to replace famed
Dutch coach Johan Cruyff, who was unceremoniously fired on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
``Barcelona is giving me a great opportunity. I hope to bring
success back to the team,'' the 63-year-old coach of Portuguese
champion FC Porto said.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona missed out on three trophies it had in reach this
season but and has salvaged a spot in Europe by clinching third in
the 22-team first division with one week to play.
</P>
<P>
Cruyff led the team to four consecutive league titles between
1990-1994 and its first ever European Champions Cup in 1992. On
Sunday, tens of thousands of fans at the Camp Nou stadium clamored
for his reinstatement and the firing of club chairman Jose Luis
Nunez.
</P>
<P>
Robson, once manager of England's national side, was expected
to be formally presented as new coach on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last week he told British papers that Barcelona was one of the
teams he had always dreamed of coaching.
</P>
<P>
``That is all I want, then I will bow out of football. But what a
way for me to go as manager of one of the really great clubs,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Export Mix Needs Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The shadow of sluggish exports in
the January-April period will probably continue, but there is
still no need for the central government to devalue the Chinese
yuan to bail out exporters, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Li Hua, an official with the Export Section of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, was quoted as saying that "this
will be the last ditch."
</P>
<P>
The negative growth in export industry will likely keep on in
the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
China's exports have dropped since last November, hampered by
double-digit inflation and delays in payment of export tax rebates
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show total exports in the first four months
of this year down 7.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped by a much larger margin in general trade,
falling by approximately 30 percent in April. From January to
April combined, exports in general trade totalled 16.13 billion
US dollars, down by 29.7 percent from the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The official urged the central government to take a
wait-and-see attitude before making any big moves.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Hua, China's foreign exchange reserves reached
a record high of 81.8 billion US dollars at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
An artificial devaluation of the yuan would force the central
bank to increase the money supply and therefore exacerbate
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
"But there still exists a possibility for the central
government to depreciate the currency if exports collapse rapidly
in the latter half of the year," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the difficulties in devaluing the yuan, it is
hard for the central government to raise the rate of export tax
rebates to spur exports due to a shortage of State funds.
</P>
<P>
The government's promise to return the export tax rebates will
somewhat comfort exporters.
</P>
<P>
The trade analyst hopes that the cut in interest rates and
further efforts against inflation will slow down the export drop
during the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Tomba May Face Charges of Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Skiing superstar Alberto Tomba may
face charges for using a police signal and siren to skirt traffic
while driving his private car, Tomba's lawyer said in Verona,
Italy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report reaching here, Prosecutors are
seeking to charge Tomba with theft and misconduct for using the
equipment to weave through a busy road leading to Cortina
D'Ampezzo, a popular ski resort in northern Italy, on December 26,
1993, said the attorney, Maurizio Paniz.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Tomba was a non-commissioned officer of the
carabinieri, Italy's para-military police corps. He left the corps
in March.
</P>
<P>
Paniz said he urged a military judge Tuesday to dismiss the
charges.
</P>
<P>
``Tomba used nothing that was not his own,'' Paniz said. ``He
is a young man who has full respect for and complete faith in
justice,'' Paniz added.
</P>
<P>
The judge will decide in the next few days whether to lodge the
charges, dismiss them, or order more investigation, Paniz said.

<HEADLINE> Questioning of Colombian General Prosecutor Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Accusation Committee
of the Chamber of Representatives in Colombia postponed
indefinitely today its questioning of General Prosecutor Alfonso
Valdivieso which was scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by parliamentary investigator Sido
Alfonso Crispin who declared that he is waiting for the decision
of the Constitutional Court regarding the procedure for putting
officials with immunity on trial.
</P>
<P>
The postponed trial was the result of inquiries from several
sectors about why a preliminary investigation of the chief
prosecutor was not opened before calling him for questioning,
said a report by the local Nation Radio Network.
</P>
<P>
The general prosecutor was charged by the Accusation Committee
on March 26, 1996, with irregularities in leasing a state-owned
lot without paying rent in 1991 when he was serving as education
minister under the government of Cesar Gaviria Trujillo.

<HEADLINE> Croatia's Rebel Serb Enclave Starts Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Jacques Paul Klein, head of the U.N. Transitional
Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem,
announced the news in Beli Manastir of the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of U.N. peacekeepers, Serb forces will be
dissolved and their weapons collected in the following 30 days, as
stipulated in an agreement reached between the Croatian government
and rebel Serbs last November.
</P>
<P>
The minority Serbs revolted against Croatia's separation from
the former Yugoslavia in 1991 and seized one-third of the country,
including Eastern Slavonia and two other tracts of territory in
the south. They had been trying to unite with the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, but the hope was finally dashed after Croatia
recaptured its southern territory last fall.
</P>
<P>
In the Dayton talks sponsored by the United States, Croatia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which negotiated on behalf of
Croatia's rebel Serbs, agreed that Eastern Slavonia will be
reintegrated into Croatia peacefully after a maximum two-year
period of U.N. administration. The accord on the region's
demilitarization was later signed by Croatia and rebel Serbs.

<P>
Germany is South Africa's top partner in trade and economic
cooperation and enjoys a healthy trade surplus, exporting double
what it imports.

<HEADLINE> Three Million-Year Old Glyptodon Remains Found in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentine archaeologists
confirmed today that the remains of a glyptodon found in the
coastal city of Mar Del Plata this month is three million years
old.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists of the "Lorenzo Scaglia" municipal museum said
that on May 7 a man accidentally found the remains in a garbage
dump in the city.
</P>
<P>
They said, the animal should weigh about 400 kilograms, measure
1.20 meters long and 60 centimeters high.
</P>
<P>
The remains are complete and in good condition, with its jaw,
backbone from the neck down, ribs and other parts.
</P>
<P>
The age of the skeleton was determined by a study of layers of
sedimentary rock which belonged to the "Chapadmalal Formation"
dating back to the end of the Tertiary Period.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Attracts More Tourists, Who Spend Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay attracted 853,600
foreign tourists in the first three months of this year, an
increase of 5.2 percent over the same period last year, but more
tourists have not brought more foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released here today by the Tourism
Ministry, despite the increase in numbers, total spending by
tourists during the period decreased 11.4 percent to 337.3 million
U.S. dollars from 380.7 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The average amount spent per tourist in the first quarter of
1996 was 395 dollars, compared to 469 dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account Uruguay's 5.7 percent inflation, average
spending by tourists has fallen 20.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that tourists from Paraguay and Brazil
increased 37.4 and 32.7 percent respectively, but those from
Argentina - traditionally the main source of tourists to Uruguay-
increased a mere 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism sources attributed the decreased spending by tourists
to the economic recession in neighboring countries, especially
Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Beaten in World Team Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras was beaten surprisingly
at the World Team Cup tennis tournament and watched the United
States lost to the Czech Republic in Dusseldorf, Germany on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Playing his first tournament for a month, the world number one
was beaten 7-6 (7/5), 2-6, 6-3 by Bohdan Ulihrach, who ranked 38
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Petr Korda had earlier given the Czech Republic a winning start
in the best-of-three match format with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 win over
Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
Sampras broke to take a 2-0 lead but lost his own serve in the
next game when he netted a forehand. Another forehand error
allowed Ulihrach to break for 6-5, but this time Sampras broke
back.
</P>
<P>
A hail storm that stopped play at 6-6 should have given Sampras
an opportunity to re-group, but the greater stability he showed in
the second set didn't last long. Although Sampras broke to lead
the final set 1-0, Ulihrach took the next five games and served
for victory.
</P>
<P>
"As my first match for quite a while it felt pretty good, but
my shot selection wasn't great," said Sampras, who spent the
weekend practising at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally I'm as good as I can be right now, but the conditions
were very slow because of the weather. The problem was that the
hail was getting me in the eye."
</P>
<P>
Rain prevented the doubles being played on Tuesday, and left
the tie between Russia and the Netherlands tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Kafelnikov took almost two hours to overcome Richard
Krajicek 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-5. But Paul Haarhuis put the
Netherlands on level terms when he overcame Andrei Chesnokov 7-5,
6-3.

SHANGHAI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30 sets of electronic
devices have been introduced to Hongqiao Airport here to
drive away birds.
</P>
<P>
The airport is the first in China to use electronic devices for
this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the airport authorities had to use fire brigades
and water cannons to expel birds hovering over the airport and
posing a danger to airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The devices reproduce high-pitched bird calls, and each device
can cover an area of 0.8 ha.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Garbage Being Loaded Back into Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The imported waste found in the
suburban county of Pinggu near China's capital has begun to be
sealed into containers.
</P>
<P>
Ten empty containers were sent Monday afternoon by the China
Ocean Shipping Corporation, which was involved in shipping
in the garbage.
</P>
<P>
"The loading is to prevent the spread of waste and occurrence
of epidemic diseases," said Jin Ruquan, deputy director of the
Pinggu County Sanitation and Antiepidemic Station Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the garbage imported from the United Stated was found,
the station has taken several sterilization actions.
</P>
<P>
"No epidemic diseases have been found yet. However, there is no
guarantee that epidemic diseases may not break out in following
days," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
The loading started at a quarter to two Monday afternoon.
Twenty-two workers in blue overalls, masks and knee-high boots put
four forklift trucks and a crane to work. Dust flew into the air,
and irritating disinfectants and noxious gases assailed the
nostrils.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the COSC said the garbage would not be fully loaded
until May 27. The loaded containers will be transfereed to a
container storage place of the company.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Beijing municipal customs, commodity
inspection and health departments were present at the loading
site.
</P>
<P>
The garbage has so far been stored in 19 containers with a
total weight of 640 tons. Part of it has been treated and there is
about 500 tons left.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists to Salvage Sunken Chinese warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists are planning
to salvage four warships sunk by the Japanese navy at the end of
the last century.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), launched by Japan to
annex Korea and invade China, the Chinese navy of the imperial
Qing government suffered heavy losses, which included the sinking
of four warships newly bought from Western countries in the
Yellow Sea off northern China.
</P>
<P>
Captain Deng Shichang who went down with his warship "Zhiyuan",
has become a household name in China over the past 100 years, and
his story was the subject of a popular film.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists from the Underwater Archeology Research Office
under the Museum of Chinese History will carry out the technical
work of the project, according to the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics.
</P>
<P>
"All the cultural relics, including the warships salvaged from
the water, will be taken over by the local cultural administration
bureau of Donggang City, Liaoning Province," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Donggang is planning to build a museum specializing in the
Sino-Japanese naval war to house the salvaged relics and warships,
the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China has always attached
importance to relations between China and the United States and
maintained that there are lots of common interest between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
this was stated by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen while
answering questions from the press here today. Qian is
accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his six-nation
African tour.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is in accordance with the basic interest of
the peoples of both countries and for the sake of world peace and
development to promote bilateral normal relations based on the
three joint communiques between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
While handling relations with the United States, Qian said,
China has always followed the principle of "promoting mutual
trust, strengthening cooperation, reducing frictions and
discarding confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that on questions concerning the fundamental
interest of the nation and the people, we stand on principle and
have to take necessary and appropriate measures," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said it was wise for President Bill Clinton to extend
unconditionally the most-favored-nation trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. Secretary of State W. M. Christopher's May 17 speech
on relations with China, Qian said he appreciated Christopher's
positive attitude to promote relations with China.
</P>
<P>
It was in accordance with reality that Christopher laid
emphasis on the importance of such relations, though some of his
viewpoints could not be agreed on, said the Chinese Minister.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he would like to meet Christopher in July and
discuss sincerely with him on development of Sino-U.S. relations,
as was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of State in his May 17
speech.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Own PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. homes with
personal computers jumped 16 percent last year, the Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was obtained from a random survey conducted by the
Computer Intelligence Infocorp, based on interviews with 11,500 PC
users, the paper said. It indicated that 38.5 percent U.S.
households have one or more PCs, or 38 million households, up from
33.1 percent in 1994 and 25.7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, another big research firm, Dataquest Inc.,
predicted that the growth in home-PC shipments would dwindle to
7.6 percent this year and less than 1 percent next year, mainly
because of a sharp drop in the number of first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
But Computer Intelligence predicts that home-PCs shipments,
excluding the home-office segment, will jump 23 percent in the
U.S. this year to 9.8 million units, compared with a 27 percent
gain in 1995. For 1997, the firm expects 19 percent growth. One
reason, the paper said, is that is found in its survey that the PC
market appears to be broadening, supporting a relatively high
level of first-time buyers who accounted for 43 percent of all
purchases in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that PC owners buying an additional and
more powerful computer are increasingly important, accounting for
38 percent of all purchases in 1995, higher than the percentages
in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that more PC vendors will start
promoting lower-priced models, rather than continue to cram more
features into PCs costing dearly. But many PC makers are already
suffering from low profit margins in a brutally competitive
market, it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Renews Calls for Israel-Syria Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today renewed his call for Syria and Israel to reopen
their peace negotiations for the safety and stability in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy,
Christopher said he believed that peace agreements between Israel
and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon "are essential", and they
would "close the circle of peace" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we remain convinced that peace is possible...we
must continue to work with the parties to achieve a breakthrough
that would have far-reaching strategic consequences, not just
for the Middle East, but for America's security as well,"
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary has made more than a dozen visits to the
Middle East to promote peace between Israel and Syria since he
took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been suspended in
wake of suicide bombing attacks on Israeli targets in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that a comprehensive peace between the two
nations "will dramatically reduce the risks of another
Arab-Israeli war."
</P>
<P>
"It will remove the final constraints on Israel's having normal
relationships with the the entire Arab and Muslim world," he said.
