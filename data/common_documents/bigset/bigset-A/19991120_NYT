<P>
   In the language of international politics, few words are quite
as dirty as appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   It smacks of cowardice, wishful thinking and prevarication,
coupled with a naive belief that aggressors, once appeased, will go
away content, rather than returning for more and more.
</P>
<P>
   This was the lesson of the 1930s, and especially of the Munich
agreement in 1938, when Hitler was ``appeased'' with the
Sudetenland only to turn round and gobble up half Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So when anyone nowadays admits to appeasement, as Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, did this week, it is worth taking note.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of Annan's mea culpa was the publication of his
report on the Serb massacre of some 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in
Srebrenica, in Bosnia, in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. had declared Srebrenica a ``safe area,'' but this _ in
the words of the prosecutor at the war-crimes tribunal for former
Yugoslavia _ is what happened: ``thousands of men (were) buried and
executed in mass graves, hundreds of men buried alive, men and
women mutilated and slaughtered, children killed before their
mothers' eyes, a grandfather forced to eat the liver of his own
grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   Well might he speak of ``scenes from hell, written on the
darkest pages of human history.'' Annan, who was in charge of U.N.
peacekeeping at the time, is evidently no less shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,'' he
says, and he admits that the U.N. made terrible mistakes, including
negotiations with Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, the Serbs' leaders, which at times ``amounted to
appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons he draws is that ethnic cleansing ``must be
met decisively with all necessary means and with the political will
to carry the policy through to its logical conclusion.'' It is, he
points out, a lesson that has had to be drawn twice in the Balkans
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia and in Kosovo, the international community tried to
reach a negotiated settlement with an unscrupulous and murderous
regime. In both instances it required the use of force to bring to
a halt the planned and systematic killing and expulsion of
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's conclusion, however, is but part of a broader maxim that
he might have suggested should be adopted with all such aggressors,
and in all circumstances, not merely when they are bent on ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   It is this: that an early failure to warn aggressors clearly of
the consequences of their actions will almost inevitably either
allow them to get away with their aggression, or lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity _ which is usually the handmaiden of indecision and
lack of will _ may indeed be just as dangerous as appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   This, alas, is the lesson not just of the 1990s, but of the 20th
century. In addition to the action in Bosnia and Kosovo, at least
five wars this century _ the two world wars, the Korean War, the
Falkands War and the Gulf War _ might all have been avoided had the
ultimate victors made it plain from the outset that they were
willing to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in each case (except perhaps the First World War), the
early message given was that no armed resistance would be offered.
That message was also given, accurately, on other occasions (to
China over Tibet, for instance, and Indonesia over East Timor),
with dire results.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the most successful unfought war of the
century, the Cold War, was notable for the absence of any ambiguity
about the West's readiness to take on its adversary.
</P>
<P>
   The West may have learned some lessons: the European Union is
now preparing to set up a rapid-reaction corps. Yet, as Annan
argues, such a force will be useless if aggressors do not believe
it will be used, and their belief will only be strengthened if the
West does not, from the outset, show that it has the will to fight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest tasks for western politicians in the
post-Cold-War world is to persuade public opinion that the surest
way to avoid more wars is, paradoxically, to display an unwavering
readiness to fight them. &QL;

SIDEWALK MASSEURS: A NEW CONVENIENCE IN NYC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regina Bradford had seen them a thousand _ who knew,
maybe a million _ times, but she had always been something of a
skeptic. ``Massage?'' she would think when she passed them in Soho
or Central Park. ``These guys? Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Wednesday, Nov. 10 _ a bad day, an apocalyptic
day. Her four-year relationship was on the rocks. Her beloved
terrier, Samson, had just gone to the vet with mysterious retching.
She was turned down for a lucrative gig. And to cap it off, Ms.
Bradford, a 31-year-old jazz singer, had developed a nasty little
crick in her neck.
</P>
<P>
   So when she came across the five Chinese massage guys clustered
near Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, she tossed doubt to the
wind and plopped down on one of their ergonomic chairs. Ten minutes
and $10 later, she rose with a smile and _ lo and behold _ her
aches and pains were mostly gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I feel pretty good,'' she said, giving her shoulders
a gentle test roll. ``It wasn't a miracle, but it was better than I
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, the Chinese chair masseurs are either
charlatans or chiropractic wonders. But they have undisputably
moved beyond their minor sideshow role at festivals and street
fairs, popping up in the city's parks and squares and on sidewalks
wide enough to accommodate their padded chairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to tell precisely how many of them are at work
on the streets on a given day. They usually practice without city
permits and, though they are required to file for state massage
licenses, many do not, officials say, opening them up to criticism
among professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But in a metropolis where being stressed out might as well be an
Olympic event, the mobile massage squads offer a possible dose of
bliss to curious passers-by or even longtime Swedish and shiatsu
fans looking for a quick, convenient fix.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority practice a brand of Chinese massage called Tui
Na (pronounced twee-nah), a subset of the larger art of physical
healing known as qigong (pronounced chee-goong), which attempts to
harness the body's energy, an intangible force called qi in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spend 10 minutes, give you a little qi, and you feel
better,'' said Michael Winn, president of the National Qigong
Association, whose group has grown to 400 members from 100 members
just two years ago. ``They're actually meeting a need caused by a
fast-paced life of tension and fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Li Xing, for example, a lanky man with veiny hands, who set
up his chair in Central Park the other day. Though Li, 39, arrived
in New York from China only a year ago, he already considers
himself an important part of Manhattan's stress-reduction team.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, outdoor Tui Na seems anything but relaxing.
There is no padded table, no wafting scent of incense, no oceanic
soundtrack or pan-pipe music drifting through the room. Instead,
clients hunker down on duct-taped chairs, their foreheads pressed
against circles of cracking foam. Police sirens often skirl in the
background. Frankfurter smells float by. Sometimes, people stop to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, under the fingers of masseurs like Li, tension
slides from achy muscles, the back loosens up, the shoulders drop.
Techniques vary: some practitioners knead the flesh, others slap or
karate chop. The focus tends to be the spine. But arms are shaken
and necks are rubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers are like acupuncture needles,'' Li explains.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the masseurs will spend the morning and afternoon in
one of the city's parks, then move on to evening spots like Prince
Street or the northern fringes of Times Square. In spring and
summer, they say, they often work on 10 to 20 customers a day at
the rate of a dollar a minute. Come winter, many abandon their
chairs for jobs in Chinese restaurants or take-out stands.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are hundreds of qigong schools across the country,
most of the street masseurs said they learned their craft from
relatives in China or through informal lessons from friends in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Shenyang province five years ago, Jack Feng
learned Tui Na from a pal in the military and eventually, he said,
worked as the official masseur for the Chinese air force volleyball
team. Now, he spends his weekdays serving clients in the park and
his weekends charging up to $70 an hour to visit private customers
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dance teacher, a waiter and many, many businessmen,''
said Feng, 37. ``Some customers come here to Central Park and like
me. Then, they give me their card.''
</P>
<P>
   A private practice is a cherished thing among the masseurs
because, as they said, the police sometimes run them out of parks
or plazas, issuing tickets and sometimes confiscating their chairs.
``Two times this has happened to me,'' said Li. ``Two times I have
bought a new chair.''
</P>
<P>
   The masseurs walk a fine line with state regulators, who require
that they be licensed, said Dr. Kathleen Doyle, executive secretary
of the state Board for Massage Therapy. ``If they're actually doing
what's considered within the scope of massage, they need a
license,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Liben, dean of the massage therapy program at the Swedish
Institute, said Tui Na is a well-respected form of massage and is
taught at her own school, but added that nearly all the street
masseurs were unlicensed and could present a danger to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a lot of frustration among our graduates who made
a tremendous investment in their training,'' she said. ``They often
see customers being solicited on the streets by people with no
guarantee that they have training in safety, hygiene or any of the
other standards we hold ourselves to.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of official training on the part of the Chinese
masseurs does not seem to keep people away from their chairs.
Cheap, convenient and fast _ the words were used again and again to
describe why customers stopped for a massage.

LAW'S DOOM WAS SEALED LONG AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The scrapping of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall law was a triumph of financial industry evolution
over public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Since financial markets have become more accessible to average
Americans, there have been two constants: While controversy over
Glass-Steagall was a source of continual financial industry
infighting, average users of financial services and products seemed
for the most part unaware of the restraints under which the
financial markets worked.
</P>
<P>
   After the landmark legislation recently passed into history, the
relative lack of media analysis was testimony to how little it had
meant to most Americans outside the banking, investment and
insurance industries. The inattention also seemed to reflect how
irrelevant the law had become as the various players found ways to
circumvent it.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the 1933 law was its separation of commercial
banking and investment banking and the creation of federal deposit
insurance. It was born of the mistaken belief that stock market
wheeling and dealing by bankers in the '20s had led to the massive
wave of bank failures that transformed a garden-variety economic
downturn into the Great Depression of the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of universal insurance coverage for bank depositors was
spurred by the need to restore public confidence, which could only
be done by assuring people that Uncle Sam wouldn't allow anyone to
lose money if a bank went bust.
</P>
<P>
   Analyses over the years by a number of economic historians has
undermined the conventional wisdom blaming irresponsible bankers
for the '30s debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist recently cited work by Emory University's George
Benston, whose extensive research has led to the theory that
restrictions on interstate banking were more the cause of the
collapse. This restriction left the asset portfolios of small banks
dangerously undiversified. On the other hand, Benston found, large
banks with securities operations were less likely to have failed
than those without.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging popularity of money market mutual funds starting
about 20 years ago was an early sign that a new generation of
Americans was willing to entrust large sums of cash to uninsured
financial intermediaries. This occurred even as deposit insurance
coverage was being expanded dramatically for banks and S&AMP;Ls against
a backdrop of the worst wave of financial institution failures
since the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, banks were doing an end-run around Glass-Steagall by
offering money market funds, discount brokerage services and the
like. More recently mergers of banking firms and financial firms
involved in activities Glass-Steagall was supposed to keep separate
further diluted the law's force.
</P>
<P>
   If the market is indeed a safer place today than it was seven
decades ago, analysts tend to give much more credit to the law
establishing the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission than
Glass-Steagall. The SEC's relentless quest to maintain market
transparency, say its supporters, has afforded the greatest
protection for average investors.
</P>
<P>
   The only people likely to miss Glass-Steagall will be the
congressional incumbents for whom it was a good lever with which to
pry campaign contributions from those seeking deliverance or
fighting to keep it.

   It is an irony worth pondering that, a couple of weeks before
the World Trade Organization meets in Seattle, the entire child
population of America is enslaved by a Japanese fad.

<P>
   The most heartfelt complaint of globalization's critics is that
the process leads inexorably to the triumph of American pop
culture. The French believe this so strongly that they have
repeatedly threatened to scupper trade talks unless ``cultural''
goods are exempted.

   A television series based on the Japanese pocket monsters is the

Pokemon.com is the most popular Web site for children of 12 and

<P>
   Hollywood is so lathered up about the child wizard that all the
town's leading directors, from Steven Spielberg to Barry Levinson,
are squabbling over the rights to direct the film and Time Warner,
the studio that owns the rights to the books, is muttering about a
billion-dollar franchise, with sequels, television shows, cartoon
spin-offs, theme-park rides, interactive games and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   And for younger children yet another British product, the
Teletubbies, is almost as popular as that quintessentially American
program, ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   This triple invasion not only disproves the idea that Americans
have a monopoly of popular culture. It also disproves the idea that
non-Americans have a monopoly of silly complaints about the evils
of popular culture, particularly the foreign-made variety.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell, a televangelist, played on a widespread American
suspicion that the British favor homosexuals when he ``outed'' one
of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, on the ground that he carries a
handbag.
</P>
<P>
   Other evangelists have called for the Harry Potter books to be
banned for promoting superstition and witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine calls Pokemon a ``pestilential Ponzi scheme'' that
encourages acquisitiveness and aggression. It also portrays its
inventor as a Japanese misfit who obsessively collected beetles as
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek asks ``Is Pokemon evil?'' (though, to be fair, it
answers ``probably not'').
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego law firm has filed a class-action suit against the
manufacturer of Pokemon cards on the ground that they promote
illegal gambling; and a Colorado preacher required children in his
congregation to watch as he torched Pokemon cards and chopped up a
Pokemon toy with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the anti-globalist growl is that global
companies are marketing fads to children with a ruthlessness that
verges on the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro is indeed churning out licensed toys and collectibles.
Burger King is giving away 57 varieties of Pokemon in a $22 million
promotion. The Pokemon television show functions as a relentless
advertisement for a cavalcade of products.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the fad for every age. Toys pull in young
children, who then move on to cards and other collectibles before
finally graduating to Nintendo's video games. And there is more to
come: a hundred more Pokemon on their way from Japan to add to the
151 that have already arrived on America's shores. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conclusions that anti-globalists draw from this
evidence of ruthlessness are mistaken. They are wrong to argue that
everything is being reduced to marketing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder bins of the world's toyshops are full of brilliant
ideas that were dreamed up by marketing departments only to be
forcefully rejected by children. And the people behind the latest
fads sweeping through young America are mavericks, not cynical
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling is a publicity-shy divorcee who wrote her first
Harry Potter book when she was on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Tajiri, the man behind Pokemon, persisted with his idea
even when Nintendo told him that technology was passing it by. He
then persisted with it again when Nintendo America told him that
role-playing games were not popular with the local children, and
when a bizarre incident, in which 700 Japanese children had fits
while watching a Pokemon television program, put the idea of
exporting the craze under a cloud. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalists are also wrong when they argue that
conglomerates inevitably homogenize the ideas that they choose to
hoover up. Some of the Pokemon have certainly had their names
westernized: Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, has became
Squirtle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the little monsters still teach distinctively Japanese
values about the importance of team-building and performing your
duties. The only way to succeed at the game is to cooperate with
others _ and the easiest way to fail is to neglect to care for your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Hollywood about setting the filmed
version of Harry Potter in an American school, Hogwarts High,
complete with cheerleaders and a blonde girlfriend. But the moguls
soon decided that Britishness is part of the book's charm.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, played by a British actor, will still attend a
1,000-year-old school with crenellated towers and a Latin motto.
Hermione will not change her name to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon will soon be history; with luck, the sickeningly
cute Teletubbies will be history even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of children will find a new craze to fill
their time and soak up their parents' money. But why so many
cultural protectionists assume that the craze will be dreamed up by
some faceless American corporation rather than by a Japanese
bug-collector or a British welfare mother is getting more
mysterious by the day. &QL;

<P>
   It is an irony worth pondering that, a couple of weeks before
the World Trade Organization meets in Seattle, the entire child
population of America is enslaved by a Japanese fad.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt complaint of globalization's critics is that
the process leads inexorably to the triumph of American pop
culture. The French believe this so strongly that they have
repeatedly threatened to scupper trade talks unless ``cultural''
goods are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   The world's nongovernmental organizations believe it so strongly
that a collection of them have placed a series of huge
advertisements in the New York Times complaining about the
McDonaldization of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But any trade negotiator who feels tempted to agree should take
the precaution of consulting a ten-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' _ parents, note that threatening
adjective _ raked in over $50 million over its opening weekend; and
when a Los Angeles radio station announced a contest for free
tickets, 70,000 calls a minute overwhelmed its switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   A television series based on the Japanese pocket monsters is the
most popular children's program in the country. More than 50
million Pokemon game cards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The five top-selling video games are all Pokemon-themed.
Pokemon.com is the most popular Web site for children of 12 and
under, and eBay, an Internet auction house, is doing a roaring
business in rare Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not far behind the Japanese in the race to
seduce America's children. The literary sensation of the summer was
J.K. Rowling's trilogy about Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is so lathered up about the child wizard that all the

<P>
   The cookie-selling season is in full swing for America's 3.5
million Girl Scouts; troops up and down the country are setting up
stalls on street corners to raise money for good causes.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie-baking stereotype is one America holds dear, but the
organization itself would dearly love to shed it. At the Girl
Scouts' tri-annual conference held recently in Kansas City, they
accordingly launched a campaign to update their image.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, oatmeal-and-raisin; hello, girl power!
</P>
<P>
   A recent Harris poll reveals that two-thirds of America's
professional women have been Girl Scouts, including the singer
Natalie Merchant, the broadcast journalist Judy Woodruff, and Susan
Taylor, the editor-in-chief of Essence magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed that their time in a troop had improved their
ability to work with others, make friends and develop moral values.
</P>
<P>
   But although membership of the Girl Scouts is at its highest for
20 years and is still growing _ by 1.8 percent last year _ adult
leaders are proving hard to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   So Girl Scouts USA is putting out a series of public-service
announcements on radio and television, presented by such famous
former scouts as Cathy Rigby and Jessye Norman, to encourage older
women to act as mentors to younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   There remains an image problem: not only of cookies, but of
unrelenting camping and crafts, as well as a perception of
WASPishness.
</P>
<P>
   The association's leader, Marsha Johnson Evans, wants to change
all that. Girl Scouting, she says, is also about maths, sports and
computing, and may well lead on to a career in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the racial mix, Girl Scouts already closely reflect the
country at large. Figures gathered in September 1998 show that 10
percent of members are black, 5 percent are Latino and 78 percent
are white.
</P>
<P>
   There have been multiracial troops since 1912, when the
organization was first launched in the United States. The Girl
Scouts have also made some grass-roots changes to encourage
``problem'' girls to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Girl Scouts Beyond Bars'' project, first set up in 1992
in a women's penitentiary in Baltimore, daughters of women
prisoners are invited to join troops of Girl Scouts specifically
created for them.
</P>
<P>
   Similar troops are now attached to 20 prisons in 13 states.
Mothers on remand _ many themselves very young _ are encouraged to
join in the troop activities alongside their children.
</P>
<P>
   Another special project is the ``Border Program,'' which caters
for daughters of migrants living along the Mexican border (in some
of the worst conditions in the country) and has already enrolled
over 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts USA has just signed an agreement with the Texas
Migrant Council to make it easier for daughters of migrant farm
workers to enroll in local scout troops when they move within the
state.
</P>
<P>
   There are troops in homeless shelters and in care centers for
pregnant teenagers, and even juvenile delinquents in special
centers can become Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all this risk-taking, there are still no plans to
join forces with that greatest risk of all, boys. The organization
is resolutely girls-only, and points to numerous studies showing
that girls thrive alongside each other but do less well in mixed
groups. (In Britain, where girls have been able for years to join
the Boy Scouts, most still prefer to be Guides.)
</P>
<P>
   And there are certainly no plans to stop the cookie sales. This
form of fund-raising, says Johnson Evans, is a great teaching tool:
``The girls have to decide on their strategy, and it all takes a
lot of planning.'' Ideal groundwork for running the world. &QL;

911 SCARE ON Y2K WAS OVERSTATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ News out of the White House was scary: With
less than two months left until the year 2000, only half the
nation's 911 emergency systems are ready for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced it was gravely concerned that 911
remained a dangerous trouble spot, and many communities, including
Kansas City, quickly began re-evaluating their systems.
</P>
<P>
   But it now appears that threat was seriously overstated.
</P>
<P>
   How could such a high-level scare have occurred? Overstated
conclusions based on flimsy research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that surveying is not an exact science and
not necessarily reflective of the whole (911) community,'' Jack
Gribben, a Y2K spokesman for the White House, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Had the president's council known then what it does now, the
report would have reflected less concern, Gribben said.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with an Oct. 1 survey conducted by the National
Emergency Number Association of Columbus, Ohio, that never defines
what it means to be ``Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   On the organization's Web site _ www.nena9-1-1.org _ is a simple
two-question survey asking respondents to indicate whether their
911 call center is ``Y2K compliant.'' And if not, would it be
compliant by Jan. 1?
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere on the survey _ the only one the White House used to
draw its conclusions _ is there a description of what it means to
be ``compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   W. Mark Adams, executive director of the trade association,
interpreted ``compliant'' this way: If any piece of the
emergency-response puzzle is not in place, even though it does not
involve the critical mission of saving a life, the call center is
ill-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they can't handle their calls, it just means
some enhanced services might not be available right away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no telling what the survey respondents understood
``compliant'' to mean. In addition, only 2,700 of the nation's
4,300 911 systems answered the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the survey could have been worded better and sent the
wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the report left the perception that 911 is not
going to work,'' he said. ``We could have been smarter in our
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Y2K watchers were quick to draw conclusions from the study,
without questioning the methodology behind the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this very, very seriously,'' Don Meyer, a spokesman
for the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology
Problem, said earlier this month. ``And our information tells us
911 is still a major Y2K concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, 911 calls might go through immediately but
the software that automatically pinpoints the location of the call
might not work.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, the President's Year 2000 Conversion Council
reported that only half the nation's 911 systems were ``Y2K
compliant,'' without defining what that meant. The council moved
911 to the top of its list of Y2K trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Some Y2K watchers have gone further, interpreting the survey to
mean that an accident victim at midnight of the Year 2000 would
have only a 50-50 chance of receiving timely medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The White House report also set off another Y2K ripple of
anxiety that prompted the Mid-America Regional Council in Kansas
City and other communities to review 911 call centers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Katerndahl, head of the Mid-America Regional Council's
Government Innovations Forum, said no problems have been found.
</P>
<P>
   In an eight-county region, 40 emergency dispatch call centers
work with Southwestern Bell Communications to provide 911 service.
</P>
<P>
   Survey results collected by the regional council and released in
June show that Southwestern Bell and the call centers are prepared
to provide the same level of emergency dispatch service on Jan. 1,
2000, as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the National Emergency Number Association is pulling
out all the stops to conduct another more detailed Y2K readiness
survey. This time, the survey will break down ``mission critical''
functions of all the nation's 4,300 911 call centers and will
define Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which the association expects will reflect a much
higher and more accurate readiness level, is scheduled to be
released Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to drive home the message _ emergency services will be
working,'' executive director Adams said.

<P>
   The cookie-selling season is in full swing for America's 3.5
million Girl Scouts; troops up and down the country are setting up
stalls on street corners to raise money for good causes.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie-baking stereotype is one America holds dear, but the
organization itself would dearly love to shed it. At the Girl
Scouts' tri-annual conference held recently in Kansas City, they
accordingly launched a campaign to update their image.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, oatmeal-and-raisin; hello, girl power!
</P>
<P>
   A recent Harris poll reveals that two-thirds of America's
professional women have been Girl Scouts, including the singer
Natalie Merchant, the broadcast journalist Judy Woodruff, and Susan
Taylor, the editor-in-chief of Essence magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed that their time in a troop had improved their
ability to work with others, make friends and develop moral values.
</P>
<P>
   But although membership of the Girl Scouts is at its highest for
20 years and is still growing _ by 1.8 percent last year _ adult
leaders are proving hard to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   So Girl Scouts USA is putting out a series of public-service
announcements on radio and television, presented by such famous
former scouts as Cathy Rigby and Jessye Norman, to encourage older
women to act as mentors to younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   There remains an image problem: not only of cookies, but of
unrelenting camping and crafts, as well as a perception of
WASPishness.
</P>
<P>
   The association's leader, Marsha Johnson Evans, wants to change
all that. Girl Scouting, she says, is also about maths, sports and
computing, and may well lead on to a career in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the racial mix, Girl Scouts already closely reflect the
country at large. Figures gathered in September 1998 show that 10
percent of members are black, 5 percent are Latino and 78 percent
are white.
</P>
<P>
   There have been multiracial troops since 1912, when the
organization was first launched in the United States. The Girl
Scouts have also made some grass-roots changes to encourage
``problem'' girls to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Girl Scouts Beyond Bars'' project, first set up in 1992
in a women's penitentiary in Baltimore, daughters of women
prisoners are invited to join troops of Girl Scouts specifically
created for them.
</P>
<P>
   Similar troops are now attached to 20 prisons in 13 states.
Mothers on remand _ many themselves very young _ are encouraged to
join in the troop activities alongside their children.
</P>
<P>
   Another special project is the ``Border Program,'' which caters
for daughters of migrants living along the Mexican border (in some
of the worst conditions in the country) and has already enrolled
over 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts USA has just signed an agreement with the Texas
Migrant Council to make it easier for daughters of migrant farm
workers to enroll in local scout troops when they move within the
state.
</P>
<P>
   There are troops in homeless shelters and in care centers for
pregnant teenagers, and even juvenile delinquents in special
centers can become Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all this risk-taking, there are still no plans to
join forces with that greatest risk of all, boys. The organization
is resolutely girls-only, and points to numerous studies showing
that girls thrive alongside each other but do less well in mixed
groups. (In Britain, where girls have been able for years to join
the Boy Scouts, most still prefer to be Guides.)
</P>
<P>
   And there are certainly no plans to stop the cookie sales. This
form of fund-raising, says Johnson Evans, is a great teaching tool:
``The girls have to decide on their strategy, and it all takes a
lot of planning.'' Ideal groundwork for running the world. &QL;

AUTHOR TELLS TEENS HOW TO SUCCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Bonnie St. John Deane climbed onto a chair so
she could make better eye contact with the young women in her
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you want to be rich?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, members of the DeLaSalle Education Center's
women's leadership group, burst into laughter as their arms shot up
in response to the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it,'' said Deane, an inspirational speaker and
author of Succeeding Sane and Getting Ahead at Work Without Leaving
Your Family Behind. ``It takes two things, hard work and savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Deane spent much of Thursday speaking with students at
DeLaSalle, which provides education for young people aged 14 to 21
who have been unable to succeed in traditional public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Deane was in Kansas City this week as part of the school's
annual movie benefit. Last week, a Benefactors' Party honored Phil
Kirk, a longtime advocate for the center.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's lunch meeting with the female students, the
young women read poems, sang songs and recited a cheer honoring
Deane.
</P>
<P>
   She praised their work and spoke about how she had overcome
poverty, abuse and a physical disability to succeed. She was born
with a stunted leg, which was amputated when she was five.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these hardships, her mother always emphasized education
and sent her daughter to an good school so she could obtain a
better education.
</P>
<P>
   While there, Deane said she had to make a choice. She could hang
out with ``the popular kids'' or go skiing with a friend who
enjoyed sports.
</P>
<P>
   Deane chose skiing, and the experience changed her life. It
improved her self-esteem and introduced her to numerous people,
including successful African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to find a positive person or group
of people who believe in you and support you,'' she said. ``People
who bring out the best in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Deane, who has degrees from Harvard and Oxford University, has
worked on Wall Street, for IBM and in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She started speaking to groups to raise money so that she could
compete in skiing. Today, she is the national spokeswoman for
Disabled Sports-USA. Her current duty is to ensure that everyone
knows that the Paralympics will be in 2002 following the Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Deane wore the silver medal she won for overall
performance in the alpine skiing events at the 1984 Paralympics in
Innsbruck, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the jobs you will get in life are helping people make
decisions,'' she told the teens. ``If you can position yourself
where the bigger decisions are made, you will get paid more.''
</P>
<P>
   She also urged the youngsters to start saving now by putting
aside at least 10 percent of what they earned and investing it in
stocks or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Shannell Lumpkin, a senior at DeLaSalle, listened intently as
Deane spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned there is a life outside of your home, outside of
your community, no matter what your problems,'' said the
18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch, Deane talked about the many challenges women
today face trying to juggle so many roles.
</P>
<P>
   While interviewing successful people for Succeeding Sane, she
learned that many people who balanced work and family best included
their children in their work.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she designed her home office with a large play area
for her 4-year-old daughter.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American elections are five-act mysteries. They
have their longueurs, the occasional laugh or dramatic moment, but
above all, lots of different scenes. They are not, as in other
countries, intense one-acters.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign is already into Act Two. The change can be seen in
the performance of three of the four leading men. Al Gore ended the
first act face-down on stage, the audience hooting with derision.
His speeches had been turgid, his delivery wooden. He looked like
the best supporting actor who would never make top billing.
</P>
<P>
   The task in Act Two is to rebuild the Gore character. This
started last month. Now, he strides on dressed in an olive suit,
grabs the microphone and cracks jokes (``In Congress, the right
hand doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'').
</P>
<P>
   He departs from the script to talk to members of the audience.
He describes his home life, his blind aunt and his surprising
background as a Vietnam-era dissident.
</P>
<P>
   This character has added depth and feeling. Admittedly, his
reviews have been lousy. Critics complain that he has been
straining for effect, his voice strident and his timing flat. To
them it is ``Re-enter pursued by a wolf.'' But the audience seems
to like this new character.
</P>
<P>
   Barely noticed, Gore's polling numbers _ the campaign's measure
of applause _ have been inching up. He has narrowed the gap between
himself and the Republicans' George W. Bush and, for the first time
in months, has drawn ahead of fellow Democrat Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's task is to display some of the glitz needed to be a
star, Bush's job is the exact opposite. Everyone knows he can hog
the limelight. Act One showed that. But, at the end, it also
suggested that he is a handsome, likeable dope.
</P>
<P>
   The next act is therefore about giving the juvenile lead some
gravitas. This endeavor _ an uphill struggle, some think _ starts
this week, with a long speech on foreign policy in California.
</P>
<P>
   It has been prepared with hours of patient coaching by the best
drama teachers in America. This time, it is hoped, the actor will
not fluff his lines or forget the names of certain minor players,
as he did at the end of Act One.
</P>
<P>
   Act Two will also see Bush on stage more often. His Texas fan
club has helped him to write an autobiography (``A Charge to
Keep''), published this week. And now he will be seen interacting
with the other characters, arguing with them in set-piece debates.
</P>
<P>
   This will be vital. The aim is to show how he performs as the
tension mounts. So far, the audience has no idea whether or not
this character can stand up to pressure or will go to pieces. In
Act Two, he will start to handle adversity.
</P>
<P>
   For his theatrical foil and understudy, John McCain, the second
act is also beginning. His first was a triumph. Brought on as a
spear-carrier and expected to blend into the scenery, he proved a
smash hit with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain character has been one-dimensional so far. Part
of the audience cheers wildly when he talks of honor and integrity.
But only part. He now has to show that he is more than that stock
figure, the peppery military man, admired for straight talking but
lacking the suppleness of mind to dominate the stage at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the most mysterious of the four leading men: Bill
Bradley. He seems to belong to a different play, one of long,
anguished soliloquies interspersed with occasional knockabout
intermissions with great sports figures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   His performance is unlikely to change all that much, at least
until he joins the rest of the cast in New Hampshire, where Act
Three begins in February _ and the characters start getting killed
off. &QL;

DEMPS OUTLINES PLAN FOR IMPROVING KC STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the challenge of regaining state
accreditation before him, Kansas City School District
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. on Friday outlined many of the
strategies he will use to boost student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure that the skills taught by teachers match the
material on state standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   - Improve teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   - Offer classes to better prepare students for standardized
tests and a Saturday school for students not at their appropriate
grade levels in reading or math.
</P>
<P>
   - Increase support for school principals, then give them more
control to run their schools.
</P>
<P>
   - Better monitor students' progress as they advance to higher
grades by grouping schools into clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Demps and school leaders have talked for months about
implementing a core curriculum and raising the accountability of
everyone in the district. But after U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple returned the district to local control on Wednesday, Demps
agreed to discuss specifics of his plan, most of which he hopes to
have in place by summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, have heard people say, `I haven't seen anything that
you are doing,' '' Demps acknowledged. ``If you are looking for me
to stand up and make a big splash then...that's not my task.
</P>
<P>
   ``My task is to get the things done that are going to make this
system work.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said putting the proper curriculum in place is key to the
district's improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the district's new curriculum already had been
distributed to teachers before Demps arrived in August. But the new
curriculum had not been aligned with state standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making sure that it is absolutely in sync with what the
(state) tests are going to expect from our children,'' said Cheri
Shannon, Demps' top assistant who recently was named chief
instructional officer for the district.
</P>
<P>
   But successful schools require more than just proper curriculum,
Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have professional development for teachers so that
they can acquire the methodology to deliver that curriculum,'' he
said, referring to teacher training programs. ``That has been a
stumbling block for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the district has contracted with the Institute for
Learning, an educational consulting group, to establish the new
staff development program.
</P>
<P>
   But Demps needs a commitment from the teachers' union to support
professional development training. Currently, such training for
Kansas City teachers is not mandatory; teachers can use sick or
vacation time on days dedicated to teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said it is not opposed to mandatory teacher
training, but wanted to make sure that teachers who miss the
training have a chance to make it up before missing out on pay.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge in returning the district to the quality the
community seeks is improving student performance on state tests.
The district's poor showing in that area was the biggest factor
leading to the loss of accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The district is contracting with a consultant to pore over
students' test results.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant will ``assess test score data at the classroom
level with teachers and principals, so that they understand what
increase in knowledge a particular student needs,'' Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Demps hopes to hire a permanent district employee as
an assessment director.
</P>
<P>
   Demps said students also must be better prepared to take the
tests. He was perplexed to find out that students were not primed
for state tests last April that were used in the accreditation
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told it was the first time that test had been issued in
that form,'' Demps said. ``And yet for some reason unfathomable to
me, our children were led into that test blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said the district will offer classes to children to
prepare them for college entrance exams and other standardized
tests. She said the district hopes to offer the assistance free to
students.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to offer more remedial instruction, Demps
said. He intends to have a Saturday school in place by January for
students not at the appropriate level in reading and math. The
classes could run from 8 a.m. to noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like it to be mandatory,'' he said. ``Whether or not I
can legally do that, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will make it attractive to parents to send their
children to Saturday school so that those children can catch up to
grade level.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps said the endeavor would be expensive, though he has yet to
figure an exact cost. He hopes to get support from corporations and
community organizations to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to turning around the district, principals may
play the biggest role, Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, principals were too far removed from the
superintendent, and Demps said that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself will have monthly, half-day meetings with all the
principals,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Demps also will have principals in charge of ``clusters,''
groups of schools linked by a geographical area surrounding a high
school. Demps hopes the idea of a cluster will allow teachers and
school administrators to better track students from kindergarten
through high school and provide for better communication.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster idea has been tried before in the district, and it
did not fare well. But Demps attributed much of that to one of the
many superintendent changes and said the program was not carried
through.
</P>
<P>
   Demps also will meet regularly with the principals in charge of
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will sit down and go over difficulties in schools, what's
working, what's not working and what help they need from central
office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demps said he has not yet tallied how much his plans will cost
the district and could not say exactly when each would be fully in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employment contract dictates I have those things in place
before June of this (school) year,'' he said. ``We will have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps continues to be amazed that such gaps existed in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of things I'm talking about are things that, in close
scrutiny, anyone could have seen were not working properly,'' he
said. ``It is really unbelievable that they were not done.''

   WASHINGTON _ American elections are five-act mysteries. They
have their longueurs, the occasional laugh or dramatic moment, but
above all, lots of different scenes. They are not, as in other
countries, intense one-acters.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign is already into Act Two. The change can be seen in
the performance of three of the four leading men. Al Gore ended the
first act face-down on stage, the audience hooting with derision.
His speeches had been turgid, his delivery wooden. He looked like
the best supporting actor who would never make top billing.
</P>
<P>
   The task in Act Two is to rebuild the Gore character. This
started last month. Now, he strides on dressed in an olive suit,
grabs the microphone and cracks jokes (``In Congress, the right
hand doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'').
</P>
<P>
   He departs from the script to talk to members of the audience.
He describes his home life, his blind aunt and his surprising
background as a Vietnam-era dissident.
</P>
<P>
   This character has added depth and feeling. Admittedly, his
reviews have been lousy. Critics complain that he has been
straining for effect, his voice strident and his timing flat. To
them it is ``Re-enter pursued by a wolf.'' But the audience seems
to like this new character.
</P>
<P>
   Barely noticed, Gore's polling numbers _ the campaign's measure
of applause _ have been inching up. He has narrowed the gap between
himself and the Republicans' George W. Bush and, for the first time
in months, has drawn ahead of fellow Democrat Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's task is to display some of the glitz needed to be a
star, Bush's job is the exact opposite. Everyone knows he can hog
the limelight. Act One showed that. But, at the end, it also
suggested that he is a handsome, likeable dope.
</P>
<P>
   The next act is therefore about giving the juvenile lead some
gravitas. This endeavor _ an uphill struggle, some think _ starts
this week, with a long speech on foreign policy in California.
</P>
<P>
   It has been prepared with hours of patient coaching by the best
drama teachers in America. This time, it is hoped, the actor will
not fluff his lines or forget the names of certain minor players,
as he did at the end of Act One.
</P>
<P>
   Act Two will also see Bush on stage more often. His Texas fan
club has helped him to write an autobiography (``A Charge to
Keep''), published this week. And now he will be seen interacting
with the other characters, arguing with them in set-piece debates.
</P>
<P>
   This will be vital. The aim is to show how he performs as the
tension mounts. So far, the audience has no idea whether or not
this character can stand up to pressure or will go to pieces. In
Act Two, he will start to handle adversity.
</P>
<P>
   For his theatrical foil and understudy, John McCain, the second
act is also beginning. His first was a triumph. Brought on as a
spear-carrier and expected to blend into the scenery, he proved a
smash hit with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain character has been one-dimensional so far. Part
of the audience cheers wildly when he talks of honor and integrity.
But only part. He now has to show that he is more than that stock
figure, the peppery military man, admired for straight talking but
lacking the suppleness of mind to dominate the stage at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the most mysterious of the four leading men: Bill
Bradley. He seems to belong to a different play, one of long,
anguished soliloquies interspersed with occasional knockabout
intermissions with great sports figures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   His performance is unlikely to change all that much, at least
until he joins the rest of the cast in New Hampshire, where Act
Three begins in February _ and the characters start getting killed
off. &QL;

VISION, PERSEVERANCE LEAD TO OPENING OF SCIENCE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was an afternoon in the city, and the
creator stood above the bustle, surveying his new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for people smiling,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Below him, girls and boys, women and men, young and old traipsed
through the city. They made music, they harvested corn, they played
golf. And the creator, David Ucko, watched their faces. After all,
this new world is his grand experiment.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Science City. It's potentially the biggest cultural
attraction in Kansas City, and it opens to the general public today
as the main tenant of the renovated Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Science City has stone streets, building facades, assorted
parks, even a roving mayor. But the experiment involves what's
inside those facades and parks. They embody a new kind of science
center.
</P>
<P>
   It's one modeled on a theme park instead of a history museum,
one with participatory experiences instead of push-button exhibits,
one where everything can be touched instead of everything
untouchable in glass cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, ``the museum world is being given a new model,''
concluded a committee of the American Association of Museums.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Ucko, the decade-long president of the Kansas City
Museum, envisioned. Science City is his brainchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the visionary,'' said Ronald Manka, longtime Kansas City
Museum board member. ``He should get 100 percent of the credit if
it succeeds. And if it's a bust, he must take the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one knows yet how it will turn out. But on an
afternoon last week, while season-ticket holders previewed Science
City, Ucko the creator went searching for early clues from the
marketplace: smiling faces.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs in the new two-level annex adjacent to the train
station's old waiting room, Ucko stopped at the four miniature golf
holes steeped in scientific principles. On the last hole, sisters
Anna and Ruth Youngberg took turns putting, then watching their
ball shoot out of a chimney-type tube and either hit or miss a
basket some 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   One after the other, the sisters kept putting. Three, four, five
times. Once after retrieving her ball, 11-year-old Anna ran by Ucko
with an open-mouthed grin and exclaimed to her nearby mother,
``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And a smile slowly spread across Ucko's face, too.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is riding on Ucko's Science City.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it represents the next generation of science
museums, a leap into the entertainment realm of the service
industry, which is drawing customers to a Rainforest Cafe or a
Niketown based on the ``experience'' of being there as much as a
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the three or four different projects people are
watching,'' said David Ellis, president of the Museum of Science in
Boston. ``There's some knowledge in the industry that David's
trying to do some new things there.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Union Station also is tied to Science City. The
station, with various eateries paying rent, faces a $2.7 million
negative cash flow next year, which the science center is expected
to partly offset with its expected 900,000 fee-paying visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge obligation on the financial side,'' Ucko
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ucko enters today's opening pretty ``unflappable,'' in
the words of his wife, Barbara. His calm, collected, almost
scientific demeanor hasn't wavered. He professes no anxiety pangs.
He is just supremely confident about Science City's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever had a doubt about it,'' Ucko said.
``If I didn't feel strongly, it would be hard to advocate as much
as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this feeling goes back to Science City's genesis.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story he has told countless times. In 1987, while he was
with Los Angeles' science museum, Ucko visited Paris for the
opening of that city's science museum. It was the same old
push-button stuff. But a temporary exhibit presented something
different, called Cites-Cines, or cinema city. In it, visitors
passed by city facades while classic film clips were projected onto
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew me away,'' Ucko said.
</P>
<P>
   This immersion became Ucko's inspiration. After he was hired to
create Kansas City's science center, he described his
next-generation museum with such words as ``discovery'' and
``adventure.'' He wrote in a national newsletter of science
centers:
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to the historical replicas of a `living history'
village, visitors to Science City will discover facades and
mini-environments that form a `living science' city of today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's curious this conception for fun came from someone not seen
as particularly fun-loving. Ucko habitually wears gray suits and
poker-faced expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I have guessed that he'd have this wild, let-loose
emotion to him? No,'' said chief exhibit designer Patrick
Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   With Science City, though, fun became a means to an end, a way
to combine science in a theme park-like setting. But getting it
done required lots of help from his team _ and sometimes Ucko
himself stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
   It became a running joke among consultants that ``any successes
weren't because of him but in spite of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Ucko gave his exhibit designers explicit instructions:
no glass cases, no rules for visitors to read and no use of the
word ``exhibit.'' But other than that, he provided little
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Often when designers presented sketches, Ucko simply asked,
``Where's the adventure?'' without offering suggestions himself.
But that was his way of inspiring a culture of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko sometimes confounded his associates by taking too long to
make decisions, changing his mind and ignoring experts' advice _
all of which contributed to several staffers and consultants
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases,'' Ucko said in response, ``it was a struggle to
get them to step out of the traditional framework and embrace a new
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the general public gets to experience what Ucko has been
talking about all these years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, because construction continued during the 10 days
Science City was open to season-ticket holders, today is supposed
to be the first opportunity to savor the full ``adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ucko has watched his city come alive. Ucko sees
season-ticket holders' faces, their smiles, as confirmation of his
long struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk was to do what everyone had done before,''
Ucko said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bloch, vice chairwoman of the Kansas City Museum board,
said it was ``extremely rare'' for something of Science City's
magnitude to start inside one person's brain and be built,
especially in Kansas City where resources for big projects are
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be the envy of everyone in his industry,'' Bloch
said, ``because there's nothing else like it in the United
States.''

DIFFERENCES OVER BARGE TRAFFIF KEEP MISSOURI FROM JOINING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Missouri officials on Friday refused to join seven
other states in an agreement that could determine how the Missouri
River is operated for years, if not decades, to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the difference between Missouri and the seven other
states that are members of the Missouri River Basin Association
amounted to only six days.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and the barge industry wanted a guarantee of a
seven-month, nine-day navigation season in times of drought; the
other states would give them only seven months and three days.
</P>
<P>
   The barge industry and Missouri said the six days were
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Those days may be the difference between the industry's
surviving on the Missouri or abandoning the river during the next
drought, said Chris Brescia, president of MARC 2000, a St.
Louis-based association of industries using the Missouri and
Mississippi rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will oppose this plan,'' Brescia said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Huffman, owner of Phoenix Towing in St. Louis, said the
barge industry had given up as much water as it could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said we've done as much as we can do to help the upper
basin states with their lake levels,'' Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will propose its plan for
operating the river by the end of the year and make it public in
early 2000. Then it will submit the plan for public comment, but it
would not be implemented before 2003. Missouri does not plan legal
action to oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to win unanimous approval Friday ended a nearly
two-year effort on the part of the Basin Association. To win such a
consensus, member states had said, would nearly have assured that
the Corps of Engineers _ which has a federal mandate to control
releases from the six reservoirs along the river _ would adopt the
Basin Association plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps had delayed proposing its plan, hoping the eight
states would strike an agreement. The states have battled over the
years for control of the river's flow, especially in times of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials, although they wouldn't give in on two
crucial issues involving navigation, said that the Basin
Association's pact still marked tremendous compromise on Missouri's
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri supports the Basin Association and most of its
recommendations,'' said Stephen Mahfood, director of the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources. ``We're not condemning what's
happened. We're pleased with our fellow states and their addressing
our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfood said that one of Missouri's accomplishments Friday was
to convince the Basin Association to recommend that in summer the
Corps can lower the flow on the river, increasing opportunities for
recreation but maintaining navigation, which benefits commercial
activities, including agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the states did address nine of the 11 concerns that
Missouri this week had demanded be included in the river pact.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Opper, the association's executive director, said the
new plan would benefit navigation on the lower Missouri by giving
it more water and more guarantees of more time on the water than
the current Master Manual, the Corps' document for controlling the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm disappointed that Missouri didn't sign on
fully,'' Opper said. ``But we did achieve an association position,
and that was our goal and we did narrow the differences between the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mike Meuleners of the Corps of Engineers praised the Basin
Association's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' Meuleners said, ``and the position of
the seven governors is going to mean a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The upper states _ with their large reservoirs that officials
had hoped would bring an economic boom in tourism and recreation _
have been at odds for decades with the lower states, especially
navigation interests.
</P>
<P>
   The upper states and some environmental groups have said the
dwindling economic benefit of navigation should no longer dictate
how the Corps releases water from the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent studies have estimated navigation's economic benefit
had fallen to only $1 million to $2 million a year. The Corps
estimates the navigation benefit at nearly $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of complete agreement on the plan may offer an
opportunity for environmental groups to win support from the Corps,
said Chad Smith, Missouri River representative for American Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The association has not handed the Corps a template for a new
river plan,'' Smith said. ``I'd hope that the Corps would look to
other plans, such as a split season for navigation, or re-creating
a large spring rise on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basin Association also is recommending that the Corps
establish a recovery committee, which would address how endangered
species might be protected. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
begun a formal process of consulting with the Corps about how it
plans to protect those species.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Indian tribes on the Missouri River also is a
member of the Basin Association, but they have long abstained on
the association's recommendations to the Corps.

LOSS OF KC SCHOOLS' ACCREDITATION COULD HURT CITY IN OTHER WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK AND OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The day after a federal judge sustained the
Kansas City School District's potential loss of state
accreditation, real estate agent Cathie Chesen got a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Braun, a single mother of a Kansas City high school
student, instructed Chesen to stop showing her houses in Midtown
Kansas City. Instead, Braun wanted to look across the state line in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was afraid of having her daughter finish in a
nonaccredited school,'' Chesen said of Braun. ``It's a problem we
all have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this week's court decision not to halt the May 1
timetable for losing the state's stamp of approval is resonating
throughout the urban core, mostly with a negative clang.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate agents and politicians fear a new round of
parents fleeing the city, which could dampen the recent surge in
urban home values. Meanwhile, downtown and economic development
leaders fear the city's business recruitment efforts will be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   William Clark, president of the Urban League of Greater Kansas
City, summed up the thinking of many: ``It will have and is having
a negative impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this school issue is strong enough by itself to
undermine the population and job turnaround Kansas City is enjoying
this decade can't be measured yet.
</P>
<P>
   One silver lining may be the dozens of phone calls that new
privately managed charter schools are receiving from parents
interested in switching children out of Kansas City public schools.
Because those charter schools also are located in the urban core,
this means those households would probably stay in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The accreditation issue is the result of a long pattern of low
test scores and low graduation rates. The loss of accreditation, if
not re-established in two years, doesn't mean students won't be
accepted to colleges. But it does basically amount to Kansas City's
final probation before the state could take over or even split up
the school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more blow to the district after 20 years of
blows,'' said Alan Barkema, a vice president with the Federal
Reserve Bank in Kansas City. ``It's too early to judge how big this
additional problem will be in relation to some of the difficulties
the district has already been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of news, though, that's not appealing to the
business community and firms that have to make decisions about
locating.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, there's an almost universal belief that schools affect
the economic vitality of their neighborhoods and their city.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Chicago. The University of Illinois-Chicago's Center
for Urban Economic Development studied job prospects in one area of
the inner city and reported last year that several manufacturers
had left partly because the area lacked an educated workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection between school achievement and economic
achievement,'' said William Howard, director of the university's
urban center.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider Jersey City, N.J. In 1989, it was the subject of
the same gloomy headlines as Kansas City's accreditation woes. The
Jersey City school district became the first in the nation taken
over by a state. The school troubles, along with city corruption,
caused residents to flee. The population hit bottom in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last few years, as a charter school experiment
flourished, have new high-tech firms and investment companies moved
into Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't ever reach our potential if we can't get our public
schools to where they need to be,'' Mayor Bret Schundler said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, mayors nationwide feel so strongly about the
importance of schools to their cities' well-being that some are
intervening in their urban districts, promoting charter schools,
vouchers and business partnerships. The Manhattan Institute, a
conservative think tank, even served as host to a conference last
month focusing on this trend.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Olsen, executive director of the Institute's Center for
Civic Innovation, said a tight labor market was drawing companies
to regions with a large pool of highly educated workers. Urban
areas could miss out on business relocations because new workers
won't live where public schools are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all falls at the lap of the school system,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In urban Kansas City, school district Superintendent Benjamin
Demps Jr., hoping to strengthen ties to the corporate community,
met with about 30 business leaders Friday from the Greater Kansas
City Chamber of Commerce. Demps accepted a business card from an
executive interested in working with the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever I can get help, I'll take it,'' Demps said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some civic leaders worry that despite a dynamic new
leader in Demps, the school district may not be able to reverse its
long troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear they have a workable model for the schools in
the long run,'' said Jonathan Kemper, chairman of Commerce Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Kansas City's urban schools had been under a
desegregation court order since the mid-1980s. During the 1980s,
the city continued an urban population decline. But in the latter
half of the 1990s, the city has rebounded in population, gained
more jobs than the previous two decades and seen housing
appreciation outdo suburban Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some in the real estate industry wonder whether the new
school issue may retard that momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people from out of town, it'll be a negative,'' said
Walter Guth, a J.C. Nichols agent north of the Country Club Plaza.
``It can't do anything but have a negative effect.''
</P>
<P>
   While residents in the southwest corridor can afford
alternatives such as private schools, others can't. So the Scuola
Vita Nuova charter school fielded 60 calls on Thursday alone from
interested parents, and most suburban school districts did, too.
</P>
<P>
   James White, assistant superintendent for the Kansas City, Kan.,
school district, said several Kansas City parents asked about
paying tuition, moving or even sending their children to live with
relatives across the state line to be eligible for White's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of panic out there,'' White said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was ever any doubt about how little the United Nations
expects from the United States, this week probably ended the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that has been hashed out by Congress and the White
House to pay nearly $1 billion of the dues owed to the U.N. has
been hailed as a victory for the world's foremost multilateral
organization.
</P>
<P>
   That the world's richest country still owes the U.N. some $600
million, and that the deal includes the sort of constraints no
national government would ever dream of accepting, have barely
registered as footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   The spur for the agreement is the fact that, if America fails to
pay at least $350 million of its back dues and assessments by the
end of this year, it will lose its seat in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation is based on an older bill, passed by the
Senate in 1997, that was put together by two senators, Jesse Helms,
a staunch Republican critic of the U.N., and Joseph Biden, a more
sympathetic Democrat. It authorizes payment of $926 million over
the next three years, subject to a number of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The condition that has long been the main obstacle to the
passage of the bill is one that has little relevance outside
American domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans added a proviso that would cut off any
American money for international organizations that promote
abortion (for the U.N., this amounts to something in the order of
$10 million-15 million).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton had been adamant that he would not
sign a bill with this proviso in it, but his administration, which
took an international knock in October when Congress rejected the
nuclear test ban treaty, has now backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state, let it be known that
she would be a ``lightning rod'' for criticism from any feminist
groups over the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of heroism coincidentally meant that credit for the
deal shifted to her, rather than to Richard Holbrooke, the United
States' ambitious ambassador to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   In another piece of domestic American political maneuvering,
Vice-President Al Gore criticized the abortion decision.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, with their minds on congressional and presidential
primaries, happily assume that the U.N. should be extremely
grateful for getting at least most of the money that was owed to
it. And, indeed, the huge dollop of cash will be useful _
particularly for the poor, small countries that have long had to
pay America's way in peacekeeping, such as Fiji (which is owed $6
million) and Bangladesh ($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, has cautiously called
the bill ``a positive development.'' But is it really such a good
deal for the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the non-family-planning conditions laid down by
Congress. The other 187 U.N. members must accept the $926 million
as payment in full. From now on America's contribution to the
U.N.'s budget will be reduced from 25 percent of the total to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s budget cannot be increased even in nominal terms
(i.e., it will have to be reduced in real terms). Various U.N.
committees must be wound up at fixed ``sunset'' times. An American
must be installed on the main budget watchdog committee. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these provisions have the laudable aim of continuing the
reform of the U.N.'s management. The U.N., which was hoping for a
small rise next year in its budget (static in dollar terms since
1994), may be a lot leaner than it used to be, but it is still too
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   Annan himself tried to introduce sunset times for committees.
And it probably makes sense for America to be elected to the main
budgeting committees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the idea that the world's richest country can
unilaterally cancel its debts is something that even America's
closest allies find hard to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States can walk away from its debts, why not
others? Nor, even by paying 25 percent of the total, was America
evidently paying too much.
</P>
<P>
   America accounts for some 30 percent of the world's GDP, twice
as much as Japan, which pays 18 percent of the U.N.'s budget (soon
to rise to 20 percent) and, unlike the United States, has no seat
on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at most multinational organizations are used to
America strong-arming its partners into agreeing to joint
communiques. But some think that the idea of Congress unilaterally
deciding what happens to a multilateral organization (without even
bothering to go through the formality of letting other countries
vote) marks a new step.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Luck, the author of ``Mixed Messages: American Politics
and International Organization 1919-99'' (Brookings Institution),
concludes that the U.N. might do better by ``being poor but
principled.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Various U.N. committees could still refuse to comply with parts
of the Helms-Biden agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week's deal, some U.N. refuseniks had privately
hoped that America would lose its seat in the assembly. Their
argument was that this might force a healthy debate in America on
the issue. But others worried that U.N. obstinacy would merely lead
to something worse coming out of America in return.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's message to the U.N. and, more important, to its
member governments will be a simple one: this is the best deal you
will get. The chances are that most of the governments will go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior diplomats contrast their frustration with America
at the U.N. with the good bilateral relations their governments
have with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it will be those bilateral relations that matter
most. And that, like virtually everything else this week, will show
how weak multilateralism, and the United Nations, really are. &QL;

DAVENPORT GAINS SEMIFINALS AT CHASE CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is not yet a crusade, but after six straight years
of stalking a title at the Chase Championships, hanging in and
hanging on until the bitter end of the endless tennis season in
pursuit of her circuit's world championship, Lindsay Davenport has
pronounced herself ready to improve on her record as a two-time
Chase runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I've been back to the Garden I think I've become a
slightly better player in some aspect, so I'm probably a little bit
of a better player and a little smarter,'' Davenport said Friday
night at Madison Square Garden after trampling Anke Huber of
Germany, 6-3, 6-1, in the quarterfinals. ``I'm going to try my
hardest to win the tournament; that's my first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing no ill effects from the hamstring strain she sustained
Sunday while winning the Chase prelude in Philadelphia, Davenport
needed just 57 minutes to reduce the 17th-ranked Huber to a virtual
spectator as she fast-forwarded herself into her third Chase
semifinal. Notified that she was in danger of losing her ranking
spot to third-seeded Venus Williams, who will play Martina Hingis
in Saturday afternoon's first semifinal, Davenport, who finished
1998 with the No. 1 ranking, seemed unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, to end the year at No. 3 is still pretty good,'' said
the congenial Californian. ``It was great to finish the year No. 1
last year, but that's the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Davenport needs further confidence boosting, but she
will take an 11-3 record into the semifinals against her next
opponent, Nathalie Tauziat. The 32-year-old Frenchwoman, the 1998
Wimbledon runner-up, defeated Dominique Van Roost of Belgium, 6-3,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Against Huber, whom she has now beaten in 10 of their 12
meetings, Davenport kept her shots mammoth and her mistakes minimal
_ she struck four aces, broke serve on 5 of 12 chances, pounded out
22 winners, and toted up a measly eight unforced errors. It was a
telling display of competence and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put pressure with the first ball on her, and I
couldn't do it,'' said Huber, who lost confidence in her serve.
``It's just tough when she goes for every shot, every single
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of Huber's six double faults occurred at 3-5 in the first
set, where she ultimately dropped the game and the set by walloping
a crosscourt backhand wide. Huber's lack of confidence descended
like a dropcloth in the fourth game of the second set. Serving at
0-40, she managed to jump-start the point but got caught in the act
of retreating from Davenport's rude return, flailed out a belated
backhand that was well wide, and dropped into a 3-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport reached match point with her fourth ace and followed
it with another fierce serve that forced a match-ending return from
Huber.
</P>
<P>
   ``She served maybe 80 percent first serves and she puts extra
pressure on the return,'' Huber said. ``Somebody has to play really
well to beat her.''  &QL;

   ABILENE, KANSAS _ Around the corner from the Dwight D.
Eisenhower presidential library in Abilene, Kan., is the Museum of
Independent Telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Its 20,000 visitors a year see a bewildering collection, ranging
from wooden wall phones, ``candlestick'' phones and old pay phones,
to switchboards and a reconstructed operator's lair.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their years, some of the artifacts continue to work as
interactive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been receiving more than usual interest in recent
years, for Abilene has become a focus for a new American
phenomenon. In this the age of modems, mobiles and voice mail,
Americans are going all gooey over old phones.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient railroad town has arguably become the antique phone
center of America _ the Antique Telephone Collectors Association is
also headquartered in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   It owes its status partly to the generosity of the Sprint
Corporation, a telecommunications giant which funds the museum
because someone called C.L. Brown founded the company there many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a big factor in the birth of the old phone market
has been the Internet. It has allowed enthusiasts to link up with
like-minded souls thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too few collectors to form local organizations of
any size, but the Internet has been a wonderful way for people to
connect,'' says Karen Poza, who two years ago joined the ranks of
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collectors are like vultures,'' says Paul Wiltfong of
Lenexa, Kan., a construction worker who has collected some 14,000
items since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Web sites like eBay offer a lively marketplace for the
buying and selling of old phones and switchboards. Many vintage
phones now cost between $500 and $1,000, with a few exceptional
ones running into five figures.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular collectable phones tend to be the ones that
people remember using themselves. For instance, interest in early
20th-century wooden wall phones _ once the most popular models _
has waned because fewer people are now alive who remember using
them.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of older phones that attracts aficionados is their
reliability. Back in the days when the phone company _ not the
consumer _ owned most phones, it was in the company's interest to
provide durable machines that cut down on repair trips.
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors actually use the rotary-dial phones that they
buy. Indeed, many old models are still compatible with current
phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an unfixable phone,'' says Steve
Hilsz who repairs phones and writes troubleshooting guides for
old-phone users.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say that some of the new buyers in the market are people
who have decorated their houses in retro styles and need
``era-appropriate'' phones. Indeed, some upmarket retailers are
already serving this market by reproducing the old-fashioned
designs.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it be before they end up in Abilene? &QL;

<P>
   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>

KNICKS FALL BELOW .500 AS OUTLOOK GETS BLEAK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Latrell Sprewell envisions a surreal Saturday night
when his shot won't miss and his team won't fail to humiliate the
Golden State Warriors. He foresees an evening of pure dominance and
the delicious satisfaction of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to leave his former organization embarrassed. He wants
to crush it, as he has said, and make it pay for what he believed
was its mishandling of the situation after his attack on coach P.J.
Carlesimo two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sprewell discovered Friday night, humiliation can work
both ways. This time, Sprewell and the Knicks were left to feel the
sting of a blowout, left to contemplate a stretch in which they
have lost 5 of 6 games. Friday night, they slipped below .500 at
5-6, as the defeats just keep getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns flaunted their array of talent and overwhelmed a thin
Knicks team that was playing without Larry Johnson, who was resting
in a hotel bed with back spasms. The Suns never let the Knicks get
close, leading by as many as 22 in the fourth quarter, on their way
to a 91-86 victory at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sprewell finished the night 3 for 11 with 14
points. Allan Houston, who scored just one point after the half,
ended with 17 points. The Suns were led by five players scoring in
double figures, including Jason Kidd (16 points), Tom Gugliotta
(14) and Todd Day (17).
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy unleashed a profane tirade on his
team before a shoot-around Friday morning in what might have been
an attempt to pierce the haze of distractions diverting the team's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   An incident reportedly involving the Knicks surfaced in a
federal indictment in Atlanta that detailed a 1997 sex party. The
indictment says that the party was staged by Steven Kaplan, who is
the owner of a topless dance club in Atlanta and, according to the
authorities, a longtime associate of John A. Gotti. The indictment,
first reported today in The Daily News, says that Kaplan provided
prostitutes and dancers to players for a pro basketball team in
April or May 1997 in Charleston, S.C. It does not name the NBA team
involved, but the Knicks were in Charleston at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden,
plans to address the issue with the players was unclear. Through a
Garden spokesman, Checketts said he would not comment at this time.
Van Gundy, who had a copy of the Daily News article in his hand
this morning, tore it up and threw it in a garbage can before the
shoot-around.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA spokesman said Friday that the league was monitoring the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Van Gundy was overheard discussing vehemently
with his players concerned their foolish fouls, lazy transition
defense and passive demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   And so his team took note. No more layups, no more silliness.
And Friday night the Knicks started off heeding Van Gundy's warning
before coming unraveled in a miserable second quarter that left
them down, 55-40, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't Utah all over again. These were different
problems. True, the Knicks' rebounding was inadequate, but instead
of giving up rapid layups as they had in Utah, they were leaving
Suns open to launch jumpers from every angle.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Sprewell and Houston were helpless to counter. As
is his habit at times, Sprewell started with a chill in his release
and missed his first six shots.
</P>
<P>
   For their efforts, the weary and injury-depleted Knicks, who
closed within 10 points at the start of the third, found themselves
trailing by 72-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were overmatched by a Suns team that also hadn't
lived up to its preseason billing. The Suns were up to the hype
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before being worn down by the Suns' talent in the second
quarter, the Knicks began the night well enough. They were getting
back on defense and diving for loose balls. Even the twist in the
lineup without the injured Johnson _ Andrew Lang at center next to
Marcus Camby _ seemed to pay dividends in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who didn't give up a layup until the two-minute mark
in the first quarter, were in hustle mode and even led the
hot-shooting Suns, 28-27, with 10 minutes left in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bottom fell out. The Suns' swift ball movement left the
Knicks lost on the floor. Sprewell couldn't make a basket and had
no answer for Rodney Rogers. And the Suns' backcourt pressure
started squeezing turnovers out of the Knicks. As foul trouble
began to build for the Knicks, Van Gundy was forced to put Mirsad
Turkcan into a game for the first time this season.

<P>
   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is eToys, eBay (auctions), CDNow, Outpost (computers
and software), Home Depot, Reel.com (videos) or Garden.com, they
and hundreds of like-minded competitors think specialists
understand their customers better and can provide superior service
and lower prices than a generalist such as Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   By coming together in virtual shopping malls organized by
portals such as Yahoo! and America Online, they argue, they can
also offer web shoppers a greater range of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Christmas will provide some clues as to who is right.
Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce market-research firm, expects
Americans to buy $5 billion worth of products on the Internet in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, when Jupiter predicts that Christmas e-spending will
reach nearly $80 billion, there should be enough business for both
Amazon and the best specialists to thrive. Assuming that Bezos has
not made a hash of things, Amazon may by then even have turned a
profit. &QL;

SEX PARTY ALLEGATIONS GET KNICKS '  ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Outside the steel locker room doors, coach Jeff Van
Gundy could be heard unleashing a profane tirade on his team before
a shoot-around Friday morning in what might have been an attempt to
pierce the haze of distractions diverting the Knicks' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The players' minds have been elsewhere lately. Beyond Latrell
Sprewell's focus on his cathartic return to Golden State on
Saturday night and the back spasms that kept Larry Johnson out of
Friday night's 96-81 loss to the Suns here, an incident reportedly
involving the Knicks surfaced in a federal indictment in Atlanta
that detailed a 1997 sex party.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that the party was staged by Steven Kaplan,
who is the owner of a topless dance club in Atlanta and, according
to the authorities, a longtime associate of John A. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks players do not face any charges of
wrongdoing, the disclosure of a sex party is an unsettling
situation for players privately concerned about their names
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, first reported Friday in The Daily News, says
that Kaplan provided prostitutes and dancers to players for a pro
basketball team in April or May 1997 in Charleston, S.C. It does
not name the NB A team involved, but the Knicks were practicing in
Charleston at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden,
plans to address the issue with the players was unclear. Through a
Garden spokesman, Checketts said he would not comment at this time.
Van Gundy, who had a copy of the Daily News article in his hand
Friday morning, tore it up and threw it in a garbage can before the
Knicks' shoot-around at America West Arena.
</P>

U.S. MISSILE-DEFENSE PLANS TRIGGER COMPLAINTS FROM EUROPEAN
ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS ``ambassadors'' to ``members' representatives'' in 2nd
graf) 
 (HLW)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior State Department official flew to NATO
headquarters this week to defend the administration's plans to
deploy a national missile defense system in the face of growing
criticism from European allies who say their security is being
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared before NATO
members' representatives in Brussels, explaining American
intentions and ``getting an earful of complaints'' from the
Europeans, according to a senior diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time the Americans really discussed with us
their plans for a missile defense that could become a big divide
between us,'' said the European diplomat. ``It is very late to wait
to talk to your allies.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton prepares to decide next summer whether to
build a $20-billion national missile-defense system, the European
allies have joined Russia and China in questioning why the United
States needs to move so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in his right mind would argue that this is welcome
timing,'' Talbott said in an interview. ``It is necessary because
of what we need to do and when we need to do it in order to respond
to a looming threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's consultation was only the first of what will be many
high-level meetings with the European allies on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the European complaints voiced in Brussels was the
administration's threat, stated with even greater firmness by
leading Republican candidates for the presidency, that the United
States might withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
if necessary to field the system.
</P>
<P>
   Under that treaty, Russia and the United States are restricted
to deploying only one, limited ballistic missile system to defend a
small area of their countries. The administration now is
negotiating with Russia to alter the treaty to allow for the
construction of a missile defense system to protect the entire
country from a limited attack by a state with an emerging missile
threat, such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said he answered questions from the ambassadors during
his discussions in Brussels. ``I gave a very thorough review of
where we stood on the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also described the negotiations between Russia and the United
States and ``the thinking within our government after the several
rounds we've had with the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   The European ambassadors also voiced deep misgivings about the
impact this would have on all arms control measures. Several
officials, according to a European diplomat here, asked whether the
deployment, even if approved by Russia, would trigger a new arms
race as other countries felt compelled to find ways around a new
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they feared that a separate American defense system
would undermine the trans-Atlantic defense system since Europe
would be left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballistic missile defenses have become the hub where relations
with Russia and China intersect, the future of nonproliferation
intersects and where our European allies express their most severe
disgruntlement with the American leadership,'' said George
Perkovich, director at W. Alton Jones Foundation and author of
``India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Two European nations will play a pivotal role in the missile
defense debate. The United States wants to upgrade the
early-warning radars it maintains in Greenland and Great Britain to
make them part of this new system.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Alaska will be home to the system, including
at least 20 interceptor missiles ready to shoot down incoming
missiles. As part of the warning system, the United States would
also use satellites and radar stations in the United States, as
well as the two overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way with Copenhagen, for the site in
Greenland, a Danish territory, and London, according to an American
official, but neither country has given its approval yet to include
the radar stations in the new American system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Liberman, the dominant creative force at Conde Nast
Publications for more than half a century and one of the most
influential and glamorous editors in America, died Friday at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 87 and had homes in New
York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian-born Liberman considered himself first an
artist and second a magazine editor and designer, it was his
extraordinary career at Conde Nast, first as art director for Vogue
and later as editorial director for all the company's magazines,
that gave him his power and reach. From the time he arrived at
Vogue in 1941, having just fled occupied France, he brought a
modern sensibility to fashion journalism that would remain with him
through his life.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to replace the hauteur of Vogue with a sense
of freedom and informality helped change the way American women saw
themselves. He wanted to embolden design and to break away from
artifice, so he brought in younger photographers who shot outdoors
in natural light. ``No more Ophelias dancing through the Plaza at
dawn,'' he said. In time, as Amy Spindler, now the style editor of
The New York Times Magazine, observed, ``No man in the Western
world held more power over the fashion images men and women saw
than Liberman during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so intuitively and so sensitively to changes of
every kind _ changes in social attitudes as well as changes in
photography and art and visual communication _ that he always
seemed to be one or two jumps ahead of everyone else in his field,
and because of this, the magazines he directed stayed fresh and
innovative and very much alive,'' Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin
Tomkins wrote in their 1993 biography, ``Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Vogue, the magazines published by Conde Nast over
the years were Vanity Fair, Glamour, House &AMP; Garden (known for a
period as HG), Mademoiselle, Bride's, GQ, Self, Gourmet, Conde Nast
Traveler, Woman, Details, Allure, Architectural Digest and Bon
Appetit.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant, courtly man who always wore gray suits to the office
with pale blue shirts and narrow hand-knit navy silk ties, Liberman
inspired both adulation and terror among editors and art directors.
From 1960 to 1994, in his position as editorial director of all
Conde Nast magazines, he had the final word on virtually all
editorial matters from captions to covers.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors loved working with him, appreciating the sureness
of his judgment and the authority of his eye, as well as his
constant desire to experiment. Others _ wary of his famous icy
glance _ quaked as he tore up layouts and substituted covers at the
last minute. ``Dear friend,'' he would say, ``don't you think it
might be better this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Several editors and art directors learned to their dismay that
the price of disagreeing with the Silver Fox, as Liberman was known
within the company, could be dismissal from Conde Nast, although he
himself never did the firing and differences with him were rarely
stated as the reason for the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's remarkable tenure stemmed in great part from the
close personal and working relationships he established with the
succession of men who headed the company, starting with Conde Nast
himself. The closest of these relationships was with S.I. Newhouse
Jr., who started work in 1961 in the company acquired by his father
the previous decade and who was appointed chairman in 1975. In a
note to Liberman on his 80th birthday, Newhouse referred to their
relationship as ``the most meaningful experience of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was eventually recognized by many critics as a
significant painter. But even though his work came to be exhibited
by art dealers like Larry Gagosian, Betty Parsons and Andre
Emmerich, his reputation was always somewhat tainted by his
position at Conde Nast. Some critics found it difficult not to be
dismissive of an artist who was so prominent a figure in the world
of glitz and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 4, 1912, to a
wealthy timber merchant and his wife, and lived a coddled,
luxurious life until the Russian Revolution erupted in 1917. Life
became so stressful that when Alex was 9 his father asked to take
the boy with him on a trade mission to London; the request was
taken up before the Politburo and received the approval of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   The young Alex spent the next three years in London and attended
English boarding schools, where he learned good table manners,
self-discipline and the English language, all of which would serve
him well for the rest of his life. In 1924 he moved with his mother
to Paris, where he lived on and off for the next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He studied painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and began his journalistic career at Vu, a photographic newsweekly
and prototype of Life magazine. It was owned by Lucien Vogel, who
would one day introduce him to Conde Nast. In 1936 he married
Hildegarde Sturm, a German model and skiing champion. A year later
she walked out on him and they were eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Liberman was reintroduced to Tatiana Iacovleva du
Plessix, a blond Russian emigre he had known when he was younger.
The two soon became lovers. Two years later her husband, Count
Bertrand du Plessix, an early Resistance hero in World War II, was
killed when his plane was shot down. A beautiful and imperious
woman who had once been engaged to the Russian poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, she had survived starvation when she was a girl by
reciting Pushkin to Bolshevik soldiers in return for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis, Liberman, Tatiana and her 10-year-old
daughter, Francine, escaped through Spain and Portugal and sailed
to New York in 1941. Through Vogel, then a consultant at Conde
Nast, Liberman went to work in the art department of Vogue. It was
the start of a legendary career that brought Liberman not only
recognition and wealth but also enabled him to marry Tatiana, who
became a hat designer for Henri Bendel and then for Saks Fifth
Avenue, as Tatiana of Saks.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were far more receptive to Liberman's sculpture than
his painting. His sculptures, fashioned from gas storage tanks and
old boilers, appear in parks, shopping malls and college campuses
throughout this country and abroad, making him one of the most
prolific public sculptors of his time. Robert Hughes, art critic at
Time and a Vogue contributor, called the welded-steel sculptures
Liberman's most important work, describing them as ``of real
importance in recent American sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was also a serious photographer. In the 1940s and '50s,
he photographed Braque, Matisse, Utrillo, Rouault, Brancusi,
Chagall and Picasso, among others, for a book of photo essays,
``The Artist in His Studio.'' He was also the author of ``Greece,
Gods and Art''; ``Marlene: An Intimate Photographic Memoir,'' about
Marlene Dietrich; ``Campidoglio,'' a book of photographs taken over
20 years showing the Roman capitol designed by Michelangelo; and
``Then: 1925-1995,'' a retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his wife, Tatiana, died. The next year he married
Melinda Pechangco, the nurse who had attended Tatiana in a previous
illness. In addition to his wife and stepdaughter, of Warren,
Conn., Liberman is survived by two stepgrandchildren.

   Alexander Liberman, the dominant creative force at Conde Nast
Publications for more than half a century and one of the most
influential and glamorous editors in America, died Friday at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 87 and had homes in New
York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian-born Liberman considered himself first an
artist and second a magazine editor and designer, it was his
extraordinary career at Conde Nast, first as art director for Vogue
and later as editorial director for all the company's magazines,
that gave him his power and reach. From the time he arrived at

The New York Times Magazine, observed, ``No man in the Western
world held more power over the fashion images men and women saw
than Liberman during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the highly volatile world of big-time magazine publishing,
where editors and art directors are as expendable as first wives,
it was astonishing that anyone had managed to stay on top as long
as Alex had,'' Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin Tomkins wrote in their
1993 biography, ``Alex.'' ``One possible explanation was that there
had never been a clearly definable Liberman style, no signature
look to the magazines he directed, nothing you can point to and
decide was out-of date. The Liberman style was protean and
infinitely renewable. He had always pushed for journalistic variety
at the expense of anything that smacked of an art director's
concept of `good design.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so intuitively and so sensitively to changes of
every kind _ changes in social attitudes as well as changes in
photography and art and visual communication _ that he always
seemed to be one or two jumps ahead of everyone else in his field,
and because of this, the magazines he directed stayed fresh and
innovative and very much alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Vogue, the magazines published by Conde Nast over
the years were Vanity Fair, Glamour, House &AMP; Garden (known for a
period as HG), Mademoiselle, Bride's, GQ, Self, Gourmet, Conde Nast
Traveler, Woman, Details, Allure, Architectural Digest and Bon
Appetit. Liberman also had a word or two to say about The New
Yorker after it was taken over by Advance Publications, the parent
company of Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant, courtly man who always wore gray suits to the office
with pale blue shirts and narrow hand-knit navy silk ties, Liberman
inspired both adulation and terror among editors and art directors.
From 1960 to 1994, in his position as editorial director of all
Conde Nast magazines, he had the final word on virtually all
editorial matters from captions to covers. Some editors loved
working with him, appreciating the sureness of his judgment and the
authority of his eye, as well as his constant desire to experiment.
Others _wary of his famous icy glance _ quaked as he tore up
layouts and substituted covers at the last minute. ``Dear friend,''
he would say, ``don't you think it might be better this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Several editors and art directors learned to their dismay that
the price of disagreeing with the Silver Fox, as Liberman was known
within the company, could be dismissal from Conde Nast, although he
himself never did the firing and differences with him were rarely
stated as the reason for the dismissals. He had many favorites and
proteges over the years, but his loyalty was not to those who
worked for him but to those for whom he worked.
</P>
<P>
   One of his protegees was Grace Mirabella, who succeeded Diana
Vreeland, the legendary editor in chief of Vogue, after the
extravagant and uncontrollable Mrs. Vreeland was asked to step down
in 1971. Ms. Mirabella and Liberman both understood that after the
excesses of the 1960s, American women were looking for ``real
life'' fashion. The new young editor and the older editorial
director quickly established an excellent working relationship,
even though Liberman had the final approval of every article, every
layout, every cover and even every cover line in Ms. Mirabella's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good at giving confidence,'' Ms. Mirabella told
Ms. Kazanjian and Tomkins. ``He was an incredibly modern person
with constant curiosity about everything and not a shred of
nostalgia. I hated it when he went away in the summer. I didn't
trust anyone else's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Ms. Mirabella reacted with incredulity to a call from her
husband, who was watching television in June 1988 and had just
heard a gossip columnist's report that Anna Wintour, the editor in
chief of HG, would be taking over as editor in chief of Vogue.
Certain that her friend Liberman would have warned her if this had
been in the works, Ms. Mirabella went directly to his office and
asked him about the report. ``Yes,'' he said. ``I'm afraid it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's remarkable tenure stemmed in great part from the
close personal and working relationships he established with the
succession of men who headed the company, starting with Conde Nast
himself. The closest of these relationships was with S.I. Newhouse
Jr., who started work in 1961 in the company acquired by his father
the previous decade and who was appointed chairman in 1975. For
more than 30 years Newhouse and Liberman discussed every aspect of
the business, including starting up and acquiring magazines,
redesigning and revamping them and hiring and firing editors and
art directors. In a note to Liberman on his 80th birthday, Newhouse
referred to their relationship as ``the most meaningful experience
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was not only the magazine business that forged the bond
between Liberman and Newhouse, but their shared passion for art as
well. Newhouse, an avid collector of postwar American art, could
often be seen ducking into Liberman's office, art catalog in hand,
to seek advice. The two men regularly visited art galleries during
lunchtime to look at possible acquisitions. They lunched together
at least once a week and Liberman introduced his boss to some of
the leading members of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was eventually recognized by many critics as a
significant painter. But even though his work came to be exhibited
by art dealers like Larry Gagosian, Betty Parsons and Andre
Emmerich, his reputation was always somewhat tainted by his
position at Conde Nast. Some critics found it difficult not to be
dismissive of an artist who was so prominent a figure in the world
of glitz and commerce. ``Although long ago he earned the right to
be ranked among the most original and genuinely creative talents of
our time, many critics have been unable to forget or forgive the
fact that part of Liberman's life is devoted to the world of high
fashion,'' the critic Lawrence Campbell once wrote in ArtNews. His
hiring of art critics for Vogue and the sheer power of the Conde
Nast publications also raised questions about potential conflicts
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   His artistic sensibility, in turn, transformed Vogue into a
serious forum for contemporary art. He published features on
Giacometti, Utrillo, Matisse, Braque, Duchamp and others and
included essays in almost every issue by important art critics. He
also brought in photographers like Irving Penn, William Klein,
Erwin Blumenfeld, David Bailey, Helmut Newton and Anthony
Armstrong-Jones. And after a long courtship Richard Avedon was
lured away from Vogue's leading rival, Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 4, 1912, to a
wealthy timber merchant and his wife, and lived a coddled,
luxurious life until the Russian Revolution erupted in 1917. Life
became so stressful that when Alex was 9 his father asked to take
the boy with him on a trade mission to London; the request was
taken up before the Politburo and received the approval of Lenin.

self-discipline and the English language, all of which would serve
him well for the rest of his life. In 1924 he moved with his mother
to Paris, where he lived on and off for the next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He studied painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and began his journalistic career at Vu, a photographic newsweekly
and prototype of Life magazine. It was owned by Lucien Vogel, who
would one day introduce him to Conde Nast. In 1936 he married
Hildegarde Sturm, a German model and skiing champion. A year later
she walked out on him and they were eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Liberman was reintroduced to Tatiana Iacovleva du
Plessix, a blond Russian emigre he had known when he was younger.
The two soon became lovers. Two years later her husband, Count
Bertrand du Plessix, an early Resistance hero in World War II, was
killed when his plane was shot down. A beautiful and imperious
woman who had once been engaged to the Russian poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, she had survived starvation when she was a girl by
reciting Pushkin to Bolshevik soldiers in return for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis, Liberman, Tatiana and her 10-year-old
daughter, Francine, escaped through Spain and Portugal and sailed
to New York in 1941. Liberman immediately set forth to look for a
job. It was one of the many moments in his life when he found
himself torn between art and commerce, having to decide whether to
pursue his muse or to find employment that would enable him to
provide for Tatiana's and Francine's needs. The decision came down,
as it always would, on the side of money. His years as a refugee
had given him a deep respect for comfort and security as well as a
desire for luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Through Vogel, now a consultant at Conde Nast, Liberman went to
work in the art department of Vogue for Fehmy Agha, the formidable
art director of Conde Nast. At the end of the first week Agha
dismissed the newcomer, saying he was not right for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman returned to his hotel to find a message that Conde Nast
himself had agreed to see him. This time he brought with him a
certificate for a prize for magazine design he had won at the
Universal Exposition in Paris in 1937, but said nothing about his
previous week's work at Vogue. Nast summoned Agha and informed him
that Liberman had just been hired to work for Vogue. ``Yes, Mr.
Nast,'' Agha replied and never mentioned the subject again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, the start of a legendary career that brought
Liberman not only recognition and wealth but also enabled him to
marry Tatiana, who became a hat designer for Henri Bendel and then
for Saks Fifth Avenue, as Tatiana of Saks.
</P>
<P>
   They entertained endlessly in their town house on the Upper East
Side and in later years at their weekend house in northwestern
Connecticut, thanks to a generous expense account at Conde Nast.
Their guests included Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Brodsky, Mikhail
Baryshnikov, Elsa Maxwell, Salvador Dali, Charles Addams, Claudette
Colbert, John Gunther, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Princess
Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon. In addition to the artists,
writers and critics, there were as many Russian emigres and titled
Europeans as Tatiana could gather.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hectic life and left little time for painting.
Nonetheless, Liberman, determined to be a serious artist, doggedly
pursued his painting on weekends. All through the 1950s, he created
geometric circle paintings: circles within circles, circle
cut-outs, circles in industrial lacquer on aluminum panels.
</P>
<P>
   By 1962 he had begun to create large-scale paintings with
splashes and streaks of color. He abandoned circles and flung paint
from buckets onto canvases laid out on the floor. Sometimes he used
floor mops instead of brushes. His paintings became larger and more
somber, then wilder and more extravagant. By the 1980s he was using
charcoal crayon on acrylic paint with the crayon pushed so hard it
would break; the pieces were incorporated into the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more I rebel, maybe even because I work in a magazine
that surrounds itself with civilized behavior, taste and so
forth,'' he told Barbara Rose, the Vogue art critic who wrote a
monograph on his work in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   If his paintings were huge, his sculptures were monumental.
Cleve Gray, an artist who had married Francine du Plessix, who
became an author of fiction and nonfiction, turned over a barn on
his property in Connecticut for use as a studio and Liberman began
cutting up and welding discarded pieces of farm machinery until he
filled a field with 25 or 30 jagged pieces of sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were far more receptive to his sculpture than his
painting. Commissions poured in. Liberman's sculptures, fashioned
from gas storage tanks and old boilers, appear in parks, shopping
malls and college campuses throughout this country and abroad,
making him one of the most prolific public sculptors of his time.
The Museum of Modern Art placed one of his sculptures in its
garden. Nelson Rockefeller commissioned one for the family estate
at Pocantico Hills. Robert Hughes, art critic at Time and a Vogue
contributor, called these welded-steel sculptures Liberman's most
important work, describing them as ``of real importance in recent
American sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was also a serious photographer. In the 1940s and '50s,
he photographed Braque, Matisse, Utrillo, Rouault, Brancusi,
Chagall and Picasso, among others, for a book of photo essays,
``The Artist in His Studio.'' He was also the author of ``Greece,
Gods and Art''; ``Marlene: An Intimate Photographic Memoir,'' about
Marlene Dietrich; ``Campidoglio,'' a book of photographs taken over
20 years showing the Roman capitol designed by Michelangelo; and
``Then: 1925-1995,'' a retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his wife, Tatiana, died. The next year he married
Melinda Pechangco, the nurse who had attended Tatiana in a previous
illness. In addition to his wife and stepdaughter, of Warren,
Conn., Liberman is survived by two stepgrandchildren.
</P>

   Speculation about when Liberman would retire as editorial
director had been a favorite topic in the magazine business for
years. In 1984 he relinquished one of the most powerful titles in
American journalism after 31 years, and was named deputy chairman
for editorial of Conde Nast. He was succeeded by James Truman, the
British-born editor in chief of Details, a Conde Nast publication
that under his leadership had become the hot magazine for hip young
men.
</P>
<P>
   In their ``American Magazine'' (1991), a 250-year history of
American magazines, the authors Amy Janello and Brennon Jones sum
up the contributions of Alexander Liberman in these words: ``For
almost 50 years, he has had _ and continues to have _ an
incalculable effect on the taste and the visual temper of our
time.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Shaber, a producer and writer for the screen
and stage, died on Nov. 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He
was 70 and had homes in Manhattan and Roxbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an aneurysm, said his wife, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Shaber wrote 40 commissioned screenplays, eight of which were
made into full-length feature films, among them ``Nighthawks''
(1981), with Sylvester Stallone, and ``Rollover'' (1981), with Jane
Fonda. Another of his screenplays, for ``Those Lips, Those Eyes''
(1980), with Frank Langella and Thomas Hulce, about an Ohio summer
stock company, was a thinly veiled account of Shaber's youthful
fascination with events both onstage and off.
</P>
<P>
   Like the main character, Shaber grew up in Cleveland and spent
two summers working as a prop man in local theater productions
while he was a pre-med student at Case-Western Reserve University.
But his obsession with the theater prompted him to abandon his
course, and he headed off to the Yale School of Drama.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a producer of the 1962 Broadway run of ``A Gift of
Time,'' directed by Garson Kanin and starring Henry Fonda and
Olivia de Havilland, and an off-Broadway production of Noel
Coward's ``Conservation Piece.'' He was also the author of several
plays, including ``Bunker Reveries,'' produced in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was working on the book for a new
musical based on the Theodore Dreiser novel ``An American
Tragedy,'' with the composer and lyricist team of Charles Strouse
and Lee Adams.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Shaber had taught advanced screenwriting at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters,
Samantha, of New York, and Remy, of Boston, and a brother, Dr. Gary
Shaber of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Haessig, 78; Target of Tainted-Blood Trial
</P>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Dr. Alfred Haessig, who was convicted last year of
letting HIV-infected blood be distributed to hemophiliacs in
Switzerland, died here on Sunday. He was 78. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haessig presided over an inglorious chapter in public medicine
as director of the Swiss Red Cross blood-transfusion service in
Bern. A court here found that starting in 1982, Haessig knew of the
risk that blood products could transmit the virus that causes AIDS,
but refused to allow the use of safeguards like heat treatment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight infected Swiss hemophiliacs who received blood from the
Red Cross laboratory sued. Four died before the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Haessig, who denied wrongdoing, testified that he had banned the
heat treatment because he believed that it made treating hemophilia
less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the lab supplied 80 percent of the blood for Swiss
hemophiliacs. ``He was so powerful,'' an AIDS specialist at Geneva
Cantonal Hospital, Dr. Luc Perrin, said. ``He was really head of a
small industry. But he thought more operationally than
scientifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Haessig, who earned a medical degree in 1945 from the University
of Zurich, was given a one-year suspended sentence. The case was on
appeal when he died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haessig, who was in the Swiss army medical corps, was a
professor of immunology on the medical faculty of the University of
Bern starting in 1966. He was also an adviser on transfusion to the
World Health Organization and the League of Red Cross Societies.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are two daughters, Marietta Kaeser and Leena Ramming
of Hinterkappelen, and a son, Hans, of Dielsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Minos Volanakis, Greek Translator And Director, 74
</P>
<P>
   Minos Volanakis, a translator and director who specialized in
ancient Greek plays, died on Nov. 14 in Athens, where he lived. He
was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Volanakis distinguished himself with his translations
of Jean Genet's plays into Greek, as well as with his translations
of American plays for the Greek director Carolos Koun, with whom he
studied theater arts. He also presented critically acclaimed
productions of ``Waiting for Godot'' and ``Lysistrata'' for the
Athens Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 he left Greece in protest of the government and lived in
England, where he translated and directed classical Greek plays,
including Aristophanes' comedies, for U.S. and British
universities.
</P>
<P>
   As associate director of the Oxford Playhouse he put on the
first public performance of Genet's ``Balcony'' and a production of
Jean Giraudoux's ``Madwoman of Chaillot,'' with the return of the
actress Elisabeth Bergner to the English-speaking stage. In 1968 he
made his professional debut in the United States with his staging
of Euripides' ``Bacchae'' for the APA-Phoenix at the Lyceum Theater
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Greece he was the general manager at the
Northern State Theater, where he had begun his directing career,
from 1975 to 1978. He also worked with the Greek National Theater,
which presented his staging of ``Oedipus Rex'' at the Vivian
Beaumont in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

   Edmona Mansell, 70, Alcoholism Counselor
</P>
<P>
   Edmona Lyman Mansell, who founded the Freedom Institute in
Manhattan and was one of the first alcoholism counselors in New
York to promote intervention as a treatment technique, died Nov. 11
at a hospital in Jupiter, Fla. She was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said her daughter Jessica Mansell
Ambrose of East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mansell, who was known as Mona, was a recovering alcoholic
and a volunteer counselor at the National Council on Alcoholism in
New York when she started the Freedom Institute in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That year, she had visited the Johnson Institute in Minneapolis,
Minn., which had developed a technique called intervention in which
family and friends persuaded alcoholics to enter treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mansell, a native of San Francisco, lived in New York
before retiring to Jupiter Island, Fla. She was chairwoman of the
Freedom Institute and a director of the National Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her daughter Jessica, she is survived by her husband,
Frank L. Mansell; four sons, Robert L. Miller of Los Angeles,
Charles B. Miller of Twin Bridges, Mont., Christian F. Miller of
Hamilton, Mont., and Gordon L. Miller of Santa Fe, N.M.; another
daughter, Devon Mansell Laycox of Sherborn, Mass.; a sister,
Princess Genevieve di San Faustino of San Francisco; and 12
grandchildren.

   Eugene J. Bockman, City Archivist, 76
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eugene J. Bockman, a longtime archivist and librarian
for the City of New York, died on Nov. 8 at a hospital in
Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered a stroke, said his
wife, Miriam.
</P>
<P>
   Bockman rescued some of the original architectural drawings of
the century-old Brooklyn Bridge, which were being used by bridge
maintenance crews in the 1970s, and put them into the city
archives.
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 to 1975, Bockman was the director and chief librarian
of the Municipal Reference Library. In 1976, he became the
commissioner of the new Department of Records and Information
Services.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Bockman, who had earned bachelor's and master's
degrees at City College, flew 29 missions as an Air Corps gunner,
winning the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with oak leaf
clusters and two presidential unit citations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Bockman is survived by three children,
Peter Bockman of Manhattan, Claudia Weisburd of Philadelphia and
Andrea Stack of Northbrook, Ill.; a brother, Leonard Bockman of
Gainesville, Fla.; and five grandchildren.

GABY CASADESUS, PIANIST IN DUO, DIES AT 98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gaby Casadesus, a pianist and teacher whose specialty was the
19th- and 20th-century French piano repertory, and who often
performed in a piano duo with her husband, Robert Casadesus, died
on Nov. 12 at her home in Paris. She was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Casadesus, whose name was originally Gaby L'Hote, was born
in Marseilles in August 1901. She entered the Paris Conservatoire
when she was 12 and became a student of Marguerite Long and Louis
Diemer. She graduated from the conservatoire with first prize in
piano when she was 16 and soon established herself with
performances of the piano works of Faure, Ravel and Milhaud, which
she studied with the composers' guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Her recitals also reached further back into the French keyboard
literature to include music of Rameau, Couperin and Chopin. She was
known as an elegant Mozart interpreter, and in 1923 she was awarded
the Prix Pages, recognizing the achievement of female pianists in
France.
</P>
<P>
   When she was still at the conservatoire she met Robert
Casadesus, another student of Diemer, two years her senior. The two
began giving performances of duo piano works together, and they
married in 1921. Robert Casadesus wrote several works for the duo,
including Six Pieces (1938), and a Concerto for Two Pianos, which
they first performed in Warsaw in 1934 and later with the New York
Philharmonic in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s their son Jean Michel Casadesus sometimes joined
them for performances of the Bach Triple Concerto and Robert
Casadesus' Concerto for Three Pianos. Jean Michel Casadesus died in
an automobile accident in January 1972; Robert Casadesus died that
September. Mrs. Casadesus is survived by a daughter, Therese
Casadesus Rawson of Berwyn, Pa., and another son, Guy Casadesus of
Toulon, France, as well as five grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II the Casadesus family settled in Princeton
but returned to France in 1946. Both were influential teachers at
the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau, France. Mrs. Casadesus
also gave regular master classes at the Salzburg Mozarteum and at
several French and American universities. She was the author of two
books, ``Ma Technique Quotidienne'' (``My Daily Technique,''
written with Philip Lasser, one of her students) and ``Mes Noces
Musicales'' (``My Musical Wedding,'' written with J. Muller).
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death she helped found an annual summer
festival in Lille, France, with her nephew, the conductor
Jean-Claude Casadesus, and in 1975 she started the Robert Casadesus
International Piano Competition, in Cleveland. She also devoted
herself to performing and publishing her husband's compositions.

NAOMI BLUESTONE, 63, WRITER WHO GUIDED MEDICAL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.H., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Naomi Bluestone, a medical writer, a practitioner, a teacher
and a ``Dear Abby'' to a generation of aspiring doctors, died Nov.
13 at her home in Center Barnstead, N.H. She was 63 and had moved
there from Great Neck, N.Y., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said her husband,
Robert Press.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bluestone wrote about 200 articles in professional as well
as lay journals. She wrote a book, ``So You Want to Be a Doctor?''
(William Morrow, 1981), for college students contemplating medical
careers and fielded the question with humor and satire.
</P>
<P>
   Her main interests were in social and public health and
psychiatry, and she continued to write about them to the end. Until
two years ago, her general psychiatric practice in Center Barnstead
drew patients from near and far.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Wilmington, Del., she graduated from the University of
Delaware with an English major. Changing course, she graduated from
Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1962 and trained in
psychiatry in New York in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Dr. Bluestone held teaching and administrative posts
in New York at Mount Sinai Hospital, Bird S. Coler Memorial
Hospital and Montefiore Hospital. She was also the city's assistant
commissioner of health for chronic and long-term care in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote on many issues confronting American medicine,
particularly those affecting women as doctors and patients. Dr.
Bluestone also helped organize national conferences and seminars on
the challenges for female doctors and the special problems of
female patients.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote columns for such publications as The New Physician,
Medical Dimensions and Resident and Staff Physician. As an editor
she was associated with The New York State Journal of Medicine and
The Journal of Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting letters from medical students,'' Dr. Bluestone
said in an interview after her book was published, ``and the
medical students would pour their hearts out to me to the point
where I was starting to feel like the Dear Abby of the medical
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some asked advice about the dictatorial atmosphere of
hospitals and the terror and loneliness of internship, adding,
``The women, in particular, wrote to me about sexism,
discrimination, problems juggling career, home, family, husband.''

GAME CAN HEAL AGGIES IN THIS TIME OF SADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To those of us who grew up on the wrong side of the Sabine River
or, heaven forbid, in Oklahoma or Arkansas, the spirit of Aggieland
has always been a disarming curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The swords. The haircuts. The Yell Leaders, dressed in retro
white.
</P>
<P>
   Aggie habits, we soon learned, are hard to break. Nor do they
even want to.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday morning, the Aggie Bonfire was roundly
considered an architectural marvel. The world's largest tinderbox.
But more than anything, it was the annual host of the world's
neatest pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   If the khaki doesn't flow through your veins, you probably
wonder. Some Texas A&AMP;M traditions are moving symbols and make
infinite sense. The tradition of the 12th Man, for instance. And
the Aggie Band, which for 105 years has been marching to its own
symbolic drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Other old Aggie habits get lost in the translation. Cheering at
midnight? ``Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!''?
</P>
<P>
   To this day, A&AMP;M has the only fight song in captivity that not
only mentions its chief rival's name and school colors but also
quotes a line from the rival's school song.
</P>
<P>
   But tradition can be a mighty force. Tradition can unite voices.
Tradition can bond strong shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   And tradition, we have learned this week, can be a powerful rock
to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this has been a year that Aggies everywhere would
rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   The football team's inconsistencies had been surpassed in
disillusionment only by the horrifying possibility that the Aggies
could get waxed but good by those tea sips from t.u.
</P>
<P>
   But now fate even has shaken one of Aggieland's strongest
traditions. Aggies have scaled the stack of logs for 90 years in
preparation for the annual football battle with the hated
Longhorns. The tragedy was a kick in the gut to Aggies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Football has been as much a part of those A&AMP;M traditions as the
Corps and its mascot collie. The legend of the 12th Man and the
Midnight Yell Practices are all tied to the school's proud football
tradition. Without football, there would be no reason for a
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the game on Nov. 26 needs to be played. The Kyle Field
stands may have empty seats. The cheers may have a hollow ring. It
figures to be the oddest morning in the long history between the
two schools.
</P>
<P>
   But six days from now, Aggies will need a football game dearly.
They'll need to see the band and listen to Reveille bark. As
therapy, a grief counselor might surely recommend three hours of
symbolically ``sawing off Bevo's horns,'' as the Aggie War Hymn
sings.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a ghastly season for the football Aggies, by recent
standards. First came the ambush at Texas Tech, 21-19. Then, the
unthinkable _ a 51-6 rout at Oklahoma. An Aggie friend admitted to
being relieved that A&AMP;M lost to mighty Nebraska by ``only'' 37-0.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal Aggies will remind that those are only three defeats. A&AMP;M
still clings to a No. 24 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   But head coach R.C. Slocum apparently is fortunate that his
backers still walk in high khaki places. Having lopped off various
coordinators as past seasons' scapegoats, Slocum has no excuses
this time around. Aggie expectations have set high standards, and
R.C. is now the victim of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bonfire tragedy, Slocum's weekly radio show
at Wings 'N More in College Station was canceled this week, and
it's just as well. R.C. probably wouldn't have had much to say
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The grieving is everywhere in Aggieland this week, and it's hard
to think about football. But by next Friday, football figures to be
just what the minister ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Even their rivals joined the Aggies in grief this week. Texas
canceled its annual Hex Rally and, on Monday, the UT Clock Tower
will darken in memory of the accident victims.
</P>
<P>
   The classy gesture has been well received. The Aggie student
newspaper, ``The Battalion'', even referred to the school as ``the
University of Texas-Austin,'' surely an Aggieland first.
</P>
<P>
   Together, next Friday, they can begin the healing.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition can be a good rock to lean on. Fate shook one. The
others will have to be even stronger.

HANK MESSICK, 77, JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR ON ORGANIZED CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By JOHN HARNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hank Messick, an author and investigative journalist who wrote
extensively about organized crime, died on Nov. 6 at his home in
Cocoa, Fla., after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   He was 77 and suffered from Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune
disease, said his wife, Faye.
</P>
<P>
   Messick wrote 19 books and was best known for ``Lansky,'' a 1971
biography of Meyer Lansky that depicted him as something of a
financial wizard of organized crime and famously quoted a disputed
estimate of Lansky's worth, $300 million. His first book, ``The
Silent Syndicate'' (1967), traced the long rise to power, and even
social prominence, of a group of gangsters who got their start in
Cleveland during Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the author of ``Syndicate in the Sun'' and the
co-author of an autobiography of Joseph Barboza, a prolific killer
in the Boston gang wars of the 1960s who later became a federal
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Messick said one of the men described in ``The Silent
Syndicate'' cordially invited Messick into his home in Miami _ and
asked if he wanted money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried threats, bribes, anything,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Although his illness robbed him of most of his sight, Messick
wrote his final book, ``Razzle-Dazzle'' (1995), largely from memory
and dictated it to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Razzle-Dazzle'' recounts his investigation for The Louisville
Courier-Journal into the powerful gambling rings that operated out
of Newport, Ky., in the late '50s and his role in efforts by
community leaders to run them out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Messick was born in Happy Valley, N.C., in 1922. He served
in the Navy during World War II and after the war graduated from
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After earning a
master's degree from the University of Iowa, he taught journalism
at what was then called Colorado A &AMP; M College in Fort Collins. But
after a few years of teaching Messick wanted ``to get out and get
some real experience,'' Mrs. Messick said.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as a reporter at The Waynesville
Mountaineer, a weekly in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Messick is survived by a daughter,
Marda Messick; two sons, Hank and Jon; a sister, Mildred Messick;
and two grandchildren. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE DOWNSIDE OF A SOCIAL SECURITY PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton vowed in last year's State of the Union
address to ``save Social Security first,'' he in effect vowed to
scuttle any attempt by Congress to use the surplus dollars in the
Social Security trust fund for government programs or for tax cuts.
He pledged to use the surplus money instead to pay down the federal
debt.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many liberals cheered because the vow seemed a deft
way to fight off a Republican plan to pass a huge tax cut for rich
families. But the president's position, by locking away trillions
of tax dollars, also blocks any plans liberals might have for using
surplus money for traditional causes, like investing in urban
schools or training disadvantaged workers.
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning Social Security surpluses must be used one way or
another. Clinton argues that his choice _ buying back Treasury
bonds from the public, thereby reducing federal debt _ is sound
economic policy. He's right. But his plan is not the only sound
economic use of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Clinton's plan point out that the policy boosts
saving and private investment. When the government buys back its
bonds, it turns dollars over to bondholders. They, in turn, lend
those dollars to companies that want to expand productive capacity.
That helps the economy to grow, driving up the wages of future
workers. The payoff of this plan is that high-wage workers will not
feel much pain when it comes time to turn over taxes that are
needed to support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other ways to boost saving and investment.
Government spending on, say, early childhood education is also an
act of saving and investment. Money is taken from taxpayers _
reducing their consumption _ and used to train smart workers for
the future. The act of reducing consumption today in order to
expand output tomorrow fits the definition of investment. So does
building airports and paying for basic research.
</P>
<P>
   So which is better: raising private investment by paying down
the federal debt or raising public investment by spending on
schools? At that level of generality, there is no answer.
Economists attack the question one project at a time _ with grunt
work that tediously estimates benefits and costs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a public project to create after-school mentoring and
tutoring programs for young students. According to recent research,
such programs can produce large, long-lasting benefits for
disadvantaged children _ cutting drug use and school absences by 45
percent or more. Those benefits can exceed the typical benefit that
comes from throwing more money into private capital markets by
buying back bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The liberals who signed onto Clinton's Social Security vow
sacrificed a lot. They agreed to keep hands off $2 trillion that is
expected to flow into the trust fund over the next 10 years but not
flow right back out to retirees. That decision could eliminate
projects that have made up the core of the liberal agenda for more
than 60 years.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops oversees matters of
religious doctrine for the Roman Catholic Church in the United
States. But some Catholics were alarmed when the bishops voted this
week to extend their authority to the nation's Catholic colleges
and universities, which educate large numbers of non-Catholics as
well and historically have been independent of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops say the goal is to get schools that define
themselves as Catholic to meet the responsibility of safeguarding
and strengthening the religion's identity. But a new rule requiring
theology professors to seek a formal certification _ or mandatum _
from the local bishops has raised fears of censorship and
abridgment of academic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules emerged last week at the National Conference of
Bishops' meeting in Washington. The rules are a response to Rome's
call for giving American Catholic colleges a closer connection with
the church hierarchy. The effort has drawn protests from faculty
members at some of the leading Catholic universities. Some
university presidents are worried that the finances and reputation
of their institutions would be harmed by a perceived threat to
intellectual life on the campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the new rules say that Catholic colleges and
universities should have Catholic presidents and that ``to the
extent possible'' the majority of their trustees should also be
Catholic. These targets should be easy to meet, given that
Catholics make up a quarter of the U.S. population, span the
political spectrum and include a variety of races and ethnic
groups. In addition, the concern for more sharply defining the
institutions' historic identities is admirable in a world where
many colleges are nondescript, lacking identities or core values.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of requiring a theology professor to receive formal
approval to teach has drawn worried comments from academics at some
of the best-known Catholic institutions. The bishops respond that
they merely want to ensure that professors make it clear to
students when they depart from ``authentic church teachings''
during the course of a lesson. But in the absence of details about
how the mandate process would work, some scholars worry that
bishops might come swooping in to lift the credentials of
professors with whom they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedures have yet to be approved by the Vatican. But
once that happens, the bishops have promised a long discussion with
Catholic theologians before deciding exactly how this system would
be instituted. For the discussions to be fruitful, the bishops will
need to affirm continued support for academic freedom.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 20:
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration cannot give Americans the
willpower to resist fatty foods that promote heart disease. But it
can arm people with the facts they need to make informed dietary
choices. The agency is doing just that with its newly announced
plans to require food manufacturers to disclose on product labels
the amount of trans fatty acids, or trans fats, the product
contains. The food industry does not oppose the new labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Present food labels disclose the amount of saturated fats but
not the amount of trans fats _ the other artery-clogging fat that
is created when vegetable oil is hardened into margarine and
shortening. Yet there is mounting evidence that trans fats raise
the risk of heart disease, the number one cause of death for
American men and women. According to some nutrition experts, trans
fats may be even more unhealthy than saturated fats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the slow grinding of the regulatory process, it could be
two years before the change in labeling goes into effect.
Meanwhile, nothing stops food manufacturers from attaching the
labels more quickly on a voluntary basis. Even better, the
companies might move away from using trans fats in their products
and refrain from misleading health claims to sell products that are
low in saturated fat but loaded with trans fatty acids destined to
do at least as much arterial damage.

EDITORIAL: BUSH'S FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 20:
</P>
<P>
   After a bumpy foreign policy debut on the campaign trail, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush faced the obvious task of showing that he
understands international issues even though he lacks direct
experience with them. In a speech yesterday at the Reagan library
in California, the Republican presidential candidate placed himself
solidly in his party's internationalist mainstream with warnings
about isolationism and protectionism. His simplistic approach to
arms control was the major flaw in a generally balanced overview of
the foreign policies he would pursue if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Russia and other nations in Asia and Europe, Bush
outlined moderate Republican positions that would be consistent
with the management of American foreign policy over the course of
recent decades. And after his wobbly performance on foreign policy
issues in recent months, he seemed determined to let no freelance
remarks blotch a speech drafted by a number of senior advisers to
his father, former President George Bush, and to former President
Ronald Reagan. Bush followed the text word for word.
</P>
<P>
   He called for dealing with China ``without ill will _ but
without illusions.'' Avoiding naming the Clinton administration, he
rightly criticized President Clinton's rush several years ago to
embrace China as a strategic partner. Bush described China
realistically as an emerging world power that has interests in
common with America, but may also threaten America's interests in
the future. His harsh criticism of Chinese human rights policy was
justified. His intention to work with China on economic and
political issues, while remaining wary of China's increasing
military power, was sensible.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outline of Bush's analysis of Russia was thoughtful.
He understands that Russia remains a great power because of its
nuclear arsenal, its natural resources and its sheer size. He
wisely suggested that the United States reach out to a younger
generation of Russians committed to democracy and reform, including
political leaders outside Moscow. On nuclear proliferation, Bush
promoted more funding for dismantling nuclear weapons in the former
Soviet Union, and his general concerns about the issue were well
put. But his downgrading of ratification of the Start 2 treaty as a
priority was a mistake, particularly if there is no effort to move
to the next round of arms cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's other prescriptions for controlling the spread of nuclear
weapons were more dubious. His rejection of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty only compounded the error made by Senate Republicans in
rejecting the treaty last month. His reliance on missile defense
systems underestimated the difficulties involved in developing a
reliable shield. It also underemphasized the crucial matter of
trying to work with Moscow to amend the antiballistic-missile
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   One speech cannot eliminate questions about Bush's familiarity
with national security affairs. Nor did it provide a blueprint of
what he would do if elected. But it was a serious effort to which
the other candidates will no doubt be responding.  &QL;

CELTICS POUND NETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how bad it has become for the Nets. Well, they're 1-8, so
that's a big clue. Here's another. Friday night, Rick Pitino went
with his second unit when the game was up for grabs and it was
still no contest.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the starters watching (and getting some rest for
Saturday night's game with Miami), the Boston bench in general and
Tony Battie in particular took over the game in the fourth quarter.
The result was a 109-96 Boston victory and another hole in the
sinking Jersey ship. The Celtics are 6-3, three games over .500 for
the second time this season. The Heat await Saturday night in _
dare we say it? _ a battle for first place.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker led Boston with 25 points and Adrian Griffin had
a team-high 11 rebounds. Both played well. But it was the
trick-or-treat Battie who stood tallest, with a 10-point,
9-rebound, 4-block gem in 27 hyperactive minutes. Three of the
rejections and 4 of the points came in a game-breaking 12-0 run in
the fourth quarter in which Battie, Doug Overton, Walter McCarty,
and Eric Williams rattled, harassed, and otherwise throttled the
befuddled Nets. Griffin and then Paul Pierce also were in on the
fun.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the run expired, the Celtics were up by 17, their
fifth home win in six games was well in hand, and the Nets were
(again) wondering what has happened to their supposedly promising
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've had all year,'' said beleaguered coach Don
Casey. ``You saw what we've been seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we saw. Keith Van Horn had decent numbers (16
points, 13 rebounds) but he can't guard anyone. Walker abused him.
``I tried to go to the basket very strong and I got a few easy
buckets,'' he said matter-of-factly. He even got to the line (nine
attempts).
</P>
<P>
   No one rebounded for New Jersey when it mattered. Their best
player: Sherman Douglas, who had 14 points in 13 minutes. And by
the way, Kerry Kittles is doing the same thing he did his senior
year at Villanova: disappearing. To make matters worse _ if that's
possible _ Scott Burrell and Lucious Harris were both nicked.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics knew a lot of this going in, but they also knew they
had gift-wrapped wins to Chicago and Detroit when both those teams
were struggling, winless, and hungry. ``They're much better than
Chicago,'' Pitino said of the Nets. ``They're a talented club that
has started off slow. They have All-Star-caliber basketball
players, which Chicago does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino added that if the Nets shoot a high percentage, ``They
can beat you.'' However, if they don't, ``We'll be all right.'' How
does 42 percent sound? Yeah, the Celtics were all right. They shot
50 percent, had a 49-39 rebounding edge, a 14-point spread in
second-chance points, and would have coasted even easier had they
not turned it over 17 times (an ongoing concern).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Boston never trailed and never really looked
as though it would unravel, even when the Nets made a couple of
runs. The first came in the first quarter, the second in the third.
Stephon Marbury (26) led a rally that shaved a 15-point Celtics
lead to 5 entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no sense of panic,'' Pierce said. He had 17 points,
8 rebounds, and 5 assists. ``We figured we'd get a couple stops and
that would be fine. Then Tony gave us that big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   When the fourth period started, the Nets had the momentum.
Pitino still had his second unit out there, minus the ailing
Calbert Cheaney, figuring, as he put it, ``I thought we were inches
away from a steal. You could see it coming. We had them on the
ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   At 82-77, the Nets officially went into lose control. Griffin
hit an excuse-me, shot-clock beater to start the 12-0 run. What
followed was utter anarchy from the visitors. Turnovers (three),
missed shots (six), timeouts (two.) Battie hit a turnaround.
Overton followed with a jumper. Williams came off a screen for a
15-footer. Overton connected again in transition. Battie made two
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. The score was 94-77 and while the clock said 6:56
to play, it might as well have said 0:00. The lead stayed in double
digits the rest of the night.

TV CONTESTANT MAKES A MILLION BUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Valerie Kuklenski  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internal Revenue Service tax collector from Hamden, Conn.,
has reached the peak of pop culture's Mount Everest as the first
contestant to go the distance on ABC's hit television quiz show,
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show taped Thursday and aired Friday night, John
Carpenter, 31, answered the million-dollar question: ``Which of
these U.S. presidents appeared on the TV series `Laugh-In' _ A.
Lyndon Johnson, B. Richard Nixon, C. Jimmy Carter or D. Gerald
Ford?''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter knew with certainty that Nixon was the one, so he used
the ``phone a friend'' lifeline just so his father, Tom, could
share in the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need your help. I just wanted to let you know I'm
going to win the million dollars,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he declared confidently to host Regis Philbin that ``B''
was his ``final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was greeted with a blizzard of confetti, a standing
ovation and an embrace from his wife, Debbie _ probably the first
time in years that evoking Nixon's name was such a happy occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel nervous at all,'' Carpenter said Friday
morning. ``I've handled worse than that.'' At work? ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, the show's first million-dollar winner since its
debut in August, said he will not be in the IRS office on Monday
because he will be giving more interviews and picking up his check
from Philbin on ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' Beyond that, he
and his wife, Debbie, have not decided whether he should quit his
job, but he said he is ``leaning toward doing something else.'' His
short-term spending plans include home improvements and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the taxes are, I'll be happy to pay it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter breaks into TV history books as the first winner on
U.S. television of a million-dollar prize, excluding lottery shows,
and the first person in the global history of this British-born
game to correctly answer all the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The program's most successful contestants have broad knowledge
of everything from pop culture and current events to geography,
history, politics, science and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do read a lot, I have always read a lot,'' said Carpenter,
who studied economics in college and likes to work crossword
puzzles. ``I hear something once, I don't forget it. There's no way
to study for this game, and that's what I liked about it. You
either know the stuff or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He never would have even watched the show, let alone tried to
get on it, if it weren't for his friends coercing him into watching
it one night last summer. From then on, he said, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter wasn't the only winner. Since ABC premiered the
hourlong game show as a summer replacement series, it has been a
ratings bonanza and, despite its big prizes, a goldmine for the
recently foundering network. In its first 12 nights this month, ABC
says 123 million people _ nearly half the U.S. population _ have
watched at least part of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Game shows have been around since the dawn of network
television, but the format is going through a prime-time
renaissance since the ratings success ``Millionaire'' enjoyed in
its first run. Fox has started its own quiz show, ``Greed,'' that
pits teammates against one another as they go after the top prize;
CBS is preparing for its tropical-island-based game called
``Survivor!''; and NBC is said to be considering resurrecting
``Twenty-One,'' the blockbuster of the mid-'50s that was found to
be rigged and brought down the whole genre.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday night's telecast, ``Millionaire's'' biggest
audience was last Monday, when it was boosted by running adjacent
to ``Monday Night Football.'' The 60-minute program, aired at
different times around the country, drew in 26.8 million viewers,
according to ABC. On Thursday night it had more viewers than new
episodes of NBC hits ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in its second limited nightly run during the November
sweeps rating period, it has averaged 23.1 million viewers each
night. Advertising sources say ABC is selling 30-second spots in
the program for $140,000 to $350,000, depending on the night of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has yet to announce its plans for the show. There is
speculation that it will become a regular addition to the network
schedule once or twice a week, and that ABC also may create a
syndicated version that most likely would blow ``Wheel of Fortune''
and ``Jeopardy!'' out of the water in ratings and advertising
income.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, until Thursday night an ordinary civil servant, still
doesn't get what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no idea that it would be this kind of reaction,
and it really strikes me as sort of silly,'' he said.

TV CONTESTANT MAKES A MILLION BUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Valerie Kuklenski  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internal Revenue Service tax collector from Hamden, Conn.,
has reached the peak of pop culture's Mount Everest as the first
contestant to go the distance on ABC's hit television quiz show,
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show taped Thursday and aired Friday night, John
Carpenter, 31, answered the million-dollar question: ``Which of
these U.S. presidents appeared on the TV series `Laugh-In' _ A.
Lyndon Johnson, B. Richard Nixon, C. Jimmy Carter or D. Gerald
Ford?''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter knew with certainty that Nixon was the one, so he used
the ``phone a friend'' lifeline just so his father, Tom, could
share in the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need your help. I just wanted to let you know I'm
going to win the million dollars,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he declared confidently to host Regis Philbin that ``B''
was his ``final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was greeted with a blizzard of confetti, a standing
ovation and an embrace from his wife, Debbie _ probably the first
time in years that evoking Nixon's name was such a happy occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel nervous at all,'' Carpenter said Friday
morning. ``I've handled worse than that.'' At work? ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, the show's first million-dollar winner since its
debut in August, said he will not be in the IRS office on Monday
because he will be giving more interviews and picking up his check
from Philbin on ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' Beyond that, he
and his wife, Debbie, have not decided whether he should quit his
job, but he said he is ``leaning toward doing something else.'' His
short-term spending plans include home improvements and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the taxes are, I'll be happy to pay it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter breaks into TV history books as the first winner on
U.S. television of a million-dollar prize, excluding lottery shows,
and the first person in the global history of this British-born
game to correctly answer all the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The program's most successful contestants have broad knowledge
of everything from pop culture and current events to geography,
history, politics, science and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do read a lot, I have always read a lot,'' said Carpenter,
who studied economics in college and likes to work crossword
puzzles. ``I hear something once, I don't forget it. There's no way
to study for this game, and that's what I liked about it. You
either know the stuff or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He never would have even watched the show, let alone tried to
get on it, if it weren't for his friends coercing him into watching
it one night last summer. From then on, he said, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter wasn't the only winner. Since ABC premiered the
hourlong game show as a summer replacement series, it has been a
ratings bonanza and, despite its big prizes, a goldmine for the
recently foundering network. In its first 12 nights this month, ABC
says 123 million people _ nearly half the U.S. population _ have
watched at least part of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Game shows have been around since the dawn of network
television, but the format is going through a prime-time
renaissance since the ratings success ``Millionaire'' enjoyed in
its first run. Fox has started its own quiz show, ``Greed,'' that
pits teammates against one another as they go after the top prize;
CBS is preparing for its tropical-island-based game called
``Survivor!''; and NBC is said to be considering resurrecting
``Twenty-One,'' the blockbuster of the mid-'50s that was found to
be rigged and brought down the whole genre.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday night's telecast, ``Millionaire's'' biggest
audience was last Monday, when it was boosted by running adjacent
to ``Monday Night Football.'' The 60-minute program, aired at
different times around the country, drew in 26.8 million viewers,
according to ABC. On Thursday night it had more viewers than new
episodes of NBC hits ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in its second limited nightly run during the November
sweeps rating period, it has averaged 23.1 million viewers each
night. Advertising sources say ABC is selling 30-second spots in
the program for $140,000 to $350,000, depending on the night of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has yet to announce its plans for the show. There is
speculation that it will become a regular addition to the network
schedule once or twice a week, and that ABC also may create a
syndicated version that most likely would blow ``Wheel of Fortune''
and ``Jeopardy!'' out of the water in ratings and advertising
income.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, until Thursday night an ordinary civil servant, still
doesn't get what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no idea that it would be this kind of reaction,
and it really strikes me as sort of silly,'' he said.

WHAT'S SO RICH ABOUT `MILLIONAIRE'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Robert Monroe  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something so alluring about big money that even watching
someone else win lots of it is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what has hooked many viewers on ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire?'' ABC's superhit, prime-time game show starring
Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, everyone wants to be a millionaire,'' said Michael
Haverty, a 43-year-old actor living in Sherman Oaks. ``Everyone
wants to see people become a millionaire. It kind of gets you
pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty said the scandal surrounding an enthralling game show of
the 1950s called ``Twenty-One'', dramatized in the Robert Redford
film ``Quiz Show,'' makes him wonder if ``Millionaire'' is fixed.
That's actually part of the allure for him.
</P>
<P>
   The game show's ratings are soaring, beating out NBC hits
``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' Thursday night. On Friday, fans got to
see their first million-dollar winner, a 31-year-old tax collector
from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD West Valley motorcycle patrol officer Dawn-Amber McCallum
said she likes to watch regular, working folks take a shot at
riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have won $125,000 last night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said her fellow officer Jim Thornton, ``the rest of the
shows are trash.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ranna Zaflow, sipping coffee with friend Sandy Rabadi, even
watching people get close to $1million is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not going to win the money,'' said Zaflow, a
20-year-old student from North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Pittenger, also a student, said the possibility that
anyone can win makes the show exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask questions that people with average intelligence can
answer,'' said the Pittenger, 20, a Calabasas resident. ``If you
just go out and live life, you can answer the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Campos, 23, of North Hollywood, said ``You think, Wow,
this is going to be something that changes a person's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of ``Millionaire,'' however, is not universal. The
show left H. Mark and Millie Markowitz, a retired couple from
Encino, with questions before they stopped watching: Who dreamt
this up? Why is it on all the time? Is it sweeps week? Is Regis
doing it to get away from Kathie Lee?
</P>
<P>
   Millie Markowitz sees it more as a mockery of the common person
rather than a fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an insult to the common person,'' said Markowitz,
73. ``You have to be an absolute imbecile to watch it for more than
10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for morons,'' said Mark Markowitz, 77.
</P>
<P>
   Is that your final answer, Mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``And the way they tease people _ `Are you sure?,' `Are you
really sure?' _ it's so silly.''

HUSKIES STILL DREAMING OF ROSE BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ University of Washington coach Rick Neuheisel doesn't
know if he wants updates from the Stanford-California game posted
on the scoreboard during Saturday's Apple Cup in Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's motivation is simple. He wants the Huskies to be
entirely focused on their showdown with archrival Washington State.
While a Stanford loss would open the door for Washington to reach
the Rose Bowl, it won't matter if the Huskies slip against the
Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is pay attention to those things that we
can control,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel knows his team can't afford to be distracted. The
Huskies (5-2 Pac-10, 6-4 overall) no longer control their own
destiny because of a lackluster effort last week against decided
underdog UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Stanford beats Cal, the stakes for the Huskies are
considerable. A Washington victory would put it in good position to
be invited to the Holiday Bowl on Dec. 29 in San Diego, a far more
desirable postseason destination than the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31 in El
Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   WSU (1-6, 2-8) would love to derail the Huskies' postseason
goals. That would salve the sting of another miserable year in
Pullman. Since playing in the Rose Bowl two years ago, the Cougars
have lost 16 of their past 21 games and have won just one Pac-10
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars are a young team looking for momentum heading into
the offseason. A victory over the UW and a win at Hawaii on Nov. 27
would provide a positive foundation for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged by a lot of our young players,'' WSU coach
Mike Price said. ``A good showing in these last two games would
mean a lot to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' chances hang on quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo
returning to the form that made him one of the conference's most
dangerous players. After standout games against Stanford and
Arizona, Tuiasosopo faltered against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to making up for last week _ especially
for the seniors,'' Tuiasosopo said. ``They deserve our best focus
and best attention this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo passed for only 134 yards against UCLA and threw a
critical interception in overtime that led to the Bruins'
game-winning field goal. Neuheisel said he expects the tape of that
game to be a blueprint for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see a lot of pressure, given that UCLA had some
success with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo's counterpart, Steve Birnbaum, is eighth on WSU's
career passing list, but the senior has found himself the scapegoat
for the Cougars' successive losing seasons. There is nothing he'd
like more than to beat the Huskies on the final game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But if Birnbaum falters, Price won't hesitate to call on
redshirt freshman Jason Gesser, who is healthy again for the first
time since undergoing surgery in September on a damaged thumb
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he doesn't expect the UW to come out flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't on top of it against UCLA,'' he said. ``They will
be against us.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the final game in Husky Stadium for 20 UW seniors,
including defensive ends Jabari Issa and Mac Tuiaea, linebacker
Lester Towns, cornerback Jermaine Smith, receiver Dane Looker,
offensive tackle Kurth Connell and punt returner Joe Jarzynka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday you feel it,'' Tuiaea said. ``I've been looking
around and feeling the emotion form the other seniors. It makes
this that much more important.''

SOMETHING'S OFF WHEN AL MVP ISN'T MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pudge Rodriguez wins the 1999 AL MVP?
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   If Pedro Martinez wasn't the single-most dominating player in
the league this season, then how do you explain his 23-4 record,
his 2.07 ERA (the second-closest ERA was Mike Mussina's at 3.44)
and his 313 strikeouts? Not to mention his 13.2 strikeouts-per-game
ratio that was nearly five better than Chuck Finley, who averaged
8.44 K's per game?
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain that once-in-a-lifetime All-Star Game
performance in Fenway Park when the Red Sox ace set down the six
batters he faced as if he were mowing down bowling pins?
</P>
<P>
   And we're not even allowed to talk about the out-of-the-bullpen
victory Martinez earned in Game 5 in the AL Division Series against
Cleveland or the Fenway gem in Game 3 of the ALCS against Roger
Clemens and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hello?
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez over Pedro Martinez?
</P>
<P>
   How many times is a Texas Ranger going to win an MVP award by
default before the Baseball Writers of America comes up with a
better system of selecting the winner?
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Juan Gonzalez won the AL MVP, beating out Alex
Rodriguez by three points despite the fact that Rodgriguez, then
21, had set a new standard for the shortstop position while posting
some of the best offensive numbers this side of Ernie Banks, Joe
DiMaggio, Al Kaline and Ty Cobb _ all Hall of Famers to whom
Rodriguez was compared in '96.
</P>
<P>
   That season was Rodriguez's first real season in the majors and
he turned out to be among the league leaders in 11 offensive
categories, leading the league in five. His .358 batting average
won him the batting title. He amassed a gluttonous 379 total bases,
scoring 141 runs. He had 36 homers and 123 RBI and led the league
in doubles with 54.
</P>
<P>
   His peers voted him Sporting News Player of the Year in a
landslide and the Associated Press named him Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost the MVP vote, the closest in 36 years. It set off a
maelstrom of controversy _ especially in Seattle, where two
baseball writers decided to list Ken Griffey Jr. ahead of Rodriguez
out of loyalty to the Mariners center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, ``A-Rodgate'' was fueled by A-Rod himself.
</P>
<P>
   That '96 season, as his numbers mounted and people started
talking about his MVP campaign, the ever-polite and politically
correct A-Rod demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I be MVP of the league when I'm not even the MVP of my
own team?'' Rodriguez said, deflecting attention to Griffey, who,
five years older and a long-established star, had yet to win the
coveted award.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, was A-Rod steamed, hurt, humiliated and confused when
Gonzalez sneaked away with the MVP trophy. All because the Seattle
writers dared not anoint A-Rod over Griffey, who had brilliant
numbers. However, A-Rod had 50 more hits and a better batting
average by 55 points.
</P>
<P>
   From ``A-Rodgate'' we fast-forward to ``I-Rodgate.'' Or
``Pedrogate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, folks, won the MVP for hitting .332 with 35
homers and 113 RBI _ an off-year for A-Rod or Griffey. And so what
if teams can't run against I-Rod and his cannon arm? There are
other ways to beat the Rangers. Just ask the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the central problem with AL MVP balloting this year.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Martinez, who won the '99 AL Cy Young Award, to Randy
Johnson, who won the NL Cy Young Award, and you see how dominating
Martinez was.
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson racked up 364 strikeouts and registered a 2.48
ERA and 12 complete games, his record was a disappointing 17-9.
During one stretch, Johnson pitched terrifically but his team gave
him no run support _ not Johnson's fault, but it does tarnish his
numbers and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, meanwhile, was absolutely unstoppable. Even on a team
with Nomar Garciaparra, Martinez was the competitive and psychic
heart of the Red Sox _ much the way Johnson was in '95, when he won
the AL Cy Young by leading the Mariners to the playoffs. That
season, Johnson was as close a thing to automatic as you get _
another reason why Johnson deserved some credit as a MVP candidate
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the matter is that pitchers are not excluded from
consideration in MVP voting. They are eligible. Their work is up
for scrutiny and their achievements worthy of serious analysis _
even if there have been too many times over the years when guys
like Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Orel Hershiser, Greg Maddux, Dwight
Gooden, Tom Seaver and Ron Guidry have been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   All 28 voters listed Pudge somewhere on their ballots, which
ranks candidates 1-though-10. All but two of the 28 writers listed
Martinez somewhere on their ballots. In fact, Martinez got 8
first-place votes, more tha Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was something rotten in the state of baseball
officialdom this postseason. By these two writers completely
omitting Martinez, it does look as if they are either blatantly
ignoring the rules, or, if you want to be nicer, experiencing a
serious philosophical difference with the entire procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, human fallibility is one of baseball's most endearing
charms. But just as some people still think A-Rod got jobbed back
in '96, this time around, it was the Red Sox ace who deserved the
MVP honor, not the lucky Ranger.

USC'S CLANCY TOO MUCH FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC had Sam Clancy. Cal State Northridge didn't
have Andre Larry _ or any semblance of an offense.
</P>
<P>
   That was the difference for the Trojans men's basketball team,
which opened the season with a 73-59 victory over the visiting
Matadors on Friday night in front of a paid attendance of 2,056 at
the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy, a burly 6-foot-7, 240-pound forward, had a career-high
24 points. He and USC center Brian Scalabrine dominated the
Matadors, who didn't have Larry, a 6-9 senior forward who is
serving a two-game suspension for participating in an unsanctioned
summer league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't blocking me out very well,'' said Clancy, who was
8 of 14 from the floor to go with eight rebounds. ``That really
opened up my game. I was able to get into the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's previous career-high in points was 16. But he's an
emerging player for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Clancy has gotten better,'' USC head coach Henry Bibby
said. ``This is the way he played in the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (0-1) badly needed Larry, who averaged 9.6 points
per game last season. After blowing an early five-point lead (7-2),
CSUN went long stretches without scoring; USC had a 10-0 run near
the end of the first half and took a 30-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the team thought about not having Andre,'' CSUN
head coach Bobby Braswell said. ``We weren't playing very smart.
Our offense killed our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (1-0) took that 13-point lead on a slam dunk by the
6-9, 250-pound Scalabrine, USC's top returning scorer who
complemented Clancy with 18 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With their inside play, Clancy and Scalabrine boosted USC to a
37-22 halftime lead. Then Trojans guard Jeff Trepagnier tried to
bury the Matadors from the perimeter at the beginning of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier made consecutive 3-pointers to increase the USC lead
to 43-26 with 16 minutes, 56 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN rallied in the middle of the second half and cut the
lead to 59-46 on a basket by Brian Heinle, who made his first shot
of the game and then missed his next eight attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine responded by blowing past Heinle on a baseline drive
and making a three-footer while being fouled. After Scalabrine
completed the three-point play, Trepagnier stole in the inbounded
pass and made a 10-footer.

   USC, now leading by 18 (54-46) coasted in the final 4{ minutes.
The Trojans needed a break, considering they have no bench to speak
of and a game against fifth-ranked North Carolina on Monday in the
Maui Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby wasn't pleased with USC's effort, though. The Trojans
outrebounded the shorter Matadors by only six (43-37) and shot just
36 percent (21 of 58). Starting guard Brandon Granville was just 1
of 6 from the field and played only 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did enough things to win,'' Bibby said, ``but we have to be
more consistent. At times, we had some decent spurts. We showed
some flashes of being a decent team.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has an easier opponent next week _ Cal State Dominguez
Hills in their home opener. Larry will miss that game, too, and
beyond guard Carl Holmes (14 points), CSUN didn't show much
offensive punch against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played dumb sometimes on offense,'' said Holmes, who made
three 3-pointers. ``We had opportunities to score, too. We (also)
missed a ton of free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's point total tied for the second least in a game since
Braswell took over four seasons ago. The Matadors shot just 33
percent (19 for 57) and also missed 10 of 21 free throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring wasn't supposed to be a problem for the Matadors, who
were ninth in the nation in that category last year. But they hurt
their chances with 27 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had eight assists,'' Braswell said. ``We played very
selfish basketball. We took a lot of bad shots. We didn't make USC
play very much defense at all.''

SHAQ TOES THE LINE AS LAKERS ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a dreadful game against an awful opponent, the
most exciting action at Staples Center on Friday night was, of all
things, Shaquille O'Neal shooting free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, O'Neal. Yes, free throws. No, really.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had put away the Chicago Bulls early in the third
quarter, and though they won by only eight, the 103-95 victory will
go down as a rout. So the upset of the night was left to O'Neal,
battling his own long odds at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   The results were a sight to behold. O'Neal, shooting 32 percent
from the line, attempted a career-high 31 free throws _ and made a
career-high 19 of them, including a stretch of six straight
(unheard of this season) in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of a season-high 41-point performance from
O'Neal, who also registered 17 rebounds and seven blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game severely lacking in drama or excitement, O'Neal's
foul shooting provided both. By midway through the fourth quarter,
the 18,401 in attendance were actually cheering each Bulls foul of
O'Neal. Applauding every free-throw attempt. And roaring at every
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' coach Phil Jackson mused, ``the biggest event of
this game was Shaq shooting foul shots, the most exciting part, and
he had plenty of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season of woeful foul shooting, O'Neal was coming off his
most woeful night of all, a 2-for-14 performance at Denver the
night before. But with the home crowd behind him, O'Neal found a
comfort zone, and then some momentum. He made 5 of 10 in the first
quarter, slipped to 1 of 4 in the second, hit 4 of 5 in the third,
then capped it off with 9 of 12 in the fourth as he played 43
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to focus a little more,'' O'Neal said. ``I still
missed too many, but I hit them when I needed to hit them. I think
I can play like that every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get my game back. I've been playing at 75
percent. Everything else has been there, except from the line. I
just have to pick that part of my game up. But I'm going to pick it
up. It can't get worse. It's impossible for it to get worse. It's
unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little else for the Lakers to get excited about in an
uninspiring game. Even Jackson facing his former team for the first
time failed to provide a decent plot, since these were hardly the
Bulls who won Jackson six championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no reflex at all about them,'' he said.
``None.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls now feature five rookies and a few old hands like Will
Perdue and Hersey Hawkins. Elton Brand, the first pick in the June
draft, impressed with 29 points and 17 rebounds, and fellow rookie
put up 20 points, but this was not a team that should have posed a
threat to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it took them until the third quarter to create the rout that
was expected.
</P>
<P>
   They held a nine-point lead coming out of halftime, then scored
13 straight _ seven by O'Neal _ to open the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh fellas, tell me that wasn't a painful game to watch,''
Jackson said of a game that featured 102 foul shots. ``We took more
foul shots (64) than we did field-goal attempts (63). That's an
unusual rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the energy of the game just kept draining out of this
game, and finally by the end, everybody just kind of gave up and
waved a white flag. The referees even stopped calling the fouls, at
least at our end.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, three Bulls had fouled out trying to stop O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to see the big fella step up there and
knock down as many free throws as he did,'' said Glen Rice, who
snapped out of his own funk to score 17 points. ``You could see him
getting really comfortable, and I think that's very important. When
he gets to the point where he really feels comfortable there, he's
going to really shock the world.''

   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member _ without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have apparently
encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the leaks may be coming from the FBI, which would take
over the investigation if there was a strong presumption of
criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a number
of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for an
expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.

``favour'' are being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color,
favor and so on.

   LONDON _ Two hundred women being treated for infertility have
had their embryos screened for genetic defects, and 20 children
have already been born in what critics warn could be the first step
towards ``designer'' babies.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial technique, called pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, involves selecting embryos that are then checked for
genetic defects. Only those embryos free of defects are replanted
in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-life groups say scientists are ``meddling in human
evolution'' and that the technique could be used to select
qualities such as intelligence and sporting prowess. They fear
advances in the technique will trigger growing demands from parents
seeking the ``perfect'' child. &QL;

   BKN-NETS-MARBURY (East Rutherford, N.J.) _ As the Nets prepare

   FBN-ARATON-COLUMN (East Rutherford, N.J.) _ Jim Fassel smiles

   Build a Better Mouse, and . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is death inevitable? Biologists who study aging are beginning to
suspect that the final curtain may at least be postponable. The raw
material of living cells is very robust. It is just that the
evolutionary forces that shape it have no incentive to make a
mouse, say, live forever, when hawks, cats and disease will let the
luckiest mouse survive for only a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now Italian researchers report they have made mice live 30
percent longer than usual by deleting part of a gene. The gene
makes a protein with a deadly role. When cells are damaged by free
radicals, dangerous chemicals generated by ordinary metabolism, the
protein triggers a self-destruct mechanism that forces the stricken
cell to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   This hair-trigger response must benefit animals during
development because it zaps any cell in danger of becoming
cancerous. But the organs of older animals may start to run out of
spare cells, and could probably make good use of the slightly
damaged cells killed off by the trigger protein. That is presumably
why the Italian mice genetically incapable of making the protein
lived longer.
</P>
<P>
   People have a version of the gene the Italians manipulated.
Experts say it should be fairly easy to make a drug that inhibits
the trigger protein made by the gene.
</P>
<P>
   So will that bump the average life span to 100? Doubtless some
Catch-22 will emerge to thwart this scheme, but it is surely
comforting to know someone is working on the death problem.
</P>

<P>
   History Stumbles Again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's a one-sentence history of the American West in the late
1800s? The politically correct answer, of course, is that the white
man came in and wrecked everything.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Well, yes and no. There can be little doubt of the
horrors visited upon American Indians by expansion-minded folks
from across the Mississippi. But what of that other staple of
Western lore _ the near-extinction of the noble buffalo, symbol of
all that is rugged, shaggy and free, by greedy white hunters? It
might be time to rethink that one.
</P>
<P>
   New studies suggest other culprits. First, a centuries-long cold
snap ended about 1850 _ weather that had nourished the grass that
buffaloes eat. Home on the range was also home, by mid-century, to
some 2 million horses, descendants of a long-ago gift of the
Spaniards. The grazing wasn't easy. And Indians, once they had
guns, hunted countless buffaloes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   White hunters  &UR; did &LR;  do their part, slaughtering millions of
buffaloes in the 1870s and 1880s, but many historians now say this
was merely the final blow _ the buffalo was already doomed.
</P>

<P>
   Movement Toward Peace In Northern Ireland
</P>
<P>
   The politicians of Northern Ireland have never had problems
talking. For five years they have been at it, in marathon
negotiating sessions seeking a lasting peace plan. But this time
the words were different _ conciliatory, accommodating and thought
out _ where before they had always been obdurate, insulting and
impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   First George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator turned Ulster
mediator, spoke, then John de Chastelain, a retired Canadian
general who heads a panel on disarmament, then David Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionists, and his rival party leader, Sinn
Fein's Gerry Adams, and finally _ and most important _ the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographed statements proposed a series of interlocking
steps that would allow the start-up of a new Northern Ireland
government and the simultaneous appointment of an IRA officer as a
representative to the disarmament panel. The formula seeks to get
around a stalemate over guerrilla weapons that has stalled progress
in putting the April 1998 peace settlement into operation.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble can get backing for the deal at a party meeting in
Belfast next weekend, the new Ulster home rule government, with its
powers divided evenly between Protestants and Catholics, could be
up and running just days later.
</P>
<P>
   _ WARREN HOGE
</P>
<P>
   Air Crash Sets Off An Ambiguous Probe
</P>
<P>
   An informal axiom among aviation investigators is that if you
don't know the reason for a crash within the first three days, you
are in for a long haul. But three weeks after Egyptair 990 plunged
toward the water so fast that people inside were weightless,
investigators cannot demonstrate why _ although some theorized from
cockpit conversations that a reserve pilot may have intentionally
set the plane on its plunge toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   So the investigators laid out a plan that will take weeks or
months to raise a substantial part of the Boeing 767 from more than
250 feet of water, twice as deep as Swissair 111 or TWA 800. The
flight data recorder shows a plane that flew ``straight as an
arrow,'' as one crash specialist put it, until it plunged, but the
cockpit voice recorder is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Every crash yields new safety measures, and one has already been
proposed for this crash: adding cameras to the microphones and data
recorders that monitor cockpits.
</P>

<P>
   A Campus Accident Kills 11
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of a giant wooden tower intended for Texas A&AMP;M
University's annual football bonfire left 11 students dead and much
of Texas in mourning. In a university steeped in traditions, the
bonfire was one of the most revered, marking the annual football
game against the rival University of Texas. The school canceled
this year's Thanksgiving night bonfire, and officials planned to
reconsider the event.
</P>
<P>
   _ JIM YARDLEY
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Decides to Pay Up
</P>
<P>
   The White House and House Republicans struck a deal to repay
nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United Nations,
ending a three-year battle that had begun to jeopardize
Washington's vote in the General Assembly. The dues were freed
after President Clinton agreed to a Republican demand to halt
federal financing to international groups that promote abortion
rights overseas.
</P>
<P>
   _ ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Takes Some Blame
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the fall of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica,
followed by a Serbian massacre of many of its Muslim residents, the
United Nations issued an exhaustive report on the debacle, taking
much of the blame on itself for trying to be evenhanded in dealing
with the two sides in the civil war. But the report also laid the
groundwork for the tragedy at the feet of the Security Council, led
by the United States, which failed to authorize enough troops to
defend Srebrenica or other ``safe havens'' in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   _ BARBARA CROSSETTE
</P>
<P>
   General Pays a Price For Adultery
</P>
<P>
   In its most severe punishment to date for adultery, the Army
stripped a general of his two stars and forced him into retirement
as a colonel for having affairs with the wives of two subordinates.
Maj. Gen. John Maher, who had been a vice director for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, was demoted following an administrative hearing in
Georgia where the general was found guilty of conduct unbecoming an
officer. The cost is high: with the demotion, Maher's annual
pension will be reduced by $18,000.

</P>
<P>
   A Notorious Drug Is Back, but with Benign Intent
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide, the notorious sedative that maimed thousands of
babies in the 1960s, may well be the wonder drug of the 1990s. It
won approval last year for treatment of leprosy, and has shown
promise in AIDS. Now scientists at the University of Arkansas have
announced a new use for it, as a treatment for multiple myeloma, a
rare bone cancer. They tested thalidomide at the urging of a New
York lawyer whose husband was dying of myeloma. It didn't help him,
but one-third of 84 patients who had failed to respond to other
therapies improved, and two went into complete remission.

   Air Crash Sets Off An Ambiguous Probe
</P>
<P>
   An informal axiom among aviation investigators is that if you
don't know the reason for a crash within the first three days, you
are in for a long haul. But three weeks after Egyptair 990 plunged
toward the water so fast that people inside were weightless,
investigators cannot demonstrate why _ although some theorized from
cockpit conversations that a reserve pilot may have intentionally
set the plane on its plunge toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   So the investigators laid out a plan that will take weeks or
months to raise a substantial part of the Boeing 767 from more than
250 feet of water, twice as deep as Swissair 111 or TWA 800. The
flight data recorder shows a plane that flew ``straight as an
arrow,'' as one crash specialist put it, until it plunged, but the
cockpit voice recorder is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Every crash yields new safety measures, and one has already been
proposed for this crash: adding cameras to the microphones and data
recorders that monitor cockpits.

   A Campus Accident Kills 11

   The collapse of a giant wooden tower intended for Texas A&AMP;M
University's annual football bonfire left 11 students dead and much
of Texas in mourning. In a university steeped in traditions, the
bonfire was one of the most revered, marking the annual football
game against the rival University of Texas. The school canceled
this year's Thanksgiving night bonfire, and officials planned to
reconsider the event.

   U.S. Decides to Pay Up

   The White House and House Republicans struck a deal to repay
nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United Nations,
ending a three-year battle that had begun to jeopardize
Washington's vote in the General Assembly. The dues were freed
after President Clinton agreed to a Republican demand to halt
federal financing to international groups that promote abortion
rights overseas.

   U.N. Takes Some Blame
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the fall of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica,
followed by a Serbian massacre of many of its Muslim residents, the
United Nations issued an exhaustive report on the debacle, taking
much of the blame on itself for trying to be evenhanded in dealing
with the two sides in the civil war. But the report also laid the
groundwork for the tragedy at the feet of the Security Council, led
by the United States, which failed to authorize enough troops to
defend Srebrenica or other ``safe havens'' in Bosnia.

   General Pays a Price For Adultery

   In its most severe punishment to date for adultery, the Army
stripped a general of his two stars and forced him into retirement
as a colonel for having affairs with the wives of two subordinates.
Maj. Gen. John Maher, who had been a vice director for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, was demoted following an administrative hearing in
Georgia where the general was found guilty of conduct unbecoming an
officer. The cost is high: with the demotion, Maher's annual
pension will be reduced by $18,000.

   A Notorious Drug Is Back, but with Benign Intent

<P>
   Thalidomide, the notorious sedative that maimed thousands of
babies in the 1960s, may well be the wonder drug of the 1990s. It
won approval last year for treatment of leprosy, and has shown
promise in AIDS. Now scientists at the University of Arkansas have
announced a new use for it, as a treatment for multiple myeloma, a
rare bone cancer. They tested thalidomide at the urging of a New
York lawyer whose husband was dying of myeloma. It didn't help him,
but one-third of 84 patients who had failed to respond to other
therapies improved, and two went into complete remission.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just for a moment, imagine the corked-up fury of life
in a failed superpower, a place where the government seems impotent
and scandal-scarred; where the army is demoralized by defeat and
incompetence; where the economy seems to rock between inflation and
depression. Then imagine that Islamic terrorists from
magnifying-glass specks on the map are blowing up your citizens,
seemingly with impunity. If you lived there, it might feel good to
hit back, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is one way to view, though not to condone, Russia's brutish
efforts to subdue its runaway province of Chechnya, a blunt-edged
assault that is messily wiping out civilians and soldiers alike,
drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation, working quite
well, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Americans cannot truly imagine Russians' frustration at their
imperial disintegration and economic collapse. But perhaps they can
get a whiff of the emotional release Chechnya evokes among Russians
by recalling how good it felt, after two decades of Vietnam,
Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to finally regain their military
prowess _ striking back first at Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then,
far more dramatically, against Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to that time: The notion that the United States was
back, a force not to be messed with, was almost palpable. American
approval was tinged with jingoism; ``Vietnam syndrome'' was
declared dead. Now, after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's defiant
speech to a gathering of Europe's and America's leaders in Istanbul
last week and the Russian military's vow to ignore the world's
carping about its tactics in Chechnya, it seems conceivable that
post-Soviet Russia has reached a similar turning point in its brief
history.
</P>
<P>
   Similar, but not identical. Unlike America, the Bear isn't back.
And Russia these days is truly reeling, socially and economically,
as America never did. In all probability, it is decades away from
reclaiming the world stage. Still, a powerful backlash is beginning
to coil, a Slavic jingoism born in desperation, fed by resentment
of Western might and exploited by even the most liberal Russian
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   This is the context in which the Kremlin, eyeing the
presidential election next June, is casting the war as a Russian
wake-up call _ a ``don't tread on me'' warning to domestic bandits
and foreign critics alike, from a people whose faces are black with
heel marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those early signs of being Westernized, they were all
superficial,'' said Leonid Sedov, an analyst with Moscow's Public
Opinion Foundation, in an interview. ``What's happening is that
Russia is taking her own special course, and it's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   All these themes, and more, are braided in Chechnya. The
military was mortified there in 1996 after the Kremlin yanked it
out before it could be decimated by urban guerrillas in the streets
of Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The current war offers generals the chance to wipe that slate
clean and regain a measure of influence in Yeltsin's weakened
government.
</P>
<P>
   Military policy-makers are bristling over U.S. attempts to fill
the power vacuum along the old Soviet Union's shrunken borders.
NATO's three-month bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last spring
was, in retrospect, a fault line in relations between the two
countries. Chechnya provides a chance to reassert Russian military
strength in its own backyard, and to show that Moscow will not
surrender its old spheres of influence so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-policy strategists here have abandoned the gauzy notion
of a decade ago that Moscow and Washington would together make the
world safe for democracy; now they see the West mostly as a rival,
if not a threat. Nowhere was that clearer than last week in
Istanbul where, as Western leaders condemned Chechnya misdeeds in
one hall, President Clinton watched in another as several former
Soviet states signed a deal for a new oil pipeline that would
circumvent Russian pipelines and their tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   To Russian foreign-policy-makers, subduing Chechnya keeps Russia
in the pipeline game, since a stable Chechnya is central to
building new routes nearby or enlarging pipelines already in the
area. And it allows the Kremlin to return the thumb in the eye that
it clearly believes has been delivered by America and its allies on
issues from pipelines to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   To the political elite, Chechnya is as much electoral as
military strategy. Given a chance to wave Russia's tricolor instead
of lamenting its decline, virtually every politician in the nation
has closed ranks behind the Kremlin and against its foreign
human-rights critics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just how little daylight separates them is clear from one
remarkable scene: A leading Western-oriented member of parliament,
Grigory Yavlinsky, suggested a negotiated Chechen peace earlier
this month. And immediately, the man who is perhaps closer to
Washington than any politician in Russia, the Kremlin adviser
Anatoly Chubais, called it the act of a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, who hopes to elect his own faction to parliament, would
not be saying such things if voters did not enthusiastically agree.
For whatever the elites now believe, it is the nationalistic
backlash among ordinary Russians that is driving them and events in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   For those Russians, the distinction between human-rights
violations and the extermination of terrorists is not so much
artificial as nonexistent. True, ordinary Russians opposed the last
assault on Chechnya, in 1994, as a cruel waste of lives and money.
But now it is an issue of self-defense: Chechen bandits invaded the
province of Dagestan last summer, seeking to extend their reach,
and Russians widely believe that it was Chechen terrorists who blew
up apartment houses and barracks across Russia, killing hundreds of
innocents. No one in Russia expects such a war to be played by
Hoyle's rules.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, the irony is that they may have done a lot to set
the mood for Russia's current attitude toward Chechnya. Conflict
there may have been unavoidable; Islamic militants effectively gave
the Kremlin and its armies a choice of fighting or losing both
territory and Russia's honor. But both the rules of the battle and
the mentality of its leaders have been molded by NATO's relentless
bombing of Yugoslavia last spring _ opening an East-West rift that
U.S. diplomats then predicted would soon be papered over, but that
has only yawned wider in the intervening months.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Kosovo war is remembered as a conflict NATO
launched in utter disregard of Moscow's emotional pleas and
warnings of disaster. This time around, Moscow has returned the
cold shoulder, ignoring Western pleas to mediate and even to
closely observe the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Russian eyes, Moscow's day-and-night bombardment of
Chechen targets mirrors NATO's round-the-clock raids, save the
smart bombs and accurate missiles that minimized civilian Yugoslav
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Russia denounced as war crimes the civilian deaths that
did occur, from errant NATO missiles or bombs that hit refugee
sites. Now those same horrors have become justification for
ignoring complaints about Chechen civilian casualties. More than
200,000 Chechens have fled their homes, and Chechen officials say
more than 4,000 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia is insensitive to those complaints, or at
least to their effect on domestic politics. In fact, the Kremlin
has tightly manipulated news coverage here, calling the war an
``anti-terrorist action,'' restricting live coverage and playing
down stories of civilian suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sedov's own polls show some softening of public
backing for the conflict in recent weeks, Russians' thirst for a
victory to celebrate seems apparent: whereas half the population
supported giving Chechnya independence four years ago, 8 in 10 now
support the Kremlin's battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   More revealing, perhaps, is the response to the question of
whether Russia must reinstate itself as a ``great empire;'' 85
percent said yes, and 7 percent no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the feelings of an old man who still imagines
that he's a young vigorous man again,'' Sedov said.

did occur, from errant NATO missiles or bombs that hit refugee
sites. Now those same horrors have become justification for
ignoring complaints about Chechen civilian casualties. More than
200,000 Chechens have fled their homes, and Chechen officials say
more than 4,000 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia is insensitive to those complaints, or at
least to their effect on domestic politics. In fact, the Kremlin
has tightly manipulated news coverage here, calling the war an
``anti-terrorist action,'' restricting live coverage and playing
down stories of civilian suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sedov's own polls show some softening of public
backing for the conflict in recent weeks, Russians' thirst for a
victory to celebrate seems apparent: whereas half the population
supported giving Chechnya independence four years ago, 8 in 10 now
support the Kremlin's battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   More revealing, perhaps, is the response to the question of
whether Russia must reinstate itself as a ``great empire;'' 85
percent said yes, and 7 percent no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the feelings of an old man who still imagines
that he's a young vigorous man again,'' Sedov said.

<P>
   President Clinton is such a devoted student of public opinion
polls that his aides say he can recite, from memory, the American
people's double-digit tastes on a wide array of issues. Besides
using survey data to help shape some of the most important
decisions of his presidency, Clinton has also consulted polls
before deciding whether his family should go to the beach or the
mountains on their summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Most infamously, Dick Morris, his former political adviser,
testified that Clinton asked him to conduct a secret, overnight
poll to determine whether Americans were prepared to hear the truth
about his affair with a 21-year-old intern inside the White House.
Morris said that after taking the survey, he told the president:
``You can't tell them about it. They'll kill you. They're just not
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we just have to win, then,'' Clinton replied. It was
Morris' poll that helped persuade the president to deceive his
family, his aides and the public for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the few hundred people who answered Morris' poll determined
a critical presidential decision,'' wrote Arianna Huffington, the
conservative columnist who has crusaded for years against
politicians' devotion to polls by urging people to refuse to
respond to pollsters' questions. Ms. Huffington described the White
House sex scandal as ``the first political crisis to be so entirely
driven and shaped by polls,'' asserting that it was the president's
consistently high approval ratings that spared him from removal
from office by the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   This vigilant reliance on poll numbers by the president and most
politicians raises an important public policy question: Who
actually talks to pollsters and who does not?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is troubling news for the polling
industry and the people who rely on the numbers: Far fewer people
agree to participate in surveys than just 10 years ago, a fact that
some critics call the industry's ``dirty little secret,'' because
most polling firms refuse to divulge their surveys' refusal rates.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is especially important in the current presidential
campaign, with a newly front-loaded primary calendar that makes
polls more crucial to candidates' fortunes than ever. Already, some
candidates have cited their own discouraging poll numbers and the
subsequent lack of financial support as reason enough to drop out
of the race, months before the first primary ballot is cast.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ever-rising number of opinion polls and
telemarketing phone calls _ and no doubt to the increasing
disengagement of people from politics _ more and more people simply
refuse to be questioned. Lately the trend has raised alarms among
pollsters and social scientists, who are starting to question the
validity of many surveys conducted for politicians and the media.
</P>
<P>
   And doubts about polls can only increase with the rise of
Internet polling (which Morris, among others, is trying to
promote). Internet polling raises obvious questions of methodology,
in part because respondents are self-selected and come only from
the population subset of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional polling, falling response rates, as they are
called in the trade, are a ``terrible, terrible problem,'' said
pollster Everett Ladd, director of the Roper Center. Even gauging
it is a challenge, given the reluctance of polling firms and media
organizations to routinely disclose response rates.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say response rates have fallen as low as 20 percent in
some recent polls, which means that as many as 8 out of 10 people
initially asked to participate in a poll refused to be interviewed.
Ten years ago, polling response rates were typically at least 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One media pollster attributes the growing number of refusals to
the public's weariness with aggressive telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is always trying to sell you something on the
phone,'' said the pollster, who insisted on anonymity. ``Most
refusals come within the first 30 seconds, when people are not
certain it is a legitimate poll. They usually assume it is just
another attempt to sell them something.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the problem, an International Conference on
Survey Non-Response was convened last month in Portland, Oregon. It
was attended by 500 pollsters, marketing professionals and
academics, who spent several days grappling with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have money to spend, you can still get quite high
response rates,'' said Robert Groves, a professor at the University
of Michigan who chaired the conference in Portland. But the
national polls conducted for large media outlets with limited
budgets often cut too many corners to produce results in just a few
days, experts argue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the political polls taken by news organizations,
including The New York Times/CBS News poll, struggle to persuade
people to participate. (The Times doesn't publish its response
rates, which vary but generally match the long-term trend. It has
provided them upon request to journalists from other news
organizations.)
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars are concerned that the public's diverse
demographics aren't being reflected in poll results.

   ``The data are pretty clear that you miss people who live alone,
especially younger people who are more likely to be out in the
evenings,'' Groves said. ``You tend to over-sample people with
young children because they are home. You also tend to
over-interview the elderly population because they are at home and
are often willing to be polled. You get the unemployed. It's an odd
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll with the highest response rate is the monthly
unemployment survey conducted by the government. The survey result
is a key economic indicator _ last week it prompted the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates _ so it better be reliable. And
scholars generally agree that it is, largely because the survey's
response rate is between 94 and 96 percent. The survey's pollsters
interview 40,000 people across the country over a 10-day period.
Studies show that people are much more willing to respond to a poll
conducted by the government than by the media or a private firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huffington and other conservative commentators have asserted
that Clinton's enduring high approval ratings result from a
political bias in polls conducted for the national media. In 1996,
these critics complained that the polls often overstated Clinton's
lead over Republican nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press studied
this question and found little evidence of political bias in
national political polls. The study also considered the criticism
that quick media polls often miss some people.
</P>
<P>
   The center took two surveys _ one that contacted 1,000 adults by
phone in a five-day survey, and a more elaborate one over eight
weeks, which included advance letters announcing that a poll-taker
would be calling and offers of a small monetary gift in return for
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, 79 percent of the people contacted in
the more rigorous survey agreed to be interviewed, while only 65
percent agreed to participate in the five-day telephone survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as it turned out,'' the center reported, `the standard and
rigorous surveys produced strikingly similar results.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Pew Center findings suggest that the non-response issue
could be addressed with polls that adhere to rigorous standards and
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, academics, social scientists and even politicians
are becoming more vocal about their distaste for politicians who
vote according to polls rather than their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., recently decried
politicians' addiction to poll results, suggesting that it had
caused Congress to adopt popular causes, like the line-item veto,
that were later found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.
``We've lost our sense of ideas that we stand by, principles that
are important to us,'' Moynihan said in an interview with ABC News
anchor Peter Jennings, which was published in the periodical
Civilization. ``We've got very near to becoming careless with the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings asked, ``Do you think that, in some respect, polls have
contributed, as I think I detect on occasion, to a lack of
confidence in politicians in their own deliberative thinking
process?''
</P>
<P>

   WASHINGTON _ There was lots of news on the campaign trail last
week, from Texas Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy debut to new
polls in New Hampshire showing a tightening horse race in both
parties. But is anyone paying attention, beyond the rapt little
world of journalists, consultants and political groupies?
</P>
<P>
   A new survey suggests that most Americans are not. When people
weren't prompted with a list of candidates, which is routinely done
in political polls, nearly two-thirds said they did not have a
favorite. More than 8 in 10 did not know whether former Sen. Bill
Bradley advocated government-paid health insurance for low-income
people. (He does.) Nearly 8 in 10 had no idea whether Sen. John
McCain supported or opposed an overhaul of the campaign finance
system. (He supports it.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds said they found the previous campaign week
``boring,'' and only a quarter found it ``informative,'' according
to the poll, which was conducted Nov. 10 to 14 for Harvard's
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The public is rarely engaged in a presidential campaign this
early, but many experts warn that Americans are growing
increasingly detached from the political process in more
fundamental ways. Turnout in the 1998 midterm elections was 36.06
percent, the lowest level since 1942, when millions of Americans
were away at war, according to Curtis Gans, an analyst with the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Turnout among
young people is particularly ominous: just 11 percent of 18- and
19-year-olds voted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is longstanding _ in the 1960 presidential election,
62.8 percent of the voting age population turned out; in 1996, 49
percent did _ and has to do with sweeping changes in American
society, Gans argues.
</P>
<P>
   These include the loss of public trust in politicians during the
Vietnam and Watergate years; the rise of an often corrosive new
campaign technology; the creation of ``something beyond
skepticism,'' as Gans puts it, among the journalists who report
about politics; and a decline in basic civic values that becomes
self-perpetuating.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some analysts say, the 2000 campaign has the potential
to feed this disaffection. Front-runners have been declared and
fields winnowed, largely on the basis of fund-raising prowess,
while most Americans were looking elsewhere, underscoring the image
of politics as an insiders game. And ahead lies a primary and
caucus schedule so compressed that it could well pass most voters
in a confusing blur.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to engage voters, as debates have done in the
general election, says Thomas Patterson, a Harvard professor and
co-director of the Shorenstein Center poll, the first in a series
called the Vanishing Voter Project. But changing political
calendars and campaigns is notoriously hard, and renowned for
unintended consequences.

   PONTIAC, Mich. _ To look at a photograph of Nathaniel Abraham is
to search for the face of a child. Nathaniel, 13, was convicted
last week for planting himself on a hillside in this Detroit
suburb, shooting at a stranger walking out of a convenience store
and killing him _ a crime he committed at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction for second-degree murder raises questions that go
to the heart of what society would like childhood to be, and what
society believes must be done when a child has acted like the worst
sort of adult.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, like an increasing number of children across the
country, was tried and convicted as an adult. So was Kip Kinkel,
sentenced Nov. 10 to life in prison without parole for killing his
parents and two classmates in Springfield, Ore., when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   As state after state has lowered the age at which youths can be
treated as legal adults, sentenced to long terms in adult prisons
and even put to death for their crimes, Americans are caught
between two contradictory impulses: to preserve childhood as a time
of innocence and to deny that children who commit crimes are indeed
children.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common lament that children today grow up too fast, that
society is conspiring to deprive them of the halcyon childhood they
deserve. Children today watch television shows and movies saturated
with sexual innuendo and violence. They wear clothes that are
scaled-down copies of adult styles. They engage in sex younger, and
for at least some of those children the rite of losing one's
virginity is increasingly ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Children are also spending less and less time with adults, and
are more often influenced by peers. The result is less guidance on
how to behave like a grown-up, even as there are more pressures to
act like one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet coupled with society's fear of prematurely lost innocence
has been a growing terror of the violent crimes that youngsters _
boys in particular _ are capable of planning and carrying out. At
least 38 people have been killed in a dozen school shootings since
1993, from West Paducah, Ky., to Littleton, Colo. In almost every
case, boys have fired the shots. Such cases have captured the
public's imagination, even though actual arrests of males under age
18 for violent crimes peaked at 151,074 in 1994 and have fallen 26
percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of crime is trumping concern about foreshortened boyhood.
Still, responding to a sharp rise in juvenile crime during the
early 1990s, at least 44 states have adopted new laws since 1992
that allow more children to be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Many child development experts say this strategy ignores
children's very immaturity. The answer to juvenile crime, they
contend, is to provide more guidance and supervision for all boys,
and more counseling for the emotionally troubled or mentally
impaired, instead of more stringent penalties for boys who step out
of line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're facing is boys are not being nurtured and
cared for toward adulthood,'' said Michael Gurian, a family
therapist in Spokane, Wash., who has written eight books on male
development. ``They're not being taught to control their emotions,
they're not being taught to be men.''
</P>
<P>
   But this view, which typifies the main current of intellectual
thought about children during the 20th century, seems to be
yielding in the criminal justice system to an older way of thinking
about children, one that views them as little adults.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's first juvenile court was set up 100 years ago in
Chicago to handle children's offenses discreetly and with an
emphasis on rehabilitation. Before then, the few youths who
committed serious crimes were often treated as small but errant
adults and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, children were treated as adults in many ways throughout
most of history. They were expected to work from an early age,
toiling alongside their parents in mines and in sweatshops.
Historian Philippe Aries has said children were not even recognized
as distinct from adults until the 17th century. The romanticization
of childhood as a time of innocence really took flight in Victorian
England, along with laws restricting child labor. Then came the
notion of a separate track for children in the criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity attending what seems like an endless series of
horrific incidents involving youngsters has contributed to the
current willingness to return to the earlier time of treating
children on a par with adults.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cases of Kip Kinkel and Nathaniel Abraham raise
troubling questions because defense psychologists testified that
the boys had emotional difficulties. Kip was said to have told
doctors during his sentencing hearing that since the age of 12 he
had heard voices ordering him to kill. Psychologists said Nathaniel
had below-average intelligence and significant difficulties in
controlling his emotions _ particularly anger.
</P>
<P>
   Child development experts almost invariably agree that
counseling and other intervention should begin early enough to
prevent violent crimes. But opinions diverge on what to do once a
child has committed murder _ particularly after having had many
other contacts with police.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspected Nathaniel in other criminal incidents during
the nearly three years before the 1997 hillside shooting, though no
charges were ever brought. Prosecutors say he has assaulted other
youths at least twice while in custody awaiting his recent trial.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some experts maintain that prolonged confinement is not the
answer. Dr. Aaron R. Kipnis, a clinical psychologist and the author
of a new book, ``Angry Young Men: How Parents, Teachers, and
Counselors Can Help Bad Boys Become Good Men'' (Jossey-Bass), said
his own experience as a troubled youth had persuaded him that long
prison sentences only produce hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the street, I sold drugs, I committed acts of
prostitution, I committed petty thefts,'' Kipnis recalled. But he
said he was able to avoid a life of crime because his sentences
were short and because he received a small grant for college.
</P>
<P>
   Children who receive long jail sentences do not have such an
opportunity to rejoin society, he argues. ``With 10 years in prison
in your youth, you have no education, no job skills, no social
contacts,'' Kipnis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington
University, contends that some children have such a predisposition
for violence that society may not be able to run the risk of
letting them go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept there are some we are not going to be able
to save,'' Etzioni said. ``I'd like to see a little society, a
little community like Boys Town, where they can live their lives as
normally as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry about the legal system's growing emphasis on
elaborate trials and harsh punishments for serious juvenile crimes,
often at the expense of prosecuting less serious infractions.
Children too easily learn that they can get away with breaking many
laws, only to face long prison terms when they go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Hymowitz, the author of a new book, ``Ready or Not: Why
Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future and Ours''
(Free Press), contends that Nathaniel's case, in which several
years of police contacts did not result in any judicial response,
shows the system at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have children hearing adults say clearly and
promptly, `You can't do this,''' she said, ``and the system is too
cumbersome for that. Instead, they get the message that adults are
indifferent, and that's the worst message you can send.''

   WASHINGTON _ There was lots of news on the campaign trail last
week, from Texas Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy debut to new
polls in New Hampshire showing a tightening horse race in both
parties. But is anyone paying attention, beyond the rapt little
world of journalists, consultants and political groupies?
</P>
<P>
   A new survey suggests that most Americans are not. When people
weren't prompted with a list of candidates, which is routinely done
in political polls, nearly two-thirds said they did not have a
favorite. More than 8 in 10 did not know whether former Sen. Bill
Bradley advocated government-paid health insurance for low-income
people. (He does.) Nearly 8 in 10 had no idea whether Sen. John
McCain supported or opposed an overhaul of the campaign finance
system. (He supports it.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds said they found the previous campaign week
``boring,'' and only a quarter found it ``informative,'' according
to the poll, which was conducted Nov. 10 to 14 for Harvard's
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The public is rarely engaged in a presidential campaign this
early, but many experts warn that Americans are growing
increasingly detached from the political process in more
fundamental ways. Turnout in the 1998 midterm elections was 36.06
percent, the lowest level since 1942, when millions of Americans
were away at war, according to Curtis Gans, an analyst with the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Turnout among
young people is particularly ominous: just 11 percent of 18- and
19-year-olds voted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is longstanding _ in the 1960 presidential election,
62.8 percent of the voting age population turned out; in 1996, 49
percent did _ and has to do with sweeping changes in American
society, Gans argues.
</P>
<P>
   These include the loss of public trust in politicians during the
Vietnam and Watergate years; the rise of an often corrosive new
campaign technology; the creation of ``something beyond
skepticism,'' as Gans puts it, among the journalists who report
about politics; and a decline in basic civic values that becomes
self-perpetuating.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some analysts say, the 2000 campaign has the potential
to feed this disaffection. Front-runners have been declared and
fields winnowed, largely on the basis of fund-raising prowess,
while most Americans were looking elsewhere, underscoring the image
of politics as an insiders game. And ahead lies a primary and
caucus schedule so compressed that it could well pass most voters
in a confusing blur.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to engage voters, as debates have done in the
general election, says Thomas Patterson, a Harvard professor and
co-director of the Shorenstein Center poll, the first in a series
called the Vanishing Voter Project. But changing political
calendars and campaigns is notoriously hard, and renowned for
unintended consequences.

   PONTIAC, Mich. _ To look at a photograph of Nathaniel Abraham is
to search for the face of a child. Nathaniel, 13, was convicted
last week for planting himself on a hillside in this Detroit
suburb, shooting at a stranger walking out of a convenience store
and killing him _ a crime he committed at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction for second-degree murder raises questions that go
to the heart of what society would like childhood to be, and what
society believes must be done when a child has acted like the worst
sort of adult.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, like an increasing number of children across the
country, was tried and convicted as an adult. So was Kip Kinkel,
sentenced Nov. 10 to life in prison without parole for killing his
parents and two classmates in Springfield, Ore., when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   As state after state has lowered the age at which youths can be
treated as legal adults, sentenced to long terms in adult prisons
and even put to death for their crimes, Americans are caught
between two contradictory impulses: to preserve childhood as a time
of innocence and to deny that children who commit crimes are indeed
children.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common lament that children today grow up too fast, that
society is conspiring to deprive them of the halcyon childhood they
deserve. Children today watch television shows and movies saturated
with sexual innuendo and violence. They wear clothes that are
scaled-down copies of adult styles. They engage in sex younger, and
for at least some of those children the rite of losing one's
virginity is increasingly ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Children are also spending less and less time with adults, and
are more often influenced by peers. The result is less guidance on
how to behave like a grown-up, even as there are more pressures to
act like one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet coupled with society's fear of prematurely lost innocence
has been a growing terror of the violent crimes that youngsters _
boys in particular _ are capable of planning and carrying out. At
least 38 people have been killed in a dozen school shootings since
1993, from West Paducah, Ky., to Littleton, Colo. In almost every
case, boys have fired the shots. Such cases have captured the
public's imagination, even though actual arrests of males under age
18 for violent crimes peaked at 151,074 in 1994 and have fallen 26

<P>
   Maybe it's insouciance. Maybe it's sang-froid. Or maybe it's
that certain je ne sais quoi.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, an American researcher is offering a possible
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans, yet seem to suffer fewer health consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Where other researchers have offered reasons ranging from
genetic differences to the red wine that often accompanies foie
gras, Dr. Paul Rozin, a psychology professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, suggests that it may all come down to one's state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: Could it be that if you think of that ice cream
sundae you're about to wolf down as your friend _ and not your
vanquisher _ you might be the healthier for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense among many Americans that food is as much a
poison as it is a nutrient, and that eating is almost as dangerous
as not eating,'' Rozin writes in the current issue of the journal
Appetite.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, surely there is no time of year more perilous to
the American palate than the season of excess and remorse that
begins this week with Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin bases his theory, which he admits he would be hard put to
prove, on a survey he and his associates did of more than 1,000
people, mostly in America and France, but also in Belgium and
Japan. Researchers questioned people at railroad stations and
airports and college students.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the French _ only 4 percent of whom are said to
follow diets in line with the American recommended guidelines for
fat intake _ associate eating more with pleasure than with health.
Americans, on the other hand (and, overall, women in all
countries), not only associate food with nutrition but worry about
it, too. The Belgians and the Japanese tend to fall in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unreasonable to assume,'' Rozin writes, ``that when
a major aspect of life becomes a stress and source of substantial
worry, as opposed to a pleasure, effects might be seen in both
cardiovascular and immune systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the study may amount to little more than further
evidence that reducing stress _ whether about food or anything else
_ is good for one's health. It is well established that a positive
mental outlook may not only ward off illness but even help bring
about a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if nothing else, the article provides yet another
illustration of how Americans and the French differ over matters of
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge people's attitudes toward food and health, the
researchers asked some two dozen questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed were queried, for example, about which word
they associated with ice cream: delicious or fattening. About 31
percent of Americans chose fattening, compared with fewer than 22
percent of the French.
</P>
<P>
   They were also given the words bread, pasta and sauce, and asked
to pick the one that did not belong. The French, presumably
appalled at the notion of dry noodles, generally gave the boot to
the bread; a somewhat higher number of Americans, dutifully
grouping together their carbohydrates, dispensed with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   People were even asked whether they would take a daily pill
instead of eating if it would safely satisfy their hunger and
nutritional needs. About 26 percent of the Americans said they
would, more than twice the percentage of French.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin, who specializes in the psychology of food (his past work
includes trying to explain the near-mystical allure of chocolate
and why cultures differ on which foods are considered edible and
which are beyond the pale), acknowledged the limits of his study.
He said any number of cultural differences like income and
religion, which people were not queried about, could help explain
the differing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the ``French paradox'' _ as the
disparity between France's rich diet and general good health is
often called _ may result, as some nutritionists believe, simply
from the fact that the French consume far fewer calories overall
than do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin said he did not expect mainstream American nutrition
experts to rush to embrace his theory. ``A good part of the
American health community is out to nail foods as good or bad for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist and nutritionist at Tufts
University, took issue with both Rozin's research methodology and
his conclusions. ``It's not clear to me that, by encouraging people
to enjoy their food more, they're going to eat less or make better
food choices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lichtenstein also said she doubted that the study
would have much effect on research into nutritional needs _ and
seemed not altogether unhappy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin remains steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that there's an important message to get to
people,'' he said. ``And that's that they can enjoy good food.''

<P>
   In the end, the study may amount to little more than further
evidence that reducing stress _ whether about food or anything else
_ is good for one's health. It is well established that a positive
mental outlook may not only ward off illness but even help bring
about a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if nothing else, the article provides yet another
illustration of how Americans and the French differ over matters of
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge people's attitudes toward food and health, the
researchers asked some two dozen questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed were queried, for example, about which word
they associated with ice cream: delicious or fattening. About 31
percent of Americans chose fattening, compared with fewer than 22
percent of the French.
</P>
<P>
   They were also given the words bread, pasta and sauce, and asked
to pick the one that did not belong. The French, presumably
appalled at the notion of dry noodles, generally gave the boot to
the bread; a somewhat higher number of Americans, dutifully
grouping together their carbohydrates, dispensed with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   People were even asked whether they would take a daily pill
instead of eating if it would safely satisfy their hunger and
nutritional needs. About 26 percent of the Americans said they
would, more than twice the percentage of French.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin, who specializes in the psychology of food (his past work
includes trying to explain the near-mystical allure of chocolate
and why cultures differ on which foods are considered edible and
which are beyond the pale), acknowledged the limits of his study.
He said any number of cultural differences like income and
religion, which people were not queried about, could help explain
the differing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the ``French paradox'' _ as the
disparity between France's rich diet and general good health is
often called _ may result, as some nutritionists believe, simply
from the fact that the French consume far fewer calories overall
than do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin said he did not expect mainstream American nutrition
experts to rush to embrace his theory. ``A good part of the
American health community is out to nail foods as good or bad for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist and nutritionist at Tufts
University, took issue with both Rozin's research methodology and
his conclusions. ``It's not clear to me that, by encouraging people
to enjoy their food more, they're going to eat less or make better
food choices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lichtenstein also said she doubted that the study
would have much effect on research into nutritional needs _ and
seemed not altogether unhappy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin remains steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that there's an important message to get to
people,'' he said. ``And that's that they can enjoy good food.''

   WASHINGTON _ In what has become an expensive ritual of
presidential politics, the Steve Forbes campaign recently assembled
about a dozen potential voters around a table in Iowa so they could
kibbitz about his possible television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: High marks for substance. Low marks for
presentation _ specifically, the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   While the likely Republican voters were quite taken with Forbes'
plans to revamp the tax code and overhaul Social Security, several
also said the candidate was not suitably telegenic to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get by his looks with me,'' one woman said. ``He
doesn't have that charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she suggested that Forbes might be a good antidote to the
current administration, saying, ``It might not be too bad after the
last seven years!''
</P>
<P>
   As they seek to hone their messages or avoid ineffective
advertising, every major presidential candidate is spending money
on focus groups, gleaning intelligence on everything from fashion
to policy. President Clinton, who probably has turned to focus
groups more than any other politician, once said, ``There is no one
more powerful than a member of a focus group.''
</P>
<P>
   The reliance on these groups underscores the degree to which
politicians trying to capture the attention of an often distracted
public find themselves fretting as much about show as about
substance. While many strategists say that such tips cannot be
mined from sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings are
hardly representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are spending a lot of money, and you have different
options available to you,'' said Mark McKinnon, media consultant
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ``you want to find out
which options make the most sense. But they can be flawed. Too many
people make quantitative decisions based on qualitative research.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, a consultant for Forbes, agreed. ``You have to
take them with a grain of salt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes of two focus groups conducted earlier this month in Iowa,
provided by Forbes' advisers to The New York Times, opened a rare
window into how one campaign settles on its advertising. In these
tapes, participants twisted dials to show what parts of the
commercials they liked or disliked, including ads of Bush that had
already been broadcast. Afterward, participants engaged in a fairly
open-ended discussion. The participants, who were paid for their
time, were not told that the Forbes campaign was conducting the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign received tapes of the ads showing exactly what
parts the group found appealing, including breakdowns by male and
female. As a result, the Forbes campaign scrapped three commercials
that tested poorly. But there was good news: roughly half the
participants said after viewing the advertisements that they would
probably back Forbes. They generally liked the substance of most of
the Forbes and Bush commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The big hitch for Forbes was that the viewers seemed fixated on
his appearance. Several suggested fewer close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In one group, a woman offered only compliments of two Forbes
commercials: ``They're just very clear. There's no spin in them.
It's, `Who I am and what I believe.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion quickly degenerated when another woman
interjected, ``He has some skin problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The first woman defended Forbes, saying: ``This does not bother
me because I like his message. But I know a lot of people who look
at these ads _ and they're shallow. When you get his face too close
up, your mind is on his blemishes _ and it's really a shame,
because he has an awful lot to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing ads on Forbes' tax plan, one woman said, ``He came
across as really sincere _ that he genuinely believes this is what
is in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the focus group's moderator asked about the general
presentation, another woman suggested that the ad focus ``a little
less on him _ he's not real photogenic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation turned to another commercial, a woman
complained that it ``was too long'' and featured ``too much of his
face at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman piped in, ``He doesn't look sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   A man, interrupting, said, ``It's almost like, `I don't believe
my own message.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then a woman defended him, saying, ``He's a very serious
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants seemed to like a commercial that showed Forbes'
accomplishments in business and in public service. ``One of the
complaints has been that he's never been elected to office,'' one
woman said. ``This shows he has done some other things.'' But often
the conversation drifted back to Forbes' complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants suggested that Forbes might smile or laugh
more. ``It made him seem more real,'' one man said. ``When he's got
a serious look on his face, it's not as appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   In dissecting Bush's commercials, one man dismissed the
candidate's accomplishments in Texas: ``I could care less what he's
done in Texas. I want to know what he's going to do for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But a woman, who liked how Bush looked, said: ``He rolls up his
white shirt sleeves and throws his jacket over like he's kind of
casual. And that's appealing, where Forbes is more stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said of Forbes, ``This may sound frivolous, but he
seems like such a rich guy with that suit and tie on _ you take
that jacket off.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the participants sounded a bit sheepish about their
emphasis on the trivial. ``This is a very superficial comment, and
I hesitate to make it,'' one man said. ``But he's not the most
attractive or presidential-looking candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes should not despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may very well say, `I like the blue tie over the red
tie,''' said Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and a
supporter of Al Gore for president. ``But really they are most
concerned about their children's future and education and health
care. They'll give you their opinion on the tie _ but I don't know
how relevant it is.''

   The young doctor was reminiscing about his first year out of
medical school. ``I was chronically in a terribly nervous state,''
he wrote. ``Nearly every case disclosed to me more and more plainly
the depth of my ignorance, my utter unpreparedness and
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been any intern who started working at any
teaching hospital in the country last July (``It was mortifying to
discover that I lacked the knowledge which every nurse
possesses.'') He could have been me 18 years ago, or any other
doctor at almost any time in history. The emotions an obscure
Russian named Vikenty Veressayev detailed in his little-known 1916
classic, ``Memoirs of a Physician,'' are a given in medicine: the
panic, self-doubt, profound exhaustion and occasional exhilaration
of that first year out.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries book-smart youngsters with new diplomas have slunk
out of medical school knowing, if they have any sense at all, that
they are impostors. A few years later they discover they have
turned into doctors. And, for all the tinkering with those years by
generations of medical educators, the alchemy of the transformation
remains almost as mysterious as ever.
</P>
<P>
   How many hours does it actually take to make a doctor? This is
still one of the big mysteries of the process. Is medical care
better delivered by a fatigued young doctor who has been at your
bedside 36 hours _ or by a succession of fresh young strangers who
work shorter shifts, and have heard about you through the medical
equivalent of the game of telephone?
</P>
<P>
   This century has seen a dramatic evolution in medical training
from long working hours to shorter ones. Up through World War II,
interns and residents in the United States were indentured servants
in hospitals, available 24 hours a day. Most received little
compensation (except for room and board) along with a free-form
education that was shaped by whatever sick patients and senior
physicians happened by.
</P>
<P>
   Now their dual roles of worker and student are more precisely
defined. As workers, interns and residents get days off and a
living wage. As students, they attend lectures and conferences that
encompass social and economic aspects of medicine long ignored in
medical training. And as indentured servants _ for they continue to
work many extra hours for the health care system _ they at least
have the satisfaction of knowing that their day-to-day welfare is
of more concern to their employers than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when interns worked every night or every other
night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could
actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the
1970s and 1980s 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace,
and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a double?'' a nurse once asked me when she noticed one
morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she
had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually
working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my
three years of residency.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death
of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long,
unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was
amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours
and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   New York remains the only state where these stipulations are
law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All
internal medicine training programs are now held to similar
standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other
countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour
workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the
practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make
from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are
replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred
from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study
has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep
interns and residents from developing the important instincts those
awful long nights hammered in _ a sense of the pace of illness and
recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?
</P>
<P>
   These details are, of course, the easy part of a medical
education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of
training _ may they never return _ helped teach us one of the
harder lessons too.
</P>
<P>
   Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young
people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death
among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill
themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of
imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective
experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can
teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all.
One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required
to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated
strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every
third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified
that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to
make a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must
feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened _ and with any luck
the lesson will stick even after it is all over.

   In the days when interns worked every night or every other
night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could
actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the
1970s and 1980s 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace,
and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a double?'' a nurse once asked me when she noticed one
morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she
had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually
working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my
three years of residency.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death
of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long,
unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was
amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours
and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   New York remains the only state where these stipulations are
law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All
internal medicine training programs are now held to similar
standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other
countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour
workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the
practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make
from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are
replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred
from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study
has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep
interns and residents from developing the important instincts those
awful long nights hammered in _ a sense of the pace of illness and
recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?
</P>
<P>
   These details are, of course, the easy part of a medical
education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of
training _ may they never return _ helped teach us one of the
harder lessons too.
</P>
<P>
   Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young
people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death
among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill
themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of
imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective
experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can
teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all.
One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required
to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated
strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every
third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified
that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to
make a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must
feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened _ and with any luck
the lesson will stick even after it is all over.

   WASHINGTON _ It is hard to walk into a store these days without
confronting a help-wanted sign. Software whizzes and hamburger
flippers alike can take their pick of jobs, and increasingly can
expect not only a fatter paycheck but some kind of sign-on bonus.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to be working, by most measures the best in
a generation. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate in October 1999
was the lowest since January 1970. Joblessness has been below 4.5
percent for a year, and below 5 percent for nearly two-and-a-half
years.
</P>
<P>
   The big questions now about unemployment are how low it can go _
and whether the improvement can be sustained over the long run as
the economy and the population change.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, for one, seems to think
the unemployment rate should not go much lower. He raised interest
rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point, the third time
he has done so this year, in large part because of concern that the
economy is literally running out of workers to fill all the jobs
being created.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's fear is that as companies have a harder time finding
the workers needed to expand or to replace employees who have left
for better jobs, they will bid up wages, and then raise prices to
maintain their profit margins, setting off an inflationary spiral
that could derail the long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For years, analysts believed that inflation danger signals would
start flashing red if unemployment dropped below about 6 percent
and the economy continued growing at a robust pace. The experience
of the past few years suggests that this so-called ``natural''
unemployment rate is substantially lower, and that the concept is
not precise enough to be used by the Federal Reserve to determine
when to hit the economic brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one knows for sure whether the current jobless rate is
too low for the economy's overall good or whether there is room for
it to drop further. The answer hinges on the economy's ability to
generate increases in the growth rate of productivity _ the amount
each worker can produce in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   From the early 1970s until the mid '90s, productivity appeared
to be growing at about 1 percent a year, a lackluster performance
that had economists puzzled. But in the last few years,
productivity growth has been surging. If the productivity
improvement sticks, the result would be more job creation and
downward pressure on unemployment rates with less risk of inflation
_ what some analysts call the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem now is that growth and unemployment are straining
against the limits of what even the new economy would permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an overheated new economy just like you can have
an overheated old economy,'' said Richard Herd, an economist at the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research
group for the world's industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, one of the biggest influences on the labor
market is sure to be the immense demographic shift the United
States is undergoing. Population growth is slowing, and as the baby
boom generation ages, the nation is getting much older.
</P>
<P>
   One implication is clear: the working age population will be
smaller, suggesting at first blush that very low unemployment might
be the wave of the future. But predicting the effect of the
demographic shifts on issues like unemployment is a hazardous
business.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, slower population growth does not necessarily
mean that there will be fewer workers competing for each job. If
population growth slows without an offsetting increase in
productivity, economic growth could be expected to decline as well,
and so would job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economy's cyclical ups and downs have proven more
powerful so far in determining unemployment than the size of the
labor pool. In Japan, for example, the working age population is
beginning to shrink, yet the unemployment rate has been going up as
the economy suffers through a long downturn. And while there is no
obvious reason why the long economic expansion in the United States
should end anytime soon, the business cycle is by no means dead.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and the size of the labor pool could also be
tremendously influenced by any rise or fall in immigration, or by
changes in the age at which workers choose to retire. A long trend
toward earlier retirement now seems to be giving way to a
willingness or need on the part of many older people to keep
working at least part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply knowing ahead of time the ratio of workers to
non-workers takes you a little way toward answering questions like
the implications for unemployment,'' said Gary Burtless, an
economist at the Brookings Institution. ``But it doesn't take you
terribly far, because that could be determined by other policy
choices or some kind of economic shock.''

   BERLIN _ As leaders of the center-left parties that govern much
of the Western world gather in resplendent Renaissance palaces in
Florence this weekend to ponder the course of the fuzzy but
resonant political idea some of them call the ``third way,'' sharp
differences are evident as to what social democracy in the
post-Cold War world should be.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroeder like to declare
themselves newfound allies in championing market-friendly
governments that still look out for the less fortunate. Out with
tax-and-spend, state-heavy irresponsibility _ in with the new
culture of fiscal conservatism and opportunity. But this surface
accord masks fundamental questions about a ``third way'' ideology
that is part marketing tool, part pragmatism and part the
innovative fruit of the left's past failures.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions in Europe are particularly profound. Britain, like
Bill Clinton's America, is a transformed society, steered to a new
entrepreneurial culture first by Margaret Thatcher and now through
the pro-market centrism of Tony Blair; France is loudly proclaiming
its loyalty to socialism while quietly installing a market-oriented
culture; and Germany is struggling to begin reforms that would end
what Schroeder has dismissively called ``the nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the center-left, Britain does what it says, France does
what it says it will not do and Germany says a lot without proving
able to do much. But there is a central dilemma: the left, once
unified in Europe around the idea of class struggle, has not yet
figured out exactly whom it represents these days and, as a result,
what its priorities should be. Is its most important constituency
still workers and state employees, or young founders of Internet
companies with progressive ideas?
</P>
<P>
   This has been a heady decade for Democrats and Social Democrats.
Seldom has so much power accumulated so fast in one political
family. Deprived of their old communist enemy and disoriented by
the global economy's erosion of such traditional conservative
values as the nation, right-wing political forces have reeled. In
their place, leaders like Blair, Schroeder and Lionel Jospin of
France have stepped forward with a new message in which the
Clintonian echoes have often been unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Clinton years have brought America many
results of which Europeans can only dream: a budget surplus, the
creation of close to 19 million new jobs, sustained growth,
virtually full employment and welfare rolls at a 30-year low. But
at the meeting in Florence convened to ponder 21st-century
``progressive governance,'' Clinton will find his ideas challenged
by Europeans still struggling to galvanize their economies.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundamental level, globalization has challenged the left by
changing the workplace in which socialism evolved. With less than
20 percent of workers in western Europe in factories, the working
class has become less relevant. In a way, this has opened new
opportunities for the pursuit of equality conceived as something
beyond the old vision of class conflict or social leveling, and
more as equality of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But equality, in the words of Ronald Dworkin, a legal scholar at
New York University, ``is now thought to be electoral poison in the
United States and basically has gone off the screen.'' America is
growing more unequal. And, even in Europe, at least outside France,
the idea of ``sufficiency'' has gained ground as a more important
value than ``equality'': society should provide a bare minimum of
social protection and equality of starting positions, but no more
than that.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to move in this ideological direction has come
partly from the global economy. Countries including Germany and
France have seen their state-heavy economic systems challenged by
new demands for competition. Unemployment rates have stayed
stubbornly in the 10 percent range, and employers point to
comprehensive welfare systems that add heavy social insurance
charges to wage costs. Why get a job if benefits plus occasional
work off the books provide a better income?
</P>
<P>
   In the grand tradition of Franco-American sparring, the French _
on the surface, at least _ are clearly most resistant to the notion
of a third way. The platform of Jospin's party for the last meeting
of the Socialist International said capitalism was ``unjust and
often irrational.'' When Jospin deploys his mantra _ ``We reject
the market society'' _ he leaves little doubt that he is referring
to the United States of the super Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Such oratory still has a ring to it. But it is something of a
smokescreen, deployed to mask the radical market-oriented changes
that Jospin's socialists have quietly encouraged in recent years:
sweeping privatization, encouragement of stock options, support for
a nascent share-holding culture inspired by the success of such
former state monopolies as France Telecom. It is not for nothing
that the Bourse has soared: investors understand that left-leaning
theory may be the best buttress for a right-leaning reality.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite has been true in Germany, where the culture is more
literal and conservative. Schroeder, for example, emphasizes a
centrist stance to the point of calling his political platform
``The New Middle.'' But German society has been slow to change,
lagging behind France in flexibility and growth, far exceeding
France in wage costs. ``Germany is still an example of socialism at
work,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank.

   Yet the policy paper on a reinvented left that Schroeder
co-signed with Blair this summer amounted to a remarkably fulsome
endorsement of Clinton's favorite themes. ``Too often rights were
elevated above responsibilities'' by former governments of the
left, the two leaders said, adding that the responsibility of the
individual ``cannot be off-loaded on the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine words, but Germany and Britain remain far apart in reality.
They differ on whether a rampant market should be embraced or
reined in; and what, if anything, to do about regulating the
Internet-driven zone where human activity seems to lie beyond the
control of individual nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different words for different traditions, but the fact
is we have all reached a new place,'' said Sidney Blumenthal, an
adviser to President Clinton. ``We are in the new economy, whether
we like it or not. What is the alternative? Close your economy?
Reflate? Nobody among these center-left leaders is doing that
because everybody knows it leads straight to disaster.'' True, but
the cultural gulfs remain striking. The French, for example, remain
far more adamant about insuring what Jospin calls ``the precedence
of the political over the economic.''
</P>
<P>
   A great Florentine political thinker also believed in that
precedence. His name was Machiavelli and he wrote: ``Above all, a
prince strives to gain from all his acts notoriety as a strong man
of superior ability.'' On that, at least, the still ascendant
center-left might agree. For if Clinton, Blair, Jospin and
Schroeder have one thing in common, it is an intensely pragmatic
nose for power that is stronger than any surviving Socialist,
Social Democratic or Democratic principle in this post-ideological
age.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Only a few weeks ago, after the uninspired 50th
anniversary extravaganza for the People's Republic that equated
President Jiang Zemin with Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
became a victim of Beijing's merciless joke circuit. In stories
told in quiet tea houses and at raucous dinner parties _ the
nearest thing here to Jay Leno's monologues as an index of
political fortunes _ Jiang was portrayed as lacking the vision and
stature that this foundering country needs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-repeated jokes imagined the president's thoughts
during the anniversary parade. He looks to the north, the story
goes, and sees millions of unemployed workers. He looks to the
south and sees millions of prostitutes. He looks to the east and
sees the vast smuggling of goods and he looks to the west and sees
ethnic rebellions. He looks to the sky and sees NATO bombs falling,
then he looks down and finds himself surrounded by Falun Gong
demonstrators intent on continuing their spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang walks to the Mao mausoleum to ask the Great Helmsman's
advice. After hearing all the woes, Mao rises up from his crypt and
says, ``You'd better lie down here, I'll take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't telling that one any more last week, after Jiang
and his fellow party chiefs signed a trade deal with America that
seemed breathtaking in its implications and anything but lacking in
vision. After months of speculation that conservative,
protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand, China made
sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and foreign
investment and to accept international rules governing these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese experts even compared the agreement, which
Americans demanded in return for supporting the country's entry
into the World Trade Organization, to Deng Xiaoping's momentous
``opening and reform'' of the late 1970s, when he cast aside Mao's
screwball economics and introduced market incentives.
</P>
<P>
   China's signature Monday showed that Jiang, and most if not all
of the other six Communist Party leaders who make major decisions
here, are convinced that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these seven
men, who serve on the all-powerful politburo standing committee,
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of pact with the devil,'' said Andrew J. Nathan, a
political scientist at Columbia University. ``You compromise on
some aspects of social and economic control, and hope you can keep
political control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the risks are obvious. Wringing out the state sector and
creating competitive companies, as China hopes to do as a member of
the World Trade Organization, should eventually bring about a
richer, more efficient country. But the lower agricultural tariffs
China agreed to last week will mean a ``blood bath'' for farmers,
as a Western economist said here, forcing more migrants into cities
where they will compete with laid-off factory workers for jobs. In
urban areas, freer trade and investment will cause temporary
dislocations as leaner, technologically advanced foreign companies
wipe out bloated domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even without foreign competition, angry workers and farmers have
protested often enough to put the government on edge. Leaders and
citizens alike know that, at this point in Communist rule,
political obedience depends on the party's ability to deliver
greater wealth.
</P>
<P>
   For the party, there is also a deeper long-term risk. From
President Clinton to eternally hopeful liberals inside China, some
openly voiced the thesis last week that an influx of foreign
companies, and the enforced discipline of global trade rules, will
promote the rule of law and prod along political change.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts think, too, that a growing middle class that owns
homes and businesses and pays taxes will demand a greater voice in
government, and form interest groups outside party control. In the
last two decades, the Mao era's grip over personal decisions like
how and where to live and work has greatly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Fair and predictable enforcement of rules, in business and
throughout society, will certainly improve daily life and aid
China's development. But this is already a prime goal of the
Communist Party leaders, who know that widespread corruption and
arbitrary decisions are corroding the last remnants of popular
faith. In the battle against corrupt provincial and local officials
and in their efforts to build a trimmer, better-educated
bureaucracy, the leaders hope to gain efficiency and also bolster
the party's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese leaders clearly don't embrace the theory that
political change is inevitable,'' said Nathan. ``They intend to
keep a monopoly on political power while still opening the economy.
They no longer insist on compete control over everything because
they realize they don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The global corporations speak in evangelical terms about their
ultimate impact on society, but they are in China for one reason _
to make money. Their greatest need is clear rules, predictability
and social stability. It may well be, as U.S. diplomats argue,
that, as society becomes more sophisticated and diverse, a
political opening will be vital to preserving stability. But it may
also be that political change, when it happens, will not come
smoothly or peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rest of the world might do well to assume
that Jiang and his comrades know more about how to survive as
Communist Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, common sense suggests that the
expanding flow of information _ now aided by the Internet, a true
devil with which the Communists feel they must consort _ will
create deep and unsettling consequences. Monday's pact should
accelerate this subversive exchange of facts and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the mythical patience of the Chinese, politicians
here have to worry a lot more about tomorrow than about the next
year, or the next decade. With his bold promise last week to
embrace the modern world, Jiang has given the Chinese people hopes
and dreams that may sustain them for a while. If all the
contradictions come crashing together one day, well, he is gambling
that may be on someone else's watch.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Only a few weeks ago, after the uninspired 50th
anniversary extravaganza for the People's Republic that equated
President Jiang Zemin with Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
became a victim of Beijing's merciless joke circuit. In stories
told in quiet tea houses and at raucous dinner parties _ the
nearest thing here to Jay Leno's monologues as an index of
political fortunes _ Jiang was portrayed as lacking the vision and
stature that this foundering country needs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-repeated jokes imagined the president's thoughts
during the anniversary parade. He looks to the north, the story
goes, and sees millions of unemployed workers. He looks to the
south and sees millions of prostitutes. He looks to the east and
sees the vast smuggling of goods and he looks to the west and sees
ethnic rebellions. He looks to the sky and sees NATO bombs falling,
then he looks down and finds himself surrounded by Falun Gong
demonstrators intent on continuing their spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang walks to the Mao mausoleum to ask the Great Helmsman's
advice. After hearing all the woes, Mao rises up from his crypt and
says, ``You'd better lie down here, I'll take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't telling that one any more last week, after Jiang
and his fellow party chiefs signed a trade deal with America that
seemed breathtaking in its implications and anything but lacking in
vision. After months of speculation that conservative,
protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand, China made
sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and foreign
investment and to accept international rules governing these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese experts even compared the agreement, which
Americans demanded in return for supporting the country's entry
into the World Trade Organization, to Deng Xiaoping's momentous
``opening and reform'' of the late 1970s, when he cast aside Mao's
screwball economics and introduced market incentives.
</P>
<P>
   China's signature Monday showed that Jiang, and most if not all
of the other six Communist Party leaders who make major decisions
here, are convinced that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these seven
men, who serve on the all-powerful politburo standing committee,
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of pact with the devil,'' said Andrew J. Nathan, a
political scientist at Columbia University. ``You compromise on
some aspects of social and economic control, and hope you can keep
political control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the risks are obvious. Wringing out the state sector and
creating competitive companies, as China hopes to do as a member of
the World Trade Organization, should eventually bring about a
richer, more efficient country. But the lower agricultural tariffs
China agreed to last week will mean a ``blood bath'' for farmers,
as a Western economist said here, forcing more migrants into cities
where they will compete with laid-off factory workers for jobs. In
urban areas, freer trade and investment will cause temporary
dislocations as leaner, technologically advanced foreign companies
wipe out bloated domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even without foreign competition, angry workers and farmers have
protested often enough to put the government on edge. Leaders and
citizens alike know that, at this point in Communist rule,
political obedience depends on the party's ability to deliver
greater wealth.
</P>
<P>
   For the party, there is also a deeper long-term risk. From
President Clinton to eternally hopeful liberals inside China, some
openly voiced the thesis last week that an influx of foreign
companies, and the enforced discipline of global trade rules, will
promote the rule of law and prod along political change.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts think, too, that a growing middle class that owns
homes and businesses and pays taxes will demand a greater voice in
government, and form interest groups outside party control. In the
last two decades, the Mao era's grip over personal decisions like
how and where to live and work has greatly weakened.
</P>

throughout society, will certainly improve daily life and aid

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EASTEUROPE-GENGAP (Bucharest, Romania) _ Since the fall of
Communism 10 years ago, a generation gap has opened up across this
part of Europe. Those who came of age in this new era have little
or no memory of the old. Their parents, conversely, struggle to
understand the new vista of choice. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ACEH (Banda Aceh, Indonesia) _ It has become a
hauntingly familiar drama in Indonesia: families huddling on a
windswept pier or in a crowded bus station, fleeing a home that has
become too dangerous as old grievances give rise to explosive
separatist passions. The last time it was East Timor. Now it is
Aceh (pronounced ah-CHAY), a lush, devoutly Islamic province on the
extreme western edge of the Indonesian archipelago that would like
nothing more than to break away from the central government in
Jakarta. By Mark Landler. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BEREZOVSKY (Cherkessk, Russia) _ Cherkessk may not be
Chappaqua, but Boris A. Berezovsky, like Hillary Rodham Clinton,
has also had to go house hunting far from home. Like Mrs. Clinton,
Russia's most versatile tycoon needs a new political domicile for
his latest act, a campaign for a seat in the Russian parliament.
With elections just a month away, he has catapulted himself into
Karachevo-Cherkessia, to the puzzlement of the 300,000 people who
make up the multiethnic electorate of this tiny, neglected region
in the unruly north Caucasus. By Celestine Bohlen. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-RDP (London) _ Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary for
Northern Ireland, on Saturday set the date of Dec. 2 for when
Belfast will gain the new provincial government called for in the
freshly revived Ulster peace agreement. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-POPE (Rome) _ Showing impatience with the reluctance of
Germany's Roman Catholic bishops to stop offering abortion
counseling, Pope John Paul II told them Saturday to hurry up and
obey his teaching. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-ASSESS (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Most Pakistanis are
eager to give Gen. Pervez Musharraf the benefit of the doubt,
agreeing with him that their wobbly and troubled democracy needed
to be demolished so it could be rebuilt on a surer foundation.
Others, however, merely hear an all-too-familiar melody sung by yet
another crooner with epaulets. ``Military rule always begins with
the same empty promises,'' said. I.A. Rehman, director of the Human
Rights Commission of Pakistan. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-ASSESS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ No visitor in memory has left
as positive and potentially as far-reaching an impression on Turkey
as President Clinton did last week. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   THIRDWAY-CONFERENCE (Florence, Italy) _ Having spoken out
vigorously this summer in favor of the free market, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder of Germany arrived at a conference here Saturday
on the future of Social Democracy saying a leading German company
should be protected against a hostile takeover bid from a British
firm. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GREECE (Athens, Greece) _ Attempting to alleviate the
traditional enmity between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, President
Clinton brought the same message of reconciliation to Athens on
Saturday that he had delivered in Ankara days before. By Marc
Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-PIPELINE (Washington) _ For both financial and political
reasons, the agreement to build a pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil
across Turkey, which the Clinton administration views as a major
strategic victory, is a long way from being a reality, oil
executives and administration officials say. By Jane Perlez. (With
a map.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-MILITARY (Beijing) _ A U.S. Defense Department
official met with Chinese officials Saturday in an effort to
re-establish high-level military contacts abruptly suspended by
Beijing after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
in May. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-SPRAWL (Atlanta) _ Atlanta, like so many other cities,
continues to build malls, office parks and subdivisions, even
though the consequences have been made clear on the region's
highways and in its air. The national call for smarter, more urban
growth has been heeded by the region's leaders, but the packed
parking lots around the Mall of Georgia suggest a deep disconnect
between the way most Americans live and one of the first official
efforts to rein in their appetite for suburban comforts. By David
Firestone. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   TENN-WAXMUSEUM-MYSTERY (Nashville, Tenn.) _ Where do wax figures
go when they die? For more than a quarter of a century the Country
Music Wax Museum was one of Nashville's most colorful tourist
magnets. But after it closed two years ago, the figures
disappeared. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   PILOTS-MENTAL-FITNESS _ The airline industry, which employs tens
of thousands of pilots flying millions of people around the globe,
has long relied on a system of internal monitoring when it comes to
the question of pilot fitness. Pilots are honor bound to report any
concerns about their colleagues; the pilots' union has a panel of
volunteers who can provide professional help for troubled pilots,
and the airlines have generally been good about allowing pilots at
risk to take time off. But for years, critics maintained that the
industry needed to impose a more rigorous and systematic program
for ensuring the mental fitness of pilots. By Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-MONUMENTS (Cortez, Colo.) _ As one of its last major
public land initiatives, the Clinton administration is preparing to
designate as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the
West that federal officials say need protection from future
commercial development and recreational overuse. By Michael
Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   CIVICS-TEST-RESULTS _ One-third of the country's high school
seniors do not understand the fundamentals of American government,
according to results of a national test administered by the
Education Department. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-TV-MOVIE (Hollywood) _ Just as the public has grown
increasingly complacent about the year 2000 computer problem, along
comes ``Y2K,'' the movie. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-POLITICS _ In late 1989, Sen. John McCain went home to
Arizona to fight for his political life. It was at the height of
the savings and loan scandal, and his dealings with Charles
Keating, an Arizona high-flier whose failed thrift was a $2 billion
debacle for taxpayers, were dominating the news in his home state.
That incident shaped the politician he has become. By Jill Abramson
and Alison Mitchell. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ In his unassuming way, Bill
Bradley is controlling the levers of his insurgent campaign. Vice
President Al Gore is not, they assert. And the result, Bradley's
supporters say, is that Bradley looks like the stronger leader. By
James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS _ Short items on politics from around the
nation. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-ASSESS (Washington) _ The Congress that began with the
traumatic Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton ended its
first session on Friday night with both political parties
fine-tuning campaign slogans for next year's high-stakes election
and blaming each other for having lost the art of legislating. By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-NOTEBOOK (Washington) _ There is always a touch of
zaniness surrounding the rush by Congress to get out from under its
workload on Capitol Hill, and this year was no exception. By
Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-DEECEE (Washington) _ President Clinton has signed
legislation that would expand academic options for graduates of
public or private high schools in the District of Columbia by
substantially reducing their tuition at state colleges in Virginia
and Maryland and by offering grants for tuition at private colleges
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   MOBIL-INSIDERTRADING (Washington) _ An Arkansas business
associate of Thomas McLarty, the former White House chief of staff,
has agreed to pay more than $144,000 to settle charges of insider
trading. By Stephen Labaton.

   ATLANTA _ The builders of Georgia's epic new mall, a vast
savanna of shopping on 100 acres, chose a precarious moment in
Atlanta's history to open their doors a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, the city had been trapped under a hood of smog.
Highway information signs begged commuters to eat at their desks.
Traffic was so heavy that a single accident caused nine hours of
delays one morning.
</P>
<P>
   Normally conservative politicians and business leaders had been
driven to create an extraordinarily powerful superagency to slow
the region's growth machine. Its chairman, a real estate developer,
took to quoting Gandhi on greed.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle of Atlanta's summer of excess, the Mall
of Georgia opened 35 miles northeast of downtown in Gwinnett
County. It called itself a new kind of mall, an open-air village
for strollers complete with a nature park, but as the largest mall
in the state, it quickly became an enormous emblem of sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The town square out front could not hide the surrounding
blacktop with spaces for 8,600 cars, because cars are the only way
to get to the Mall of Georgia. There is no public transportation in
Gwinnett County, and none will be available for years.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, like so many other cities, continues to build malls,
office parks and subdivisions, even though the consequences have
been made clear on the region's highways and in its air. The
national call for smarter, more urban growth has been heeded by the
region's leaders, but the packed parking lots around the Mall of
Georgia suggest a deep disconnect between the way most Americans
live and one of the first official efforts to rein in their
appetite for suburban comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the 10-county metropolis that includes Atlanta
has known for years that the region's smashing economic success was
producing so much congestion that its future was threatened. This
year it acted, creating one of the most powerful tools in the
country for containing growth, the Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority, empowered to veto highways, order new rail lines and
deny development like subdivisions and malls.
</P>
<P>
   But sprawl is the result of millions of small, individual
decisions _ from the building of a giant mall to the decision to
shop there _ that have barely changed, despite the public's
expressed disgust with congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Given years of population growth that was overtly encouraged by
government, those decisions have accumulated to make Atlanta the
epicenter of the nation's struggle with road congestion, air
pollution and overdevelopment. No city has scrambled faster to
develop long-range plans that might reduce the effects of growth,
but in no city in America do residents continue to spend more time
in their cars. That is a direct result of the Atlanta area's
extremely low population density, the lowest of the nation's
largest metro areas, and its continuing consumption of forest land
at the rate of 50 acres a day. The Atlanta region has about 1,370
people per square mile, compared with about 5,400 in the Los
Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   If the region still has any hopes for continued economic growth
_ and Atlanta is loathe to turn off the population spigot, which
added more people here in the 1990s than to any other metropolitan
region _ its residents will have to change their way of life, and
they may have started too late.
</P>
<P>
   WITH CAR THE KING, A LACK OF SIDEWALKS
</P>
<P>
   Counties like Gwinnett and Douglas still prefer the tax revenue
of a new mall to rejecting a developer's request; three regional
malls that rival the Mall of Georgia are being built and another is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a renewed interest in developing vacant sections of
downtown and midtown, home buyers still prefer the big lots and low
prices of suburban cities like Cumming and Alpharetta to a smaller,
more expensive city home. And most commuters, particularly those
who work at suburban office parks, still find a single-occupant car
more convenient than a train or bus.
</P>
<P>
   For all the prosperous professionals who have moved into the
core city of Atlanta to escape traffic, the growth of the suburbs
was 100 times greater than that of the city last year. The city, in
fact, has grown little, while the region around it has swelled.
With 427,500 people, Atlanta today accounts for 13.3 percent of the
metropolitan area's 3.2 million residents, while it made up 22.4
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile is so essential here that most neighborhoods lack
sidewalks, and the design of the cities has made it difficult for
people to find ways to reduce driving. Though a growing number have
joined car pools that allow them to use designated faster lanes,
vehicle emissions have hit a historic high. Of more concern, the
region's residents now drive an average of 35 miles a day, an
average higher than anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods continue to reject public transit lines, in part
because they fear that they will bring other races into their
midst, or because they dread the foot traffic and development that
public transit is designed to concentrate. Counties that do try to
restrain growth often face furious opposition in a region with a
strong libertarian streak, as longtime landowners insist on their
right to sell to the highest-paying developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about changing human nature here, and especially
the independent streak that so many Southerners have,'' said Lucy
Smethurst, director of the region's Clean Air Campaign, a
consortium of businesses, government agencies and environmental
groups trying to break long-standing regional habits. ``We're
trying to slow down the Queen Mary, and we've just now seen the
rocks in the water ahead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Atlanta's ambivalence about how to deal with
its roaring growth that even the Mall of Georgia, which one
environmentalist decried as ``the very embodiment of sprawl,'' is
being offered by its supporters as a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   F. Wayne Hill, the chairman of the Gwinnett County Board of
Commissioners, who pushed the mall through the approval process,
said it would keep Gwinnett residents from driving to a mall on the
other side of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not sprawl _ it's actually keeping our people from
driving even further,'' Hill said. ``Do you want everyone on the
roads, driving downtown to shop? Gwinnett needs its own malls
because people are choosing to live here, which they can still do
because this is a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   All that freedom, however, lies at the root of Atlanta's crisis.
The region's population has grown 70 percent since 1980, spilling
into once-rural counties, largely because there was always more
farmland to clear for another subdivision, unimpeded by natural
barriers. Gwinnett County's population more than tripled, to
523,900 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there were few regulatory barriers to growth.
The competition for development and the accompanying tax revenue
led counties to build hundreds of miles of roads without fear of
interference by the state. (The Mall of Georgia will generate
nearly $5 million a year in property taxes and $6 million in sales
taxes.)
</P>
<P>
   That way of thinking began to change in June 1996, when the
Environmental Protection Agency threatened to ban federal money for
highway construction in 13 regional counties because of high ozone
and smog levels. Last year, when the ban took effect, businesses
acted, fearing that government regulations combined with Atlanta's
congestion, pollution and worsening image would begin to hurt
profits.
</P>
<P>
   One business leader very publicly called the federal action a
``train wreck'' for the region. Companies began to organize to
reduce air pollution, which this year produced 69 smog-alert days,
a local record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business community realized that we couldn't
afford to be paralyzed by the situation, the way other cities
are,'' said the chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce,
John A. Williams, a real estate developer. ``To ensure that Atlanta
continued to grow and be prosperous, it became evident that the
single most important issue was improving the quality of life. So
we had to work with the political and environmental communities to
come up with a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, in fact, have done far more than residents to reduce
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, ridership on the region's subway increased
only 1.4 percent. But BellSouth, the huge regional
telecommunications company with headquarters here, announced that
it would consolidate 75 offices, with 13,000 employees, into three
regional centers, each situated at a subway station.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. plans to bring 2,500 employees from the suburbs to
its headquarters downtown. And several real-estate developers are
beginning to concentrate on what is called new urbanism projects,
in which housing is built around offices and shops, encouraging
residents to walk to work.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to find a way to continue the region's growth _ the
lifeblood of corporate profits _ while concentrating it in a way
that is less harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what it means to be a good citizen,'' said BellSouth's
chief executive, F. Duane Ackerman. ``The congestion and air
quality situation has really risen to a crescendo here in Atlanta,
and anything that affects the quality of life could affect the
growth of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, however, business leaders joined forces with
environmental groups to support Gov. Roy Barnes' plan for a Georgia
Regional Transportation Authority, known as GRETA.
</P>
<P>
   The authority, quickly approved by the state Legislature in
March, is intended to provide the firm control over growth and
transportation planning that local governments, competing with one
another, have failed to muster.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will have the power to build (or veto) roads and
transit systems. In theory, it could build and operate a rail line
through any of several counties that have opposed mass transit. It
can also have an effective veto over large subdivisions, office
parks and malls by refusing permits to tie into the road system.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's chairman, Joel Cowan, made it clear in a recent
interview that new projects like the Mall of Georgia would not be
approved unless they had mass transit connections, or at least the
population density to justify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to reorder the culture in which decisions
to build these projects are made,'' said Cowan, a developer and
advocate of better planning. ``A mall like that will be a huge
traffic generator, and there's nothing we can do about it now. But
in the future, we will need to see a great deal more density before
a plan like that is approved, and a corridor for transit. We have
to ensure that these projects don't create new trips.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a mall might be approved if it is integrated
with housing and office buildings. This idea of ``manufactured
density,'' for which Cowan is a leading apostle, is fairly radical
for Atlanta and the Southeast, which grew up around the historical
planning orthodoxy of strictly separating housing and commercial
areas. But a consensus is clearly growing among the region's
leaders that houses, offices and shops must begin sharing the same
space, much as they do in older, Northeast cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way Atlanta is going to have to grow, in true
live-work-walk communities, with enough density to support
transit,'' said Williams, who has bet much of his company on the
concept. ``It's going to be a lifestyle change, but given the
alternative, I think people will take to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That consensus, however, is at a fairly elite level, and it is
unclear whether it will trickle down to the warring camps of
property owners and new residents. A stark example of their
conflicting interests occurred recently in Cherokee County, a
largely undeveloped area 25 miles north of downtown where the
population has grown more than 50 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the urging of newcomers who moved in and then
wanted to slow the growth around them, the county commission passed
an innovative plan to concentrate development in 13 town centers,
leaving most of the county pastoral. Longtime landowners, however,
fought the plan bitterly because it meant they might not be able to
sell to developers; some zoning meetings erupted in fistfights. In
July, the commission dropped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up,'' said Emily Lemcke, the chairwoman of the
Cherokee commissioners and a leading proponent of careful growth.
``I still hope that we can educate people and get them to
understand that the whole region is going to have to change. But
for now, there are still too many people who don't want to be told
how to live their lives or what to do with their land. What we need
is for GRETA to come in and give us some cover.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems quite likely. In September, GRETA delayed a new
beltway in the far northern suburbs, long the favorite of state
highway builders, in favor of more carpool lanes and an expanded
transit system. Barnes has also ordered counties to set aside 20
percent of their undeveloped land for parks and green space.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan, the chairman of the agency, said he planned to interpret
its mandate broadly, and would make the decisions that are too
tough for local politicians to swallow. Asked, for instance, about
the recent refusal by neighborhoods east of downtown in DeKalb
County to accept a new rail line, he noted that the agency had the
power to build a line over local opposition.
</P>
<P>
   EFFORTS TO REVIVE DORMANT DOWNTOWN
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs, too, that the region is beginning to look
inward for its future. Several major projects are under way to
awaken Atlanta's dormant downtown, which until recently had not had
the nightlife to attract nearby residential development. In
September, Turner Broadcasting opened its new basketball and hockey
stadium, Philips Arena, next to its expanding CNN Center, having
reversed a decision to build in the suburbs. Two developers plan to
build a walker-friendly mini-city of homes, offices and shops on
the site of the Atlantic Steel plant, a 144-acre wasteland on the
northern edge of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods near the center of the city have become popular
among young couples who have rejected the commuter's life, making
houses in such areas far more expensive than comparable dwellings
in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too young to be spending our entire lives in the car,''
said Kate Folse, an employee-benefits manager who recently moved
with her husband, Brian, from suburban Duluth, in Gwinnett County,
to the Virginia Highlands area, Atlanta's brick-restaurant and
coffee shop district. ``It was hard convincing my husband, but when
we did the math, we realized we were spending 20 hours a week
commuting, and we had no control of our time. Now we love walking
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Folses, however, are vastly outnumbered by their suburban
counterparts. From April of last year to this year, the 10-county
Atlanta region grew by 94,300 people, the second-largest annual
population increase in its history. But the city of Atlanta grew by
only 900 people.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends show no sign of changing. Last month, local
officials proposed a 25-year plan, intended to reduce ozone
emissions, that still forecasts the region growing by a million
more people by 2025. Most of the projected new residents will live
in suburban areas and continue to drive. Even with all the proposed
spending, the average time that Atlantans spend in the car is
projected to increase to 90 minutes a day, from 80 minutes now.
</P>
<P>
   Some transportation experts say that as long as a region's
economy is growing and creating jobs, there is nothing the city can
do about traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are complaining about congestion really need to
get a life,'' said David T. Hartgen, the head of transportation
studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who has
studied Atlanta's traffic patterns. ``This is a democratic, free
society with a lot of wealth, which translates to private mobility.
Short of extremely draconian measures which no one wants to take,
there's almost nothing that will materially affect traffic
congestion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In late 1989, Sen. John McCain went home to Arizona to fight for
his political life.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the height of the savings and loan scandal, and his
dealings with Charles Keating, an Arizona high-flier whose failed
thrift was a $2 billion debacle for taxpayers, were dominating the
news in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faced a hail of hostile questions, even at the Mesa
Rotary Club in bedrock Republican territory. After one of the
club's elders rose to defend him and say he still believed in him,
the senator mordantly observed, ``The fact that my supporters even
feel they need to say these things is evidence of how serious the
situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly the most difficult experience in my political
life,'' he now says about this tumultuous time. During a 14-month
Senate ethics investigation that ended with his exoneration, he and
four other senators stood accused of exerting improper influence by
meeting with federal bank regulators on behalf of Keating, who had
contributed $1.5 million to the political causes and campaigns of
the senators, including $112,000 to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told allies, including his lawyer, John Dowd; a former
Senate colleague, Warren Rudman; and a Senate aide, that the
Keating investigation was more painful than being held as a
prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a searing experience for John,'' said Dowd, who
represented him during the ethics inquiry. ``He told me it was
worse than being in Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal left a stain on his Senate record, and some political
strategists believe the issue will come up again if McCain
continues to gain traction in a presidential bid in which he has
been highlighting his crusade against special interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the Keating mess also stoked and hardened McCain's
determination to be his own man in the Senate, to go his own way no
matter what. These McCain traits are appealing to many voters,
especially in states like New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   His time under ethics scrutiny ``only further encouraged him to
follow his own compass,'' said Scott Celley, his former press
secretary. ``His attitude was that `I've got to decide what's right
for myself and go at it without relenting, no matter who is
standing in the way.''' Celley says McCain has carried that
attitude with him in other fights, from overhauling campaign
finance to federal anti-tobacco legislation to this year's budget
battle, in which the McCain has denounced pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   The cloud of scandal did not lift until Nov. 20, 1991, when
McCain was exonerated by the Senate Ethics Committee after an
investigation that included weeks of televised hearings. Although
the committee found that he had ``exercised poor judgment'' in
attending, with four other senators, two meetings with federal
banking regulators, it found no improper action on his part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found nothing in my investigation which caused me to
question Senator McCain's integrity,'' said Robert Bennett, the
Washington lawyer who was special counsel to the ethics panel
during what is called the Keating Five investigation. Bennett, more
recently, has been one of President Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had taken $112,000 in Keating-related campaign donations,
trips aboard Keating's corporate jet and family vacations at the
executive's Bahamas hideaway. While legal, these gifts made his
attendance at the meetings with federal regulators all the more
questionable. (The other four senators had also taken large
contributions from Keating, some of them far more than McCain.)
</P>
<P>
   He survived and was re-elected easily in 1992 and again, with
almost 70 percent of his state's vote, in 1998. Three other members
of the Keating Five were more seriously rebuked by the ethics panel
and all of them retired rather than face difficult re-election
battles. John Glenn of Ohio, who was exonerated with McCain, was
also re-elected in 1992, but retired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now that McCain is running for president, and with the passage
of time, he says he does not view the Keating Five investigation as
a ``defining moment'' in his career, though many of his friends and
other political observers say it did influence his development as a
crusader for changing campaign finance and as a Senate maverick. He
also now says that the experiences of going through five and a half
years as a prisoner of war and the Keating investigation are not
comparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult trauma for me because my reputation as
an honorable person was brought into severe question,'' he
explained. ``Sure, it was difficult, but it was not comparable to
being in a POW camp.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two-year investigation was a scalding education in the
corrosive world of money and politics and the growing partisanship
of a once-collegial Senate club.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted that he was not influenced by any political
contributions from Keating, but said, ``The thing I learned was
that it's not only impropriety that counts, it's the appearance
that is just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Attending two meetings with federal regulators in 1987, McCain
concedes, was a mistake. ``Going into that room gave a definite
appearance of impropriety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Keating Five affair, McCain became one of the
Senate's strongest advocates for changing campaign finance rules.
His long, uphill battle to overhaul the nation's election laws and
to ban the unrestricted donations known as soft money has earned
him many enemies in his own party. McCain said he was interested in
the issue before the Keating Five scandal, but had reservations
about Democratic bills that would have used taxpayer money for
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, who filed the ethics complaint on behalf of
Common Cause that led to the Senate's Keating Five inquiry, said:
``Senator McCain's national leadership on the campaign finance
reform issue in my view transcends any notions of just responding
to the Keating Five problems he encountered. McCain's commitment on
the issue has been real and deep, and his leadership has been
courageous in publicly challenging his own party and Senate
colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Another effect, according to several former and current
political allies, was to make him determined to go his own way in
the Senate. At first, McCain trusted that the Senate Ethics
Committee would drop him from the investigation, as Bennett had
recommended because his involvement was less than the other
senators. McCain had only reluctantly attended the two meetings
with regulators, in part because Keating was a large employer in
his state.
</P>
<P>
   Before the controversial meetings, Keating had called McCain a
wimp, because he would not intervene for him more aggressively with
the regulators, and the two men never spoke to each other again.
And once the regulators told the senators that there was a criminal
referral on the Keating case, McCain dropped the matter entirely. (
Keating was eventually convicted on state and federal fraud charges
and served four years in prison. He now lives in Arizona.)
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was the only Republican embroiled in the affair, and
Democrats on the panel would not release him, even at the urging of
his friend Rudman, who was then a senator from New Hampshire and
the senior Republican on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was going to remain their Republican hostage, no matter
what,'' Rudman wrote in his memoir, ``Combat.'' The ethics
investigation took two years to complete, which taught McCain he
could not rely on the go-along-get-along ethos of the Senate in an
era of growing partisan rancor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept being disappointed,'' he says, ``because I kept
thinking the thing would be resolved more quickly than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy for surviving the Keating ordeal was candor,
especially with the press. It is a strategy he has followed ever
since and one that has gained him admirers in the news media, if
not among his Senate colleagues, some of whom view his disclosures
as posturing.
</P>
<P>
   After initially exploding in anger at a few Arizona reporters
and columnists, he held a 70-minute news conference and promised to
answer any questions about the Keating affair. He would speak out
about what happened, even if it meant casting colleagues in an
unflattering light.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, tensions mounted between him and
another member of the Keating Five, a fellow Arizonan, Dennis
DeConcini. The former senator, now a Washington lobbyist, refuses
to comment on McCain, other than to say they are ``not friends.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candor has also bruised feelings among Senate
colleagues, who resent his comments about the corrupting influence
of special influence political donations. In his successful effort
to kill the McCain-Feingold campaign finance overhaul bill, Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., angrily chided McCain for not backing up
his oratory with specific examples of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``His colleagues who now wonder why he is candid should not be
surprised, given what they put him through in the Keating
investigation,'' Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the Keating investigation was also a very difficult
time. McCain's wife, Cindy, helped with the couple's bookkeeping,
and some of the flights the senator took on the Keating corporate
jet were not accounted for properly. He ended up repaying an
additional $13,000 for the flights, which created more fodder for
the investigation, though McCain was ultimately cleared of any
wrongdoing on the issue of the flights, too.
</P>
<P>
   Worry over the investigation may have ``been a contributing
factor'' to his wife's drug problem, he said, though it mainly
stemmed from painful back surgery that left her addicted to
prescription medicine. But, he said, the Keating Five investigation
``was a very tense time for her,'' adding, ``It's always harder for
a spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, McCain's mood was dark and ``rarely brightened,''
according to his biographer, Robert Timberg. But publicly, he never
hunkered down, as did some of the other members of the Keating
Five, the sobriquet McCain always hated because it did not
differentiate among their different levels of involvement,
according to Celley.
</P>
<P>
   McCain agreed to testify in court against Keating in a lawsuit
filed by bondholders of Keating's thrift, Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan,
who successfully sued and recovered millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my first and best witness,'' said Joseph Cotchett of
Burlingame, Calif., a prominent Democrat who was the lawyer who
represented the bondholders against Keating. The four other
senators refused to testify, according to Cotchett.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did not get out of politics after the Keating mess
and why he decided to run for president knowing that the ethics
investigation would be dredged up again, McCain replied with a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Several sharp blows to the head
when in prison accounts for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning serious, he added: ``It's something I'll be judged
on. My hope is that it will be judged in the context of all of my
legislative career as opposed to as an isolated thing.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russia's brutal effort to
subdue runaway Chechnya is messily wiping out civilians and
soldiers alike, drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation,
working quite well, thank you. Americans cannot truly imagine
Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic
collapse. But perhaps they can get a sense of the emotional release
that Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt,
after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to
finally regain their military prowess by striking back first at
Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against
Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991. By Michael Wines. WITH GRAPHIC.

   POLLING-RELIABILITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Most politicians'
vigilant reliance on poll numbers raises an important but
seldom-asked public policy question: Who actually talks to
pollsters and who does not? The answer, it turns out, is troubling
news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the
numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just
10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's dirty
little secret, because most polling firms refuse to divulge their
surveys' refusal rates. By Don Van Natta. (Moved in the `a'

   JUVENILE-JUSTICE-REVIEW (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Many psychologists
and sociologists nowadays worry that boys are growing up too fast
these days. Boys are increasingly dressing like adults, watching
television shows for adults and having sex. The answer, the child
development experts say, lies in letting boys stay young longer,
through more parental guidance and supervision, more mentoring and,
for disturbed boys, more counseling before emotional problems lead
to potentially lethal violence. Yet the nation's juvenile justice
system is rapidly moving in the opposite direction, with ever more
boys being tried as adults. By Keith Bradsher. WITH GRAPHIC.

   FRANCE-DIET-REVIEW (Undated) _ If it tastes good, eat it! Paul
Rozin, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans yet suffer fewer health consequences. Where other
researchers have offered reasons ranging from genetic differences
to red wine consumption, Rozin suggests that it may all come down
to one's state of mind. By Eric Nagourney.

<P>
   FOCUS-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Every major presidential
candidate is spending money to assemble focus groups to glean
intelligence on everything from fashion to policy. Their reliance
on these groups underscores the degree to which politicians _ in
trying to capture the attention of an often distracted public _
find themselves worrying as much about presentation as about
substance. While many campaigns say the groups give them tips that
cannot be found in sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings
are hardly representative of the electorate. By Richard L. Berke
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The big questions now about
unemployment are how low it can go and whether the low rate can be
sustained over the long run as the economy and the population
change. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan feels the jobless rate should
not go much lower, or else there could be inflationary pressures as
employers are forced to raise prices after bidding up pay for
scarce workers. But there is considerable uncertainty among other
economists about how low unemployment can go before the risks
outweigh the benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.

   DOCTORS-TRAINING-REVIEW (Undated) _ How long does it take to
make a doctor? Book-smart youngsters with new diplomas slink out of
medical school knowing that they are impostors. A few years later
they discover they have turned into doctors. And, for all the
tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the
alchemy of the transformation and how long it should take remain
almost as mysterious as ever. A look at some problems in medical
training and efforts to resolve them. By Abigail Zuger.

   EUROPE-U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW (Florence, Italy) _ Leaders from
Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroeder like to declare themselves
newfound allies in championing market-friendly governments that
still look out for the less fortunate. Out with tax-and-spend,
state-heavy irresponsibility _ in with the new culture of fiscal
conservatism and opportunity. But this surface accord masks
fundamental questions about a ``third way'' ideology that is part

<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ After months of speculation that
conservative, protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand,
China made sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and
foreign investment and to accept international rules. The deal
showed that President Jiang Zemin and most of the other Communist
Party leaders believe that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these men
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power. By Erik Eckholm.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russia's brutal effort to
subdue runaway Chechnya is messily wiping out civilians and
soldiers alike, drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation,
working quite well, thank you. Americans cannot truly imagine
Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic
collapse. But perhaps they can get a sense of the emotional release
that Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt,
after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to
finally regain their military prowess by striking back first at
Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against
Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991. By Michael Wines. WITH GRAPHIC.

TENSIONS KEPT CONGRESS DIVIDED THROUGH '99 SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congress that began with the traumatic Senate
impeachment trial of President Clinton ended its first session
Friday night with both political parties fine-tuning campaign
slogans for next year's high-stakes election and blaming each other
for having lost the art of legislating.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise that finally allowed the Senate to pass the
year's last spending package and adjourn for the year came seven
weeks after the start of the new fiscal year. The deal came on
legislation that must pass to keep the government running. But
beyond the spending bills, the 106th Congress has mostly been
characterized by fierce politicking, missed opportunities and
legislative standoff.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert went onto an empty House floor
Friday and proclaimed, ``We have made great progress in preparing
America for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of Congress were scathing in their assessments
of what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a session of great initiatives,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``This was a session that was
post-impeachment and pre-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking his party's
presidential nomination, said recently, ``We have a poisoned
atmosphere in Washington that can only be cured by a new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Early expectations that prosperity would allow this Congress to
seize the moment and restructure the Medicare and Social Security
programs to prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom
generation evaporated quickly. Clinton's proposal for a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit languished. The horrific
shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado could not propel gun
control legislation through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority built little public support for its
10-year, $792 billion tax cut and did not attempt to override
Clinton's veto of the measure. And the Senate's rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ended any last pretense of
bipartisanship on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent accomplishment of the year was legislation
repealing Depression-era laws that had limited the ability of
banks, securities firms and insurance companies from entering into
each other's businesses. The bill passed because of enormous and
unified lobbying from some of the most powerful business interests
in America and because most of the issues were not partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The partisanship that roils the Congress on other issues has
several causes. Tensions from impeachment still flare. The coming
election has also put both parties on a war footing.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the House, and possibly the Senate, could be up for
grabs in the 2000 elections. And the fierce struggle for the House,
in particular, sets the tone for debate on almost every issue of
any significance. The Republicans are trying to govern with one of
the narrowest majorities this century and they face a Democratic
minority that is in a determined, disciplined drive to pick up the
five seats needed to return to power.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Each party in the House accuses the other of trying to destroy
any possibility of compromise. House Majority Leader Dick Armey
said in an interview that House Democrats were trying to wrest back
control of the House in the 2000 elections by dedicating themselves
to ``stopping everything we can at every point'' so that they can
run against a ``do nothing'' Congress. ``They disclaim
partisanship,'' Armey said, ``as if they're perfectly innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said, ``The answer to that
is rubbish.'' Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who decided against a
2000 presidential run so he could focus on the battle for the
House, ticked off a list of Democratic priorities, from overhaul of
the campaign finance law to regulation of health maintenance
organizations to gun control. He then accused the Republicans of
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do all those things,'' Gephardt said. ``They just
don't want to do it.'' Pointing to polls showing that all these
measures have wide support, he said, ``They're frustrating the
agenda that the American people really want.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than nine months after Clinton's acquittal, the tensions
and resentments from impeachment lie just below the surface,
occasionally bursting into public view.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
insisted that the Senate had come through the the president's trial
``without a lot of residual scars.'' But he soon called Clinton
``the most partisan president I've ever seen'' and compared him
unfavorably with Richard M. Nixon, the Republican president who
resigned under threat of impeachment in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, even at the worst moments, Nixon wasn't partisan,''
Lott said. ``In fact, many Republicans thought he wasn't partisan
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Senate killed the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty
this fall, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., startled the chamber by
reciting an imaginary conversation between Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair about the treaty. It ended with Blair
saying, ``Give my regards to Monica.'' The reference to Monica
Lewinsky was later struck from the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said, ``The environment here has been
polluted by impeachment and by many members' dislike and distrust
of the president.'' He added, ``This is a president who has never
reached out to the Congress or built relationships up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their minority status, Democrats have largely set the
agenda for this Congress. By using parliamentary maneuvers in the
Senate and by building coalitions with Republican moderates in the
House, Democrats have managed against the odds to pass gun control
legislation in the Senate and push their favored versions of
campaign finance legislation and regulation of health maintenance
organizations through the House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But on one issue after another, the Democrats lacked the
strength to prevail. The Senate killed campaign finance overhaul in
a filibuster. Gun control legislation was defeated on the House
floor when conservatives voted against the series of moderate
measures and so did Democrats who considered them too weak. It is
possible that a gun control bill could come out of a House-Senate
conference committee next years.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans were hostile to the managed care legislation
that the House passed. So Hastert named an array of lawmakers who
oppose the House's own bill to negotiate over a measure with the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, the Senate passed an increase in the minimum
wage, an issue that has been a Democratic priority, but linked it
to new tax breaks the administration opposed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lott said: ``The Democrats still are chafing over the fact that
they are in the minority. They think they should set the agenda. We
don't agree with that.'' He added that Republicans could take
credit for stopping ``a lot of bad initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration, the Democrats, if they had their way,
they would have spent more, raised taxes and increased regulations
across the board,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, trying to hold together their coalition of
conservatives and moderates, put forward an extremely modest agenda
of their own, one that would not showcase their divisions. No
longer were they acting like the revolutionaries who wanted to
transform Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, Republicans said they wanted to
provide for national security, retirement security, education and
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   So they took credit for increasing military pay and Pentagon
spending, for granting more flexibility in how federal education
money can be used, and for requiring the administration to deploy a
missile defense when it becomes technologically feasible. They also
said they had created a new political firewall against using Social
Security money to pay for other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is compassionate conservatism,'' Hastert said on the
House floor, linking Congress to the presumed Republican
front-runner for president, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Republican emphasis on education and
protecting Social Security is also a response to the Democrats, who
have used those issues in their campaigns. ``These are issues that
traditionally have been Democratic issues,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn. ``We're learning how to deal with them. It will take
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' signature issue was the tax cut. And they
refused even to enter negotiations over it once Clinton vetoed the
$792 billion measure, unwilling to get into a negotiation that
would force them to agree to new programs in exchange for a smaller
tax cut. Instead they hoped for the election of a Republican
president in 2000 who would sign such a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are saying, `Let's wait until the election,'''
said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. ``Then we'll do better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties pledged to return to the unfinished agenda next
year and some Republicans held out hope that Clinton would want to
work with them for a final burst of accomplishments in his last
year in office. But Lott acknowledged that making fundamental
changes in either the Social Security or Medicare programs would be
even more difficult in the election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the likelihood of doing those kinds of things in
2000 are not very likely,'' he said. ``I think they will be done in
2001 because they need to be done.''

IN EASTERN EUROPE, A NEW GENERATION IS SHIFTING PRIORITIES

   BUCHAREST, Romania _ In the Vox Maris discotheque, Graziela
Tache extended one leg even farther out from under her tiny slit
skirt. ``You know what these boots cost?'' she asked. ``They were
$250. You know what that waitress earns? Maybe $100 a month. There
are two levels in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tache, all of 19, is one of the young in the former
communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe who have made it
in the post-communist decade.
</P>
<P>
   She earned her money the new-fashioned way: capitalism, and
connections.
</P>
<P>
   She did well in her three years of stylist school and snagged
the wealthy boyfriend seen by many young women in the
post-communist world as a prerequisite for success. With his help,
she opened her own salon and has five women working for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother sees me spend so much, she does like this,''
said Ms. Tache, clawing the perfectly blended base makeup on her
cheeks. ``But I am the big happiness in my family. My parents say
they would rather have a lot in the refrigerator than to buy
clothes, but I don't get this mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I'll be in the ground and talking to my neighbor,''
she added, miming a nudge to the coffin next to hers. ``So now I
like to have a little bit of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of communism 10 years ago, a generation gap has
opened up across this part of Europe. Those who came of age in this
new era have little or no memory of the old and little or no
ability to conjure up their parents' childhood in the red
neckerchiefs of Communist Pioneers, the old excitement of trying to
dial past the jamming to hear Radio Free Europe, or the tedium of
studying an artificial history from books larded with wooden
language and airbrushed portraits of unknown but all-powerful
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, conversely, struggle to understand the new vista
of choice and _ for the fortunate _ the material joys that eluded
them but are open to their children. Many of the older generation
pine for the vanished sureties of communism. They are in shock,
lost in a world that values attributes and accouterments vastly
different from those they were raised to appreciate; their children
are listening to hip-hop, exchanging e-mail with foreigners,
comparing Nike sneakers and possibly even Alpine vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 80 percent of the people would give up democracy to
have the secure life they had before,'' said Marian Stanescu, 39,
sipping beer at a roadside stall in impoverished rural Romania,
where a third of the country's 22 million people live on less than
$2 a day and the national government is going deeper into debt this
winter to buy heating oil for the urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, this poverty was masked under the rigid, meager
securities of uniformity. Now, the gap yawns between men like
Stanescu and Alin Teodorescu, a former statistician whose daughter
attends medical school in Texas on the profits from his private
company in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Stanescu conceded, ``There were restrictions:
No passport, you couldn't go anywhere. But there was respect for
labor. The average salary had purchasing power. My father was a
steel-mill foreman his whole life and retired with a double
pension. I just visited him, and he had disconnected his phone, his
lifeline to the family. He can't pay it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the communist days, the warmth of those kinds of family ties,
of good friendships cemented by endless chats and much alcohol, by
political jokes told around kitchen tables, helped compensate for
the often drab rhythm of daily life. Usually, it was only in this
private sphere that anyone was forced to assume responsibility for
actions, or was judged as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home, many decisions lay with the Communist Party;
wangling one's way past the absurdities thrown up by a system that
tried to plan everything became a way of life; the opaque and
corrupt operation of power and a system that came to depend largely
on lip service rewarded deviousness, not honesty.
</P>
<P>
   The young of these nations inherited the ruins of that failed
ideology. Over time, communism had changed the way that its
citizens thought and operated _ so powerfully, in fact, that even
the common culture of Germany cannot overcome the many divisions
between its formally reunited citizens in East and West.
</P>
<P>
   The cynicism and deceit of the old system _ many of whose
foremost families have also become prominent, and rich, in the Wild
East of post-communism _ have combined with the new material
opportunities to create, in many of today's East European young,
the ultimate ``me'' generation.
</P>
<P>
   In the chase for the good life, the self is paramount, said
Janos Balazs, a Hungarian sociologist who said his surveys of
values had found a huge upsurge of selfishness in the young,
manifested in many ways: rude driving in the powerful cars now
available, rising juvenile crime and the notion that honesty with
friends is less important than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the middle-aged generation, solidarity at the
workplace was once very important,'' Balazs said. ``Nowadays,
everybody is secretive about their extra income, about their
problems. Recently, for economic reasons, my university laid off a
female professor who was perfectly good. No one stood by her. For
us, this is unusual. For the youth, it's normal. They are more
self-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   This lack of empathy, combined with the chaotic and often
corrupt politics of this part of Europe, feeds disdain for the kind
of political and social engagement on which democracy thrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored by politics. I'm disgusted by them. I don't want to
get involved,'' said Svetoslav Velkov, 20, a business student in
Sofia, Bulgaria, who _ along with many other young people in the
former Communist world _ turned down his first chance to vote, in a
mayoral election held this year.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Lydia, a 41-year-old history professor, was pained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We argued,'' she said. ``I told him that democracy requires
participation and support. He was only 10 when the end of communism
was announced, and in fact it began to decay five years earlier. He
takes democracy for granted. Because it was always around him, he
thinks it will be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Andras Bajkor, 17, a high-school student fluent in
English who wore an American lumberjack jacket at Morrison's Music
Pub, a youth bar in Budapest, has little idea, he said, how to
relate to two of his father's most formative experiences: poverty,
and the suppression of his Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   His father did not learn that he was Jewish until he was 16, and
then by accident. Having hidden from the Nazis and fearing another
outbreak of anti-Semitism, Bajkor's grandparents simply never told
their son.
</P>
<P>
   In the new democratic Hungary, the younger Bajkor is proud to be
Jewish and bothered that one of his friends had converted to
Christianity as a child because of taunts. But he admitted that,
like most of his peers, Christian and Jewish, he is not religious.
</P>
<P>
   His father's memories of poverty seem to come from another
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad lived on the 10th floor, and even if he had luggage, he
would walk up, because you had to pay the elevator guy,'' he said.
``He would buy bread with the money he saved. Sometimes, he went to
the neighbors to ask for bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes back to him,'' he continued, ``when we are eating
now. He says he'd like to cry, because he is so lucky that we can
eat meat.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, he said, sometimes complain that families are less
close nowadays. ``When I get a present from my parents, it's
normal,'' he said. ``But they don't see as much happiness as in the
old times. In those days, for anything, for the most little thing,
even a Matchbox car for Christmas, the children would stay with
their parents for hours and hours, thanking them for the present.''
</P>
<P>
   This feeling that something in the social fabric has been lost
is widespread among the middle-aged of the post-communist world,
and even more prevalent among their parents _ today's grandparents
_ who grew up in the devastation of World War II and were simply
glad to have survived and to have a system that provided for them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common complaints of parents and grandparents
about their offspring is that the young no longer read. In the
boring old communist days, a Western book, a good Tolstoy novel or
_ more rarely _ a piece of samizdat, forbidden literature
hand-typed on thin sheets of paper and passed around to avoid the
censor, were a welcome relief from everyday life, a window on a
world that could be conjured only in the imagination. Now, they
grouse, their children play mindless videogames and watch movies
like ``Die Hard,'' and talk soccer, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, families can still be close. Children are not the
only ones to have profited from the new freedoms; parents, too,
have parlayed talents suppressed under communism into newfound
prosperity _ although the experience can vary widely: a doctor in a
state-run hospital can earn, without the near-ubiquitous bribes on
the side, only $40 a month, much as she did a decade ago. A dentist
who starts a private practice can make $65,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, as a statistician, Teodorescu, now the Bucharest
businessman, earned half the salary of his neighbor, a tire-plant
worker, because the state, which set salaries, lionized manual
labor. Both suffered because their state-owned apartments were
heated only four hours a day, and food and medicine were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Teodorescu had another problem, for a researcher: The state
restricted access even to the public library.
</P>
<P>
   Now his neighbor is out of work because his inefficient plant
was closed; he tried to get a job as a policeman, ``but even they
want young men who can speak English,'' Teodorescu said.
</P>
<P>
   Teodorescu has a daughter going to medical school in Texas; she
and her husband cannot afford the tuition, so Teodorescu is paying
it. He can manage it because his profitable market research firm
was, he says, the first Romanian company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a conference of researchers the other day,'' he said.
``And they were all in the same crazy situation _ Romanians sending
money to America for children in school. I calculated that, among
us, we were sending America $1 million. I said, `Guys, for $1
million, we could start a nice small university here.' But they
didn't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, like many other young Romanians, has emigrated
knowing there is not enough work. In his father's generation, many
Romanians are miserable on tiny pensions, although a lucky few are
getting back buildings or other property seized by the Communists
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Teodorescu himself is satisfied, he said, because he retooled
himself to cope with changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Milev, 50, has also made it. He is chief of research at
the Bulgarian state gas company. Asked what his 14-year-old son,
Nikolai Jr., owns that he did not have at that age, Milev started
naming almost everything he had ever wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A tape recorder was at the top of his list, he said. He could
listen to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Cream on Radio
Luxembourg and Radio Beirut, but could not buy their albums, so
there was no way to take their music to parties. The only recorder
available in the shops, an East German model, would have cost his
father two months' salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he has several,'' he said of his son. ``Last month we
changed his Walkman for a new model.'' His son also has a 21-gear
mountain bike. He did not realize there was a time when bikes had
only one gear, and his father would work as a porter in a brewery
for two months to earn the price of a Russian-made one.
</P>
<P>
   For the young, particularly the women, of these countries, who
mostly can only dream of the kind of equality and opportunity
achieved in recent decades by their Western sisters, sex is one
area in which the generation gap is most tangible.
</P>
<P>
   As in the old communist days, there is no behavior homogenous to
Eastern Europe, whose countries have richly varied histories and
took different paths to communism, as now to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In sexual relations, for instance, Poland had more liberal
abortion laws under communism than in the present, where the Roman
Catholic church wields enormous influence. In the old days, urban
Albanian teenagers put the concrete bunkers left littered over
their land by the paranoia of the dictator Enver Hoxha to use for
sexual trysts; today, those bunkers are more likely to be inhabited
by the very poor, who have migrated from the mountains of northern
Albania seeking something better than subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary now, most students said they receive regular sex
education; those in Bulgaria said they have had none.
</P>
<P>
   After pausing to think about the greatest difference between her
mother and herself, Reka Mihola, 20, a law student leaving a
University of Budapest disco one night with her boyfriend, asked:
``Can I tell you? It's personal. In their day, you didn't go to
sleep with a boy the first time. But now it's rather accepted. My
mother can accept it, but it was hard for her the first time. She
asked us only, `Was the bed too small for you?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Bucharest, no such gap seems to divide
Georgiana Marin, 17, and her mother Dorina, 44.
</P>
<P>
   They remember huddling together behind a bed when a bullet
smashed their apartment window during the chaotic street fighting
that followed the overthrow of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they still huddle together; they are matched even in
a certain naivete. Both are afraid of drugs rumored to be coming
into Georgiana's high school _ particularly marijuana, which they
both have heard is injected by needle and which, Georgiana says she
has heard, ``leads to harder things.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are disgusted by the huge percentage of Georgiana's
classmates who smoke. Both are bothered that parents are now so
indifferent or busy that one of Georgiana's classmates is repeating
sophomore year without her parents realizing it _ which would have
been unthinkable under communism, Dorina said, because the
principal would have called them repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Both are glad that doctors visit the school to talk about birth
control. When Dorina was young, abortion was the primary means to
prevent unwanted births. In 1968, Ceausescu, obsessed with having a
larger Romanian population, outlawed it; the birthrate quickly
doubled. In 1989, those 21-year-olds swamped the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the ironies of history that abound in these countries,
it was, among other things, the anger of these young, underemployed
people that led to the routing of Ceausescu, who was executed only
days after his fall from power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day,'' Dorina said, ``people were ashamed to talk about
sex. Now, some shameless teenagers brag about it in front of their
parents. I'd be hurt if she did that, but if my daughter wants to
have a sex life, she can. I'm glad Romania woke up to a world in
which virginity is not obligatory.''

FOCUS ON OIL PIPELINE TURNS TO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For both financial and political reasons, the
agreement to build a pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil across
Turkey, which the Clinton administration views as a strategic
victory, is far from being a reality, oil executives and
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   For years, oil companies have looked at various pipeline routes
to get the Caucasus region's vast oil reserves to market. And they
have signed similar deals before, though this one looks more solid.
</P>
<P>
   For the oil companies, the chosen route must be profitable. But
for the Clinton administration, the prime concern has been
strategic: guaranteeing that any pipeline would skirt Russia or
Iran and deny them a choke-hold over a new energy supply for the
West. The administration would also like to use the oil deal to
bring several former Soviet republics into a Western-looking bloc,
and to enhance the regional power of Turkey, a key NATO ally.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the route agreed to last week _ which is
strategically advantageous to the United States but costly for the
oil companies _ can be made profitable quickly is still a big
question. So too is the nature and extent of political fallout with
Russia, the loser in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The key oil company involved in the pipeline project, BP Amoco,
said it would seek help from Washington to line up enough oil
shipments from producers in the region to make the pipeline
commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
   The company, said Michael Townshend, its director of
international affairs, has set a deadline of next October for
raising financing and commitments to use the pipeline. A new batch
of oil from the Caspian will be ready by 2004, and the oil
companies will need to make a decision by October for where they
are going to build a pipeline to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible, but it's a stretch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way this is going to work is to make the pipeline as
affordable as possible for shippers to put their oil down it,'' he
added. ``We're asking the United States government to attract as
much oil as possible and to attract as much financing as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If that money is not in place in time, BP Amoco can try to get
the oil out by a different route, by expanding the capacity of an
existing pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Supsa, Georgia, near
the Black Sea, Townshend said. From there the oil would be taken by
tanker through the Bosporus, a route less to the liking of
Washington and the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was also possible that BP Amoco might just delay the next
phase of oil production in the Caspian Sea if the structure of the
pipeline deal was still not settled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not pledged any money for the
project beyond $500 million in loan guarantees from the Overseas
Private Investment Corp. and the Export-Import Bank, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies had first hoped Washington would allow a
shorter route through Iran, with an outlet at the Persian Gulf. But
this was blocked by Washington's refusal to lift economic sanctions
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond strategic considerations, the route through the narrow
Bosporus also raises some environmental problems, and as they
became more evident, the oil companies leaned more toward the more
expensive route through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   As the oil companies wavered, Turkey tried to make the route to
its port of Ceyhan more appealing by announcing it would pay for
cost overruns on the estimated $1.4 billion the pipeline is
expected to cost the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was announced at a European summit meeting in
Istanbul, Turkey, last week, it was, for Turkey, the most
substantive part of President Clinton's five-day visit there. The
other countries to sign the deal were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   That victory for the Clinton administration may have as yet
unseen costs, however. Administration officials acknowledged that
Russia has always viewed the pipeline route through Turkey as an
implicit threat. While the Russian reaction appeared muted last
week, even the prospect of a pipeline deal had led Moscow officials
to speculate publicly that Washington was trying to foment chaos on
its southern borders.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, said Russia perceived Washington's efforts in the
Caspian Sea as the equivalent of NATO expansion on Russia's
southern flank.
</P>
<P>
   Russia came to live with NATO's embrace of its former satellites
_ Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary _ but how it would react
to the pipeline that is designed to deprive Moscow of precious
income and prestige was an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly see this as threatening,'' said a senior
administration official. ``They see this as the next phase of
U.S.-Russian competition. They don't seem to understand that they
would be better off with a stable southern flank.''

   CHERKESSK, Russia _ Cherkessk may not be Chappaqua, but Boris
Berezovsky, like Hillary Rodham Clinton, has also had to go house
hunting far from home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Clinton, Russia's most versatile tycoon needs a new
political domicile for his latest act, a campaign for a seat in the
Russian Parliament. With elections just a month away, he catapulted
himself into Karachevo-Cherkessia last week, to the puzzlement of
the 300,000 people who make up the multiethnic electorate of this
tiny, neglected region in the unruly north Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, sometimes called a modern-day Rasputin because of
his behind-the-scenes role in the Kremlin's endless intrigues, has
ridden out the tumultuous changes in Russia by continually
reinventing and promoting himself _ as an automobile dealer, a
financier, a media magnate, a government trouble-shooter and,
always, a political insider. His latest incarnation may prove to be
his most difficult, as he runs as one of 12 candidates in a
district that has previously voted for the Communists, his
archrivals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Berezovsky started his first whirlwind tour of the
republic on Tuesday than a powerful gale blew in off the plains,
driving fresh snow toward the northern slopes of the Caucasus
Mountains. But the sudden bout of bad weather did little to deter
the hyper-energetic businessman, who landed near here in a charter
plane and sped about town in a rose-red Mercedes, accompanied by a
small but busy entourage of consultants and bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On his first day on the campaign trail, Berezovsky met with
about 60 potential supporters, most of them employees of a company
owned by Stanislav Derev, who is the mayor of Cherkessk and a
leader of the local Circassian population. The Circassians, who
make up about 10 percent of the population, have been waging a
vociferous campaign against their compatriots and rivals, the
Karachai, a major ethnic group with 30 percent of the population,
whom they accuse of usurping power.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions have been running high here since the summer,
giving rise to concerns that Karachevo-Cherkessia, one of the north
Caucasian regions confected by Lenin and half-emptied by Stalin,
was heading down the road to violent confrontation. With the
Russian army now ravaging nearby Chechnya, another tinderbox in the
Caucasus is the last thing the Kremlin needs.
</P>
<P>
   As he fielded questions, Berezovsky, looking every inch the
oligarch in a tailored blue suit, was in his element, offering
himself up as an expert in crisis management. Speaking like the
mathematician he was before he turned to business, he told the
audience how he likes to try to solve difficult problems. ``I do
this because I like to do it,'' he said with a broad smile. ``If I
didn't like it, I wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Gen. Vladimir Semyonov, the leader of this
region, holds the key to a Berezovsky victory on Dec. 19. ``Will he
get political support here?'' the general asked. ``That is the big
question. There is only one month left to promote a candidate who
has a negative image.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is not the only Russian businessman who has decided
to make a run for the Duma, as the Russian Parliament's lower house
is called. Roman Abramovich, an oil company executive who, like
Berezovsky, can boast of close ties to Tatyana Dyachenko, President
Boris Yeltsin's daughter, has gone even further afield: to Chukchi
on the Bering Strait, the impoverished home to one of Russia's
Arctic peoples, running in a district that has 58,977 voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian newspaper Izvestia, in a recent article examining
the sudden urge of politically connected businessmen to seek public
office, took a skeptical view of their motives. The headline on the
front-page article, ``In Law,'' was a thinly disguised allusion to
the term ``thieves in law,'' used to refer to Russia's criminal
godfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia contended that the oligarchs had chosen ``national
territorial regions'' _ as Russia's ethnically based regions are
called _ for two reasons. First, their electorates tend to be
small, and second, they tend not to share the ``allergy'' to
Russia's new breed of businessmen that has infected most of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But taking a broader view, the paper concluded that men like
Berezovsky and Abramovich, having made their wealth during Russia's
insider-driven privatization, are now looking for ways to
legitimize it, by influencing laws that will affect their business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, in an interview in Moscow, put it another way.
Having been pushed out of a series of government jobs over the last
few years, he said, he now wants to hold an official position,
independent of the Russian government, that will provide a platform
for his main political goal: keeping Russia's liberal economic
reforms on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to run because my unofficial status was preventing
me from pursuing this task,'' he said, speaking in an elaborately
redecorated 19th-century mansion that he has turned into a private
club, more than 900 miles from the poverty of Karachevo-Cherkessia.
``I can do serious things for reform, but my opponents have been
exploiting the fact that as of now, I have no official position.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with his usual rapid-fire delivery, Berezovsky _ who
has been the target of on-again, off-again criminal investigations
_ dismissed all talk that he might be seeking legal cover as one of
the Duma's 450 deputies who, under Russia law, are immune from
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things I would do as deputy would be to
propose a law lifting immunity for deputies,'' he said. ``The
original purpose of the law was to guarantee the deputies'
independence. But that is no longer valid. We now know that the
Duma can be bought; many deputies' votes are paid for. I doubt that
anyone can buy me for money. In that sense, I can be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the voters in Karachevo-Cherkessia, Berezovsky's notoriety
is less important than his wealth, which some here openly hope will
filter their way as he vies for their votes. Derev, a local vodka
and mineral water magnate who is helping the Moscow-born candidate
find a house in Cherkessk, says he has told Berezovsky as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will bring investments to the region,'' said Derev,
who is claiming neutrality in the parliamentary contest. ``I look
at it from a pragmatic view. My advice to him is to take a factory
and get it working again. People here want to see actions, not
words.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for Berezovsky's reputation as an ``odious figure,'' _ a
common term used for him in that part of the Russian news media
that he does not own or control himself _ Derev said that is not
such a big obstacle in a region where the average monthly wage, for
those who have jobs, is about $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, stopped on Cherkessk's wind-swept streets, were barely
aware of Berezovsky's presence in their midst. For many, the coming
electoral campaign is still just background noise, drowned out by
more urgent concerns over the simmering ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just one mafia fighting against another,'' said Maria
Andreyevna, an ethnic Russian pensioner who recently returned to
the region, where she had lived for 32 years. ``They are all trying
to get to power. It is very tense here. There are fights on the
buses.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the ethnic divisions are another unfortunate byproduct
of democracy. In Soviet times, there was a formula for ethnic peace
in this region. The local Communist Party boss was always a Russian
(Russians make up 40 percent of the region's population), while the
second in command was a Circassian. The Karachai, who were deported
en masse to Central Asia by Stalin during World War II, had no
place at the top of the power structure.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in the late 1980s, as political reform swept
the country. The Karachai asserted their dominance, and according
to observers here, that has irked the Circassians, whose extremist
leaders are now calling for secession.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, some here say, is that in
Karachevo-Cherkessia, as in Russia's other 86 regions, power on the
local level has been concentrated in the hands of the local
governors, whose appetite for autocratic rule has been fed by the
weakening of Moscow's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of our regions is that everything is decided by
one man,'' Derev said. ``The governors are little princes in their
own fiefdoms. They don't obey anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky openly admits what everyone here knows: his victory
will be assured if one or both of the region's leaders, Derev and
Semyonov, back his candidacy. At his first meeting with his
electorate, he spoke about how the two local leaders had called on
Yeltsin last summer to appoint Berezovsky as a mediator in the
north Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I count on support from local leaders,'' said
Berezovsky, who took part in meetings in Moscow that brought the
region's warring leaders to a temporary truce. ``It would be
strange if I didn't count on it.''

ANALYSIS: AT LEAST FOR NOW, MOST PAKISTANIS FAVOR GENERAL WHO TOOK
POWER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ This country's elite has been notorious
for corruption, with some elected officials the most voracious at
the trough. So it is tempting for people here to cheer on Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a coup five weeks ago. His new
government has ordered the arrest of dozens of prominent wealthy
people who supposedly finagled multimillion-dollar bank loans they
had no intention to repay.
</P>
<P>
   A war on the wicked rich is the central reform mandated by the
general, who has taken the title of chief executive. He says he is
ending ``sham'' governance and will ``pave the way for true
democracy'' in this country of 150 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Military despots have intermittently run impoverished Pakistan
for 25 of its 52 years, and each time that democracy was shoved
aside, a sincere-sounding general explained his assumption of power
in roughly the same way. Will this time be any different?
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early to tell, but most Pakistanis are eager to
give Musharraf the benefit of the doubt, agreeing with him that
their wobbly and troubled democracy needed to be demolished so it
could be rebuilt on a surer foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, merely hear an all-too-familiar melody sung by
yet another crooner with epaulets. ``Military rule always begins
with the same empty promises,'' said. I.A. Rehman, director of the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Field Marshal M. Ayub Khan announced that ``our
ultimate aim is to restore democracy but of the type that people
can understand.'' In 1969, Gen. A.M. Yahya Khan vowed ``that I have
no ambition other than the creation of conditions conducive to the
establishment of a constitutional government.'' In 1977, Gen.
Zia-ul-Haq said, ``The survival of this country lies in democracy
and democracy alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf may indeed be no better with his promises, but at
least for now, some very able people believe otherwise. They are
risking their reputations to join his new government.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the general has been making important hires,
naming a seven-member National Security Council, a cabinet and
provincial governors. The list has more than its fair share of
generals, active and retired, but the majority of the appointees
are civilians. While most come from the same well-connected
families that have always run the country, many are well regarded
as independent thinkers with a bent toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   Shaukat Aziz, a Pakistani living in New York, was a highly paid
vice president at Citibank. Soon after the coup, he was urged to
visit Islamabad by Musharraf, a man he had never met. The military
wanted advice about an economy that is $32 billion in debt and on
the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The general offered the banker the post of finance minister. ``I
was impressed by the chief executive and his team, their sense of
purpose and eagerness to set things right,'' said Aziz, a perfectly
coifed executive with just the right amount of gray around his
temples and a neatly folded handkerchief in the breast pocket of
his blue blazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan has this small window of opportunity here, this
chance to fix things with integrity and transparency,'' he said.
``The army wants to do away with the culture of corruption that
exists in Pakistan. And I'm totally convinced they mean business,
that they really care about improving the lot of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Asghar Khan, an environmentalist who has been working in
opposition to the illegal harvesting of timber, was offered a
cabinet post to oversee rural development and labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are talking about the devolution of powers,
trying to get average citizens into government,'' said Khan, the
Cambridge-educated son of an air marshal. ``They don't have a time
frame for a return to democracy, but I don't blame them for that.
The sheer survival of the state is at stake. Things shouldn't be
rushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Sattar, an amiable, if pedantic, retired diplomat, was at
a conference in Washington when the coup occurred Oct. 12. He too
had never met Musharraf, but the two hit it off after Sattar was
asked in for consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Both men share a burning distrust of India, Pakistan's neighbor
and fellow nuclear power. Indeed, Sattar, who has twice been
ambassador to New Delhi, said the 13 years he spent on
Indian-Pakistan relations was a ``desert that produced nothing
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He accepted the job of foreign minister. ``Democracy here was
just musical chairs, and what we need are fundamental reforms,''
Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, once a commando, insisted that his government was
``entirely civilian.'' However, he also said the army was needed to
monitor everything that goes on. ``Only the military, which is all
over Pakistan, can act as eyes and ears,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been relatively tepid in criticizing the
military takeover, but the Commonwealth _ a group of 54 nations,
many of them former British colonies _ has suspended Pakistan,
demanding ``restoration of civilian democratic rule without
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, such condemnations draw sneers in Pakistan's
capital, where people are wont to claim that the ousted prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, was nothing but a power-hungry conniver,
stuffing his already fat pockets while systematically enfeebling
the judiciary and the legislature through political foul play.
</P>
<P>
   In Musharraf's view, the army too had become a victim of this
institutional meddling, with the prime minister sowing dissension
in the ranks, especially after a humbling military setback in a
near all-out war with the Indians in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative chain of events is offered by the party hierarchy
of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League. In this account, senior
officers were plotting against the general, whispering warnings to
the prime minister about a Musharraf-led coup.
</P>
<P>
   This goes to the heart of the question of the hour in Islamabad.
On Oct. 12, Sharif fired Musharraf. Was the prime minister trying
to thwart a coming coup? Or was the coup, as the general enjoys
describing it, an utterly spontaneous and tellingly loyal response
by his officers to the news of his dismissal?
</P>
<P>
   The events of that evening are now part of Pakistani lore.
Musharraf, unaware that he had been fired, was seated aboard a
commercial jet, heading to Karachi from Sri Lanka. The air traffic
control tower, supposedly under orders from Sharif, denied the
plane permission to land. The runway had been blocked. Fuel was
running perilously low.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, only the quick reflexes of the general's
subordinates saved the day. The army took control of the tower. The
plane and all 198 on board, including 60 schoolchildren, were
saved. The coup began. Sharif was quickly placed in custody. He has
since been accused of treason, hijacking and conspiracy to commit
murder _ all capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings up the second question on people's minds,
endlessly debated over tea. Sharif will soon stand trial. Most
people assume a verdict of guilty.
</P>
<P>
   So will they or won't they? people wonder. Are they going to
hang him?

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ In a few days the World Trade Organization
will hold a summit in Seattle. Some 150,000 protesters are going to
take to the streets to denounce the WTO and globalization as
unalloyed evils.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters might want to talk to the workers of Sri Lanka
first, because what you find here, in this island state located off
the southern tip of India, is a rather nuanced view of
globalization _ an awareness that it is as much a vehicle for
developing countries to escape poverty as it is a vehicle for them
to be exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Sri Lanka's biggest concern about
globalization. At the Ministry of Industrial Development here is a
sign that says: ``The Year 2005 is only 60 months away. What are
you doing to get ready?'' The developed nations of the world are
terrified about a year 2000 bug that could make all their computers
stop. But for poor developing countries, it's 2005 that matters _
the year when their sewing machines could stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't know that a global Multi-Fiber Agreement
sets quotas on exactly how many clothes every developing country
can sell in U.S. and EU markets. The quotas are the lifeblood of
countries like Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka. By 2005 all the quotas will be phased out, which is going to
trigger a Darwinian free-for-all to sell clothes to the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lankan textile workers and manufacturers are now gearing up
for Y-2005. Their biggest concern? China. ``What we worry about
with China is the profit motive _ they have state-owned factories
that don't need to make a profit, but just keep people employed,''
said Mahesh Hirdaramani, a Sri Lankan textile maker. ``It means
they can sell at any price. And once there are no quotas anymore to
protect our market share, China could undersell us everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the China threat, Sri Lankan textile companies are
trying to move up the quality ladder. ``We can't be the low-end
producers anymore,'' says Mahesh Amalean, another manufacturer.
``Bangladesh and China will run circles around us. So we are
focusing on better quality, so retailers will want to stick with
us. And we are working to make ourselves more valuable to the
retailers by actually designing clothes ourselves. In the past, the
retailers designed the garment and we had to show them we could
make it. Now we have to design more things ourselves, get the
fabrics, and then show the retailers that they can get the whole
package from us. We have to become more than just tailors to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   I visited Amalean's factory, which makes underwear for
Victoria's Secret. Located in the small tropical village of
Pannala, the factory is completely computerized and will soon be
linked by Internet to the Victoria's Secret chain to handle
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 employees, mostly women 18 and older, work in this
modern, air-conditioned factory on pneumatic sewing machines. The
workday is eight hours and is intense. Each woman has to stitch so
many garments per minute. Wages are about $80 to $100 a month, the
average here, and there is a waiting list for jobs. In terms of
working conditions, this factory is world class, and it's not alone
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can survive against China and Bangladesh after
2005 is if we build long-term relationships with the big global
brand retailers,'' explains Amalean, ``and those brand retailers
are now demanding not only better prices and quality, but better
conditions for workers.'' And they are demanding that not because
they suddenly became socially conscious, but because American
consumers are demanding it, thanks to recent anti-sweatshop
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, working conditions have improved here not
because Sri Lanka has put up walls against globalization, but
because in today's global economy Sri Lanka must tie itself to
Western retailers to survive. And the more it does that, the more
its factory standards have to meet the values of Western consumers.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of sweatshops in this region, and the
Seattle protesters should go after them _ by targeting the specific
retailers who use them, but not by targeting globalization. That is
stupid, not only because globalization is inevitable, but also
because if managed properly, it can be an effective tool to lift
labor standards around the world. The Seattle protesters need to
understand that. The people of Sri Lanka already do.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Where do wax figures go when they die?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter of a century, the Country Music Wax
Museum was one of Nashville's most colorful tourist magnets. One in
every nine visitors to Nashville walked through its doors, gawking
at life-size replicas of Hank Williams, George Jones and Dolly
Parton.
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary wax museum. Performers like Minnie Pearl
and Johnny Cash donated clothes and instruments and even tended to
their characters. Once, after Jim Reeves had died and his ex-wife
dropped by to brush the hair on his exhibit, employees saw she had
put a picture of herself on the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Country Music Wax Museum quietly shut its doors two
years ago, a casualty of Nashville's self-conscious rush toward
modernization. In 1971, when the museum opened, Nashville was a
small city with a handful of studios; today the population of the
metropolitan area has boomed past 1 million, and there are 400
music studios. Professional hockey and football teams have moved
into town, and health care has replaced country music as the city's
No. 1 moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   The wax museum was once part of a thriving tourist mall, along
with the Hank Williams Jr. Museum, Barbara Mandrell Country and the
Car Collectors Hall of Fame. Now they, too, are closed, and there
are plans to supplant them with a traffic circle, offices and a
Ritz-Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened to the cherished wax figures of country music
greats with their vintage finery and original instruments?
</P>
<P>
   Not even officials of the Country Music Hall of Fame across the
street knew the answer. This reporter crisscrossed Nashville on the
trail of the missing wax figures, encountering tales of a vanished
promoter, a Kennedy campaign consultant and a Taiwanese herb
vendor. But nothing could prepare him for what he found.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three shopkeepers who remain in the area _ once
called the gateway to Music Row but now nicknamed ``death row'' _
knew the figures' whereabouts. Rumor had it that they had been sold
to the Music Valley Wax Museum, a newer attraction on the city's
outskirts, where the Opryland USA theme park, since demolished, had
lured the tourists who once kept the mall's shops in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did offer their collection to us,'' said Doris Harvey,
the assistant manager of the Music Valley Wax Museum. ``But they
didn't want to break the set, and we already had many of the same
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries at the Country Music Hall of Fame revealed little.
Administrators said they were never offered the figures. But one
employee brought out a charmingly crude wax museum coloring book
she had recently bought for 99 cents at the local grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brazzell, the proprietor, found the books in the back
of the store when she bought the place some two years ago. Phone
calls to former employees of the museum produced the vague
conjecture that the figures had been melted down.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 figures were missing. And it wasn't so surprising
in a city that likes to reinvent itself every few years,
complaining about the loss of tradition while paving over its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city decided that they want the convention business,''
said Jim Cook, the owner of Hat Country, a wax museum neighbor that
is going out of business. ``But they can't create that new image of
Nashville without killing the old one.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago the Country Music Wax Museum was tied to the most
powerful people in the city. Aurora Publishing, a failed book and
entertainment venture that had managed to pull most of Nashville
into its orbit, founded the museum. One of its first chiefs was
Paul Corbin, a political operative who worked on campaigns for John
F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. After their assassinations,
Corbin found respite from politics in wax figures, often borrowing
their boots to wear around town.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's most notorious operator was Dominic DeLorenzo,
an Aurora founder described by former employees as a good-looking,
slick-talking charmer who persuaded Nashville luminaries like Chet
Atkins, Minnie Pearl and the newspaper mogul John Seigenthaler to
invest in the publishing company and museum. It was while dining at
the Peking Restaurant, a country star hangout, that DeLorenzo
discovered the museum's future: Daniel Hsu, the son of a leading
herbal medicine authority from Taiwan, who had given up his
microbiology studies at Vanderbilt University to open the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu soon became majority shareholder in Aurora, and DeLorenzo
left Nashville for New York and disappeared, leaving behind a pile
of creditors, some of whom believe that he faked his death.
DeLorenzo's son, Dominick, who used to spend his summers working at
the museum, said his father died of cancer in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hsu, the wax museum thrived and the area around it
blossomed into a tourist mecca of offbeat novelty stores and
shrines to country stars. In a bold move in a world of Hank
Williams Jr. fans, Hsu opened a Chinese art museum above the wax
museum. And when Hsu learned that Seigenthaler's daughter-in-law
was an artist, he commissioned her to make new wax figures.
</P>
<P>
   The last one she made was of George Strait. A faded wood sign
above the old museum still advertises the addition to the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Opryland closing, tourism slumping, the Hall of Fame moving
downtown and tour buses rerouting to the more package-tour-friendly
Branson, Mo., the death knell for the neighborhood rang in 1997
when a city-sponsored study determined that a business district
would be more useful.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hsu had left to work for his family's herbal medicine
business in California, selling the buildings to a developer named
Jim Caden, who converted them into office space and a shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wanted us out of there,'' said Phyllis Shoemake, a
former wax museum employee who now distributes herbal medicines,
including Hsu's. ``They thought we were an eyesore. Now it's a
ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Caden's office buildings became home to a magazine called
Country Weekly. And it was there that the trail of the wax figures
got warm again. Visitors reported seeing the Hank Williams dummy in
the reception area, leaning against the wall in his original suit
designed by Nudie the Rodeo Tailor.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure enough, a reporter for Country Weekly, Bob Cannon,
knew exactly where the figures were: They had never left the
building and were locked up, deteriorating, in the basement. ``The
weird thing is, if you go down there at night, it's real spooky,''
he said. ``You have 40 wax figures looking at you. And they all
look like Buddy Ebsen, whether they're male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring phone calls for a week, Caden eventually agreed
to open the storage room, which was once home to the car
collectors' museum. ``But,'' he warned as he unlocked the door, ``I
don't want you to write anything making fun of the South, or some
of the positions these figures are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the pieces looked more as if they belonged to a country
music chamber of horrors than a wax museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Michael Horton, the building's maintenance man,
``was Ronnie Milsap's head.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to a wax face that had been smashed by vandals.
Barbara Mandrell's head, with a hairpiece she had designed, was
impaled on a stick, yards away from her torso. Johnny Cash, all in
black, stood against the wall, one arm hanging below his knee. Pop
Stoneman's autoharp rested on a bench, covered with detached
fingers. Uncle Dave Macon's gold teeth had been stolen. And Hank
Williams Jr. lay on his back with two disembodied hands across his
chest and a giant crack running along his neck
</P>
<P>
   Just who owns these figures _ 62 of them not counting various
busts and body parts _ is in some doubt. Caden said they either
belonged to him, to Hsu or to Aurora. ``But,'' he added, ``I don't
even know where Daniel Hsu is, to be quite honest.'' Hsu, who works
in the Irvine, Calif., office of Brion, his family's herb company,
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Nashville's delinquents didn't recognize the value
of what they were vandalizing, and left the costumes intact. When
Mark Medley, the archivist for the Country Music Hall of Fame,
walked into the storeroom to determine the collection's worth, his
jaw dropped. There were clothes from the entire Carter Family,
Jimmie Rodgers' singing brakeman outfit, a rare Gretsch guitar that
once belonged to Jim Reeves, handwritten lyrics from the Stoneman
Family and more than a dozen stage suits by Nudie, the
rhinestone-loving designer who created country high-fashion in the
late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collection of suits is really the most complete I've ever
seen,'' Medley said. ``Their historical and monetary worth is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange,'' he continued. ``These things belonged to
people who are so exalted, and now their costumes end up on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long they will stay on the floor is anybody's guess.
``I don't have a clue what I'm going to do with them,'' Caden said.
``I thought some bolt of lightning would strike us, and we would
figure it out. But we really have no plans.''

<P>
   And so the figures remain in limbo, a waxy analogy for country
music itself as they decay untended while Nashville races after its
cosmopolitan dream.

COMMENTARY: NUTS OR GUTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Are you the Manchurian candidate?'' I ask John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replies. ``I expect Angela Lansbury to come up to me
at any moment with the queen of diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   What will you do, I wonder, when you see the queen of diamonds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Strap a bomb on myself and run toward the White House?'' he
offers, with a rueful laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In the brilliant 1962 movie ``The Manchurian Candidate,''
Laurence Harvey plays a soldier in the Korean War who is captured
and brainwashed by Communists and then sent back to America to kill
on demand, so that they can take charge of the White House when his
operator (his mother, chillingly played by Ms. Lansbury) shows him
the queen of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The question now bubbling sulfurously here is whether the
Manchester candidate is really the Manchurian candidate. Did the
good senator, who spent five and a half years being tortured in a
Hanoi prison camp, come home with snakes in his head?
</P>
<P>
   With McCain zooming in New Hampshire polls come whispered
insinuations from Republicans, including some George W. Bush
supporters, that his years in Viet Cong dungeons, which included
two suicide attempts, drove him cuckoo. There have also been rumors
that GOP rivals are trying to dig up his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that some of my Senate
colleagues want to drive a stake through John McCain's heart,''
says Sen. Chuck Hagel, who is national co-chairman of the McCain
campaign and won two Purple Hearts in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an orchestrated effort, very subtle, very clever,'' he
adds. ``It goes from temper to temperament to instability. They
say: `You can't blame John for acting half-nuts sometimes. He's a
hero. Anyone who went through that experience would be half-nuts.'
They throw around platitudes, but the underlying message is: John's
nuts and shouldn't be around any kind of buttons that could lead to
nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting, despicable rumor-mongering about a guy who
has given so damn much to his country by a lot of guys who have
never given anything and never worn uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Vietnam vets, including Democrats like John Kerry, are
boiling. Privately, some offer riffs like this: ``While McCain was
getting tortured, Bush was flying jets defending Texas against
Oklahoma, Trent Lott was doing jumping jacks for Old Miss, and John
Engler was eating Dunkin' Donuts to make sure he was too overweight
to be drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unbelievable that as 2000 arrives we're again obsessing
about Vietnam. The presence of an inspiring war hero in the
presidential race has given other candidates, including those with
a cosseted berth in the war, the willies about how they stack up
against him. But now someone's being questioned for serving, not
dodging.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at an airport in South Carolina, McCain was clearly hurt
that people who had watched his 17-year career in the House and
Senate were suddenly calling him wiggy. But he knows that the
prospect that he would be president _ with a promise to upend the
table of special-interest goodies _ drives Washington wiggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having trouble hearing you, Maureen,'' he says
mischievously. ``Those voices in my head. STOP THOSE VOICES!''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's had an ``outsized temper'' since he was 2 _ his
parents would dunk him in a cold tub to try to calm him _ but calls
any linkage to Vietnam ``ludicrous'' and thinks the whispering
campaign is payback for his maverick stances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious many of my colleagues resent these reform
things,'' he says, ``when I beat up on pork-barrel spending, the
lobbying reform, the gift ban, campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came home, I was debriefed in the Philippines, like
every POW,'' he continues. ``I've never undergone counseling of any
kind, although I have no doubt I should have done so. My children
allege I need it. Soon I'm going to make all 350 pages of my
medical records public. When you spend years in solitary, you get
to know yourself very well.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do you learn? ``Narcissism,'' he says drily. ``I do
have a confidence in myself. You talk about trying to become an
alpha male, I never heard of such a thing. I know my strengths and
failings. I'm very well prepared for whatever difficulties the rest
of my life brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``And being crazy,'' he concluded, ``ain't one of them.''

   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia _ It has become a hauntingly familiar
drama in Indonesia: families huddling on a windswept pier or in a
crowded bus station, fleeing a home that has become too dangerous
as old grievances give rise to explosive separatist passions.
</P>
<P>
   The last time it was East Timor, which voted for independence
from Indonesia in August only to be plunged into bloodshed that
required an Australian-led international military force to quell.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Aceh (pronounced ah-CHAY), a lush, devoutly Islamic
province that lies on the extreme western edge of the Indonesian
archipelago and would like nothing more than to break away from the
central government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes stoked by the secession of East Timor and by remarks
by Indonesia's new president that Aceh too should be given the
chance to decide its future, a half-million people rallied recently
in front of the luminous white mosque in this provincial capital to
demand a referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesia, Aceh is the fire next time _ a crisis that, even
more than East Timor, could determine whether the central
government can hold this staggeringly diverse and far-flung nation
together. Unlike East Timor's, Aceh's status as an Indonesian
possession has never been challenged by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could lead to the disintegration of Indonesia,'' said
Eugene K. Galbraith, an expert on Indonesia and the former head of
Asian research at ABN Amro Bank. ``There are several other restive
provinces, from Sulawesi to Irian Jaya, which would take their cue
from Aceh.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior military leaders last week began calling for martial law
to be declared in parts of Aceh, where they claim that rising
separatist activity is leading to violence and civil unrest.
Thousands of non-Acehnese are fleeing the province, fearful that
they could become targets of groups that want to purge the place of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   They huddled under a merciless morning sun here, their
belongings packed into boxes that form lonely encampments across a
sprawling pier. The families grabbed food, clothing and television
sets. A faded teddy bear was lashed to one of the boxes with an
electrical cord. The ferry did not leave for five hours, but these
people were desperate to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to escape what's going to happen here,'' said Yetti
Samsul, 45, who has lived in the province for nine years but is
fleeing to the Sumatran city of Medan. ``No one can guarantee our
safety. There is a feeling of fear in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samsul, who is from neighboring North Sumatra, said she was
afraid of being singled out, even though her in-laws are from Aceh.
``If the people don't get what they want, things will get much
worse here,'' she said. ``They will take it out on people from
other parts of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aceh is only one of several centrifugal forces tugging at
Indonesia, experts believe its secession would be particularly
corrosive to its national unity.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to East Timor, which was a Portuguese colony that
Jakarta invaded and subjugated in 1975, Aceh played a vigorous role
in the establishment of the Indonesian republic in 1945. Its
soldiers are renowned for their bravery in the struggle against the
Dutch colonists.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim sultanate since the 16th century, Aceh has a long
history of rebellion. The Acehnese consider themselves culturally
and to some extent ethnically different from other Indonesians. In
the years after World War II they began to resist control from
Jakarta and in 1961 Aceh was designated a special territory with
autonomy in religion, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh's loyalty was frayed during decades of shabby treatment by
the government. The province has some of Indonesia's richest
natural resources, including vast oil and natural-gas fields, which
people here say Jakarta has plundered. The Indonesian military
moved into Aceh in 1989 to quell the growing unrest over economic
issues. Human rights groups say the troops have committed a catalog
of abuses, ranging from intimidation and abductions to rapes and
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aceh has been left behind economically and abused
politically,'' said Yacob Hamzah, the director of the Legal Aid
Society in Lhokseumawe, an industrial city south of here that is a
hotbed of separatist activity. ``Why would we want to be part of a
country that treats us like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Aceh's latest push for independence began with the fall of
President Suharto in May 1998 and accelerated after the referendum
in East Timor. But it really caught fire following recent remarks
by Indonesia's new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Shortly after he
was elected last month, Wahid declared unexpectedly that he
supported a referendum on independence for Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has reaffirmed that view several times since, though he
now adds that it is his own opinion rather than government policy.
Still, for the people of Aceh, it has become a rallying cry. The
word referendum is spray-painted on roads and houses throughout the
territory. It hangs from banners and flags, and comes up in every
conversation with an Acehnese, whether a guerrilla or a government
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur raised very large hopes for the Acehnese people,''
said Nasir Zalba, the head of public affairs for the provincial
government, using Wahid's commonly used nickname. ``If he were to
go back on his word, there would be an even greater demand for
independence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here said it was hard to guess the
president's real intentions. Soon after he made his remarks about a
referendum, Wahid left for a trip to the United States and Japan,
where he received statements of support for a unified Indonesia
from President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that Wahid is trying to keep both sides
off balance: the military, which fiercely opposes a referendum that
would lead to independence, and the pro-independence forces in
Aceh, which include students, human rights groups, Muslim leaders,
and the Free Aceh Movement, an armed rebel group that has been
skirmishing with the army in the jungles of Aceh since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Free Aceh Movement acknowledge that some of
their members have driven non-Acehnese people out of the province.
But they reject a comparison to the pro-Jakarta militias in East
Timor _ roving bands of armed men who attacked and killed hundreds
of pro-independence voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying very hard not to let this escalate,'' said
Nasrullah Dahlawy, a spokesman for the rebel group. ``Of course, we
cannot control all our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of outsiders illustrates one of the nettlesome
challenges facing the pro-independence forces in Aceh. While they
are united in the goal of freeing themselves from Jakarta, they
disagree stridently on how to do it. Muhammad Nazar, the head of a
coalition of 50 pro-independence student groups, said he opposed
the Free Aceh Movement's use of violence to achieve independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our struggle is based on democracy, mediation, peace, and
justice,'' said Nazar, an intense 26-year-old who majored in Arabic
literature at the local university.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Aceh Movement has deep roots in the villages, where its
fighters move from house to house to evade Indonesian soldiers.
Abdullah Syafie, the commander of the rebel forces, leaves little
doubt that he is ready to use force to win Aceh's freedom. Syafie,
who wears a crisply pressed camouflage uniform and whips out his
own tape recorder for interviews, said his troops were ready for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can solve this peacefully through diplomacy,'' said
Syafie, as he sat cross-legged beneath a Free Aceh flag in a
hideout 10 miles off the main road. ``But if we can't, we might
have to wage a military campaign. We hope it doesn't come to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what sort of diplomatic proposals the guerrillas
or the students are offering. Both want a referendum, which must
include the option of independence, and both want it soon. Some
analysts here say the pro-independence forces need a more nuanced
strategy if they hope to make headway with Wahid, whose erratic
pronouncements mask a shrewd political tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers said local Islamic leaders could act as a bridge
to Wahid, who came to prominence as a Muslim leader and is the head
of Indonesia's largest Muslim group. The role of Islam is a wild
card in Aceh's future. Jakarta recently allowed the province to
adopt elements of Islamic law, and there is spirited debate here
about whether an independent Aceh should be an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few people here have much of an idea of what an
Acehnese state would look like. In part, this is because the
independence movement is still young. But it is also because Aceh
lacks home-grown leaders of the stature of Jose Ramos-Horta or
Xanana Gusmao in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, some people here believe Indonesia can
mollify Aceh without granting it independence. They say Jakarta
must start by shipping back more of the money made here. In 1999,
Aceh will generate more than $1 billion in revenue from exports of
oil and gas. Yet the central government will return less than 10
percent of that in the form of funding for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy of the government is not to give a penny, because
if you give a penny, people will ask for more,'' said Zainul
Arifin, the vice chairman of Aceh's Investment Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, people here say Jakarta must make amends
for the conduct of the military by prosecuting soldiers accused of
atrocities. Human rights groups estimate that the army is
responsible for the killings of 1,321 people from 1989 to 1998, the
period of greatest military presence here. Wahid has ordered the
army to cut the number of troops in Aceh to 5,000 from 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the army's leaders acknowledge that it remains feared and
distrusted. ``To get the people's trust back is going to be very
hard, and it is going to be even harder now that the military is in
a defensive position,'' said Lt. Col. Iro Suparmo, the deputy
commander of military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the hurdles to independence for Aceh, none is more
daunting than the military. The army is deeply invested here, and
analysts said it was inconceivable that it would tolerate a repeat
of East Timor. The government overrode the army's objections in
allowing a referendum there. And when the East Timorese voted to
separate, the military helped orchestrate the campaign of violence
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Army leaders are quick to note that Aceh is not another Timor _
not least because the international community recognizes it as a
province of Indonesia. But they warn darkly that Aceh will become a
dangerous place if the army is forced to retreat. As for
independence, Suparmo said, ``Aceh is like Indonesia's oldest son.
It is very hard to let your oldest son go.''

   WASHINGTON _ As he was preparing a major poverty proposal
earlier this fall, former Sen. Bill Bradley huddled with a small
group of top advisers to hash out final details. Several aides
expressed concerns about one idea they thought might be
overreaching and risky: a sweeping pledge to cut child poverty by
half over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley listened quietly as suggestions to scale back his plan
ricocheted around the room of his suburban New Jersey headquarters.
But when the discussion ended, he spoke up: He would stick with his
original idea. Debate over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he makes a decision, there is very little revisiting of
it,'' an adviser to Bradley said. ``That is that, and you move onto
the next thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bradley's supporters, that story underscores what they
consider to be a major reason he has pulled close to Vice President
Al Gore in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In
his unassuming way, Bradley is controlling the levers of his
insurgent campaign. Gore is not, they assert. And the result, they
say, is that Bradley looks like the stronger leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a guy who changes,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's
campaign spokesman. ``He's very secure in who he is and what he
wants to do and how he would do it. Those things don't change. They
are not created for the political moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another way, the story also highlights one of the
problems many political analysts, and even some friends, see in
Bradley: He is hard to manage. Strong-willed and prickly, he is
known to follow his instincts more than his staff, to resist the
very advice he pays his advisers to give.
</P>
<P>
   Some political consultants have said they turned down offers to
work for him, because they thought he would not listen to them. And
even his current crop of advisers occasionally expresses
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude is `I'm going to do it my way, and if it doesn't
work, I'll get on with my life,''' a former Senate aide to Bradley
said. ``That could cut both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little evidence that Bradley's style is causing
him problems. He has pulled even with Gore in New York and New
Hampshire, polls show. His small, tight-knit circle of top advisers
has avoided the leaks, backbiting and controversy that have
occasionally convulsed the Gore campaign. And he looks so relaxed
on the stump that he actually seems to enjoy himself.
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts say that as his campaign expands to
more states and starts hitting unexpected potholes, Bradley may
need to start listening to fresh advice from professionals who have
endured the heat of presidential races before.
</P>
<P>
   ``For good or ill, the kind of political handlers the public
doesn't like are often critical to a campaign,'' said Nelson
Warfield, a Republican political consultant. ``The risk I see for
Bradley is there is a natural tendency for new presidential
candidates to underestimate the complexity of their task.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts argue that a good example of the danger
of not taking political advice may be Bradley himself. In 1990,
when he was seeking his third term as senator from New Jersey,
Bradley was challenged by an unknown Republican, Christie Whitman.
Relentlessly, Whitman tried to link Bradley to an unpopular tax
increase enacted that year by his loyal ally, Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers at the time suggested that he distance
himself from Florio. But Bradley was unwilling to criticize his
friend, though he disagreed with the tax increase. The more he
dodged the issue, the more Whitman attacked. And Bradley, once
considered invulnerable in New Jersey, won by just 55,000 votes,
despite outspending his opponent by 12 to 1. The election left him
feeling hurt, angry with his aides and uncertain about his
political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us pounded on him to do something,'' said one former
adviser to Bradley. ``He understood what was happening. But he
said, `I'm not going to attack this guy and make this an issue.'
Ultimately that hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his current advisers take away a different lesson
from the 1990 campaign. They assert that he spent too much money on
polling and consultants, and listened too closely to the advice of
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very good instincts,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's
communications director. ``One of the main lessons he learned from
1990 was listening to his gut and not listening to the polls.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign advisers say his resistance to handling is a
strength of his campaign. By eschewing polling and media packaging,
they assert, he has been more spontaneous, more willing to take
risks, more comfortable with himself than ever before. And voters,
they believe, like what they are seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when 20 people tell him something is unrealistic, he will
say, `I hear what you're saying, but I want to do it this way,'''
said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who is advising Bradley.
``That's a very good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not completely shunned political handling. His
campaign has used focus groups to test his television commercials.
He has been consulting with Madison Avenue advertising executives
for 18 months about shaping his image and message. And his aides
use polls to help determine which states and voting groups to focus
on.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that Bradley has written the script
for most of his campaign to date. He determined the handful of
issues the campaign would spotlight, including campaign finance,
gun control and health care. And the big fund-raiser with his
former basketball teammates and foes _ he was once a New York Knick
_ at Madison Square Garden was his idea, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Bradley's decision to endorse several contentious
proposals, including replacing Medicaid and expanding the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 to cover gay men and lesbians, over the concerns
of aides.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides assert that Bradley is not a micromanager in the
mold of Michael Dukakis, who interviewed low-level job applicants
in the heat of his 1988 presidential campaign. They say he has
great confidence in his top aides to run the campaign's day-to-day
operations, freeing him to write speeches, develop policies, raise
money and meet with significant supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things he delegates entirely,'' said Douglas Berman,
the campaign chairman. ``He always sets broad direction, the values
about how the organization should be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman is typical of the faithful core of people in Bradley's
inner circle. Berman worked on Bradley's first campaign, in 1978,
and then managed his landslide re-election campaign in 1984. Gina
Glantz, the campaign manager, has been a friend and informal
adviser to Bradley since he joined the Senate. Ms. Dunn, Hauser and
Marcia Aronoff, the senior adviser for issues, were on his Senate
staff.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Wright, the finance director, was a friend of
Bradley when they played on the Princeton basketball team 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts point out that former Presidents Jimmy Carter
and Ronald Reagan also relied on small circles of loyalists to
direct their winning campaigns. But Bradley may need more than that
to overcome the vice president's many organizational advantages,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, their strategy of a relatively small, close-knit
team seems to have worked a whole lot better than the Gore
system,'' said Susan Estrich, who ran the Dukakis campaign in 1988.
``But it is absolutely clear that down the road, if this thing
grows, they are going to have to grow. There is an advantage to
being in New Jersey at first, but there comes a time when you have
to play Broadway.''

CLINTON URGES GREEKS TO TRY TO HEAL SPLIT WITH TURKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Attempting to alleviate the traditional enmity
between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, President Clinton brought
the same message of reconciliation to Athens on Saturday that he
had delivered in Ankara days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two countries need to go hand in hand into the future,''
Clinton said after a private meeting with Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis. ``And the festering disputes have to be resolved in
order for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Already engaged in high-profile peace efforts in Northern
Ireland and the Middle East, Clinton is using his current trip
through southeastern Europe to bring attention to the deep hatreds
and rivalries of the Balkans, which acquired great importance for
his administration last spring when NATO went to war against
Yugoslavia over its treatment of the Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton left Athens with no concrete agreements, he
urged Greek and Turkish leaders to resolve their territorial
disputes, especially in the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus,
which has been riven since Turkish troops landed on its northern
half in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders will hold talks at the United
Nations in New York during December, and Clinton said he hoped this
could ``lay the foundation for meaningful negotiations toward a
comprehensive settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first U.S. president to try to solve the
intractable Cyprus problem, nor to attempt to boost Greek-Turkish
relations _ which improved independently last summer when peoples
of both countries rushed to help each other cope with the damage
left by devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush shuttled between Turkey and Greece in 1991
in an ultimately failed effort to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
   The visits of both Bush and Clinton ignited angry protests in
the center of Athens. Saturday morning, after touring the Acropolis
with his daughter, Chelsea, Clinton said he regretted ``the Greeks
who had their property injured and who suffered losses'' because of
demonstrations in the city center Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He then addressed some of the points of U.S. policy that have
riled Greek leftists, standing firmly by NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia, which was highly unpopular in Greece, but suggesting
that the United States had been unwise in backing the military
junta that was overthrown in Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner Friday night, Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos offered Clinton a hard-edged history lesson from a
Greek perspective. ``We face no problems other than those created
by the aggressive policies of Turkey,'' Stephanopoulos said,
asserting that the division of Cyprus ``was created by Turkey's
military invasion.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos said that 180,000 Greek Cypriots ``are still
refugees, deprived of the right to live where they were born and
denied access to their property and wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simitis sounded a more conciliatory tone when meeting
reporters after his talks with Clinton. Both Greece and Turkey must
be willing to compromise, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot just expect for something to happen without doing or
contributing anything for our part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped that his visit had helped to improve the
climate for December's talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In bilateral matters, Greek officials said they still needed
more time before signing a cooperation pact with the United States
on fighting terrorism, while U.S. officials talked of expanding
trade and study programs in the United States for Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to empathize, Clinton noted the heavy presence of Greek
Americans on his staff, including White House chief of staff John
Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   And he told business leaders that his favorite restaurant in
Little Rock was a Greek cafe.

   UPS AND DOWNS OF PRESIDENTIAL POLLS
</P>
<P>
   A lot that happens in presidential campaigns is not predictable,
of course. But then again, a lot is.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a pretty good bet that sooner or later in Campaign
2000, the polls would start jumping around and seesawing.
</P>
<P>
   It has started. In a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Bill Bradley grabbed headlines by suddenly
jumping ahead of Vice President Al Gore in the Democratic contest
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sen. John McCain of Arizona suddenly leapt
forward and caught up with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the
Republican contest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, again in New Hampshire, McCain grabbed more
headlines by coming out on top in a theoretical Election Day
matchup with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore retook the lead from Bradley in New
Hampshire, thereby reversing a slide in the Granite State that had
lasted through much of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing of all, in another poll released last
week, this one involving the Republican contest in Iowa, McCain
suddenly came from way back and almost took second place from Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean?
</P>
<P>
   That there will be still more jumping and seesawing. Bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   But for the short term, political pros say that while the polls
show a definite narrowing in the contest in places, even switches
in leads, it is too early to draw any real conclusions,
particularly because at times different polls have had different
candidates ahead at the same time. Further, the pros note that in a
number of cases the candidates at the top are separated by only a
percentage point or two, a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it appears that just as Bradley was able to close in
on Gore in New Hampshire by working the state hard, Gore has been
able to slow his slide there by picking up the pace of his
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, McCain's gains in New Hampshire appear to be the
result of a lot of hard work on the ground, leading Bush to serve
notice last week that now he, too, intends to pick up the pace in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iowa, the conventional political wisdom seems to be that
some of the attention McCain has been getting in places like New
Hampshire is beginning to spill over into the Hawkeye State.
</P>
<P>
   THE PERSISTENT YAWNS OF PRESIDENTIAL VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe all the jumping and seesawing in the
candidate polls mean little or nothing. At least that is
essentially the view of the 1,007 voters contacted last weekend by
Harvard's Vanishing Voter Project.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of them told the project's poll takers that they
were paying little or no attention to the presidential race, mostly
because they were too busy or because it was too early in the
campaign or because they were just apathetic or plain alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Two of every three said that they found the campaign boring,
that they had not picked a candidate to support and that in any
event what they thought or did would have only ``some to little''
influence on government.
</P>
<P>
   Three of every four said that on the day the poll takers called,
they had not read, seen or heard a news story about the campaign.
Nor, they added, had they discussed the campaign with anyone or,
for that matter, given it any thought.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know where Bush stood on gun registration, where McCain
stood on campaign contributions, where Bradley stood on
government-paid health insurance for the poor and where Gore stood
on allowing parents to use tax dollars to send their children to
private or parochial schools (favorite issues for each candidate)?
</P>
<P>
   Four out of five said they had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   THE WHATS AND IFS OF THE ELECTORAL VOTES
</P>
<P>
   So if the polls are bouncing around, most voters aren't paying
any attention and Election Day is still 50-odd weeks off, what's
the score at this point, the real score, as in Electoral College
votes, the only votes that count when all is said and done?
</P>
<P>
   It takes 270 to win. So on Friday, The Hotline, a popular
political tip sheet, took a look at how the current leaders in
national polls, Bush and Gore, are doing in the 35 states in which
polls matching them up have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 of those states, the race was too close to call. Bush held
a slight edge in six of the 11, but when the margin of possible
error in the polling was factored in, all 11 ended up as a
statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining 24 states, Bush was cleanly ahead. If he stays
ahead _ a big if _ they will be worth 263 electoral votes on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TURNING MARRIAGE INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mark Anderson of Arizona, a conservative Republican,
hears a different legislative drum.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he was elected to the Arizona House in 1994 from
Mesa, a city just east of Phoenix, he has made marriage issues a
big priority, his pitch being that a state whose couples are
happily married is a happy state and, more important, a strong
state. His proposals have not enjoyed a lot of success _ Arizona
still has its share of divorces and broken homes _ but he keeps
pushing.
</P>
<P>
   First, he tried to get the state Legislature to finance a $2
million program to teach single women on welfare the advantages of
getting a husband. His bill would have enabled women ``interested
in pursuing a career track in home management'' to learn ``positive
thinking and attitude adjustment techniques'' and would have helped
them understand the ``economic and personal benefits of marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, when a constituent, a divorced single parent, asked him to
push the Legislature to provide child care for single parents who
are in college, he suggested that her best course of action would
be to ``revisit the issue of your marriage failure, perhaps take
some classes in parenting'' and then find a new husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the state to put up $17 million to finance an array of
public school and adult education classes that promote the idea of
getting married and staying married. Some of the money would be
used to develop a ``healthy marriage'' handbook and courses in
marriage and communication skills, some would be used to underwrite
attendance at such courses by poor people and to provide tax breaks
for employers who offer marriage courses, and some would be used to
underwrite a ``marriage is a healthy lifestyle'' advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's goal: to reduce Arizona's divorce rate, now ranked
10th-worst in the nation, by 5 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   State educators do not like the proposal. They say they already
have trouble enough finding money and time to teach the three R's,
let alone taking on a how-to marriage course.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson, who has never been divorced, refuses to back off.
He argues that relationship skills that work in a marriage will
also work in just about any other setting, including the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have people graduating from school that can
communicate and be a good marriage partner and be a good parent
than somebody who can add,'' he declared last week.
</P>
<P>
   VOTERS DRAW BLANKS ON A BUSH POP QUIZ
</P>
<P>
   An update ...
</P>
<P>
   Fabrizio, McLaughlin &AMP; Associates is a Virginia-based political
consulting and polling company that mostly works with Republicans.
So its advice and its findings tend to reflect that party's point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems worth passing along what Fabrizio, McLaughlin
found the other day when it sprang the George W. Bush
name-the-leaders pop quiz on a thousand registered voters around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, it may be recalled, was caught off guard a few weeks back
when a reporter suddenly asked him if he could name the leaders of
Taiwan, Chechnya, Pakistan and India, four regions that were
prominent in the news. He got one of the four.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened when Fabrizio, McLaughlin popped the same quiz
on unsuspecting voters?
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 couldn't name a single leader.
</P>
<P>
   But six of 10 said such quickie quizzes, when popped on
candidates, were nothing but ``gotcha'' journalism intended to
embarrass.

ACCOUNTANT FOR MCLARTY ACTS TO SETTLE INSIDER CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Arkansas business associate of Thomas McLarty
III, the former White House chief of staff, has agreed to pay more
than $144,000 to settle charges of insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court here,
the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stephen B.
Humphries, a business associate and longtime accountant to McLarty,
of violating a federal insider trading law when he bought and then
sold stock options in Mobil Corp. The options were bought after
Humphries learned that McLarty had been retained as a consultant
for a possible deal between Exxon and Mobil. The options were sold
shortly after the deal became public.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not accuse McLarty of wrongdoing, and it did
not identify him in its court papers because officials said they
had found no evidence that he had done anything improper. Rather,
the agency's complaint said that Humphries had learned of the
Exxon-Mobil talks ``as part of his ongoing fiduciary relationship
or similar relationship of trust and confidence'' with McLarty.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McLarty said that McLarty had had no knowledge
of the trading undertaken by Humphries until he was contacted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries is president of McLarty-Asbury Automotive, a joint
venture formed last year between McLarty's family auto business and
a Philadelphia company. Humphries also worked for the last 15 years
as McLarty's personal accountant and financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9 of last year, 18 days before Exxon and Mobil announced
their proposed merger, McLarty told Humphries that he had been
retained by Mobil for a possible deal, according to McLarty and
commission officials. McLarty was retained to brief senior
executives of the companies about the issues involved in the
merger. At the time, McLarty was also involved in selling a major
part of his interest in the automotive business, which Humphries
was also working on. McLarty stepped down as the White House chief
of staff in President Clinton's first term but continued as a
senior adviser until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days before the Exxon-Mobil deal was announced, Humphries
and an unidentified friend bought 100 Mobil call options, which
give purchasers the right to buy stock at an agreed-upon price
within a certain time. A few days after the deal was announced,
Humphries and the unidentified friend sold the options for a profit
of $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the commission said that the friend of Humphries
was not identified in the court papers because there was no
evidence that the friend had any knowledge of the conversation
between Humphries and McLarty.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Humphries agreed to turn over the
$70,000 in illegal profits to the government and pay an additional
$74,596 in interest and penalties.

   HOLLYWOOD _ Just as the public has grown increasingly complacent
about the Year 2000 computer problem, along comes ``Y2K,'' the
movie. The made-for-television thriller, which will be shown on NBC
on Sunday night, features just about every scary scenario
envisioned by the Year 2000 doomsayers: blackouts, cash and food
shortages, plane crashes and nuclear meltdowns, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   At least some people think NBC is being irresponsible. The
Edison Electric Institute, a trade group representing electric
utilities, wrote to 100 NBC affiliates asking them not to show the
movie, or to follow it with news reports stating how ready the
nation really is for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that the NBC film, coming just before the
conversion, will fan flames of panic and unnecessary alarm,'' the
institute said. ``We understand the need for creative, exciting
programming. But we also believe in the importance of social
responsibility at critical moments like the one we're about to
enter.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hollywood and the television networks are not above
preying on public fears to make a buck, especially during the
November sweeps, when television ratings are used to set
advertising rates for local television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Year 2000, what is remarkable is how little
the entertainment industry has exploited what would seem to be the
ultimate race-against-time plot line.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood made two feature-length films about asteroids or
comets that threaten to annihilate the Earth, a far more remote
possibility than blackouts caused by computers' interpreting the
date 00 to mean 1900 instead of 2000. But while there are some
general apocalypse-type films appearing as the new millennium nears
_ like ``The Omega Code,'' ``Last Night'' and ``End of Days'' _
there has been no feature film on the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   There have been suspicions that Hollywood has deliberately
avoided such movies under pressure from Washington not to scare the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wonder whether people in the media weren't warned
off by public officials,'' said Stephen D. O'Leary, a professor at
the University of Southern California who monitors treatment of the
Year 2000 problem by the media. But he said he had no proof of this
and believes movie executives held back because they thought there
would be too many other Year 2000 movies. Officials in Washington
and Hollywood deny that there was any pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood executives say the extensive coverage of the Year 2000
problem in the news media is a deterrent to making a movie. ``It
kind of feels tired already,'' said Tom Rothman, president of 20th
Century Fox Film Group. In the company's film ``Entrapment,''
released earlier this year, a major heist takes place at the
century changeover, but this was only a small part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a meteor collision will always be a possibility,
however remote. But the date transition will be over early next
year. Especially if the date transition turns out to be a nonevent,
a Year 2000 movie would have little residual value for cable
channels, television networks and video stores, important sources
of studio revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to spend a lot of money on what on Jan. 2
is going to be a dated movie?'' asked a senior executive at one
studio.
</P>
<P>
   The short shelf life is less of a problem for lower-budget
television movies like ``Y2K.'' It stars Ken Olin as a government
computer whiz monitoring the disasters as the new year begins in
different time zones. One of his tasks is to avert a nuclear power
plant meltdown that threatens Seattle, where his own family lives.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, including the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Governors' Association, contacted NBC out of at least
mild concern about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials released a burst of
information on Thursday to show that the nation is apparently
prepared and calm. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. released poll results indicating that the
percentage of people planning to take extra money out of the bank
before the new year had fallen to 39 percent from 62 percent in
March. Dan Glickman, the agriculture secretary, held a news
conference in a supermarket to say the food supply would not be
interrupted by the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Weinman, executive vice president for broadcast content
policy at NBC, dismissed the concerns. ``We're not in any way
claiming there's a level of verisimilitude here,'' she said. ``This
program is a purely fictional thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the controversy helps draw viewers. And the movie would
have no tension if it were not based on events that Year 2000
experts have at least worried about.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us said any of this is definitely going to happen, but
no one's saying it's not going to happen either,'' said David
Israel, the executive producer, whose mantra during the filming, he
said, was ``paranoia is our most important product.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC will show a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie stating
that it is fiction and is not intended to imply that the depicted
events will occur. Some affiliates are going further. WPXI in
Pittsburgh said it would scroll disclaimers across the bottom of
the screen. And directly after the movie, it will broadcast a ``Y2K
reality check'' news report.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To the extent Hollywood has touched on Year 2000, it has been
more light than fright. Blackouts and food hoarding have provided
humorous grist for episodes of ``The Simpsons'' and ``Sports
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem ``potentially has huge dramatic and
comedic possibilities,'' said Tony Krantz, co-chairman and chief
executive of television operations at Imagine Entertainment, which
makes ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The best place to find Year 2000 spoofs is in commercials. Nike
has one in which a man goes for his run on Jan. 1 oblivious of the
tanks rolling by in the street, the missiles flying and a giraffe
that has escaped from the zoo. The McDonald's ``FrY2k'' spot
features a man stockpiling shelves of French fries.
</P>
<P>
   When Kia Motors ran a commercial in May showing people lining up
outside a bank (under the slogan that Y2K means ``Yes to Kia''),
the American Bankers Association complained that it would undermine
confidence in the banking system. Polaroid dropped a commercial
showing an automated teller machine malfunctioning, but Kia said
the bankers should learn how to take a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, even the bankers have lightened up. The
association did not complain about the NBC movie, merely offering
experts for any news stories or promotions that accompany it, said
John Hall, a spokesman for the bankers association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the public's a lot more educated now about Y2K than
they were then,'' Hall said. ``We're confident they'll be able to
tell the difference between fact and fiction.''

GLOBAL ECONOMIC TRENDS TEST VALUES OF EUROPE'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EUROPE-U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW.) 
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ Having spoken out vigorously this summer in
favor of the free market, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
arrived at a conference here Saturday on the future of Social
Democracy saying a leading German company should be protected
against a hostile takeover bid from a British firm.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent contradiction between the chancellor's avowed
embrace of a freewheeling entrepreneurial culture and his patriotic
defense of the mobile phone group Mannesmann suggested yet another
zigzag in his attempt to reform his Social Democratic Party and
adapt Germany to the pressures of the modern global economy. The
effort to strike a balance between the market and traditional
values of social justice is one of the central difficulties facing
center-left leaders meeting here to try to define a political
course some have called ``the third way.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are among the leaders
attending the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. economic success _ while seemingly incontrovertible in
numbers like the nearly 19 million jobs created during the Clinton
years _ is by no means universally recognized in Europe. On a
recent tour of Europe, Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal was struck
by the European left's image of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top-hatted plutocrats crushing the masses, a place from a
Brecht play where crime is so rife you can barely stick your head
outside without being shot,'' he said. ``An anti-American
imagination is at work that obscures American reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, of course, such descriptions merely reflect European
distaste for American triumphalism. The French now frequently refer
to the United States as a ``hyperpower'' and the Greeks have dubbed
Clinton a ``planetarchis,'' or planetary ruler.
</P>
<P>
   But the disappearance of the communist system against which the
moderate left long defined itself and the emergence of a global
economy that has transformed the workplace have created pressures
and divergences within the family of the moderate left that go far
deeper than trans-Atlantic misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the pressure on Social Democracy greater than in
Germany, home of ``consensus capitalism'' and the ``social-market''
model that propelled the postwar miracle. This model has proved
generally ill suited to the speed and competitive demands of a
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder came to power just over a year ago under the electoral
slogan of ``the new middle,'' and this summer he co-signed a long
paper on the third way that said the European left had too often
favored state intervention and excessive economic regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a society which celebrates successful entrepreneurs,''
Schroeder and Blair wrote then.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has since suffered a series of electoral setbacks, and
has been criticized by both the labor unions, which remain a
cornerstone of German Social Democracy, and the governing
socialists in France.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Schroeder has begun to retreat from his embrace of
Blair's New Labor, vividly illustrated by his unusual intervention
in the British company Vodafone Airtouch's $127.7 billion hostile
bid for Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in Saturday's edition of Le Monde,
Schroeder said, ``Those who mount such operations in Germany
underestimate the virtues of co-determination'' _ a reference to
the German model of having worker representation in the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence that Vodafone would undo this model
in Mannesmann's operations, there is ample evidence that German
unions and the popular press are uniting against the British bid.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that he was not as a general rule against foreign
firms' taking ``stakes'' in German companies, but he called for
``extreme prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   German companies have actively bought foreign companies in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that, ahead of a Social Democratic Party
congress in Berlin in December, Schroeder has become deeply
concerned with retaining the support of his left wing. He has taken
to scoffing privately at his old political slogan. ``The new
middle,'' he now says, ``drives Porsches.''

U.S. READIES A MAJOR LAND-PROTECTION INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ariz., ona, Calif., ornia, Mont., Ore., Utah)  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTEZ, Colo. _ As one of its last major public land
initiatives, the Clinton administration is preparing to designate
as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the West that
federal officials say need protection from future commercial
development and recreational overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who came to Colorado for the
weekend to build support for the action, said the administration
had decided to act because, in many cases, Congress had failed to
act on proposed legislation that would accomplish the same thing.
Delays, he said, had prompted President Clinton to consider
invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the president the
authority to act by executive order in the case of any lands that
have scientific, historic or archaeological significance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, every president except Richard M.
Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush has designated at least one
national monument. There are now more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the administration was more than willing to allow
Congress to take the lead. But conceding that opposition in some
cases might be strong, he said the president was willing to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope this is not our last major initiative, but it
is a major undertaking,'' Babbitt said in an interview Friday
before hiking through part of the 73,000 acres he wants added to
the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction. Saturday he
toured ancient Indian ruins on a 165,000-acre site here that he
wants declared a monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are growing year by year,'' he said, referring to
commercial and recreation pressures on the lands in question.
``Congress hasn't responded at all. So rather than leave it all to
the 11th hour, the president is ready to consider these on a
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two Colorado sites, the other proposed monuments are
in Arizona, California, Montana and Oregon. Having toured them all
within the last year, Babbitt said he had found growing public
support for granting them monument status, which would effectively
provide greater protections through the National Park Service or
the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   All the lands under consideration are managed by the land
bureau, but monument status would add access restrictions and
ensure that they cannot be developed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation groups and environmentalists are applauding the
administration initiative. ``It sends a very important signal that
these special places deserve more protection than they're
getting,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation. ``This tells the world that they are very
significant sites.''
</P>
<P>
   But many opponents view it as little more than a political
gambit by Clinton, a way for him to seal his legacy as an
environmentalist and cement environmental groups' support for Vice
President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers from Western states, like Sens. Robert
Bennett of Utah and Wayne Allard of Colorado, object to federal
intervention within their borders without sufficient local input.
And commercial interests say the initiative is yet another attempt
by the administration to ignore the economic consequences of
environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly smacks of another anti-mining advocacy
effort,'' said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining
Association. ``We can't arbitrarily move mines around. You have to
go where the minerals are, and if they continue to withdraw lands
where the mines are, it means going elsewhere to develop, which
means out of the country and the loss of millions of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Myra Hyde, director of environmental issues for the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose members own herds that graze on
open lands, said: ``The economics are far-reaching. Once you take
lands out of production, it affects whole communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Interior Department said that some of the lands
in question have mineral resources but none have active mines. They
also said grazing rights would probably not be affected by the
designations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of a House national parks
and public lands subcommittee, sponsored legislation two years ago
that would require approval of Congress as well as the governor and
state legislature to designate a national monument that exceeds
5,000 acres. It passed the House, but a companion Senate bill is
still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the most recent national monument _ Grand
Staircase-Escalante, a 1.9 million-acre tract in southern Utah _
was designated by Clinton in 1996, Hansen called the designation
``the biggest land grab in the nation.'' And in a letter in October
to Babbitt expressing concern over monument designations in their
state, three Colorado lawmakers _ Allard, Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell and Rep. Scott McInnis _ described it as a ``heavy-handed
federal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said in an interview last week that Babbitt had yet to
respond to the letter. He criticized administration officials for
``storming in and storming out without doing the proper legwork''
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, who attended a public forum led by Babbitt at the
Colorado National Monument on Friday, predicted that Congress would
expand the monument, which is in his district, within the
administration's timetable. With regard to the other lands, he
added: ``Executive order is not the way to go. The Antiquities Act
was never intended to bypass Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Freemyer, staff director of Hansen's subcommittee, said
that even without Hansen's bill, the administration already had
``hundreds of tools'' to manage public lands without drawing on a
93-year-old measure that was passed before agencies like the park
service were created to manage and protect federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big photo-op declaration, which really isn't
necessary,'' he said of Babbitt's initiative. ``They're just doing
what Al Gore likes to do best, the champion of the environment
warning that if we don't make these places monuments, the
bulldozers are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   To administration officials and environmental groups, that
prospect is not much of an exaggeration. As the expanding national
economy of the 1990s has created more business opportunities and
disposable income, they contend, open lands have become more
vulnerable to commercial development, recreational use and
encroaching sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, which was attended by about 200 people, Babbitt
said that whether it is Congress or Clinton who makes the
designations, monument status would assure that ``the next seven
generations'' have the same opportunity to enjoy the lands that
visitors have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My object, unequivocally,'' he said, ``is to bring this to a
mutually agreeable conclusion.''

35 PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS FAIL NATIONAL CIVICS TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One-third of the country's high school seniors do not understand
the fundamentals of American government, according to results of a
national test administered by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   The tests showed that 26 percent of high school seniors had
``proficient'' knowledge of the workings of the government. And
most of those polled, 65 percent, were defined as ``at or above'' a
basic level. But 35 percent were below the minimum requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The test was part of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, often called the nation's report card.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diane Ravitch, a member of the governing board that designed
the test and an education official in the Bush administration, said
the results were ``deeply troubling'' and called for a
strengthening of civics curriculum. ``Only 9 percent of the kids
were able to give two reasons why it is important for citizens to
be involved in a democratic society,'' said Dr. Ravitch of a
question posed to high school seniors. ``These are questions where
you would expect voters to know how to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ravitch pointed out that the seniors would all be eligible
to vote in next November's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, however, said he was pleased
that 25 percent reached proficiency, especially given widespread
voter apathy and adult ignorance of the democratic process. He
called the results ``an opportunity for renewal and improvement''
and said the department would increase funds for civics education
to $10 million to $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The tests included multiple choice and answers that had to be
written out. They were conducted in 1998 with nationally
representative samples of 22,000 4th-, 8th- and 12th-graders in
public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, even critics conceded, were not easy. One
question, with no options listed to choose from, asked high school
seniors to list two ways the American system of government is
designed to prevent ``absolute arbitrary power'' and ``governing
without settled laws.''
</P>
<P>
   At the eighth-grade level, 81 percent of the students identified
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as someone who was concerned
about the injustice of segregation laws, although only 6 percent
were able to describe two ways that countries benefit from having a
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The test found that 74 percent of the fourth graders tested knew
that in the United States, laws must be applied to everyone
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Students in center city schools had lower scores on average than
those in urban fringe or large town and rural locations, although
by senior year there did not appear to be a difference based on
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``By themselves these efforts cannot overcome the general
indifference that so many adult Americans seem to have about
participation in our democracy,'' Riley said. ``If older Americans
will not model good behavior, we should not expect our young people
to be any different.''

EGYPTAIR CRASH PUTS FOCUS ON MENTAL FITNESS FOR PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days a week, Brad Bartholomew climbs into the cockpit of
a Southwest Airlines jetliner and begins his safety routine. He
checks the instrument panel, radios the control tower, gets the
latest update on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps the most important safety check of all,
Bartholomew looks over at the co-pilot who will fly alongside him.
And that look _ a brief, imperfect observational moment _ as well
as whatever collected knowledge he may have of his colleague, is
the best assurance he will get that the person flying next to him
is fit enough to help carry scores of people through the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either one of us senses a problem with the other,'' said
Bartholomew, who has flown for Southwest for 12 years, ``we're
probably going to take action.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry, which employs tens of thousands of pilots
flying millions of people around the globe, has long relied on a
system of internal monitoring when it comes to the question of
pilot fitness. Pilots like Bartholomew are honor bound to report
any concerns about their colleagues; the pilots' union has a panel
of volunteers who can provide professional help for troubled
pilots, and the airlines have generally been good about allowing
pilots at risk to take time off.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, critics maintain that the industry needed to
impose a more rigorous and systematic program for ensuring the
mental fitness of pilots. Critics say only about half of U.S. and
foreign airlines give psychological tests before hiring pilots, and
after that the pilots are typically subjected only to physicals
once or twice a year, during which they are asked about their
emotional well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the risks posed by disturbed pilots are not
likely to be eased in the aftermath of the crash of EgyptAir Flight
990 on Oct. 31, when all 217 people aboard were killed. While
investigators have cautioned that they have reached no conclusions
about what caused the disaster, government officials said last week
that, based on the evidence so far, they believe the plane was
brought down by one of the pilots who for unknown reasons
intentionally sent the aircraft into a fatal plunge from 33,000
feet over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   If those suspicions prove correct, it would be the fourth time
investigators believed that a commercial plane had been
intentionally crashed by one of its pilots. None of of those
crashes have involved United States airlines.
</P>
<P>
   To many pilots, the minimal number of such horrific incidents
underscore a fact that even the industry's critics concede: pilots
are among the healthiest and most proficient groups of workers in
America. Nearly half of the commercial pilots in the United States
are former military pilots, who have proven themselves in stressful
training. The rest have civilian backgrounds, including many who
have logged thousands of hours flying corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all come from the same breeding stock, and it's a really
small network,'' said Bartholomew, the Southwest Airlines pilot who
also publishes a newsletter on airline labor issues. ``With a half
dozen phone calls, you can really find out a lot about people you
want to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the airline industry maintain that it would be
virtually impossible to devise a foolproof program for preventing
such wildly aberrational behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry's critics insist that much could be done to
further limit risk. At the moment, federal and international rules
simply demand that commercial pilots undergo physical examinations
at least once a year _ and in the case of captains of United States
airliners, twice.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Pressman, a clinical psychologist with Strategic
Outcomes, a company in Providence, R.I., that specializes in
selecting personnel for sensitive jobs like flying, calls that ``a
pretty inefficient way of getting at some of the deeper issues.''
He said the airlines generally ``have been lucky up to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some types of psychological tests have a strong record of
detecting signs of depression or agitation that could pose safety
problems, Pressman said. He and other experts also contend that the
Federal Aviation Administration should require pilots to take such
tests every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and union officials counter that these kinds of safety
problems are extremely rare, and they question whether more testing
is worth the time and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before the EgyptAir accident brought new attention to
screening issues, pilot unions had begun pushing to relax other
longtime safety rules, which bar pilots from taking most
anti-depressant medications.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting depression often forces pilots to be grounded. So even
some psychologists complain that the rules have prompted pilots to
try to hide their problems, adding to the potential hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real Catch-22 there,'' said John Mazor, a spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilots union.
``The FAA needs to look at those rules with an eye to bringing them
up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   But as air travel expands, there are signs that pilots are
facing more stress, and experts say the dangers can manifest
themselves in subtle ways. A divorce, a financial setback or a
death in the family can reduce a pilot's concentration, and
depression or other psychological problems can dull their reactions
in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Records at the FAA show that in 1998, 633 people were denied the
medical approvals needed to secure licenses as commercial airline
and cargo plane captains because of neurological or psychological
problems that ranged from excessive anxiety to a history of alcohol
abuse. That was up from 438 denials in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said those totals included both new applicants
trying to get into the industry and active pilots who failed their
medical exams, though they could not say how many were in each
category. They also said the number of rejections was minuscule
compared to the nearly 135,000 people who renewed or received their
licenses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, then, the most effective monitoring of pilot fitness
is achieved through the industry's system of self-reporting. If a
pilot or crew member become concerned about another pilot, they can
tell union or company officials. Pilots say the large airlines have
generous sick-leave policies and are quick to offer references to
medical specialists if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics contend that because these cases tend to be
resolved internally, it is hard to know how well they are handled.
</P>
<P>
   It also is clear that some pilots are reluctant to turn in their
colleagues, and that some troubled pilots fail to get help.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said that in the last two years, two pilots at one
airline committed suicide. He declined to identify the carrier, but
he said it did not have a psychological testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are two pilots who got into trouble and became depressed,
and it just slipped through the cracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said he believes that the FAA should require pilots to
take written psychological tests like the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory, along with the regular medical exams.
</P>
<P>
   He called the personality inventory, which has 550 questions,
``a darn good effective test,'' and said it would take two hours
and cost about $100 to administer it.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette said the agency was not
considering any such changes in its requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And some pilots scoff at the idea. One American Airlines pilot
who took a test while he was being hired said it seemed like it was
``designed to weed out only those people who have extraordinarily
apparent psychological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazor also insisted that psychological tests were not reliable
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but if you're going to try to take an airline pilot
and hang his career out to dry on a test that may have only 95
percent accuracy, we're going to fight it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the concerns about the tests, industry officials
say it can be difficult legally to remove pilots whose behavior is
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Delta Air Lines grounded a captain five years ago
after he got into an argument with his co-pilot and flight engineer
in the cockpit. The captain had also been arrested, and temporarily
committed to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation, after he was
accused of threatening his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors disagreed about whether he had a personality disorder.
He later won an appeals motion, saying he should not have been
grounded. Earlier this month an arbitrator awarded him partial back
pay.

 &HT;    Stereolab offers a taste of the '60s you may have missed
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nope, as the recent Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young
reunion proves, the 1960s never went away. But then, that's the
official '60s _ the long hair, protest anthem, pot-smoking, peace
'n' love era recycled endlessly on VH1 documentaries and late-night
cable commercials starring Howard Hesseman. It's the vision of
casually bohemian America that any casually hip late-1990s music
fan can't distance themselves far enough from (unless they're
grooving to latter-day hippie bands like Phish, Leftover Salmon and
so on, but that's another trend entirely).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they went to see Stereolab recently. The band, based in
London with various British, French and American members, has been
around most of the decade. Long enough to no longer be a cult
novelty, not quite long enough to be an institution. Its vision of
the '60s, which thoroughly underpins and propels its keyboard-laden
grooves, has more in common with Austin Powers than Abbie Hoffman
and evokes the ``exploding plastic inevitable'' of Andy Warhol and
the Velvet Underground more readily than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Stereolab, whose central figures are guitarist Tim Gane and his
partner, vocalist/keyboardist Laetitia Sadier, wears its influences
proudly. These influences would make a great record collection: the
``space-age bachelor pad'' Muzak of Esquivel, ``Pet Sounds,'' the
1970s pioneers of ``kraut rock'' (Can, Neu! and Faust), Lou Reed
and John Cale of the Velvet Underground, which in turn was
influenced by minimalist composers Tony Conrad and LaMonte Young,
the electronic chance music of John Cage and early electronic music
in general (before it found its way from the academy to the dance
floor).
</P>
<P>
   Stereolab relives the '60s you (or your dad) slept through. They
toss it around like vodka in a martini shaker. What might seem
harsh or obscure becomes smooth and sexily rhythmic. Sadier's airy,
alluring voice, singing lyrics in French, helps complete that
transformation and even adds another level of ``secret '60s,'' as
the words often recall the slogans of the Paris 1968 student
revolt. It's as if radical filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard had been
reincarnated as one of his starlets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as was evident when the group played a jam-packed Variety
Playhouse, this push-pull tension has its discontents. The
less-is-more philosophy that made Stereolab so effective early on
has given way as the musicians have added on influences. And it's
tended to diminish the raw power of its surging, minimalist grooves
and drones: It's what happens when you stop being an art project
and start being a pop band. ``Bossa Nova vs. the One-Chord
Wonders,'' is what I scribbled in my note pad, spoofing the group's
penchant for entertainingly convoluted album titles (the latest:
``Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night''). Unless
you were willing to hassle your way through the crowd for an
uncomfortable spot in front of the stage, the performance shimmered
in the background. It was still a lot more fun and provocative and
friendly, even, than the usual rock-star posturing. The musicians
tended to disappear behind the music, perhaps the better for the
mostly under-30 audience to pick up the slack, foregrounding its
own self-conscious sophistication as if the venue was the latest,
trendiest nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Stereolab serves a subtle reminder that the go-go
cage and the avant-garde have a lot in common. And you don't have
to be a granola-head to love the '60s.

GATES GIVES $26 MILLION TO HELP U.N. FIGHT TETANUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An American support group for UNICEF, the U.N.
children's fund, will announce Sunday that it has received its
largest donation ever, a grant of $26 million from the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation earmarked for the elimination of tetanus
among babies and their mothers in the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 250,000 people, most of them infants, died of tetanus in
the developing world in 1998, according to the U.S. Committee for
UNICEF, the American support group and the oldest of UNICEF's 37
national support committees. Only one newborn infant died of
tetanus in the United States in the same year, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The grant from the foundation, which was created by Gates, the
chairman and co-founder of Microsoft Corp., is intended to make
immunizations more widely available to the poor. ``It helps us
close the gap between what we are capable of doing in the world and
what we are actually going to do,'' said Charles Lyons, president
of the U.S. committee. The money will be turned over to UNICEF for
its programs abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNICEF and others have strategies for dealing with neonatal
tetanus,'' Lyons, a former UNICEF official, said in an interview on
Thursday. ``We're down to 57 countries, 27 of which account for 90
percent of cases. But there was no movement on that because the
resources weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to eliminate neonatal tetanus received its first
pledge of assistance in 1998 from Becton, Dickinson &AMP; Co., a
leading maker of syringes, which offered donations of equipment and
some funds. The Gates grant, Lyons said, is expected to prompt more
donations because people like to be part of a demonstrably
successful project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is much of a limit on people's interest
and willingness to give, but they want to see results They want to
see lasting results,'' he said. UNICEF says that its campaign can
effectively eliminate neonatal tetanus as a health hazard if the
organization can raise $100 million to inoculate 100 million women
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that the Gates grant, which follows grants to several
U.N. projects from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, reflects a growing
interest in development among companies that want to expand their
business abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at this very interesting stage historically,'' he said.
``I don't believe that the private sector is giving more in terms
of international development because government funding is being
reduced. I think the private sector is much more engaged because
their own vested interests are touched. There are more and more
companies that are operating in more and more countries where they
want to grow. Countries where we're still dealing with maternal and
neonatal tetanus include India, China, parts of Southeast Asia,
parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Companies see this as part of their
growth strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers in poor nations become infected by the tetanus bacteria
through unsterilized gynecological procedures or unsanitary
conditions surrounding childbirth. Babies can be infected when the
umbilical cord is cut, UNICEF experts say. Death can be torturous,
with spasms, stiffness and the loss of the ability to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the tetanus campaign and on the disease itself is
available on the U.S. Committee for UNICEF's Web site:

POPE LECTURES GERMAN BISHOPS OVER ABORTION COUNSELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Showing impatience with the reluctance of Germany's Roman
Catholic bishops to stop offering abortion counseling, Pope John
Paul II told them Saturday to hurry up and obey his teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this significant activity of the church in your
country will soon be put back in order definitively according to my
directive,'' the pope said in a firmly worded speech to a group of
German bishops at the Vatican. ``In the defense of life,'' the pope
said, ``it is essential that bishops of the entire church speak
unanimously and with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion in Germany is technically illegal, but pregnancies can
be terminated within the first 12 weeks without prosecution if the
mother can provide a certificate that shows she sought counseling.
Catholic organizations run 270 of Germany's 1,690 counseling
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Many bishops contend that their centers succeed in dissuading
some clients from going through with an abortion, and are therefore
worth preserving, but they failed to convince the Vatican. The pope
sent a letter to the German bishops last September telling them to
close their centers.
</P>
<P>
   But the German bishops could not reach agreement on whether to
obey the pope's instructions and announced that the church would
stay within the state counseling system ``for an interim period,''
as they needed more time to respond to the pope's demands. In a
letter sent to the pope in October, the bishops expressed
``persistent misgivings'' about the Vatican's views.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the pope told them Saturday to get back in line with
church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   German Catholics, like many in Europe and the United States, are
independent and often go their own way on social issues that the
Vatican considers indisputable. Besides birth control, many
Catholics question church teaching on celibacy for priests and the
ordination of women. The pope again told his bishops that there is
no leeway on those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding them that papal decisions against ordaining women as
priests were ``infallible,'' the pope told the bishops, ``As
authentic pastors of your dioceses, you must reject contrary
opinions, be they from individuals or groups.''

officials from the People's Liberation Army on Saturday, and will
return to Washington on Sunday, an American Embassy spokesman said.
The spokesman, Bill Palmer, said the delegation ``was hoping for
constructive talks,'' but he would offer no information about the
content of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was also hoping to arrange a visit to Washington
by Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, the Chinese Army's deputy chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were circumspect about the visit, noting that its
purpose was ``exploratory discussion.'' Still, in a week that
started with the signing of a landmark U.S.-China trade agreement
that is expected to pave China's way into the World Trade
Organization, it seemed clear that relations between the two
countries are again warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chinese officials seemed vaguely optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to resume high-level exchanges between the two
militaries we hope the U.S. side will do more concrete deeds,''
said Sun Yuxi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``But on the whole we
think the signing of the WTO agreement will facilitate the
all-around development of relations between China and the United
States.''

CLINTON SIGNS BILL GIVING MORE OPTIONS TO STUDENTS IN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Md.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has signed legislation that would
expand academic options for graduates of public or private high
schools in the District of Columbia by substantially reducing their
tuition at state colleges in Virginia and Maryland and by offering
grants for tuition at private colleges in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This act helps to level the playing field for the young people
of the District of Columbia by expanding opportunities for
affordable higher education,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which is part of a strategy to encourage families to
remain in or move to Washington, would allow students from the city
to qualify for the tuition rate paid by state residents at public
colleges in Virginia and Maryland. Students attending public
colleges would be eligible for $10,000 a year, a reimbursement that
would go directly to the colleges. And students at private schools
could receive up to $2,500 in tuition aid.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard Riley, and representatives from a
dozen colleges and universities in the area, introduced the new law
last week, emphasizing the importance of higher education and the
need for access to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anxiety that so many parents feel about paying for college
has become part of America's worry list,'' Riley said. ``We want to
let parents and students here in the district and all over the
nation know that college is within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students living in the city, who now pay
out-of-state tuition for attending any public college other than
the University of the District of Columbia, could see their tuition
cut by more than 50 percent. Students paid $7 million in
out-of-state tuition fees last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar effort to retain residents in Washington and
attract new ones, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gave first-time
home buyers a $5,000 federal tax credit for buying in the city.
</P>
<P>
   To be considered for the tuition grants, high school graduates
must have lived in the city for a year before beginning college and
must start college within three years after high school graduation,
unless they first serve in the military, Peace Corps or Americorps,
President Clinton's national service program. Students who are
already freshmen, sophomores or juniors at area colleges would be
eligible for the program, which will begin next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams, in consultation with the Department of
Education, will administer the $17 million program. Depending on
costs, the mayor will have the authority to expand the program to
state colleges nationwide or, if money is running low, to set
priorities for recipients based on income and need.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a dozen private colleges or universities in
Washington, and highly regarded state universities in Maryland and
Virginia, but the city, which has about 500,000 residents, has only
one public university, the University of the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The original legislation proposed in the House in March by Rep.
Thomas Davis 3rd, R-Va., sought to include colleges and
universities in every state, but Congress decided that such a
program would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has called the legislation ``an enormous leap forward''
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to
Congress, said, ``At last, we are free to go to college at
reasonable rates wherever our hard work takes us.''

CONGRESSIONAL NOTEBOOK: ADJOURNMENT HIJINKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Calif., Conn., W.Va., Miss., S.D.)  (mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is always a touch of zaniness surrounding the
rush by Congress to get out from under its workload on Capitol
Hill, and this year was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   What else but the approaching millennium could explain Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., walking in tandem with a six-foot cow across
the sparkling Capitol?
</P>
<P>
   The picture prompted a perfectly apropos question: Had Obey, the
chief Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, suffered through
one too many marathon sessions with Republicans and the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   There he was at 11 a.m., ambling clear across the Capitol, with
that very tall cow, a pair of black boxing gloves and a couple of
Wisconsin colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Obey and Reps. Ron Kind and Thomas Barrett,
who are also Democrats from Wisconsin, had persuaded two aides to
slip into a cow costume and trot on over to the offices of Sen.
Herb Kohl. Kohl is the Wisconsin Democrat who led the lonely fight
in the Senate against legislation that he said would hurt
Midwestern dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl walked out of his office to find the cow on his carpet, a
set of boxing gloves with a cow charm attached and a group of
chuckling lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the heavyweight champ of dairy,'' Obey proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Becker, Kohl's press secretary, said with a smirk, ``The
cow got cow fur all over Sen. Kohl's sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxing gloves proved more symbolic than anything else,
though. By the end of the day, Kohl had dropped his threat to keep
the Senate in session by reading dairy recipes on the Senate floor.
It would be a fight for another day.
</P>
<P>
   There were other last-minute incongruities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert stood before a near-empty House
chamber to deliver an end-of-session speech. A few of his aides sat
in the seats ordinarily reserved by members, completing unfinished
paperwork or gazing out into the ether. Two untouched glasses of
water sat on a table nearby, in case the speaker needed to clear
his throat. It was a speech tailor-made for C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The newest representative, Joe Baca, D-Calif., who won a special
election last week, swooped into the Capitol on Thursday to get
sworn in and join the congressional club. His first vote: a motion
to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., tried to adjourn, but somehow
wound up back in the Capitol when he should have been on a plane.
With his car idling in front of Ronald Reagan National Airport,
Shays raced back to the Hill after he heard that Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., might be threatening hijinks on the Senate floor in an
effort to protect his state's coal miners from a court ruling
ordering them to stop dumping waste from mountaintop mines into
valley streams. No sooner did Shays get back to the Capitol, ready
to fight over the coal issue, if need be, than he realized it had
been a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Home for him would have to wait until well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been anyone but Sen. Byrd, I would have gotten on
that plane,'' Shays said, referring to Byrd's ability to hurl
thunderbolts and tie the Senate up in knots when he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there was a touch of envy toward the House, hard
as that is to believe. Home was still a distant thought for most
senators early Friday morning. Expectations were for a Saturday
departure, with the risk of the session spilling into Sunday and
beyond. Sen. Trent Lott. R-Miss., the majority leader, and Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, worked to toss aside the
clutter, bit by bit, without angering recalcitrant senators or
igniting a bunker mentality.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely smooth going. Lott told reporters that one
infuriated senator almost broke the majority leader's desk, he
pounded on it so magnificently at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But for those not involved in the adjournment negotiations, time
ticked by slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Once a deal was reached with Kohl, the Senate, known for its
snail-paced deliberations, flipped on the power jets and switched
to warp speed. As members stood up to praise Kohl and his efforts
to protect dairy farmers, Lott interrupted the colloquy, saying
``be profound, but be succinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Senate jumped on its omnibus bill and pulled out
of Capitol Hill.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry and mild weather will cover a large part of the nation
Sunday and Monday. But the weather pattern of recent weeks, marked
by exceptional dryness, will change gradually in the days ahead as
a series of progressively stronger Pacific disturbances penetrate
the heart of the continent. Initially, significant precipitation
will be confined to the mountains of the West.During the latter
half of the week, however, inclement weather will spread from the
Plains to the Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will begin with plenty of clouds and a few coastal
showers across the East Coast states. Clouds will break in much of
the region during the midday and afternoon, although overcast skies
will linger in a few areas, especially near the Appalachians and
near the Carolina coast. Onshore winds will promote a few showers
near the coast from the Middle Atlantic states to Florida.
Afternoon temperatures will be far above the seasonal average,
especially in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-starved front will be preceded by sunshine and very
mild air from the Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes. In the
wake of the front, cooler air will reach the northern and central
Plains, but readings will still be above normal for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moist high-level winds from the west will impinge upon
west-facing slopes from the Cascades to the northern Rockies, where
periods of light snow will be common above 4,000 feet. Scattered
rain showers will dampen the Northwest Coast and a few interior
valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dry Streak
</P>
<P>
   Showers on Friday morning in Peoria, Ill., brought the first
measurable rain since Oct. 16. The streak sets a record of 33
consecutive dry days in Peoria. The previous record of 32 days also
occurred in autumn from Nov. 11 to Dec. 12, 1904. Fall is usually
the driest time of year. Long nights aid in the cooling of air near
the ground. The surface chill discourages rising columns of air
that are precursors to the showers of summer. Also, the horizontal
temperature contrasts that are fuel for large middle latitude
storms are still in the early stages of building toward their
winter peak.

SPORTS COLUMN: LOGIC GONE AWRY _ THE BATTLE BETWEEN TWO WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ P.J. Carlesimo stood in the middle of the
practice floor Saturday, a few steps from where it happened. No one
remembers the exact details anymore, except the way it began:
</P>
<P>
   The piercing glare of a coach, a nasty exchange of profanity.
And then it happened _ one of his own players lunging at him,
putting his hands around his neck, an attack that became known as
the most violent incident involving a player and a coach in
modern-sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Latrell Sprewell is not even sure how the
relationship deteriorated so badly, how he lost his senses, grabbed
Carlesimo, told him he wanted to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches and players get into it,'' the guard, now with the
Knicks, said Friday, before he would face the Golden State Warriors
on Saturday night for the first time since the incident. ``Things
do happen. I'm sure it can happen again. Not to the extent of my
episode, but these things happen in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he and Carlesimo could put the incident behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no closure,'' Sprewell said. ``No closure.''
</P>
<P>
   You want an end to this saga, a clear winner, a moral loser,
something palatable to make it seem as if it never happened _ or at
least that it won't again. Can anyone be sure?
</P>
<P>
   You listen to Sprewell speak of injustice, about how the
Warriors dealt with the situation badly. You remember his lawyers
have yet to drop a hopeless lawsuit against the NBA for depriving
him of $6.4 million during a 68-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo coaches the way he has won in the past, prodding,
shouting and grating on his players. He is emotionally wearing down
an undertalented team that has little chance of making the
playoffs, trying his best to make it to the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sad but true: He is viewed less as a martyr today than as an
abrasive man who had the misfortune of being attacked by his
player.
</P>
<P>
   Reversal of fortune: Sprewell has gone from America's thug to
Madison Square Garden's favorite son in less than a season. He
signed a $61.8 million deal last month. He got his job back, his
money back and he has somewhat rehabilitated his image.
</P>
<P>
   But what has he really won? The ability to blow off training
camp, to show another franchise that it should play by his rules or
else?
</P>
<P>
   The day after the attack, coach Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks was
asked about the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' he said. ``It's bad. It's bad for the league, too. I
feel badly for P.J. because he's a very good coach, and to have to
deal with that goes beyond coaching. It's unfortunate. That's
exactly the type of image you don't want to have in this league.
Coaches have to make some tough decisions, and not everyone is
going to like them.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did Van Gundy have to say after Sprewell skipped
training camp this year? ``Don't apply real-world logic to the
NBA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In this league, in this era, authority figures try their best to
instill rules. And when those rules are broken, they either bend or
get fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a players' league, whether it's been
acknowledged or not,'' said Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant coach.
``That was an isolated incident that happened. I honestly don't
think it will happen again. I also think the gap between players
and coach is closing, mainly because the players are starting to
realize the coach is in the same hole as you are. If you don't win,
you can go too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, there was a definite separation. The team didn't
function right, you usually made a trade or benched a player. If
things don't go right now, the coach or the player could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney won't name names or teams. But he said he once saw a
player and a coach square off and throw punches during halftime of
a game. ``It was shocking, but I could see how it could happen,''
he said. ``The emotions were riding high. Two guys didn't like each
other, and all of a sudden they just started going at it.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to make someone a villain, try to find some hidden
meaning behind what happened between Carlesimo and Sprewell on this
practice floor two years ago _ the day a Generation X player grew
agitated and decided to break the code by attacking the old-school
taskmaster, the man whom Sprewell still believes pushed him to his
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no silver lining, no payoff at the end. Maybe
some coaches and players will never get along, and maybe some of
them go over the line and put their hands around someone's throat
before they think about the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where an employee's salary often dwarfs his immediate
supervisor, where more prominent players increasingly have
organizational say in who goes and who stays, can anyone be sure it
won't happen again?

SPORTS COLUMN: FASSEL NONCHALANT AT THE CROSSROADS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The look is casual, a gray sweatshirt with a blue embroidered
``Giants'' drooping over the belt of rumpled tan slacks. The
demeanor is calm, a pleasant exchange with the beat reporters on a
glorious late autumn afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel smiles and acts not like a man who may be facing the
crossroads game of his professional life. He sounds more like a
coach who only believes he is going to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say to the guys, `If we win, this is what it can do for
us,''' Fassel said of Sunday's showdown against Washington at the
Redskins' newly renamed (sigh) FedEx Field. ``It's not a case of
saying, `If we lose this game, all hope is lost.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that, win or lose, a thousand divisional scenarios
will remain to be hashed out on sports talk radio over the next few
weeks. As far as the Giants are concerned, all of them will amount
to drooling into the microphone if they don't beat the Skins. It
will be time for us _ if not for Fassel and his team _ to stop
kidding each other about the Giants and the playoffs. If they are
five victories against five defeats after 10 weeks of the N FL
season, they will be, on the subject of serious postseason threats,
in a category that includes the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Giants are not even a playoff team in a mediocre
conference whose longstanding dynasties are halfway down the road
to ruin, then where, exactly, does that leave Fassel, now past the
midway point of his third season in this job? A program that began
with a beyond-all-expectations playoff run will have flattened out,
like so many attempts by any Giants quarterback in recent years to
throw one deep. Fassel and the Giants will be on a treadmill, which
is often an unproved coach's personal road to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the coach's job is on the line Sunday
afternoon. John Muckler of the Rangers and Don Casey of the Nets
have to twitch every time the telephone rings, because their teams
are gasping for early-season air after millions of ownership
dollars were spent, and that usually foretells of some corporate
executioner on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches die different deaths, as it becomes, with each
passing Sunday, slowly apparent that their programs are not flying
and they are not the next Bill Parcells. In Fassel's case, he was
more of the anti-Parcells when he took the Giants to the playoffs
two years ago, a career assistant who was making the most of his
big chance.
</P>
<P>
   He came into town as almost an afterthought, in the year the
mighty Parcells had been hired by the Giants' co-tenant to crack
the whip. Fassel was a stand-up guy, an earnest guy. He won a lot
of games that first year with ferocious defense, but his reputation
in a long assistant's career was made with offense, with
quarterbacks, and so it seemed the Giants were on their way.
</P>
<P>
   In Year 2, they finished fast but only to salvage
respectability, nothing more. The offense was still painfully
devoid of playmakers, but it was also clear that Fassel, in that
first season, had built up a healthy portion of collateral with the
news media. People liked him. They still like him. His team is
competitive, if also dull. It seems to win enough not to be written
off, but that is not all that hard to do when parity is the party
line to which the entire conference is hooked.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is just something less promising about
Fassel's relentless optimism, about the kind of big-game challenge
he said he had made to his team for a game he called the biggest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told them, `When you're talking about championship games,
you've got to take it to a championship level,''' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   No one really expects Fassel and these Giants to win any
championships beyond the most attainable one, their division's. At
this point, it is not too much for their ownership and fans to
expect them to go into Washington Sunday and defeat a team that is
slumping, beat up and likely fed up with a boorish new owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They snuck up on us the last game,'' said Keith Hamilton, the
defensive tackle, trying to explain those shocking 50 Redskins
points back in September.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hamilton said, ``I'm proud to be part of what we're trying
to establish here.''
</P>
<P>
   What that is, no one will be quite sure of if the Giants lose
Sunday , and put themselves on a collision course with a season
destined to peter out at 8-8 or 7-9. Sometimes, as it was with Rich
Kotite and the Jets, there are too many games that define a coach's
regime. In other cases, it may take only one.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many people around town who do not want Jim Fassel
to succeed. He is not an extreme personality, a
love-him-or-hate-him guy, like Parcells. Late Friday afternoon, his
interview done, Fassel demonstrated this again by strolling back
from the practice field, amid a swarm of reporters, swapping
stories, just one of the guys.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the coming New Year's Day, which the Giants will
have to spend in Dallas. Fassel said, all things considered, he'd
rather be away New Year's, even this one, than Christmas. The
Giants are home against Minnesota on Dec. 26. No one can say for
sure, but this Christmas, for employment's sake, Fassel may need to
find a playoff berth under his tree.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The builders of Georgia's epic new mall, a vast
savanna of shopping on 100 acres, chose a precarious moment in
Atlanta's history to open their doors a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, the city had been trapped under a hood of smog.
Traffic was so heavy that a single accident caused nine hours of
delays one morning. Normally conservative politicians and business
leaders had been driven to create an extraordinarily powerful
superagency to slow the region's growth machine.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle of Atlanta's summer of excess, the Mall
of Georgia opened 35 miles northeast of downtown in Gwinnett
County. It called itself a new kind of mall, but the town square
out front could not hide the surrounding blacktop with spaces for
8,600 cars, because cars are the only way to get to the Mall of
Georgia. There is no public transportation in Gwinnett County, and
none will be available for years.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the 10-county metropolis that includes Atlanta
has known for years that the region's smashing economic success was
producing so much congestion that its future was threatened. This
year it acted, creating one of the most powerful tools in the
country for containing growth, the Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority, empowered to veto highways, order new rail lines and
deny development like subdivisions and malls.
</P>
<P>
   But sprawl is the result of millions of small, individual
decisions _ from the building of a giant mall to the decision to
shop there _ that have barely changed, despite the public's
expressed disgust with congestion.
</P>
<P>
   No city has scrambled faster than Atlanta to develop long-range
plans that might reduce the effects of growth, but in no city in
America do residents continue to spend more time in their cars.
That is a direct result of the Atlanta area's extremely low
population density, the lowest of the nation's largest metro areas,
and its continuing consumption of forest land at the rate of 50
acres a day. The Atlanta region has about 1,370 people per square
mile, compared with about 5,400 in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Although some prosperous professionals have been moving into the
core city of Atlanta to escape traffic, the growth of the suburbs
was 100 times greater than that of the city last year. The city, in
fact, has grown little, while the region around it has swelled.
With 427,500 people, Atlanta today accounts for 13.3 percent of the
metropolitan area's 3.2 million residents, while it made up 22.4
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile is so essential here that most neighborhoods lack
sidewalks, and the design of the cities has made it difficult for
people to find ways to reduce driving. Though a growing number have
joined car pools that allow them to use designated faster lanes,
vehicle emissions have hit a historic high. The region's residents
now drive an average of 35 miles a day, an average higher than
anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods continue to reject public transit lines, in part
because they fear that they will bring other races into their
midst, or because they dread the foot traffic and development that
public transit is designed to concentrate. Counties that do try to
restrain growth often face furious opposition in a region with a
strong libertarian streak, as longtime landowners insist on their
right to sell to the highest-paying developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about changing human nature here, and especially
the independent streak that so many Southerners have,'' said Lucy
Smethurst, director of the region's Clean Air Campaign, a
consortium of businesses, government agencies and environmental
groups trying to break long-standing regional habits. ``We're
trying to slow down the Queen Mary, and we've just now seen the
rocks in the water ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's population has grown 70 percent since 1980,
spilling into once-rural counties, largely because there was always
more farmland to clear for another subdivision, unimpeded by
natural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there were few regulatory barriers to growth.
The competition for development and the accompanying tax revenue
led counties to build hundreds of miles of roads without fear of
interference by the state.
</P>
<P>
   That way of thinking began to change in June 1996, when the
Environmental Protection Agency threatened to ban federal money for
highway construction in 13 regional counties because of high ozone
and smog levels. Last year, when the ban took effect, businesses
acted, fearing that government regulations combined with Atlanta's
congestion, pollution and worsening image would begin to hurt
profits.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, the huge regional telecommunications company,
announced that it would consolidate 75 offices, with 13,000
employees, into three regional centers, each situated at a subway
station.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. plans to bring 2,500 employees from the suburbs to
its headquarters downtown. And several real-estate developers are
beginning to concentrate on what is called new urbanism projects,
in which housing is built around offices and shops, encouraging
residents to walk to work.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, however, business leaders joined forces with
environmental groups to support Gov. Roy Barnes' plan for a Georgia
Regional Transportation Authority, known as GRETA.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will have the power to build (or veto) roads and
transit systems. In theory, it could build and operate a rail line
through any of several counties that have opposed mass transit. It
can also have an effective veto over large subdivisions, office
parks and malls by refusing permits to tie into the road system.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's chairman, Joel Cowan, made it clear in a recent
interview that new projects like the Mall of Georgia would not be
approved unless they had mass transit connections, or at least the
population density to justify them.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus is clearly growing among the region's leaders that
houses, offices and shops must begin sharing the same space, much
as they do in older, Northeast cities. That consensus, however, is
at a fairly elite level, and it is unclear whether it will trickle
down to the warring camps of property owners and new residents. A
stark example of their conflicting interests occurred recently in
Cherokee County, a largely undeveloped area 25 miles north of
downtown where the population has grown more than 50 percent since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the urging of newcomers who moved in and then
wanted to slow the growth around them, the county commission passed
an innovative plan to concentrate development in 13 town centers,
leaving most of the county pastoral. Longtime landowners, however,
fought the plan bitterly because it meant they might not be able to
sell to developers; some zoning meetings erupted in fistfights. In
July, the commission dropped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up,'' said Emily Lemcke, the chairwoman of the
Cherokee commissioners. ``I still hope that we can educate people
and get them to understand that the whole region is going to have
to change. But for now, there are still too many people who don't
want to be told how to live their lives or what to do with their
land.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON'S VIGOR IN TURKEY MAY HELP SPEED UP REFORM
 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ No visitor in memory has left as positive and
potentially far-reaching an impression on Turkey as President
Clinton did last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's vigor and youthful political style sent an unavoidable
message for change to a country where the president, prime minister
and main opposition leader are all phlegmatic septuagenarians. Many
believe the visit has given Turkey new momentum toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm with which he plunged into crowds of earthquake
victims, entered their tents and shared their tea and misery
astonished many Turks, who rarely see their own politicians mix so
closely with ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his trip, Clinton seemed determined to encourage
forces in Turkish society that defend minority rights and political
change.
</P>
<P>
   To show his support for the Greek Orthodox minority, whose
leaders sometimes complain that the government does not treat them
respectfully enough, Clinton paid a call on the Orthodox patriarch.
Aides said that he expressed sympathy with one of the patriarch's
long-held dreams, the reopening of a religious seminary here that
was ordered shut years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Later Clinton met with a group of human rights advocates,
including some whose organizations have been in trouble with the
government. Among them were leaders of Mazlum-Der, a
Muslim-oriented group whose bank account was frozen to prevent it
from sending unauthorized aid to earthquake victims in August, and
the Human Rights Association, which government officials have
accused of collaborating with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time we have lacked leadership and vision in
this country, and when I had a chance to speak, I thanked him for
giving us some,'' said Kemal Koprulu, one of those who attended the
meeting. Koprulu heads a group that advocates sweeping political
change in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this visit, people here are yearning for leadership even
more than before,'' he said. ``People have a tendency to think that
the whole world is as slow to develop democracy as we are, but now
they see that isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our standards are very low. Clinton set a benchmark for us. He
put the standard way up there. He told us we have a few problems to
solve, and people are energized to go out and meet the challenge he
gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant as the list of people with whom Clinton met
was the list of those he ignored. Although military commanders hold
ultimate power in Turkey, Clinton scheduled no meetings with any of
them. Instead he addressed the relatively powerless Parliament, a
gesture that aides said was intended to show his support for
strengthening civilian power here.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton praised Turkey's progress toward
democracy but also asserted, ``There is still far more to be
done.'' Touching on one of the country's most sensitive challenges,
he said he hoped that it would be possible ``for Kurdish citizens
of Turkey to reclaim that most basic of birthrights, a normal
life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clearly aligning himself with those who desire more political
liberty in Turkey, Clinton said: ``When writers and journalists
freely express themselves, they exercise not only a fundamental
right, but fuel the exchange of ideals essential to prosperity and
growth. When peaceful outlets exist to express normal human
differences, the peace is preserved, not shattered. When people can
celebrate their culture and faith in ways that do not infringe upon
the rights of others, moderates do not become extremists, and
extremists do not become misguided heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Political reformers were ecstatic about the speech and Clinton's
visit in general. ``I think he's just great,'' gushed Omer Madra, a
radio station manager whose biting commentaries have made him a
symbol of impatience with the old order. ``He's got to be one of
the best American presidents in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was careful to mix his calls for democracy with lavish
praise for Turkey's ``ability to bridge east and west,'' gratitude
for its ``half a century of friendship, mutual respect and
partnership'' with the United States, and praise for ``the great
founder of the Turkish Republic,'' Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. As a
result, although small leftist groups staged scattered protests, no
prominent figure of any persuasion criticized his message, at least
in public.

   HARD-NOSED OR JUST PLAIN DIRTY?
</P>
<P>
   As Karl Malone lowered his shoulder and bulled his way through
the Knicks last Wednesday night, an old debate raged on: Is the
Mailman just a hard-working, physical player or a manipulative,
cheap-shot artist or a little of both?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the picks, just don't stick your elbows
out,'' said Chris Childs, who received four stitches when he and
John Stockton collided in the fourth quarter of Utah's victory. ``I
got hit a couple of times with elbows to the head. I don't like
that. I don't mind contact, but don't elbow me in the head. There's
no place in basketball for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby echoed the same sentiments, adding of Malone,
``According to him, he never fouls. He was complaining. Then again,
he probably is the most physical guy in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone often initiates contact and pushes off underneath when he
goes after rebounds, like many big, strong players in the league.
But when it comes to the dirty-player label, the Knicks' point
guards are quickly gaining steam.
</P>
<P>
   Since Charlie Ward bent down low and blocked out P.J. Brown at
his knees in Game 5 of the 1997 conference semifinals against Miami
_ a play that provoked Brown to toss Ward out of bounds and led to
a melee _ the Knicks' starting point guard has drawn the ire of
several other players for his aggressive play.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Glen Rice and Kevin Willis, who said Ward was
malicious in his acts. Now Childs, who is unafraid to mix it up
with anyone and often encourages physical contact, is grating on
players around the league.
</P>
<P>
   After Miami beat the Knicks last Sunday, Tim Hardaway wondered
aloud: ``What's up with Childs? He was out there using his forearm,
his elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Childs often likes to get under a player's skin to
charge himself up _ in the same vein that most players use a couple
of made shots as motivation to play better _ Hardaway shook his
head in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days, somebody's going to knock him out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   LEAGUE OFFICE LOSES A TOP PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the transactions last week was the news that Jeff
Mishkin, the NBA's executive vice president and chief legal officer
for the past seven years, will return to private practice.
</P>
<P>
   He never played a minute or stepped to the podium to announce
the procuring of a billion-dollar network television contract. But
alongside Commissioner David Stern, Mishkin was vital to the
league's rise in prominence the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He argued some of the most significant and sensitive appeals for
the league in one capacity or another, and has worked for the
league since 1973. Mishkin will become a partner in the New York
office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom after the first of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's most prominent sports lawyers, Mishkin
became an expert in matters of antitrust, labor relations and
intellectual property. Mishkin will continue to serve the NBA as
its chief outside lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess David is going to keep me at it till I get it right,''
he said.

SOME OLD WISDOM FOR YOUNG STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note time element in 3rd graf. Game begins at 10:30 p.m.) 
(With BKN-NOTEBOOK)

<P>
   Terry Cummings was sitting by his locker recently, pondering
what the NBA has become in his 17-year career. He has run the
gamut, from rookie of the year to clubhouse sage. Now, at age 38,
he is trying the role of NBA ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in this league say they've seen everything,''
Cummings said. ``I feel like I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night alone, he took part in Latrell Sprewell's return
to Golden State to play the Warriors. Beyond the specter of the
choking incident in December 1997, Sprewell became yet another
example of a young player in his 20s who had trouble accepting the
franchise-player role.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings also heard about 19-year-old Leon Smith, the troubled
Mavericks rookie, who ended up in a Dallas psychiatric ward.
</P>
<P>
   He also looked at Stephon Marbury's outlandish number of
field-goal attempts in a box score, wondering if Marbury felt the
pressure to carry a franchise by himself and in the process had
alienated most of his Nets teammates. While with Philadelphia,
Cummings saw that in Allen Iverson before the 76ers started
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest disappointment might be the way players are
marketed who don't really deserve it yet,'' Cummings said. ``They
haven't earned the right. You market them, you show their face, but
you also show their weaknesses. They come out blaring in their
youthfulness; in the midst of the youthfulness is their weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not tutored, they're not mentored, so they're learning
as they go, and so, in some ways, it almost seems as if they're
being exploited to their detriment. And then, along the way, the
league is defamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings does not put blame solely on the league or the players.
He thinks much of it has to do with a system that rewards potential
instead of experience. He also realizes the future is here and you
have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like Charles Barkley or Karl Malone,'' he said. ``I
don't believe it's a bad thing for the younger players to act and
respond the way they do. I think it's part of having a warrior
mentality. I think what has to happen is it needs to be funneled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it can only be funneled through conduits which the young
players respect. They're not going to follow just anybody. But if
they respect you, that's a whole another story. Changes come and
they accept the change and move on with the program. If they don't
respect you, they stay in their own realm. They make their own
rules, create their own laws and they abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably about 10 to 20 percent of what they say is a
bad seed in our league. There are many more good guys. I'm not
saying everyone is a knight in shining armor, but the real bad
seeds are few and far between. And they need help.''
</P>
<P>
   It's self-serving, he knows. But Cummings, one of the few true
counselors left on NBA rosters, wonders why more teams don't invest
in veterans to help bridge the generational gap. The recently
retired Buck Williams and Herb Williams used to hold teams together
the way Cummings helps hold the Warriors together today.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mitchell in Minnesota. Charles Oakley in Toronto. Terry
Porter in San Antonio, where he's barely needed. And Michael Cage
in New Jersey, where they don't listen. The wise man in the corner
stall is a dying breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they can't score 15 to 20 points a game per year, but
they can give you a spark when you need it, on the bench, in the
locker room and on the floor at times,'' Cummings said. ``And
they're good enough role players to understand you're not always
going to have a role on the court sometimes. You're not there just
for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The league and the players have to start thinking
about more than the dollar now. They really have to start thinking
about the character of the game and the character of the
individual. It becomes incumbent on both the owners, including
David Stern, and the players association to find a way to bridge
the gap between the youthfulness and the mature side.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways is to keep some of these guys around long
enough that are really good for the players, guys that can still
play.''

 &HT;    A SAILOR'S TALE OF SURVIVAL IN HURRICANE LENNY: 'I WAS SURE I
WOULD DIE'
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Naked, shivering and in agony,
Jacques Santos just wanted it to end, even if it meant dying.
</P>
<P>
   He had endured 30 hours of an unspeakable ordeal after Hurricane
Lenny swamped his charter sailboat and left him clinging to the
torn shreds of a life raft, tossed about like a plaything in
30-foot swells, whipped end-over-end by 100-mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure I would die,'' said the 26-year-old Brazilian
resident of St. Martin, a tiny Caribbean island. ``I drank a lot of
seawater, I made a lot of vomit. I didn't have any more strength. I
wanted to kill myself; just to get it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, after an excruciating day and terrifying night riding
the monstrous waves, Santos was spotted by a U.S. Coast Guard
Falcon Jet from Air Station Borinquen on Puerto Rico. It was about
9 a.m. AST (8 a.m. ET) Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jet circled about five times and I waved and waved,''
Santos said. ``Soon another plane came and dropped a buoy with
water and a radio. I don't know how long it took because I was
delirious. But soon the helicopter came and the man jumped out and
they pulled me up. I couldn't believe it. I was saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos was flown to a St. Croix hospital, where he was treated
and released late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, he suffered only scrapes, bruises and rope burns
from when Lenny's winds tried to rip the inflatable raft out of his
grip.
</P>
<P>
   His companion on the 65-foot charter vessel Frederick apparently
perished in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to his wife last night from the hospital,'' said
Santos. ``I told her that after we left the boat, I never saw
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos, who was crewing on the boat, knew the man only as
``Captain Guillame.''
</P>
<P>
   The improbable tale began Tuesday at Marigot, a port on French
St. Martin. Unable to find shelter for the Frederick at the marina,
Capt. Guillame decided to head to sea to try to outrun Lenny, which
was then hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sailed east, toward the storm, but also toward the
shelter of larger islands like Puerto Rico. They made several
hundred miles before the seas and winds picked up as Lenny
approached.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 p.m. Wednesday they turned back, sailing as far as Saba,
a tiny island near St. Martin. Capt. Guillame reached someone on
the radio who told them they were still in the storm's path and
they shouldn't come back to St. Martin, so they turned east again.
</P>
<P>
   Santos took down all the sails and the two men traded 1-hour
shifts fighting the vessel's wheel, which pitched wildly in the
churning seas. They wore safety lines while on the open deck,
watching with growing fear as the waves climbed steadily higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very scared,'' said Santos, who has sailed all his life
and has worked charters on St. Martin for the past two years.
``Never in my life had I seen seas like this. It was ... wow.
Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   During the night Thursday, the boat's engine failed. Next the
wheel broke, and the vessel turned aimlessly in circles amidst the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bilge pumps failed, and the water washing in from the
towering waves quickly began filling the Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain told me, 'OK Jacques, get the water bottles and
the life raft,''' Santos said. ``He decided we had to leave the
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, the men failed to don life jackets, although
there were plenty aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they put their faith in the inflatable raft, a
six-person job about the size of a double bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we threw it outside, the wind just took it like a
parachute,'' Santos said. ``It ripped the floor out and the ropes
burned my arms when I held on.''
</P>
<P>
   The men dove from the Frederick, which by then was heeled over
on its side. They grabbed the life raft, but the wind and swells
pitched them end-over-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over about five times, and then this giant wave broke
right on us,'' Santos said. ``I never saw my captain after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos managed to keep hold of an inflated portion of the raft,
wrapping his arms and legs around it, hugging it for dear life.
Lenny's powerful wind and waves stripped all of his clothes off.
</P>
<P>
   It was pitch black and Lenny roared around him like a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been afraid of the ocean,'' Santos said. ``But I
have never seen it like this.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day Thursday, the winds relented somewhat as Lenny
churned eastward. But the towering waves didn't let up, and Santos
was pitched over, held under and pummeled repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so tired,'' he said. ``I told myself, 'Just be quiet.
There's nothing you can do but hold on.' I thought about my family.
I thought about my wife. I didn't think I would ever see her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   On St. Martin, Santos' wife of 10 months, Sarah, thought the
Frederick had sailed to safety. She was contacted by the Coast
Guard after the rescue, and spoke to her husband at the hospital
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought everything was alright,'' Santos said. ``It was a
big surprise to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Lenny pounded his home island, Santos will likely spend
the next few days on St. Croix, then hopefully catch a flight home
when the St. Martin's airport re-opens.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he sits in a sunny hotel room in Frederiksted, staring
out the open window at the blue, calm Caribbean, contemplating his
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love the ocean and boats,'' he said. ``I will still go
on boats, but not in a hurricane. I will save my life, not the
boat.''

LOPES' LONG ROAD FROM COACH TO MANAGER WAS BLOCKED BY EXCUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why was Davey Lopes unable to secure a manager's job until now?
Let him count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes said: ``I couldn't interview. I wasn't good with young
guys. I'm going to come in and take over the whole organization. I
don't know if I can work with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were probably some reasons he forgot. ``I didn't know
if I was any good at anything by the time it came out,'' Lopes
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``All those things are false.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes, a take-no-prisoners kind of second baseman when he
played, was interviewed for seven different jobs before the
Milwaukee Brewers, No. 8, made him their manager a few weeks ago.
As Chris Chambliss and Willie Randolph still do, Lopes had to
wonder if he would ever rise above the status of coach as one team
after another said thanks for your time, but we decided to go in
another direction.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse heard most often for Lopes' previous failures was
that his interviews did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in a couple cases that might have been true,'' the
53-year-old Lopes said, ``but for the most part I think that was
just something people used to justify why you didn't get a
particular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams that interview blacks or Hispanics for jobs as manager or
general manager feel compelled to give reasons why those candidates
were not hired: ``He doesn't have major-league managing
experience'' and ``He lacks administrative experience'' are two of
the usual reasons given about those failed candidates. Teams do not
seem to feel it's necessary to explain why white candidates do not
get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes, a coach for 12 years, most recently with the San Diego
Padres, acknowledged that his interview with the Brewers went
better than some of his previous interviews. ``I think I was more
relaxed in this interview process for whatever reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopes seemed to be encumbered by a reputation for being
outspoken and opinionated, characteristics that can especially work
against black or Hispanic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my background,'' Lopes said, ``I've never been
in a situation where my employers said they had a lot of
controversy with me. I speak out on issues. If people can't deal
with that, that's their problem, not my problem. If you don't want
to know what I'm thinking, don't come and ask me a question. But if
you come and ask me a question, expect to hear something that's my
belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying you have to accept it, but just because it may
not be what you want to hear, it doesn't mean it's wrong. That's
how I live my life, how I've always lived my life. I'm not here to
try to change people's minds. I have a philosophy about how things
should be done. I'm going to give them that in Milwaukee. What's
happened in the past, I don't hold any grudges. I just wasn't what
they were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has the job he has long yearned for, Lopes takes
command of a team that has not produced a winning record since
1992. Does he feel any pressure to succeed immediately?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not any more than anyone else who has wanted an opportunity to
manage at the major-league level,'' Lopes said. ``I don't feel any
extra pressure on myself. Why should I? It's no different than
anybody else seeking a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Few rookie managers get to begin their careers with a good team,
of course. Lopes' problem in replacing Phil Garner is that the
Brewers are still the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with the players my boss gives me,'' Lopes said. ``I
understand the situation. Anybody who takes an opportunity like
this understands the economics of the game and that you may not be
afforded some of the luxuries of some of the markets, and you make
the best of it you can. But this is a new regime. It's going to be
a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying if it remains the same, the outcome should
remain the same,'' Lopes said. ``There will be some changes made.
Hopefully those changes will be for the good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the Brewers were a bunch of underachievers
in recent seasons, Lopes said: ``I don't want to get into that.
That's a knock at the people before me. By me saying something like
that, it's a reference to what the other person didn't have. That's
not my style. I just think things will be different. Good, bad or
indifferent, they'll be different.''

   CLOSING ARGUMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Before the New York Mets decide to keep John Franco and use him
in tandem with or as a substitute or setup man for their anointed
closer, Armando Benitez, a study of New York Yankee history may be
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1977 season, despite the presence of Sparky Lyle, the
American League Cy Young Award winner that year, the Yankees signed
Rich Gossage as a free agent. They decided that he and Lyle could
serve as co-closers. Bad idea. Lyle plummeted from 26 saves and 60
games finished to nine saves and 33 games finished. Gossage earned
27 saves and finished 55 games. That winter, a thoroughly but
understandably disgruntled Lyle was traded to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have good reason to keep Benitez in the closer's role;
not many relief pitchers throw as hard as he does. He will squander
an occasional lead, but he will give the Mets fewer fits than
Franco, the Cardiac Kid.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN MONEY IS THE ONLY THING
</P>
<P>
   All players who become, or are a year away from becoming, free
agents should be required to study the experience of Darryl Kile
before they decide to try to extract the absolutely last dollar any
club is willing to pay them. Kile is a case study in how a player
can follow the money to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-game winner in 1997 with Houston, Kile embarked on a
free-agent odyssey that took him away from a division champion and
planted him in the major leagues' pitching graveyard. Resisting the
Astros' efforts to sign him to a three-year contract for $21
million, the right-hander instead grabbed a three-year deal with
Colorado for $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been traded to St. Louis, does Kile regret that
fateful decision two years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never say that,'' Barry Axelrod, his agent, said. ``He
won't come close to saying that. It was a calculated gamble to go
to Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile clearly lost the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros spent the last two seasons winning two more
division titles, Kile spent two dismal seasons with the Rockies.
Struggling to survive in Denver's high altitude and in the middle
of a mediocre defense, Kile went from a 19-7 record and a 2.57
earned run average with the Astros in 1997 to a two-year record of
21-30 and a 5.84 ERA with the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   His 7.44 ERA at Coors Field this year was the highest for a
starter at home in the National League. Regrets? There just might
have been a few.
</P>
<P>
   THAT DODGER SWAGGER
</P>
<P>
   The abuse and the ridicule the Los Angeles Dodgers have gotten
because of their high-pay, low-production season have not
introduced humility into their ranks. They recently showed that,
new ownership or old, they are no less arrogant than the Dodgers of
old.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual general managers' meetings and winter meetings,
when a trade is made, representatives of both teams appear in the
press room for a news conference. But for the announcement of the
Raul Mondesi-for-Shawn Green trade at the general managers'
meetings, only one team took the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Dodgers' press conference,'' they began.
</P>
<P>
   Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager, answered reporters'
questions about the deal standing in the hotel lobby not far from
the room with the stage the Dodgers made their own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had not joined the Dodgers executives inside, Ash
said, ``We weren't invited to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   CY YOUNG MINUS 20
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 pitchers who have won the Cy Young Award more than
once, Randy Johnson is the only one who has not been a 20-game
winner in any of the seasons he won. Johnson won 18 games in the
slightly strike-shortened 1995 season and 17 games in his
run-starved 1999 season. Greg Maddux won 16 and 19 in 1994 and
1995, both strike-shortened, but gained 20 victories each in 1992
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   TWO WRITERS NEEDED EDITING
</P>
<P>
   When most of the candidates have all 28 members of a 28-person
panel willing to vote for them, but one candidate has only 26 who
are willing to consider him, the result is an election stacked
against the one. That was precisely what happened to Pedro Martinez
in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award:
Two writers left the Red Sox ace off their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Martinez should have necessarily won, but he should
have at least had as fair a chance as the others. That's why the
Baseball Writers' Association of America should take steps to
ensure that in the future its voters will not embarrass the
organization, make a farce of one of the the most prestigious
awards in sports and treat players unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   If a voter honestly feels a certain pitcher does not deserve to
be among the 10 names on his ballot, he should not be forced to
include him. In this instance, however, the voting writers omitted
an obviously deserving Martinez because they did not believe
pitchers should be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not for the voters to decide; that decision has been
made for them: pitchers are eligible. In future elections, writers
who are assigned to vote on the MVP panels should be asked
beforehand to state their views on pitchers. (Baseball writers from
The New York Times do not participate in voting for postseason
awards.) Assuming the nonbelievers can reply honestly, excuse those
who say they will not list pitchers on their ballots and give the
vote to writers who will.

CASE INVOLVING MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA RESULTS IN PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two advocates of the medicinal use of marijuana
pleaded guilty Friday to growing more than 6,000 plants and selling
the drug, saying their only hope was to ask for a judge's mercy
after they were precluded from raising medical issues in their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Peter McWilliams and Todd McCormick, intended to
tell jurors about the state law passed by voters in 1996 allowing
marijuana use for medical purposes, its purported benefits and
their own health. McWilliams has AIDS, and McCormick has fused
vertebrae from childhood cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge George H. King of U.S. District Court here barred them
from raising those issues in the courtroom after prosecutors
contended that doing so would confuse and mislead jurors.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute was whether a ``medical necessity
defense'' saying they broke the law because their health required
it could be used when Congress had classified the drug in question
as having no legitimate use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the judge's logic, that the medical necessity defense
does not exist, someone in Peter's situation has only two remedies
to prevent him from going to jail,'' said Tom Ballanco, a lawyer
for McWilliams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is prosecutorial discretion, and the other is compassion
on the part of the judge,'' Ballanco said. ``Here, obviously, the
prosecutors chose to prosecute, so it's all up to the judge to
demonstrate there is some compassion in the federal law. I am
hoping that he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Both pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to manufacture and
distribute marijuana. In doing so, they capitulated to a set of
facts that they continued to dispute outside the courtroom. Based
on letters McCormick wrote to McWilliams, prosecutors maintained
the men were planning to sell marijuana to cannabis clubs where ill
people go to use the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But the defendants maintained they were growing the plants for
personal use and for a book McCormick was writing about medical
marijuana. McWilliams, a book publisher, acknowledged growing 300
of his own plants but insisted the roughly $100,000 he gave
McCormick was a book advance, and not financing for the growing
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The case also highlighted a conflict in federal law. Despite
Congress' stance, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed a
cannabis club in Oakland to resume providing marijuana to patients
in September, saying medical necessity could be used as a defense
against a court injunction obtained by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, who faces up to five years in prison under his plea,
waived his right to appeal on that issue. But McCormick will appeal
King's ruling on the medical necessity defense. If he loses, he
will face five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this was the smartest way to protect my health and my
well-being,'' McCormick told reporters outside court afterward.

   WILLIAMS RETALIATES AGAINST DIRTY TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   The education of New Orleans Saints running back Ricky Williams
continues. The latest lesson: dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was giving his usual relentless effort on the field
last Sunday, this time against the San Francisco 49ers. He is a
gifted runner who makes tacklers pay with a lowered shoulder into
the chest; his 722 rushing yards this season put him on pace for
1,284 yards, which would make him the Saints' first 1,000-yard
rusher in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were having a hard time stopping Williams the right
way _ by tackling him _ and, according to Williams, one defender
decided to use cheaper tactics. Williams was on the bottom of a
pile of bodies after a running play, and as players began to slowly
get up, he said, he felt someone's knees pinning his legs to the
ground. Then Williams felt a sharp pain in one of his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the pain was caused by defensive end Gabe Wilkins'
grabbing the ankle and severely twisting it. Williams thought at
one point that his ankle was going to snap. Williams said he was
able to pry himself from the ground before Wilkins could finish the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has a soft-spoken demeanor, but no one should be
fooled: he is a fiery competitor. Upon getting up from the ground,
he kicked Wilkins in the leg, and although Williams was the one who
was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, Saints coach Mike Ditka
praised Williams for sticking up for himself.
</P>
<P>
   A league spokesman said Wilkins would not be fined because
nothing was caught on videotape. San Francisco 49ers officials had
no comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was surprised by what happened in that game,''
Williams said. ``You don't expect someone to try and twist your
ankle off. But I wouldn't say the NFL is dirty. I think what I've
learned is that there are some players who will do whatever it
takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he had been kicked, punched and had his lower
limbs pulled and twisted as if he were a Thanksgiving turkey.
Cheap-shot tactics like these are not uncommon against young stars,
especially a Heisman Trophy winner like Williams. For some players,
it is a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The entire season has been a classroom for the talented rookie.
The Saints basically traded their entire draft to the Washington
Redskins to get Williams, and whether that was a wise move is
debatable. What is not debatable is the fact that Williams is a
great runner and a future star.
</P>
<P>
   His season has been phenomenal, despite the fact that he has
battled injuries. He leads all NFC rookies in rushing and is fourth
over all in the conference. His 197 carries are the third most in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spoke on a number of subjects during an interview last
week, including whether the embattled Ditka would return next
season. ``I hope so, but I don't really know,'' Williams said. ``I
don't know if anyone knows. I do know he loves the players a lot
and is a great coach.''
</P>
<P>
   On 49ers running back Lawrence Phillips being suspended
indefinitely for refusing to practice, Williams said: ``We all have
problems. We all do things that are not always morally correct. I
only hope he learns from what has happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   On how long he thinks he will play in the league: ``Hopefully
I'll play at least 10 years. I'm only 22 and it's already hard to
see myself playing at this level 10 years from now. The game is so
hard on your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams spends most of his free time alone or with close
friends. Like many young NFL players, he is an avid user of the
Internet. Williams has been known to go into a Saints chat room
under another name, see if fans are criticizing him, then reveal
his true identity. He spoke this past week while taking part in a
promotional campaign for the Quarterback Club, a league marketing
program that will include Internet interviews with NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Williams is one of the league's classiest players.
And, like second-year quarterback Peyton Manning in Indianapolis,
he is already being called a high-quality player by scouts and
coaches around the league. But Williams' team might not have as
much success as Manning's anytime soon. Does that bother him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is a true statement,'' he said. ``We're
going to turn this thing around sooner than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   HOSTETLER READY TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   When Tyler Hostetler, the 8-year-old son of former Giants
quarterback Jeff Hostetler, was severely injured last June while
riding an all-terrain vehicle, Hostetler spent nearly every day
with his son as he underwent grueling physical therapy sessions.
Jeff, who last played for Washington in 1998, received interest
from St. Louis, Tennessee, Seattle and Denver but would not rejoin
the NFL until his son healed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is now almost fully recovered and returned to school in
September. Meanwhile, Jeff Hostetler is ready to play again. Last
week, he met with the 49ers and members of the organization were
amazed by Hostetler's arm strength in a 45-minute workout. He has
stayed in shape by hammering fence posts into the ground near his
home in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wanted to sign Hostetler immediately but could
not. As he has done before, Hostetler kept a promise to Tyler.
Months ago, Tyler was asked to choose a vacation spot, picking
Hawaii so that he could swim with dolphins. Hostetler would not
complete a deal with the 49ers until his family returns later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler would like to sign with San Francisco and stay into
next season. When the 49ers draft a thrower to replace Steve Young,
Hostetler would like to tutor him. The 49ers could not ask for a
better teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of my boys have encouraged me to play, and that
plays a lot into my thinking,'' Hostetler said. &QL;

THE AD CAMPAIGN: A BUSH MESSAGE ABOUT SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial, titled ``Pictures,'' is the sixth to
be released by the Bush campaign and begins running Sunday in New
Hampshire, a state with an early primary.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: George W. Bush sits, relaxed, his burgundy shirt
open at the collar, in a sun-filled room, talking to an
interviewer. As he speaks, a montage of campaign footage unfurls:
Bush and his wife, Laura, waving from the door of a plane; Bush
walking, a bouquet of paper flowers in his hand, among black and
Hispanic children; Bush shaking a man's hand; Bush holding a baby;
Bush at a table with a schoolgirl, two tiny American flags in front
of them; Bush holding another baby.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial alternates a few more times between Bush in the
sun-filled room and the campaign scenes, with the exception of a
shot of Bush kissing his wife in a more private outdoor setting.
The commercial ends with Bush talking and the appearance of the
slogan: ``A Fresh Start.''
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Bush says, ``Everywhere I go in America _ everywhere
I've gone on this fantastic journey so far _ people walk up to me
with pictures of their children and say, `Governor, I want my child
to look at the White House and to be proud of what he or she sees.'
I believe it's important for Americans to have confidence in their
leadership. I think it's really important for moms and dads to be
able to point to the White House and say, `That person has brought
honor and dignity to the office.'''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The Bush campaign might well have called this
commercial ``All About Monica.'' That is the glaring subtext: that
Bush is an antidote to the sexual scandal of President Clinton's
affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about that relationship caused many politicians,
Republicans in particular, to remark that they did not know how to
explain the president's behavior to young, impressionable children
or how to teach their children right when the president was doing
wrong. Bush's plain, direct language seems to allude to that, while
the imagery makes the case both that children look up to the
president and that Bush would be a president worth looking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush's repeated appearances, and the affection that Bush
shows her, also seem to draw a contrast with the Clintons, whose
marriage has presumably been strained by his acknowledged
infidelities.

EDITORIAL: WATCHING WHAT THE ARMY TEACHES  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to criticism and pressure, the Army is finally moving to
reform a training academy that should preferably be closed _ the
long-notorious School of the Americas. Established in 1946 to
befriend and tutor members of Latin American militaries and train
them in the virtues of democratic civilian control, over the
decades it became an instrument of U.S. Cold War policy, providing
training for fighting and interrogating leftist guerrillas. The
school became far better known for the dictators and thugs it
graduated than for any good works done. The drug-dealing Gen.
Manuel Noriega of Panama was an alumnus, as were the Guatemalan
colonel linked to the killing of an American innkeeper in 1990, 19
of the 26 soldiers who murdered a group of Jesuit priests in El
Salvador in 1989, and the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, who reputedly
organized many of El Salvador's death squads.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which liked the close relationship the school gave
it to Latin American military power, has defended its usefulness
for years against congressional critics who charged that its
methods were being used in the region to suppress democratic
dissent. When it was revealed in 1991 that the school's training
manuals advocated torture, blackmail and the ``neutralizing'' of
insurgents, the Army gave ground. The school began emphasizing
courses in human rights and civilian control, subjects closer to
what it had been intended to teach.
</P>
<P>
   But only now, after some 60,000 soldiers and police officers
have passed through its courses _ and after Congress almost closed
it last fall _ is the Army secretary, Louis Caldera, proposing to
reconstitute the curriculum and student body of the school. Still
at Fort Benning, Ga., still under control of the Pentagon, the
school would recruit Latin American political and civilian leaders
as well as uniformed cadets, drop some combat instruction, bring in
lecturers from the State Department and change its name to the
Center for Inter-American Security Cooperation. The Army is being
forced to do this, various officials admitted, by the school's
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing our focus from the Cold War, and the role the
school played in the past, to this mission of helping educate
military and civilian leaders within the context of democratic
principles,'' a senior Army official said. This sounds more like
the school's original mission, but coming so late it lacks
persuasiveness and passion. If the administration and Congress want
a school to train Latin American leaders, both civilian and
military, it should have broader sponsorship than the Army.

ETCHEVERRY AND UNITED ARE BACK IN TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Three years ago, D.C. United and the Los
Angeles Galaxy met here in the first Major League Soccer
championship game. Playing in a downpour, United rallied from a
two-goal deficit for a 3-2 overtime victory on a goal by Eddie
Pope.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, United will return to the championship game for the
fourth straight year and play for a title it has already won twice.
And its opponent at Foxboro Stadium will again be the Galaxy, back
for a second appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to thank United for inviting us to their annual
championship game,'' said coach Sigi Schmid of the Galaxy (20-12),
which eliminated Colorado and Dallas to reach the championship
game. ``They're very strong everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   United (23-9) eliminated Tampa Bay and Columbus on its way to
the final.
</P>
<P>
   One reason United has been the dominant team in the league's
four years of existence has been Bolivian player Marco Etcheverry.
He is arguably the league's best playmaker, someone who customarily
raises his level of play in important games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's championship game, in which Chicago neutralized
Etcheverry _ primarily because of Chris Armas, the league's best
defensive midfielder _ was an exception. Otherwise, Etcheverry has
been virtually unstoppable in the big games.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid contemplated the question of how to stop Etcheverry for
several seconds before answering.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said: ``I don't think you can stop him. You try to
contain him and make it a little tougher for him to get the ball in
positions he likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry's strengths are his long diagonal passes, his
improvisation on free kicks and his precision on corner kicks. He
is a true general on the field, and his leadership motivates his
teammates to raise their games a notch, too, when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   When United was faced with a third and deciding game in its
semifinal series against Columbus, Etcheverry created three goals
and scored the last in a 4-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leads by example,'' said Richie Williams, United's
indefatigable defensive midfielder. ``I think people are right when
they say we go as far as Marco takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is one of five players who will start his fourth
championship game for United, along with Etcheverry, Pope, Jaime
Moreno and Jeff Agoos.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has four starters returning from that first
championship game: Mauricio Cienfuegos, Robin Fraser, Cobi Jones
and Greg Varney. Cienfuegos is the Galaxy's answer to Etcheverry.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos is a diminutive El Salvadoran who plays with the
heart of a giant. He is as creative as Etcheverry, and he lacks
none of Etcheverry's leadership qualities. The only difference is
that Etcheverry is more accurate with his long passes, while
Cienfuegos can be more dangerous with his creative maneuvers in
tight spaces around the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams met twice in the regular season, each winning on
the road, on the way to posting the two best records in league. The
Galaxy won by 2-1 at Washington and United won by 2-0 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have met 12 times in four years, with United
winning eight of those games.

MASSACHUSETTS CAMPUS TENSE AFTER ATTACKS ON WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Emerging slightly dazed from an exam into the
brisk early evening air, Sarah Shumaker was approached by three
fellow students who offered to accompany her to her destination at
the University of Massachusetts here. The conversation took place
just yards from where a series of attacks on women had occurred in
recent weeks. Two reported being raped.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shumaker, a 21-year-old English major, declined the offer of
an escort because she did not have far to go and because two patrol
cars and several uniformed police officers were also milling around
the area. Later, she expressed her thoughts on walking around
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a bad attitude, but you expect this kind of a
thing, being a woman,'' Ms. Shumaker said. ``It's really hard being
a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the attacks took place on successive Tuesdays. The
latest, in which a woman was grabbed from behind and cut on the
face with a knife, occurred last week, just before 2 p.m., less
than 100 yards from where 500 people were holding a rally for
campus safety. In another incident, last Sunday, a woman reported
being assaulted with pepper spray and punched by three men in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
   The university's police chief, John Luippold, would not
speculate on whether a single individual was involved in the
Tuesday attacks, but he acknowledged similarities in the
descriptions offered by the three victims of the Tuesday assaults:
a white, college-age man with a muscular build. A state police
forensics unit is studying the knife used in the last attack.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks come at a time when reports of rape are on the rise
on college campuses and when federal requirements for reporting
campus crime are undergoing a major overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics show that rapes on
476 campuses across the country rose 11.4 percent last year, to 402
from 361 in 1997, while other violent crime increased only
slightly. Experts warn, however, that rapes are significantly
underreported and that the vast majority of those that are reported
involve an attacker known to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst, with 25,422
students, reported more ``forcible sex offenses'' in 1996 and 1997
than any university in the country other than Colorado State
University and the University of Southern California, both of which
have slightly larger student populations, statistics published by
The Chronicle of Higher Education last May show. Fifty-one other
colleges in the nation had larger enrollments in the fall of 1996,
but The Chronicle cautions against comparing institutions because
of variations in how crimes are reported in different states and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Campus Security Act of 1990 mandated that all colleges
compile and publish statistics on a specified list of crimes. New
regulations published this month by the federal Education
Department seek to make crime statistics more comprehensive and
uniform by, among other things, stipulating that crimes in areas
adjacent to campuses be included in published reports. The
regulations will take effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   The two rapes and two assaults reported here since Nov. 2 are
highly unusual because of their nature and their frequency, said
Howard Clery III, who monitors campus crime from an office in King
of Prussia, Pa., for Security on Campus Inc., which his family
founded after his sister, Jeanne Clery, was raped and killed at
Lehigh University 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the attacks were reported to have taken place in broad
daylight, and three occurred in a heavily traveled part of campus,
by a pond bordered by thick bushes.
</P>
<P>
   As another Tuesday approaches, the climate on campus is ``very
fearful,'' said a spokesman for the student government, Jared
Brooslin.
</P>
<P>
   The university has trimmed the bushes around the pond and is
making available 10,000 alarms that create a loud screeching noise
when a pin is pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Students are taking action, too. Members of a group called Pond
Watch, wearing orange armbands and traveling in groups of at least
three, offer campus escorts to people like Ms. Shumaker. And the
student government is planning another rally for Tuesday, hoping
that it will be the first Tuesday in the month to be free of
attacks.

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL (WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a tony Manhattan private school for boys last week, the
headmaster, a Brit, confided that even after many years here he was
still desperately struggling to understand baseball. Could he ask a
rudimentary question? I nodded politely and tried to remember if
the infield fly rule had been rescinded or if the strike zone had
been relocated again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, under the circumstances,'' he said, with a sudden bolt of
intensity, ``do you think the David Wells-for-Roger Clemens trade
was justified? And, also, about David Cone's free agency; are you
anxious?''
</P>
<P>
   No, just stunned. Here we are in the belly of football, in the
early heat of basketball and hockey, with boxing rocking, and none
of it seems more urgent than the gossip around the Hot Stove
League: two-league Cy Young Award winners, will the Mets or the
Yankees get the Japanese pitcher, are John Franco and Junior
Griffey coming or going?
</P>
<P>
   Are we in another diamond cycle, is the national pastime
reasserting itself, or are the other sports just going through
emotional bear markets? If Bill Parcells hadn't invented Ray Lucas
last week, there would be no football talk that didn't involve a
bone chart or a court appearance. The death of Walter Payton and
the failing health of Tom Landry seem to signal the end of a
certain kind of NFL, and certainly the end of a certain boomer
innocence about it, and mortality.
</P>
<P>
   On the pro basketball court, we are still in uneasy transition
from Air Jordan to all the not-so-fresh princes. As hip-hop culture
informs the mainstream, the faux-outlaw image of tattoos, clunky
gold, posses and attitude is getting old for the suburban boys who
buy music, beer and sports.
</P>
<P>
   College football and basketball are not in much better shape. A
recent conference created by former Drake provost Jon Ericson was
able to begin with the premise that big-time intercollegiate sports
is corrupt. What evolved seems hopeful, a group called the National
Alliance of Faculty for College Athletics Reform. Faculty
involvement is essential. Without the compliance of professors, the
nurturing of nonscholar athletes would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The pro sports that are periodically boomed never quite go bust.
Hockey is still simply too demanding, a wonderful game played by
immensely skillful toughs, but it is marketed as a series of wintry
crashes, and now that we have pro wrestling, who needs violence
without a story line? Once, wrestling was merely a parody of
boxing, but now that boxing can handle its own mockery, wrestling
is free to expand and become a parody of the Olympics, with its
hyperpomp, systemic corruption and designer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is soccer, always just about to save us. A young
Nigerian, Henry Iwuchukwu, who has been refereeing youth games in
Manhattan this season, said recently: ``Soccer will never make it
in America until little boys sneak out of the house against their
parents' wishes to kick the ball around in the park with their
friends. All I see is parents driving kids to organized games.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwuchukwu, you may remember, along with his countryman Bishop
Dike, starred for Martin Luther King Jr. High School last year as
coach Martin Jacobson's team won its third straight city title.
Iwuchukwu and Dike dropped out of school in the wake of an
eligibility controversy that caused games to be forfeited and
Jacobson to be suspended. They have since begun classes to get
equivalency degrees. An executive with Major League Soccer says the
pros would be interested in giving them tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the reinstated Jacobson and his latest team competed
against Newtown High, at the Long Island University Brooklyn
campus, for the city title.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people were at the game than were talking about baseball
in the city. Even I wasn't there. Of course, I told that private
school headmaster, I'm anxious about Cone's free agency. And, yes,
how could you not still be ambivalent about the trade? Clemens is
merely a great pitcher. Wells is a great role model.

EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT ULSTER PACT HITS A NEW SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain on Saturday put in motion plans to start up the
new Northern Ireland government under the freshly revived Ulster
peace agreement, but immediate progress was halted by a dispute
between the rival Ulster Unionist and Sinn Fein parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning _ just beginning _ to see the outline of a
new Northern Ireland,'' Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary for
Northern Ireland, said in laying out the steps he will take to have
home rule powers transferred from the British Parliament in London
to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast by Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward with those actions depends upon the outcome of a
crucial balloting of the quarrelsome Ulster Unionist Party in
Belfast next Saturday. Its leader, David Trimble, hopes to gain
support for the plan mediated by former Sen. George Mitchell in his
just completed rescue of the long-deadlocked peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge facing Trimble was seriously complicated
Saturday by reports that a chief Sinn Fein officer had told a
Boston newspaper that the party was not fully committed to press
for disarmament of the Irish Republican Army, the assurance that
Trimble needs to sell the deal to his distrustful Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble told the BBC on Saturday that if such a ``double cross''
was occurring, he would cancel Saturday's meeting of his party.
``If it turns out that Sinn Fein was making statements in the
United States that contradict the statements they have made here in
Northern Ireland and if these are not clearly and immediately
repudiated,'' he said, ``then obviously they have broken the
understanding on which we are proceeding and we will act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Boston Herald that made the front
pages in British newspapers, Pat Doherty, a Sinn Fein vice
president and member of its negotiating team in the 11-week
Mitchell talks, said the IRA had no intention of disarming. He
reportedly said that Sinn Fein did not believe Britain would carry
through with its sanction of shutting down the new Ulster
government if the guerrilla force failed to dismantle its weapons
by May, as called for in the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it's conceivable that if the institutions are
working, and the cease-fire is holding, and that the arms are not
being used, that the whole thing would be collapsed ?'' Doherty was
quoted as telling the newspaper's editorial board in Boston. ``That
would be just lunacy.'' The statement is a damaging one for Trimble
since, if true, it confirms the very suspicion on which many of his
party members base their opposition to his plan to enter government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has maintained a cease-fire for more than two years, and
the week before last, the act that enabled Mitchell to seal his
rescue mission with success, the underground group said it would
agree for the first time to discuss disarmament by appointing a
representative to the independent panel charged with dismantling
paramilitary arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein issued a statement from Doherty in the United States
on Saturday afternoon expressing ``dismay and deep concern'' over
the reporting of his remarks. He said he had been quoted out of
context, adding: ``Sinn Fein is not in the business of
double-crossing or misleading anyone. Such a course of action would
be disastrous. We are in the business of making peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble said he found the response inadequate. ``I think the
eschewing of intent to double-cross by itself is quite
insufficient, and this is far too serious a matter to leave to some
silly little play on words. There has to be clarity about what was
said, what was meant and whether it represented the position of the
republican movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's task now is to build support for his decision to
abandon the long-standing Ulster Unionist demand _ known as ``no
guns, no government'' in what had become a party mantra _ that
there be an actual turnover of weapons before Sinn Fein, the party
that represents the IRA, is permitted to take its leadership
positions in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition includes six of the Unionists' 10 members in the
British Parliament and the party's deputy leader. But Trimble
expressed confidence Saturday that he would win. ``I expect that
with perhaps the odd display of nerves from the odd person, the
party will calmly, coolly make up its mind and proceed as it always
does'' he said.

JEFFREY ARCHER QUITS RACE IN LONDON OVER SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire novelist and member of
the House of Lords who was the Conservative Party's candidate for
London's first elected mayor, dropped out of the race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, 59, said he was withdrawing from the May election
because it was about to be revealed that he had asked a friend to
lie for him 13 years ago when he was accused of being involved with
a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he said that he had never tried to hide problems
from his past and had worked hard on new ideas to improve life in
the capital, but that he was unwilling to put his family through
attacks on him.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken peer has been the subject of fiercely denied
allegations ranging from making huge profits in stock trading based
on insider information to shoplifting suits in Canada to
fabricating war hero credentials for his father and his own
qualifications to gain entry to Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has in recent years been dogged by sexual
and financial scandals, and the party's leader, William Hague, said
Saturday that ``Jeffrey Archer has let the party down, and there
could be no question of him continuing as our candidate for
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's surprise development spared the Labor Party more
front page embarrassment after days of comment over its muddled
process of choosing its mayoral candidate. The front-runner in
polls is Ken Livingstone, a leftist whom Prime Minister Tony Blair
has attacked as representing everything he tried to purge from
Labor's past. Blair favors Frank Dobson, who resigned as health
secretary to run.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Archer won an $800,000 libel judgment from The Daily
Star by arguing successfully that while he had made a $3,500
payment to the prostitute Monica Coghlin, he had not slept with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The News of the World, Britain's best-selling Sunday
tabloid, told him it was printing an article saying his friend Ted
Francis had agreed to claim that the two men were dining together
at a time when Archer was suspected of being with the prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Archer admitted that he was at the Chelsea restaurant, but with
an unidentified female friend, not Francis, whom he had asked to
cover for him.

POLICE PREDICT FEW ARRESTS OF HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the police
would intensify efforts to keep the homeless from sleeping on city
sidewalks and in doorways, the police said Saturday that they did
not plan a sudden crackdown and did not expect a sharp increase in
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But coming after years of stepped up police surveillance and
enforcement of quality of life offenses _ and with the nights
getting colder _ the mayor's threat sent waves of apprehension
among homeless people across New York City, according to people who
assist them through private advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most homeless people on the streets have already had
unpleasant experiences with the police, so some will tell you this
is nothing new,'' said Patrick Markey, a counselor with the
Coalition for the Homeless, who said he had participated on Friday
night in his group's routine visits to outdoor areas in the city
where the homeless congregate.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the visits _ which he said included stops at the
Staten Island ferry terminal and at several dank, isolated
locations also in lower Manhattan _ was to distribute food. But
Markey said he had talked with several of the homeless people he
met about the mayor's pledge of increased enforcement, and found
their mood to be particularly grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them think this is just going to make life more
difficult than it already is,'' he said, adding that a fresh wave
of police action would ``simply force people into hiding.'' He said
the homeless would probably respond by avoiding groups and sleeping
in dark alleys or secluded side streets, which would put them in
greater danger.
</P>
<P>
   But the fears of a sudden wave of arrests were unwarranted, said
Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman. She said the police had no
intention of conducting enforcement sweeps like the ones the city
has begun employing against taxi drivers who discriminate against
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply not a crackdown on the homeless,'' she said,
adding that Giuliani's instructions to the police had been only to
``re-emphasize what we have been doing all along in enforcement of
quality of life crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know if there had been an increase in
arrests of homeless people, or summonses issued to them, since
Friday, when the mayor made his remarks on his weekly radio
program.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, Ms. Mode said, homeless people would be arrested
only for such violations as violent behavior or disturbing the
peace. To illustrate the department's emphasis on seeking help for
the homeless, she cited data for 1998 showing that the police
received 64,424 complaints about people who were described as
emotionally disturbed, of whom 24,787 were removed to hospitals and
551 were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority is to assist people,'' she said. ``If we have
arrested more people, you can be sure we have also assisted more
into shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's pledge of increased enforcement was prompted by an
attack on a woman on a Midtown street on Tuesday by a man the
police believe to be homeless. The woman, Nicole Barrett, 27, was
struck on the head with a paving stone at Madison Avenue and 42nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police said Saturday that Ms. Barrett's attacker
had not been identified, and Ms. Mode said, ``We cannot be certain
that this was a homeless or mentally ill man,'' she added that both
the mayor and the police ``assume that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett suffered such serious head injuries in the attack
that doctors had first feared for her life. But since Tuesday, her
condition has improved steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is in critical but stable condition, and continuing to
improve,'' said Peter Schectman, a spokesman for Bellevue Hospital,
in a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's pledge of renewed enforcement efforts came as there
has been a widespread public outcry, including an unusual
front-page editorial in The New York Daily News calling on the city
to ``Get the Violent Crazies Off Our Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the attack on Ms. Barrett, public fears have been
stoked since January when a woman was pushed into the path of
subway train by a man with a history of schizophrenia.

NASCAR EXPANDS ON ITS POPULARITY 
NBA AND POLITICS 
AIRWAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   With NASCAR's $2.4 billion broadcast and cable deals with Fox,
NBC and TBS wrapped up, the stock car racing behemoth is focusing
on plans to create its own 24-hour channel.
</P>
<P>
   A network that is all-NASCAR, all the time, would feature news,
highlights, pre- and post-race programming, qualifying races, races
on circuits like Winston West and Busch Grand National North that
aren't on TV and golden oldie races.
</P>
<P>
   The format would be similar to NBA.com TV, the NBA's 24-hour
channel that started earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be pursuing a NASCAR channel,'' said John Griffin, a
Nascar spokesman, who declined to say who its partners would be.
</P>
<P>
   One option being explored is to create the NASCAR Channel by
converting SpeedVision from its programming about cars, boats,
aviation and motorcycles. Fox owns 30 percent of the channel, which
has 25 million cable subscribers, in partnership with cable
partners Cox, Comcast and Media One. A conversion to dawn-to-dusk
NASCAR would very likely accelerate its subscriber growth.
</P>
<P>
   For Fox to be NASCAR's partner in the channel, it might have to
buy out its partners. SpeedVision could also continue as it is and
spinoff a second network that would be for NASCAR. Or SpeedVision
could keep some of its programming but devote a heavy amount of
time to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The organization could also go to NBC, TBS, as well as Fox, and
create a joint venture in a channel.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that NASCAR'S goal is to blanket the world with
stock car races and programming. The notion of a NASCAR channel
bespeaks the perceived insatiability of fans, viewers, track owners
and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   One assumes diehard stock car fans would find an embarrassment
of riches in a full-time NASCAR network. Just because it wouldn't
carry live Winston Cup races doesn't mean it wouldn't attract those
who find three hours on a Sunday afternoon inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the programming lineup:
</P>
<P>
   Wake up to ``Live! With Junior Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch the sitcom ``Everybody Doesn't Love Jeff Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tune in to the ``NASCAR Evening News with Benny Parsons.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget ``Nascar E.R.,'' with Dr. Jerry Punch, and
``This Old Track (With Condos),'' starring speedway mogul Humpy
Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   NBA and Politics
</P>
<P>
   Just why did NBA Entertainment stage Bill Bradley's presidential
fund-raiser last Sunday at Madison Square Garden? Besides its usual
work like making videos, ``Inside Stuff,'' international basketball
games, the NBA.com Web site and NBA.com TV, the NBA unit is in the
event-producing business.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley-NBA Entertainment relationship began when the former
senator's campaign staff called seeking some archival video, and
the possibility of producing the fund-raiser with some of the
former Knick's best basketball friends arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our New York City base of operations, our familiarity
with the Garden and the number of current and former NBA players
there, we said yes,'' David Stern, the NBA commissioner, said.
``We've done other arena events like `Don't Foul Out,' with Nancy
Reagan at Market Square Arena,'' the Pacers' former home in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The message, then, is that NBA Entertainment is an
event-producer for hire, not that it provided a special,
one-time-only service for a former player who was a New York star.
Stern said the service is available to all political comers. So
presidential hopefuls like Vice President Gore _ who averaged 2.8
points a game as a Harvard freshman _ Gov. George W. Bush, Sen.
John S. McCain and the rest need only book their rallies and make
friends with enough current and former NBA stars to make the event
worthy enough to involve NBA Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our stagings are about the NBA,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest NFL Films has gone beyond its basic mission was a
deep-sea fishing tournament for Clint Murchison, the former
Cowboys' owner. It has spurned requests to film bar mitzvahs and
weddings, but once mulled paid promotional work for a presidential
run by Jack Kemp, the former quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Airwaves
</P>
<P>
   HBO Sports is preparing a documentary for next year on Bill
Russell, one that the Boston Celtic great suggested to the cable
network through Frank Deford of Sports Illustrated. Russell
recently refused to be interviewed for his ESPN ``SportsCentury''
profile, but Ross Greenburg, the HBO Sports executive producer,
said, ``Now Bill says he's ready.'' ... HBO is also planning a
third edition of ``When It Was a Game,'' its baseball home-movie
series, covering the 1960s. ... NBC and Turner Sports will decide
shortly after Thanksgiving if they will start a spring-summer
football league.

DISTRICT ATTORNEYS PROVIDE MUTUAL AID IN DEATH PENALTY CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Heide Mason, an assistant district attorney,
walks into a courthouse to prosecute a case, the setting is
normally the sprawling, 11-story state Supreme Court building in
downtown Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Ms. Mason, still an assistant district
attorney in Brooklyn, goes to work daily in a much smaller rural
courthouse in the distant reaches of upstate New York _ the tiny
Adirondacks community of Elizabethtown, whose population is about
1,500 and whose main street is two blocks long.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabethtown is the seat of Essex County, and Ms. Mason is on
loan from the Brooklyn district attorney's office to help the Essex
County prosecutor, Ronald Briggs, with a death penalty case. Her
presence as jury selection proceeds in the trial of Jeffery Glanda,
who is charged with hiring another man to murder his estranged
wife, is the most conspicuous example yet of how district attorneys
throughout New York state have been helping one another in the
demanding task of prosecuting capital cases under the 1995 state
law that reinstated the death penalty for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ms. Mason, who helped win a death sentence in Brooklyn in
the first capital trial under the new law, moved 300 miles north
three months ago to help Briggs try Glanda, the mutual aid that the
state prosecutors' offices had given one another in capital cases
had largely been out of public view. It had involved activities
like helping with legal research and with writing court briefs, and
providing advice on jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mason's work on the Glanda case represents ``the first
time, to my knowledge, that a trial attorney from one county is
participating with the district attorney's office of another county
in prosecuting a capital case'' in the courtroom, said Sean Byrne,
executive director of the New York Prosecutors Training Institute.
His group was established by the New York state District Attorneys
Association to help prosecutors handle the demands of the capital
punishment law.
</P>
<P>
   In rural counties, prosecutors across the state say, smaller and
generally less experienced staffs have faced problems handling the
extensive and highly sophisticated legal work a death penalty case
entails. Prosecutors said they were especially worried that if the
small offices mounted weak cases that brought unfavorable judicial
rulings on important death penalty issues, those rulings could set
precedents that would hurt prosecutors across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just out of the goodness of our hearts,'' James M.
Catterson Jr., the Suffolk County district attorney, said recently
in explaining why he and other prosecutors with large and
experienced staffs had aided their counterparts in counties
including Ulster, Schoharie, Genesee and Wyoming with death penalty
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought if we had an adverse decision'' in one of those
counties, ``it would affect us because this is a brand-new
statute,'' said Catterson, whose office has won death sentences in
both of the capital cases it has tried so far.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Legal issues in a death penalty case can include the
constitutionality of the capital punishment statute, which
reauthorized the death penalty 11 years after the state's highest
court, in 1984, declared the remaining provision of the state's
previous capital punishment law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They can also include the instructions the judge gives jurors
for determining whether they should sentence a person convicted of
first-degree murder to execution by lethal injection or life in
prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulster, Schoharie, Genesee and Wyoming Counties, a total of
five capital murder defendants have ultimately avoided trials by
pleading guilty and receiving sentences of life in prison, in two
cases without the possibility of parole and in the others with
parole possible after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Catterson said many of the state's prosecutors had decided on a
mutual-help policy because the capital punishment law provided for
a state-funded office, the Capital Defender office, to represent
those charged with capital murder and help private lawyers with
such clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the beginning they would be very aggressive and
thorough,'' Catterson said, ``and we were concerned that if they
descended en masse on one of our rural counties upstate, it would
overwhelm them.'' Catterson was president of the District Attorneys
Association when the death penalty law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin M. Doyle, director of the Capital Defender Office, said he
also saw the competition as a ``David and Goliath thing,'' but
maintained that the capital defense bar was David because ``the
combined forces of the prosecution'' statewide ``are certainly much
greater than the resources we can muster.''
</P>
<P>
   John M. Ryan, chief assistant district attorney in Queens, where
three death penalty cases have been brought, said the state's
prosecutors have aided and consulted with each other in noncapital
cases, but ``the amount of it, the level of sophistication of it''
has been far greater under the 1995 death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs, the Essex County prosecutor, said he asked Charles
Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, for help in prosecuting the
Glanda case because ``it was clear that I needed aid.'' Brooklyn
has mounted six death penalty prosecutions, the most in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A capital case is just a tremendous amount of work,'' Briggs
said, referring to the lengthy jury selection in such cases and the
numerous special legal issues involved _ all in addition to the
normal evidentiary issues in any murder trial, which, as in the
Glanda case, can be challenging to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs has only three full-time assistant district attorneys,
and his office has had just six noncapital murder cases in the six
years he has headed it. Essex County has about 40,000 residents
scattered over a vast area near the Canadian border that includes
Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes, whom Briggs met while both were serving on the executive
committee of the District Attorneys Association, responded to
Briggs by lending him Ms. Mason, 38, who has worked in the Brooklyn
office for 13 years, the last nine specializing in homicide cases.
</P>
<P>
   She was part of the three-member prosecution team in the case
against Darrel K. Harris, the first person to be tried for capital
murder under the 1995 law. Harris was sentenced to death last year
by the Brooklyn jury that convicted him of killing three people
while robbing a Bedford-Stuyvesant social club.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mason said she was flattered to have been chosen and found
prosecuting a case in a rural area to be an interesting experience.
</P>
<P>
   Four other convicted murderers have been sentenced to death in
the state _ the two in Suffolk County and one each in Rochester and
Syracuse. Their cases are on appeal. Four other capital trials
ended with the juries convicting the defendants of first-degree
murder but sentencing them to life in prison without the chance of
parole. Seventeen other capital cases ended with guilty pleas, and
trials in six cases, including Glanda's, are under way or pending.
Altogether, capital cases have been mounted in nearly 20 of the
state's 62 counties.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON WINS ON RIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Alaska, N.Y.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   A heartening feature of this year's budget struggle was the
collapse of the Western Republicans' annual effort to load up the
appropriations bills with last-minute riders designed to aid
commercial interests at the expense of the environment. A few key
Democrats, an energetic conservation lobby, a stubborn band of
moderate Republicans _ all deserve praise for holding fast. But
most of the credit belongs to President Clinton and his associates,
who showed unusual consistency in sticking to earlier threats to
veto any bill containing these measures.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Western senators and like-minded House members
who for years have used legislative sneak attacks to cripple
environmental laws were largely put to flight. Riders that would
have undermined science-based management of the national forests,
allowed oil companies to escape certain royalty payments, derailed
an important grizzly bear recovery program and weakened new
environmental regulations governing mining operations were
eliminated from the Interior appropriations bill. Another rider
allowing mining companies to dump more waste on public lands was
substantially mitigated.
</P>
<P>
   No less important was the defeat of three other riders that
emerged in the last days of the congressional session and
threatened briefly to torpedo a final budget agreement. A veto
threat killed an amendment that would have delayed, perhaps
fatally, an administration plan to put 40 million acres of the
national forests off limits to road building. Strenuous objections
from Northeastern Republicans, plus another veto threat, derailed a
rider that would have blocked a federal lawsuit aimed at collecting
heavy fines from dirty coal-fired power plants in the Midwest that
have violated the Clean Air Act by failing to install pollution
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also crucial to the defeat of a third
last-minute amendment, this one sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., one of the most powerful Democrats in the Senate. His
rider would have overturned a recent court decision prohibiting
mining companies from dumping mountaintop waste into valleys and
streams in defiance of the federal Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   When the White House seemed slow to respond, the Republicans _
including Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Rick Lazio of New York _
pointed out the hypocrisy involved in allowing a prominent Democrat
to assault the same environmental laws that the White House was so
staunchly defending against Republicans. The White House then
stiffened its resolve, and the Byrd rider effectively died.
</P>
<P>
   The administration did not win every battle, but those it lost
were relatively minor and mostly fixable in the future. It also
allowed the Alaskan congressional delegation to shower itself with
money for local projects, a small price to pay for winning the
consent of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the leader of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, to most of its budget requests. Only a
few weeks ago, Clinton's Lands Legacy program, including money for
the Land and Water Conservation Fund and vital projects like the
restoration of the Everglades, was in tatters. By Friday, the White
House had persuaded congressional negotiators to restore most of
what the House and Senate had originally cut from its important
land acquisition programs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the White House had more success on the environmental
front this year than at any time since the big budget battles of
1995. A president who stuck to his word from beginning to end had a
lot to do with that outcome.

NEW YORK, CITY OF BROTHERLY GREED? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most cities have a burnished story of creation, some
hoary tale of heroism and principle that swells the chests of their
citizens as they strut down historic streets past Starbucks and The
Gap. Take Philadelphia; founded on the premise of religious
tolerance, its very name evokes fraternal love.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is New York. Crass, uncouth, grubby New York.
</P>
<P>
   As the recent PBS documentary ``New York'' demonstrates, this
city was founded largely on the premise of making a buck. While
Providence, R.I., proudly remembers the meeting between Roger
Williams and the Narragansett Indians that led to its becoming a
haven of tolerance, New York recalls how Peter Minuit bought
Manhattan Island from local Indians for a Dutch song.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Minuit paid $24, possibly in beads and
trinkets. Historians say the price was closer to $600. Either way,
it was ``the operative moment of New York as a real-estate deal,
and that hasn't changed,'' said Peter Quinn, a historian and
writer. ``Donald Trump would have tried to pay $22.''
</P>
<P>
   Children do not re-enact the Minuit moment in school plays,
perhaps because it is hard to imagine celebrating a development
deal that enshrined capitalism _ some would say ``greed'' _ as the
primary force in the city's growth and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that Americans and even New Yorkers are
entirely comfortable with,'' said James Sanders, an architect and
author who wrote the documentary with Ric Burns. ``It's not really
democracy and Mom and apple pie. It's something to be skeptical
about, capitalism and greed. It is a funny connection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the connection between New York and the pursuit of wealth is
as complex as it is odd. Some of the historians featured in the
documentary suggest a cause-and-effect link between capitalism and
several significant social advances, including the establishment of
housing, health and zoning codes. Others say the documentary
overstates that connection, and that many factors _ not just the
quest for profit _ made New York a pioneer in social reform.
</P>
<P>
   So New York was established as a money-making venture. So it
took settlers a few years to erect a church. So what? Boston was
founded by English Puritans, but Quakers who thought that meant
religious freedom were sometimes hanged for their
misinterpretation. And historians generally agree with the
documentary's point that New York's crass beginnings contributed to
a kind of no-nonsense tolerance that continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some level, everyone is equalized in the sense of: `What
can you do for me? I don't want to be your friend; let's just do
business,''' Sanders said. But that rather cold demeanor can be
interpreted another way, he said: ``I don't need to be your friend.
I don't care what color you are, what your religion is or what your
politics are. But if you put up the cash, we'll do some business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crass beginnings of New York really did work to its
advantage,'' said Carol Berkin, a professor of history at Baruch
College. ``If you have the wrong ideology, it's better to have no
ideology at all. Maybe you don't want to write an epic poem about a
place where you can make a buck. But given the alternative, it made
it more tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, history is more complicated in real time than when it
is poked and analyzed generations later. Beware grand abstractions
and theoretical concepts, advised Mike Wallace, the co-author of a
Pulitzer Prize-winning history of New York called ``Gotham''
(Oxford University Press, 1999) and one of the documentary's
prominent figures. ``Events on the ground are never so clear and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with New York. For example, it is true that soon after
establishing the village of New Amsterdam _ later called New York _
in the early 17th century, the Dutch founders accepted people from
many cultures. And it is true that the community's leader, Peter
Stuyvesant, was overruled by superiors in Holland when he proposed
banishing Jews from the colony; think of the higher goal of profit,
they suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But those days were not all handshakes over piles of guilders.
``If you are talking about the Dutch being willing to accept a
variety of cultures,'' Wallace said, ``the Dutch were also
perfectly prepared to enslave zillions of people if that were the
way to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The British ousted the Dutch in the late 17th century, and
American colonists ousted the British after the Revolutionary War.
But while the flags overhead changed, the businesses on the ground
continued to grow: banking, shipping and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   One event was overtaken by the next. Alexander Hamilton struck a
deal that solidified New York as the country's financial center. A
grid of intersecting streets was built. The Erie Canal was
completed, simplifying the movement of goods between the Midwest
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1830s, the city saw fit to create a financial district on
Wall Street to which people commuted. ``It is the first time in
human history that a district is devoted to the single purpose of
commerce,'' Sanders said. ``Nobody lives there. And that's a new
way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunes were made in bull markets, lost in bear markets, and
forgotten by the next bull market. The affluent built town houses
and mansions in the ever-expanding uptown, while the poor blacks
and Irish immigrants congregated in the Five Points, a
foul-smelling sinkhole of a district _ near today's Foley Square _
with unpaved roads, run-down buildings and occasional epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's chapter on this period is aptly called
``Sunshine and Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, among others, sees the natural tension between these
extreme forms of economic life in New York as setting the stage for
the social reforms to come. ``That's where you have greed and the
resistance to greed playing out,'' he said. ``New York was the most
economically advanced state in America. That's why you had the
labor movement and the social-reform movement existing here, but
not existing in other places in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the political machine known as Tammany
Hall converted the anger of poor Irish and German immigrants into
votes that allowed it to control and corrupt city government (``I
seen my opportunities and I took 'em,'' a Tammany leader, George
Washington Plunkitt, once said). In exchange, Tammany's operatives
provided jobs and fought anti-Catholic movements. Later, to secure
the support of the new wave of Jewish and Italian immigrants, it
backed significant social legislation to improve the conditions of
working people.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace argues that an alternative vision for New York dates
back to the early 19th century, when some people contended that the
rich came perilously close to resembling the aristocracy that
existed under British rule. And the city has always been a haven
for radicals and rebels, from Tom Paine to the architects of the
Cuban revolution. That environment, he suggests, played an
important role in creating a sense of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is based on the notion that people are entitled, by virtue
of their citizenship, to certain rights,'' Wallace said. ``They are
entitled to decent housing, public health, free education.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A concept emerges from the streets of New York that is somewhat
foreign to the rest of the world, historians say. Simply put: With
profit there must come social justice.
</P>
<P>
   But reform was more theory than practice; the arguments of an
economic reformer named Henry George failed to persuade the city to
elect him mayor in 1886. The city had millionaires by the score,
and conditions in tenements that Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of
history at Columbia University, suggests in the documentary were
``as bad as anything ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the documentary suggests, seminal moments in the arc of
New York fostered institutionalized change. Jacob Riis' stirring
photographs of life in Five Points in the late 1880s shamed city
elders into developing housing codes for tenements. A fire at the
Triangle Shirtwaist factory in 1911 killed 146 women in 15 minutes;
the tragedy led to broader powers for the Fire Department to ensure
factory safety, and bolstered the labor movement's drive for
organizing factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   More than before, the city began to blaze trails in social
reform. ``New York becomes an example of a liberal democracy,''
said Jackson, the editor of The Encyclopedia of New York (Yale
University Press, 1995). ``It learns that you can't let capitalism
run completely amok. You have to take care of the people who get
trampled along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Sanders put it: ``New York is one of the first to realize
that capitalism wasn't enough''.
</P>
<P>
   The first five parts of the documentary ended last week by
focusing on the Great Depression, which taught New York yet again
about the dangers of unfettered greed. The sixth and final episode
will not air until early next year. But Sanders and others said the
last 70 years would continue to reflect a city trying to strike the
proper balance between capitalism and the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Several pointed to the demolition of the ornate Pennsylvania
Station in 1965 as an example of the city failing to find that
balance, of paying the price for wanting everything bigger and
better. But in the continuing evolution of its municipal
conscience, the city soon created a Landmarks Preservation
Commission that led the successful fight, years later, to save
Grand Central Station from the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the historian John Steele Gordon said, ``Penn
Station died for our sins.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the paradox of New York continues. In Manhattan, the rich
rent FAO Schwarz overnight for pajama parties for their children,
and the ex-wife of a billionaire, Ronald Perelman, says in divorce
court that she spends $3,175 a month on clothing for their
4-year-old daughter. In Queens, immigrants _ from Guatemala,
Eastern Europe, Pakistan _ cram together in illegally subdivided
houses. Some spend their days selling flowers on the street, or
hawking batteries on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Czitrom, one of the historians featured in the
documentary, grew up in the Bronx and drove a taxi in the city

MEN'S TENNIS MAY SOON HAVE AN ENDING THAT SATISFIES ALL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a promotional slogan, ``The Race to Hanover'' never quite had
the power to convince. First of all and with all due respect to the
fine citizens of Hanover, the only people usually in a hurry to get
to their city are Ruhr business executives who are late for a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly Paris or London or New York or even Melbourne, the
least cosmopolitan of tennis' Grand Slam cities.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, for the final time, the world's top eight men's
tennis players, or rather the world's top eight healthy men's
tennis players (not quite the same thing these days), will be in
Hanover to play and be pampered at the ATP Tour's year-end
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this event is the ATP Tour World
Championship, but that grandiose title has long smacked of false
advertising. Since it started in 1990 in another German city,
Frankfurt, this round-robin event has never had the clout to claim
supremacy, not when there are at least four other events that
matter much more to the players and the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the encouraging news is that the ATP Tour's ultimate event
is about to get better, and that the ATP Tour _ a relatively weak
product minus the Grand Slams _ appears likely to get better along
with it. Beginning next year, the tour championship will resume
being an itinerant event, just as the season-ending tournament
known as the Masters was from 1970 to 1976 before settling in New
York for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the ATP championship will be played in Lisbon,
Portugal. In 2001, it will move to Sao Paulo, Brazil, which,
assuming that Gustavo Kuerten remains a vibrant force, should make
for quite an atmosphere. The idea is then to continue to shift the
locale every year, and though that will create logistical
nightmares for the organizers, it is a good idea for improving the
event's appeal. Moreover, a long-overdue agreement seems imminent
between the ATP Tour and the International Tennis Federation to
merge the event with the Grand Slam Cup, the tournament held in
Munich that is long on money but short on relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions have continued for three years, but this year, if
the numbers crunch comfortably, a merger could be announced as
early as this week. ``We've tried and failed on a couple attempts
to get it over the line, but this time there seems to be more
enthusiasm,'' said Larry Scott, the ATP Tour's chief operating
officer. ``I think the timing is good.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing is good because the Grand Slam Cup is, for the
moment, without a site for next year and because the petty rivalry
between the ITF, which controls the Grand Slam tournaments and the
Davis Cup, and the ATP, which controls the workaday men's tour, has
evolved into something resembling cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The ITF created the Grand Slam Cup in 1990 as a counterweight to
the players' decision to break away and form the ATP Tour. The top
performers in the Grand Slam events qualified to play and the
winner was paid $2 million, a shocking figure at the time. Philippe
Chatrier, an able Frenchman who was the ATP president then, spent
the rest of his career regretting it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pete Sampras, then 19, won the first edition in
1990, it has become clear over the years that the stars treat it as
an easy payday, not a meaningful title. The Grand Slam Cup awards
no ranking points because the ATP Tour, which controls the ranking,
has no desire to sanction a competing event with points. ``It's a
little extra Christmas money,'' Sampras once said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam Cup organizers countered by changing the event's date
from December to September in 1997, and then added women to the mix
in 1998. Now, the ITF seems ready to get rid of the event
altogether, and throw its resources _ and the vital $2 million it
generates for the game's development worldwide _ in with the ATP.
The women will have to go their own way for a while, but they
already have a fine year-end championship in New York. Men's tennis
does not need two such events: not with an already cluttered
calendar and the increasing physical demands on top players.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the ATP could allow the Grand Slam champions to
qualify automatically for the merged version in whatever form it
ultimately takes: round robin, eight-man knockout draw or 16-man
knockout draw. After all, in the past decade, only three players
who won Grand Slam titles failed to qualify for the ATP
championship: Andre Agassi in 1992, Kuerten in 1997 and Petr Korda
in 1998. When it is done making that concession, the ATP could then
join with the ITF and do more good for the game: create, say, a
third week for grass-court tennis between the French Open and
Wimbledon; or find a way to end the season in early November
instead of early December, and work to showcase the Davis Cup, a
potentially transcendent event that has become an addendum to the
schedule, occupying the week after Key Biscayne in 1999 and the
Australian Open in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What must not be forgotten is that the tennis matters when the
best players compete, and that the public understands what matters.
With only one tour finale to play for, each player will start at
zero in January and fans will be able to follow the points race to
No. 1, which next year will be ``the Race to Lisbon.''

FEW CLUES IN BRICK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas) (lh) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detectives began showing thousands of photographs of
violence-prone criminals to six witnesses Saturday in an effort to
identify the man who critically injured a 27-year-old Midtown
office worker with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief William Taylor Jr., the commander of Manhattan
detectives, reported the photographic search at the same time as he
noted that more than 180 leads in the investigation had so far come
up dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no limit to the resources we can get on this case,
but we need more help,'' from anyone else who saw any part of the
attack, he said in a telephone interview Saturday. ``Someone out
there must have seen something'' that none of the six witnesses the
police have found saw, and that could be helpful in the search, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Nicole Barrett, a native of Athens, Texas, was
struck from behind on Tuesday afternoon with no warning and for no
apparent reason as she was about to cross Madison Avenue at 42nd
Street in the middle of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Ms. Barrett, who moved with a friend to New York
last year, remained in critical condition. The police do not
believe she saw enough to identify her attacker. They have turned
to the public for help, distributing posters with a sketch of the
suspect based on the six witnesses' descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the attacker may be homeless, so they have
concentrated on interviewing residents of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   They have also interviewed parolees in the city and in
Westchester County who have been arrested for violating parole or
for committing other crimes and fit the witnesses' description.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that because little more is known now than
immediately after the attack, he was bringing the six witnesses
together to examine photographs of criminals who resembled the
sketch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search isn't limited to the homeless, or even the mentally
disturbed. We are looking for anyone who has a propensity for
violence,'' he said. ``We have shown the witnesses a limited
selection of photographs already, but now we will take a more
extensive grouping.''

 &HT;    New rules ending race-based admissions in Fla. lead way for
South
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida has painted the latest stroke in the complex
mosaic of attempting to end racial segregation in university
admissions while also abolishing the controversial quotas designed
to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Board of Regents on Friday adopted Gov. Jeb Bush's
proposal to eliminate race as a factor in admissions, but the new
rules, which may be in effect by next fall, also would broaden
admissions criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush promoted unity under his ``One Florida''
initiative, affirmative action proponents said the plan is a
backward step on the path to higher education for minorities,
especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the moral imperative in this country to level the
playing field,'' said Ansley Abraham of the Southern Regional
Education Board, an Atlanta-based policy research group. ``It sends
the wrong kind of message at a time when the nation should be
concerned with making sure students are going on to college and the
climate for minority students is inviting.'' But the overhaul is
unlikely to bring about immediate changes in the way colleges admit
students elsewhere in the South. Several states in the region are
under court order to desegregate their public university systems or
face civil complaints on racial issues: _ The University of Georgia
still gives weight to prospective black applicants in its admission
policy. That's become the basis for a class-action lawsuit by four
white females who claim males and blacks gained admission
preference over them.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Alabama, a federal court ordered the state to spend at
least $100 million over 15 years to improve programs at
historically black schools. That means a pair of new advanced
degree programs at Alabama State University. It also means money
for white scholarships at historically black Alabama A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Louisiana, the state reached a federal settlement in 1994
and pledged $48 million for new programs at three historically
black institutions. One of them, Southern University at Baton
Rouge, is working on cooperative research programs with Louisiana
State University, the state's flagship school.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Mississippi, black Ole Miss student Jake Ayers sued in 1975
for a more equitable system of higher learning. The case rose to
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and became the nationwide basis for
ordering that the vestiges of previously segregated college systems
be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Tennessee, as part of a 1984 court settlement, the state
formed a committee to report annually on desegregation efforts. The
court ordered the merger of traditionally white University of
Tennessee at Nashville with Tennessee State, the only historically
black college in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, several states have contacted Bush's office for
details on his effort to eliminate race as a factor in college
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly going to give momentum to the
anti-affirmative action foes,'' said Charles E. Jones, chairman of
the African-American Studies program at Georgia State University.
``It could serve as a lightning rod, a model to be emulated. It's a
bad policy to not include race when we know it colors everything in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's executive order _ which also eliminates racial set-asides
in bidding for state contracts _ guarantees admission to state
universities for students in the top 20 percent of every Florida
high school senior class _ rich or poor _ regardless of SAT or ACT
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old solutions have become increasingly controversial and
divisive,'' Bush said. ``What is viewed as an opportunity by one
Floridian is too often correctly viewed as an unfair advantage by
another Floridian. And in the heat of the controversy, too many of
our citizens are forgetting the shared values that bind us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan wins approval from attorney Terry Pell, a member
of the conservative Center for Individual Rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pell helped persuade the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals to declare as unconstitutional a race-conscious admission
policy used by the University of Texas School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   While the jurisdiction of 5th Circuit is limited to Texas,
Louisiana and Mississippi, the case has caused universities to move
cautiously in using race-sensitive admissions in their
desegregation formulas.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where the Florida governor's brother, Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush, is governor, the
Legislature in 1997 adopted a formula similar to the one proposed
in Florida. It requires public universities to admit the top 10
percent of seniors from every Texas high school, opening a door for
students at predominantly black and Hispanic high schools who might
have been unable to compete on the basis of test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is moving very rapidly in a direction that makes it
clear race preferences are illegal when they're used,'' Pell said.
Bush has ``moved forward in a sensible way rather than wait and be
forced to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential ``something'' is the threat of a ballot question
on affirmative action forced by outsiders. Ward Connerly _ a black
businessman from California instrumental in voters there passing a
proposition that dismantled affirmative action _ has collected
enough signatures to ask the Florida Supreme Court to consider
whether Florida voters should be given a similar choice.
</P>
<P>
   Polls by The Miami Herald and the St. Petersburg Times
newspapers show Florida voters favor eliminating affirmative action
from state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend Bush actually is more concerned with
calming the political waters for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what the governor has done is deal with a problem
with what he sees as a political solution and not as sound
educational policy,'' said Robert Kronley, senior consultant for
the Southern Education Foundation, an Atlanta-based public charity
that studies equity in public education. Research by the foundation
indicates black college attendance in the South has stagnated or
declined, despite the end of segregated university systems.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's 1998 report calls race-sensitive college
admission a practice that will be ``essential if we are to increase
black access to traditionally white institutions.'' Recent court
decisions, however, have supported the argument that encouraging
campus diversity is not enough reason to consider race as an
admissions factor.
</P>
<P>
   In January, for instance, a U.S. District judge ruled
unconstitutional an admissions program used by the University of
Georgia from 1990 to 1995 that gave preference to black applicants.
University officials have said they will continue the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Georgia has done is quite courageous,'' Kronley said.
``It says they will tolerate the inconveniences and name calling .
. . because race is a compelling issue in the kind of society where
we live. Other states say we don't want that kind of heat.''

PASSING THE TORCH TO YOUNGER ARCHITECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were the youthful vanguard in 1972 when their
work was published in the influential book ``Five Architects.''
Now, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk
and Richard Meier have reached an age when retirement ordinarily
looms.
</P>
<P>
   Startling as it may seem, the ``New York Five'' are in their 60s
and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   So are many of those whose names are synonymous with
architecture in and around New York, like James Ingo Freed, Hugh
Hardy, William Pedersen, James Stewart Polshek and Robert A.M.
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation that has so much dominated architecture is
coming to the point where the baton is being passed,'' said Cesar
Pelli, 73, the designer of the Petronas Twin Towers _ the world's
tallest _ in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. No baton has changed hands yet
at Cesar Pelli &AMP; Associates in New Haven, Conn., but Pelli has two
younger partners in the wings: his son, Rafael, and Fred W. Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture is known as an old man's profession (the day is
coming when it will belong to old women, too) and no one expects
these celebrated practitioners to step away from their drafting
boards soon. But they are almost all wrestling with the question of
whether their offices will endure in the long run and how they will
function in the short run, as younger partners try to make their
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult thing, after having control for many
years and being lionized, to pass that on while you're still
healthy and active,'' said Polshek, 69. ``But the test in the end
is the vitality of the work.'' He has six partners in his practice,
the Polshek Partnership of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A firm need not vanish with its founders. The modern HLW
International is descended from the office opened by Cyrus L.W.
Eidlitz in 1885. McKim, Mead &AMP; White lasted until 1961, although
its final commission, the Museum of History and Technology at the
Smithsonian Institution, would scarcely be mistaken for a
masterpiece like Pennsylvania Station. Its successor firm is Bell
Larson Raucher of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The key is broadening a partnership while the founders are still
vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's been my name on the door, I have always
relied on my colleagues to help design and oversee our projects,''
said Graves, 65.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he expanded the ownership of Michael Graves &AMP;
Associates of Princeton, N.J., to include Karen Nichols, Patrick
Burke, Gary Lapera, Thomas Rowe, John Diebboll and Susan Howard.
``Whether I'm taking an afternoon on the golf course, or someday
end up horizontal, the firm absolutely carries on,'' Graves
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Architects have many reasons to ensure that their practices
carry on. Ego, for one. Having spent decades establishing a name
for themselves, most do not look warmly on the prospect of retiring
that name.
</P>
<P>
   The founders stand a greater chance of long-term financial
reward if their interest in the practice is bought out by partners
with a stake in a continuing business, rather than being
liquidated. And if there is a firm still in place, the older
partners do not have to worry so much about indefinite personal
liability for third-party lawsuits involving their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it may be for the founders to relinquish ownership and
control, a partnership can be a nice, crunchy carrot to dangle
before talented _ and sometimes restless _ young associates. And it
can relieve the older partners of day-to-day management headaches,
allowing them to roam more freely in the design field.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, partners in their 30s are more likely to be
comfortably conversant with computer-aided design programs at which
partners in their 60s can merely marvel. ``An older generation who
wants to survive should have younger people in the firm who are
more computer literate,'' said Peter Samton, 64, of Gruzen Samton.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing practice rewards younger architects and
administrators who have given decades to the firm but are not yet
rainmakers themselves. A link with famous partners allows them to
cultivate clients and work on high-profile jobs that gravitate
toward ``name'' architects.
</P>
<P>
   For all of these advantages, however, history suggests that the
transition from a sole proprietorship or collaborative partnership
into a long-running architectural enterprise is enormously
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a great history of that,'' Samton said. ``It's
been more a pattern of stars, or firms coming together around a
given partnership of two, three or four people, and then
disintegrating.''
</P>
<P>
   His own firm has held together. Founded in 1936 by Hugh Kelly
and Barney Gruzen, it is continued today by Samton; Barney Gruzen's
son, Jordan, 65, and five younger partners.
</P>
<P>
   Other practices have not fared so well. Marcel Breuer, the
architect of the Whitney Museum, added partners before he died in
1981 but ``didn't develop them in a way that they could continue,''
said Samton, who once worked for him. ``People felt somehow they
wouldn't get the same project if he weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   So sensitive is the issue of succession, with its intimations of
mortality, that leading partners in a number of firms declined to
be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few architects have the Peter Pan complex,'' said
Stern, who turned 60 in May. ``They can't grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern began expanding the ownership in 1988 to include Robert
Buford, who was managing the firm. Since then, he has added four
designers, Roger Seifter, Paul Whalen, Graham Wyatt and Alexander
Lamis, all in their 40s. ``If I retired at 65, which is not likely,
they'd have roughly 20 years to run the firm,'' Stern said.

<P>
   Pei Cobb Freed &AMP; Partners also turned to the 40-something
generation in April, naming the designers Ian Bader, 45, and Yvonne
Szeto, 42, to the partnership. ``This is not at all an ending of
one thing and the beginning of another,'' said Henry Cobb, ``but
rather a weaving of the first generation of this partnership with
the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the firm was once identified in the public mind almost
exclusively with I.M. Pei, it has been a partnership since its
founding in 1955 by Pei, Eason Leonard and Cobb, who designed the
John Hancock Tower in Boston. Pei retired as a partner in 1990, at
the age of 73, but continues to work on projects as a design
principal, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Freed became a partner in 1980 and was largely responsible for
the design of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Michael Flynn
and George Miller joined the partnership in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Bader grew up in South Africa and did not see the firm's work
until the '70s, when he found himself ``shocked'' by the severely
angular East Wing of the National Gallery in Washington. He
promised himself he would never work for such an architect. But he
joined in 1981 and has come to embrace what he called the firm's
poetic sensibility, its technical and analytical prowess and the
authenticity of its buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are what they represent themselves to be,'' Bader said.
He is now the design partner for the Westchester County Courthouse
in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Szeto has been with the firm 20 years and is working with
Cobb on the ABN Amro Bank headquarters in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. Under the firm's team approach, she has also worked
directly as a young architect with Pei and Freed.
</P>
<P>
   She and Bader do not envision a single design approach emerging
on their watch. ``There is a diversity of style that exists among
the founding partners,'' Ms. Szeto said. ``We would encourage that
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The public is coming to recognize the different voices of the
firm as Freed, 69, and Cobb, 73, emerge from Pei's shadow _ the
former with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and
the latter with the U.S. Courthouse in Boston. Like Pei, they have
won the prestigious Arnold W. Brunner Award from the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something poignant about the fact that both
architects now have to pass a baton they have held so briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' Freed allowed. ``Most newspapers like to
simplify and say, `It's by I.M. Pei,' that's it. That's hard to
cope with, hard to live with. It not only haunts us, it haunts
I.M., too. It haunts all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch with his partners, Cobb said he could talk about the
subject until midnight. But he was stoic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make certain choices in life,'' Cobb said. ``You make them
with your eyes open. And you live with them. You can't have a
partnership among individuals with ability and not have tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bader and Ms. Szeto face the same challenge. ``New clients
always want Harry and Jim, of course,'' she said. ``Ian and I have
to emerge from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1992, there was a second Pei generation at Pei Cobb Freed:
C.C., now 53, and his brother, L.C., 50. They left their father's
firm to open the Pei Partnership, which has designed the Bank of
China headquarters in Beijing and an academic health center for the
University of California at Los Angeles. The senior Pei plays no
formal role but ``counsels us, critiques us and has on occasion
steered us to work,'' said L.C. Pei. ``He is first of all our
father, and has an abiding interest in our success.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, one of his greatest legacies to his
sons is the name Pei. What a firm calls itself says much about the
image it is trying to project _ or change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There absolutely is tremendous value in the Robert A.M. Stern
name,'' said his oldest partner, Buford. ``When he decides to
withdraw or lower his profile, the remaining partners have a great
interest in being identified with that brand so they can carry it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn Pedersen Fox has become something of a misnomer for a firm
that now numbers 14 principals. And ``Kohn Pedersen Cioppa Louie
Polisano Leventhal Clement Katz von Klemperer Kennon Greene
Schubert Lerner Mosellie'' would be a cumbersome way to answer the
phone. So the firm has adopted KPF as a brand name; akin to HLW
(Haines Lundberg Waehler), HOK (Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum) and
SOM (Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill).
</P>
<P>
   Two of the founders, Eugene Kohn, 68, and William Pedersen, 61,
are still active. But Kohn said they are planning a transition,
consistent with their goal from the day they founded the firm _
July 4, 1976 _ that it grow beyond their ranks and continue after
their departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make that decision, as opposed to `When I'm done, the
firm's done,' the way you build the firm is much different,'' Kohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   KPF is actually a professional corporation, not a partnership,
in which the principals own stock. It is governed by an executive
committee composed of Kohn, as president of KPF; Pedersen, Robert
Cioppa, William Louie and Lee Polisano.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn anticipates the day when he turns over the presidency.
``I'll be most happy and proud when they don't need me,'' he said.
``And most disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Fox &AMP; Fowle, a steering committee meets weekly that includes
neither Robert Fox Jr. nor Bruce Fowle, who founded the firm in
1978 and still preside from back-to-back corners of the office they
share.
</P>
<P>
   The younger principals are Daniel Kaplan, who runs the
commercial studio and is the project architect of the Conde Nast
and Reuters Buildings in Times Square; Sylvia Smith, who heads the
educational and cultural studio and Michel Franck, who heads the
interiors studio. Rounding out the steering committee is Elyse
Engelhardt, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the younger principals ultimately keep the name Fox &AMP;
Fowle remains to be seen. ``I think they find the name is a brand
and they cherish it,'' said Fox. ``To tinker with it is not in
their best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially with that name,'' said Fowle. ``Unless you put a
Hare and a Hound in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The founding partners instituted a transitional plan in 1993
that calls for them to step down no later than age 72. Fowle is now
62 and Fox will be 58 next week. Meanwhile, they are gradually
shifting the spotlight to the younger cohort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we'd created a different kind of firm, this great
collaborative organization,'' Fox said. ``We didn't want to look
back, having spent 30 to 35 years creating this entity, only to
have it disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just leave and say, `OK, these guys are in charge,'''
Fowle said.
</P>
<P>
   Polshek said he and his partners _ Joseph Fleischer, Timothy
Hartung, Duncan Hazard, Richard Olcott, Susan Rodriguez and Todd
Schliemann _ discuss what role he will play on any given job:
``pilot, copilot, passenger or the guy in the control tower.''
</P>
<P>
   While Graves serves as aesthetic and spiritual leader, his
studio heads are developing identities of their own, said Ms.
Nichols, who has been at the firm since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's very eclectic in his taste and very interested in
the language of architecture,'' she said. ``For him, it's not about
style. Because it's not, he can accept and encourage the latitude
necessary for other architects to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   John Belle, 67, of Beyer Blinder Belle, said he might attend a
meeting between a client and a younger partner but say nothing
except a few introductory remarks. ``In a newer way of less is
more,'' he said, ``you can send a signal to clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm now has seven younger partners, including Margaret
Kittinger, 40, who was named earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a novelty, the succession issue goes back at
least a century. Charles McKim, William Mead and Stanford White
faced the matter in 1906 when they added three new partners to
their firm. And not a moment too soon, as White was shot dead
shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   His only son, Lawrence White, became a partner in 1919. Before
he died in 1956, the firm was chosen to design the Museum of
History and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal Mount Everest was getting this commission,''
recalled his grandson, Samuel White, an architect and founding
partner of Buttrick White &AMP; Burtis.
</P>
<P>
   The last surviving partner of McKim, Mead &AMP; White was James K.
Smith, who died in 1961. That year, four alumni of the firm _
Milton Steinmann, Alexander Corrigil, Walker Cain and Cornelius
White (no relation) _ succeeded to the practice. Steinmann, Cain &AMP;
White completed the Smithsonian project in 1964. It is now the
National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Bell joined as a partner in 1978 and the practice was
renamed Cain, Farrell &AMP; Bell. The current line-up is Bell, 64; Doug
Larson, 36, and Alice Raucher, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell has renovated McKim, Mead &AMP; White buildings like
the Century Association clubhouse on West 43rd Street, he downplays
any idea that his firm is heir to those turn-of-the-century
legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose we have some of the same sensibilities,'' he said,
``but we've never, on purpose, advertised ourselves or said we
were. It's a different time. That was a giant firm, a major force
in the world. Our firm has 10 people.'' In one small gesture to the
past, however, the firm gives its founding date as 1880 in the
directory of the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of such continuity holds no appeal to Eisenman, 67, who
remains the sole owner of his practice, though he said he regards
Richard Rosson, 46, as his likeliest successor. ``Whatever name he
chooses to put on it would be fine with me,'' Eisenman said. ``I
have no desire to have Eisenman Architects go on after my demise.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't talk to him about winding down, either. ``I'm a late
starter,'' he said. ``Those other guys have built their major works
and we're just about to do that. All these things which are going
to mark our career are yet to be done. Five years from now I'll
begin to tell you about succession.''
</P>
<P>
   Succession is not an issue either for Hejduk, 70, the oldest of
the ``New York Five,'' since he stayed away from architectural
offices in favor of teaching, writing (books and poetry) and
designing.
</P>
<P>
   His chief professional commitment is as dean of the Irwin S.
Chanin School of Architecture at Cooper Union, a post he has no
plans to give up. ``I hope to die with my boots on,'' Hejduk said.
</P>
<P>
   And lest any epitaphs be written prematurely, it is worth
turning back again to the early 1970s and recalling that the
closing essay in ``Five Architects'' was written by a 66-year-old
eminence grise of the design world. His name was Philip Johnson. He
is still practicing architecture.

<P>
   ATHENS _ President Clinton rose early Saturday, slipped on a
taupe sports shirt and a pair of brown slacks, and took his
daughter to have a look around the Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there was a little more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   There was the presidential motorcade to assemble, with aides and
doctors and press in tow.
</P>
<P>
   There were the riot police, the soldiers and the plain clothes
cops to line the streets, blanket the sidewalks and infiltrate the
stands of olive trees surrounding the ancient site.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire Acropolis had to be shut down, along with the
road leading to it from Clinton's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   No one sees the world in quite the same way as the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there are times when the First Tourist has much in
common with fellow travelers anywhere who battle fatigue, contend
with the elements and struggle with the puzzles of a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   And so, there was the most powerful man on Earth, a bit
bleary-eyed after a week on the road, tilting a green umbrella
nearly sideways as a buffer from the wind and rain, and straining
to hear what his guide had to say about 3,000 years of Grecian
architecture and art.
</P>
<P>
   He was, said Greek Minister of Culture Elizabeth Papazoe, the
ideal tourist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was perfect,'' she said, ``deeply interested in this
culture and in the monuments and, of course, the history that comes
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   History gets no better than the Acropolis, a towering peak _
it's name means ``the high city'' in Greek _ that's been inhabited
since the Neolithic age. By the time the Greeks built their marble
monument to Classical deities and design, the Parthenon, there
nearly 25 centuries ago, they were already piling stone upon the
ruins of ancient cultures that came before.
</P>
<P>
   To the leader of currently the world's sole superpower, the ebb
and flow of empire washing over the Acropolis must have summoned
some sobering thoughts. He paused now and then to let the weight of
history sink in, shaking his head now and then at the splendid
irony of it all.
</P>
<P>
   He doubtless pondered the ancient regional rivalries near the
heart of modern animosities he's sought to quell among Greeks and
Turks, Muslims and Serbs, Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   And he was moved, he later said, just to gaze out from the great
hill upon the cradle of Western democracy below, the city where
Socrates taught, Plato wrote and the foundations of global
citizenship were laid.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A good part of any journey, though, involves spotting the simple
amid the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton set aside ruminations on empire and civilization
to linger before a segment of stone roofing that has survived more
than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting, those water spouts up there,'' Clinton said
to his guide, professor John Camp of Randolph-Macon College in
Ashland, Va. ``I've always wondered how those buildings managed the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   He strolled with his daughter, Chelsea, holding her hand and
smiling proudly at her inherited instinct for inquiry, as the two
tread gingerly over rain-slicked marble walkways worn jewel smooth
by the patient footsteps of time.
</P>
<P>
   Still there came that inevitable moment that arises on even the
best of trips, when Clinton felt the exhaustion and saturation of
travel begin to take its toll. And so, setting aside the majesty of
the moment, he let out a deep breath, stretched one arm toward his
guide and asked ``Now where are we going?''

   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia _ It has become a hauntingly familiar
drama in Indonesia: families huddling on a windswept pier or in a
crowded bus station, fleeing a home that has become too dangerous
as old grievances give rise to explosive separatist passions.
</P>
<P>
   The last time it was East Timor, which voted for independence
from Indonesia in August only to be plunged into bloodshed that
required an Australian-led international military force to quell.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Aceh (pronounced ah-CHAY), a lush, devoutly Islamic
province that lies on the extreme western edge of the Indonesian
archipelago and would like nothing more than to break away from the
central government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes stoked by the secession of East Timor and by remarks
by Indonesia's new president that Aceh too should be given the
chance to decide its future, a half-million people rallied recently
in front of the luminous white mosque in this provincial capital to
demand a referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesia, Aceh is the fire next time _ a crisis that, even
more than East Timor, could determine whether the central
government can hold this staggeringly diverse and far-flung nation
together. Unlike East Timor, Aceh's status within Indonesia has
never been challenged by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could lead to the disintegration of Indonesia,'' said
Eugene K. Galbraith, an expert on Indonesia and the former head of
Asian research at ABN Amro Bank. ``There are several other restive
provinces, from Sulawesi to Irian Jaya, which would take their cue
from Aceh.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior military leaders last week began calling for martial law
to be declared in parts of Aceh, where they claim that rising
separatist activity is leading to violence and civil unrest.
Thousands of non-Acehnese are fleeing the province, fearful that
they could become targets of groups that want to purge the place of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   They huddled under a merciless morning sun here, their
belongings packed into boxes that form lonely encampments across a
sprawling pier. The families grabbed food, clothing and television
sets. A faded teddy bear was lashed to one of the boxes with an
electrical cord. The ferry did not leave for five hours, but these
people were desperate to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to escape what's going to happen here,'' said Yetti
Samsul, 45, who has lived in the province for nine years but is
fleeing to the Sumatran city of Medan. ``No one can guarantee our
safety. There is a feeling of fear in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Samsul, who is from neighboring North Sumatra, said she was
afraid of being singled out, even though her in-laws are from Aceh.
``If the people don't get what they want, things will get much
worse here,'' she said. ``They will take it out on people from
other parts of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aceh is only one of several centrifugal forces tugging at
Indonesia, experts believe its secession would be particularly
corrosive to its national unity.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to East Timor, which was a Portuguese colony that
Jakarta invaded and subjugated in 1975, Aceh played a vigorous role
in the establishment of the Indonesian republic in 1945. Its
soldiers are renowned for their bravery in the struggle against the
Dutch colonists.
</P>
<P>
   A Muslim sultanate since the 16th century, Aceh has a long
history of rebellion. The Acehnese consider themselves culturally
and to some extent ethnically different from other Indonesians. In
the years after World War II they began to resist control from
Jakarta and in 1961 Aceh was designated a special territory with
autonomy in religion, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh's loyalty was frayed during decades of shabby treatment by
the government. The province has some of Indonesia's richest
natural resources, including vast oil and natural-gas fields, which
people here say Jakarta has plundered. The Indonesian military
moved into Aceh in 1989 to quell the growing unrest over economic
issues. Human rights groups say the troops have committed a catalog
of abuses, ranging from intimidation and abductions to rapes and
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aceh has been left behind economically and abused
politically,'' said Yacob Hamzah, the director of the Legal Aid
Society in Lhokseumawe, an industrial city south of here that is a
hotbed of separatist activity. ``Why would we want to be part of a
country that treats us like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Aceh's latest push for independence began with the fall of
President Suharto in May 1998 and accelerated after the referendum
in East Timor. But it really caught fire following recent remarks
by Indonesia's new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Shortly after he
was elected last month, Wahid declared unexpectedly that he
supported a referendum on independence for Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has reaffirmed that view several times since, though he
now adds that it is his own opinion rather than government policy.
Still, for the people of Aceh, it has become a rallying cry. The
word referendum is spray-painted on roads and houses throughout the
territory. It hangs from banners and flags, and comes up in every
conversation with an Acehnese, whether a guerrilla or a government
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur raised very large hopes for the Acehnese people,''
said Nasir Zalba, the head of public affairs for the provincial
government, using Wahid's commonly used nickname. ``If he were to
go back on his word, there would be an even greater demand for
independence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here said it was hard to guess the
president's real intentions. Soon after he made his remarks about a
referendum, Wahid left for a trip to the United States and Japan,
where he received statements of support for a unified Indonesia
from President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that Wahid is trying to keep both sides
off balance: the military, which fiercely opposes a referendum that
would lead to independence, and the pro-independence forces in
Aceh, which include students, human rights groups, Muslim leaders,
and the Free Aceh Movement, an armed rebel group that has been
skirmishing with the army in the jungles of Aceh since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Free Aceh Movement acknowledge that some of
their members have driven non-Acehnese people out of the province.
But they reject a comparison to the pro-Jakarta militias in East
Timor _ roving bands of armed men who attacked and killed hundreds
of pro-independence voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying very hard not to let this escalate,'' said
Nasrullah Dahlawy, a spokesman for the rebel group. ``Of course, we
cannot control all our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of outsiders illustrates one of the nettlesome
challenges facing the pro-independence forces in Aceh. While they
are united in the goal of freeing themselves from Jakarta, they
disagree stridently on how to do it. Muhammad Nazar, the head of a
coalition of 50 pro-independence student groups, said he opposed
the Free Aceh Movement's use of violence to achieve independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our struggle is based on democracy, mediation, peace, and
justice,'' said Nazar, an intense 26-year-old who majored in Arabic
literature at the local university.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Aceh Movement has deep roots in the villages, where its
fighters move from house to house to evade Indonesian soldiers.
Abdullah Syafie, the commander of the rebel forces, leaves little
doubt that he is ready to use force to win Aceh's freedom. Syafie,
who wears a crisply pressed camouflage uniform and whips out his
own tape recorder for interviews, said his troops were ready for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can solve this peacefully through diplomacy,'' said
Syafie, as he sat cross-legged beneath a Free Aceh flag in a
hideout 10 miles off the main road. ``But if we can't, we might
have to wage a military campaign. We hope it doesn't come to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what sort of diplomatic proposals the guerrillas
or the students are offering. Both want a referendum, which must
include the option of independence, and both want it soon. Some
analysts here say the pro-independence forces need a more nuanced
strategy if they hope to make headway with Wahid, whose erratic
pronouncements mask a shrewd political tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers said local Islamic leaders could act as a bridge
to Wahid, who came to prominence as a Muslim leader and is the head
of Indonesia's largest Muslim group. The role of Islam is a wild
card in Aceh's future. Jakarta recently allowed the province to
adopt elements of Islamic law, and there is spirited debate here
about whether an independent Aceh should be an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few people here have much of an idea of what an
Acehnese state would look like. In part, this is because the
independence movement is still young. But it is also because Aceh
lacks home-grown leaders of the stature of Jose Ramos-Horta or
Xanana Gusmao in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, some people here believe Indonesia can
mollify Aceh without granting it independence. They say Jakarta
must start by shipping back more of the money made here. In 1999,
Aceh will generate more than $1 billion in revenue from exports of
oil and gas. Yet the central government will return less than 10
percent of that in the form of funding for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy of the government is not to give a penny, because
if you give a penny, people will ask for more,'' said Zainul
Arifin, the vice chairman of Aceh's Investment Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, people here say Jakarta must make amends
for the conduct of the military by prosecuting soldiers accused of
atrocities. Human rights groups estimate that the army is
responsible for the killings of 1,321 people from 1989 to 1998, the
period of greatest military presence here. Wahid has ordered the
army to cut the number of troops in Aceh to 5,000 from 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the army's leaders acknowledge that it remains feared and
distrusted. ``To get the people's trust back is going to be very
hard, and it is going to be even harder now that the military is in
a defensive position,'' said Lt. Col. Iro Suparmo, the deputy
commander of military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the hurdles to independence for Aceh, none is more
daunting than the military. The army is deeply invested here, and
analysts said it was inconceivable that it would tolerate a repeat
of East Timor. The government overrode the army's objections in
allowing a referendum there. And when the East Timorese voted to
separate, the military helped orchestrate the campaign of violence
and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Army leaders are quick to note that Aceh is not another Timor _
not least because the international community recognizes it as a
province of Indonesia. But they warn darkly that Aceh will become a
dangerous place if the army is forced to retreat. As for
independence, Suparmo said, ``Aceh is like Indonesia's oldest son.
It is very hard to let your oldest son go.''

IN DENVER, NOSTALGIA IN A NEW $50 MILLION ENCLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MINDY SINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For more than a century, the Elitch Gardens Amusement
Park was a place where families gathered for summer entertainment,
picnics or just a stroll. Now, as houses replace roller coasters on
the old site, the developers hope those traditions will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great phrase that the best cities have one foot in
nostalgia, and one foot in prophecy,'' said Jonathan Rose, a
developer based in Katonah, N.Y., who has joined a Denver developer
and restaurateur, Chuck Perry, to form Perry/Affordable Housing
Development Corp. ``Some part of them reaches back to their past
and the other to their future, and we really tried to do that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Rose bought the old amusement park site last year,
four years after it had closed, and are building a $50 million
mixed-use project there called Highlands' Garden Village. It is
scheduled for completion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The property, about three miles northwest of downtown Denver, is
the first of three large mixed-use developments to go into
construction here. The others are to be at the former Stapleton
Airport and the old Lowry Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three homes are occupied and two dozen are under
construction at Highlands' Garden Village. Later, stores and
offices are to be built within walking distance of the homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the site are two remnants of the amusement
park's glory days _ the historic theater and the carousel house,
which are to be restored. To date, 25 of the 31 detached houses in
the first phase have been sold, with prices ranging from $200,000
to more than $300,000. The architect is Wolff-Lyon of nearby
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Following a master plan created by Calthorpe Associates of
Berkeley, Calif., Highlands' Garden Village is designed to make the
new homes and buildings blend in with the older, existing
neighborhood around the site of the old amusement park, where
family-owned shops and restaurants are within walking distance of
the homes _ an element that Rose and Perry are now trying to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the development's 51 houses will face existing homes
outside the perimeter of the site. Like them, they will have a
traditional look, with front porches and garages in the rear,
reached from alleys between the houses. Some will have attached
carriage houses with separate entrances above the garage, which may
be used as rental apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In later phases of the project, there will be a three-story
housing complex with 63 apartments for the elderly; an
eight-building, 90-unit apartment complex; 37 row houses and 90,000
square feet of commercial space. There will also be large areas of
open space for community gardens and parks, a day-care center and
possibly 23 live/work areas that are expected to be for artists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan calls for a 34-unit co-housing complex _
where families live in their own homes but are clustered together
and share maintenance chores, child-care and meal preparation. The
co-housing units are to have one to four bedrooms, and be priced
from $140,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Elitch Gardens Amusement Park opened in 1890 on a broad hill
that was considered remote from the bustling downtown at the time.
It offered the public everything from botanical gardens to wild
animals and thrill rides to big-name entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Elitch's left in 1994, it left a hole in the
neighborhood,'' said Perry, whose home and restaurant are nearby.
``There was a lot of uncertainty and concern about what would
happen. This was not considered a `hot' neighborhood then. It has
always been primarily working-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the development process involved meeting with community
groups and residents who had endured long summers listening to the
shrieks of riders on the Twister, the roller coaster at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the developers kept the good elements _ the theater,
the gardens, the parks _ and it's no loss at all losing the
amusement park,'' said Mary Riffle, who has lived across the street
for 30 years. The developers plan three acres of parks and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the project is actually a leftover from the
park _ the historic octagonal two-story theater that was not only
the United States' longest-surviving summer-stock showcase, but
also the place where the first movies were shown in Denver and
where stars such as Grace Kelly and Sarah Bernhardt appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Perry/AHDC is trying to find a nonprofit organization
that will renovate and run the theater with cultural events such as
films, music festivals or plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a love and almost mysticism attached to this
theater,'' Rose said. ``What could we replace it with that could be
any better? A shopping center? There's nothing we could do that
would be better than this. These buildings come with such a
heritage of goodwill that we can build upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Another remnant from the old park that has been incorporated
into the design is the old carousel house, which will now serve as
a gazebo near the restored ``diagonal park'' and the day-care
center. The carousel itself _ along with most of the rides from
Elitch's _ was moved in 1995 when the owners relocated closer to
downtown Denver in the Platte River Valley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And there are other, less obvious, vestiges of days gone by.
Elitch's was known as much for its gardens as for the Tilt-a-Whirl.
Rose proudly points out that the honeylocust trees next to one of
the completed houses had been moved within the park. Tulip bulbs
were saved and will be replanted throughout the development in
gardens and along walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Although the novelty of the site's history makes it intriguing,
it is actually the smallest of three similar projects being
developed in east Denver. One is at the former Stapleton Airport
site on 4,700 acres, which is expected to have a mix of 12,000
residences and 17 million square feet of office and retail space.
The third is at the old Lowry Air Force base on 1,866 acres, which
is expected to have 4,000 homes and apartments and 2 million square
feet of office and retail space.
</P>
<P>
   All the developments are likely to include schools and grocery
stores, and there is a plan for a church at the former Stapleton
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Rose considers these projects the recycling of previously
developed land. ``We're not reducing the supply of farmland, we're
not destroying a forest, we're working where there's existing
land,'' he said. ``We're also working on existing infrastructure. A
huge amount of environmental impact comes from the creation of new
roads and new water and sewer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose is a son of the late Frederick Rose, who was chairman of
Rose Associates, a major owner-developer of housing in New York
City. He left the family business in 1989 and now divides his time
between his home office in Katonah and the Rocky Mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I started my business here, which is affordable
housing, it was very difficult to do development work on the East
Coast, because of the recession,'' he said. ``I had done some work
in Santa Fe, and I love the Rocky Mountains, physically, the
environment, the taste of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Perry did their first project together in 1993, when
they redeveloped the Denver Dry Goods building in the 16th Street
Mall downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The once-crumbling 104-year-old former department store now has
51 loft residences mixed with office space and a large retail space
on the ground floor. The Denver Urban Renewal Authority extended
partial financing both to that project and to Highlands' Garden
Village.

 &HT;    Protestors at School of the Americas draws thousands
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ At Fort Benning's front gates Saturday,
thousands of protestors sang, chanted slogans and listened to
speakers demand that the Army's School of the Americas be shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   The school trains Latin American soldiers and teaches police
combat and terror tactics. Some SOA graduates have been implicated
in atrocities, protestors said.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers from Latin American countries told stories of
death and torture at the hands of SOA-trained military.
</P>
<P>
   Rufina Amaya, sole survivor of the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El
Salvador, told how soldiers slaughtered her entire village of 1,100
men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya drew gasps from the crowd as she told her story through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed four of my children: my 9-year-old, my 6-year-old,
my 3-year-old and my 8-month-old. My husband too was killed. I
spent seven days and nights alone in the hills with nothing to eat
or drink. I couldn't find anyone else; the soldiers had killed
everyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials acknowledge that some graduates have been
involved in atrocities but say blaming the School of the Americas
for that violence would be akin to blaming Harvard University for
the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the protest, now in its 10th year, said they are
expecting 10,000 people here for today's ritual, ``crossing the
line'' onto the base. About half of them, carrying crosses with
names of victims of violence in Latin America, will march onto the
base. They will likely be detained by military police, herded onto
waiting buses, taken off the base and released. But Roy Bourgeois,
founder of the SOA Watch, which is organizing the event, said they
aren't certain what to expect when marchers cross the line onto the
base.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers are being asked to attend nonviolence training classes
that were being conducted at a downtown theatre.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a former protestor carrying press credentials for a
Guatemala news agency was arrested when he ventured onto the base.
Johnathon Moeller of Oberlin, Ohio, had been permanently banned
from the base after crossing the line during 1997's protest,
according to SOA Watch spokeswoman Heather Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said Moeller drove onto the base with his press credentials
and was stopped at a checkpoint by military police. When MPs found
his name on a list of those people banned from entering the base,
they handcuffed Moeller and briefly took him into custody before
letting him go.
</P>
<P>
   Two other protestors, who also had been permanently banned, were
detained after a charter bus on which they were traveling drove
onto the base by mistake. The bus was attempting to turn around
when MPs stopped it and removed the two, according to SAO Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Army refused to confirm either incident.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeios dismissed recent statements by Army Secretary Louis
Caldera that he is considering changing the school's name and
course offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that the combat courses are remaining. That can never
be. This school has always been about men with guns, about
violence, about death. They are still holding on to the guns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois said the opposition movement will only grow in numbers
until the school is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors ranged from grandmothers to elementary school age
students, from veterans to pacifists. Many slept in tents or on
bare earth. Dedicated and determined, they came from throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McNaulty of Long Island, N.Y., was back this year after
serving time in a federal penitentiary in 1998 for entering the
base after being banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes times when you put your body on the line,''
McNaulty explained.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Hermsen-Wieland, 20, an Ohio college student, came with
about 80 other students from Oberlin College because, she said,
someone has to.
</P>

wages and to kees News Service

 &HT;    Climbing back after past mistakes
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sexual harassment. Drug addiction. Fraud. Theft. DUI:
a few key words you don't want showing up on your resume.
</P>
<P>
   But if your work history is stained by one of these issues, then
what?
</P>
<P>
   Though they are serious strikes against you, these legal,
ethical and moral breaches don't have to mark the end of a career,
say experts in recruitment and career counseling. With honest
disclosure of bygone difficulties and savvy use of references, it
is possible to recover from an imperfect past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take heart,'' says Marilyn Moats Kennedy, managing partner at
Career Strategies, a management consulting firm in Wilmette, Ill.
``Not everybody in the world is convinced that you're not worth a
second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding your second chance may take time, however. The job hunt
may be painful and may be drawn out, says Porter Gnann, human
resources manger at AGL Resources, the parent company of Atlanta
Gas Light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be like someone who has a poor credit rating. You've
pretty much got to take time to straighten that out, to prove that
you're trustworthy,'' he said, adding that human resources managers
often believe that past history is an indicator of future behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Begin confronting that belief by facing your past head on, the
experts say. Fill out job applications accurately. Answer interview
questions honestly. ``Don't lie about anything. Not ever. Not for
any reason,'' Kennedy cautions.
</P>
<P>
   As challenging as it may be, telling the truth about your past
builds credibility with potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your willingness to tell me that you've got a problem works in
your favor, not to your detriment,'' says James H. Wall, national
managing director of human resources at Deloitte &AMP; Touch. ``It
shows you're honest, you're willing to confront your mistakes and
discuss them openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Such candor requires conviction, however. Tell the truth
decisively, counsels Emory W. Mulling, president and founder of
Atlanta-based outplacement and executive coaching consulting firm,
The Mulling Group. ``If you are appearing like you have something
to hide, then the potential employer can become suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sharing the truth about your past may win you the
second chance you seek. ``The amount of times I have eliminated
someone who has not been forthcoming in an application and
interview is far greater than (eliminating) someone who has been
forthcoming,'' Wall contends.
</P>
<P>
   With the truth on the table, managers may more fully evaluate
your situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the situation? The level of breach? How much harm
(did) it cause? Does the person understand what they did? Are we
really sure they would not do it again?'' are among the questions a
manager will consider in light of the candidate's story, Wall says.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure alone, however, may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be prepared to show how and when you dealt with
your issue, your problem,'' Mulling says. ``If it is sexual
harassment, if it's theft, if it's chemical dependency, those
issues have rehabilitation. And you need to show, if necessary, how
you've been rehabilitated.''
</P>
<P>
   When telling the story of how you've battled back, be sure to
keep it realistic. ``Don't overembellish on the positives so that
you're not realistic about your achievements,'' cautions AGL's
Gnann.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster your story, instead, with references from employers who
knew you before your problem. Their assessment of you can
accentuate the positive aspects of your work history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must depend on those good references to carry you
through,'' says Mulling, by presenting them in this way: ``I made
one mistake, but look at all the other things that I accomplished.
Please call all these other companies to check my references.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, be sure to anticipate negative feedback and to
be proactive with damage control, says Mulling. ``You need to come
up with an excellent parting line, the reason you left the
company,'' he says. ``The best way to do this is to go back to the
former employer and tell them what you want to say to see if they
will confirm it. You need to see what kind of references they will
be giving.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to locate a sponsor, someone familiar with
your positive work history, who'll vouch for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That person who's backing you is critical because companies
may be more willing to hire someone (recommended to them) with a
problem in their past than if you're just a person off the
street,'' Mulling says.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Manheim, a partner at New York executive search firm
Herbert Mines Associates, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networking among people whom one knows personally, who already
know the circumstances, is probably going to be more productive
than arms-length cold calling,'' Manheim says. ``Then you don't
have to lay all this information on people who have no connection
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that your sponsor can't do it all, cautions
Kennedy. ``You have to be a really good worker. You can't just be a
slug, or that's going to cause a problem with that friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a sponsor, choose carefully who you initially tell
your story to, advises Kennedy. Her recommendation: a small
company. ``Aim a little lower than you would if your record was
outstanding. What you want is a really good reference.''
</P>
<P>
   That may mean applying for a job you're overqualified for, a job
you'll work for six months or no more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really want is to be outstanding. You want to
shine,'' she says, so stay focused, momentarily setting aside
long-term ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are in a rebuilding phase. You know that that's what it
is, and you're cheerful about it because presumably you really want
to do this rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, it's important to choose your industry of
re-entry wisely, says Kennedy. ``If we're talking about (an offense
such as) shoplifting, you're probably not going to be working for
another retailer,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And, if anybody asks you why you're changing industries, you can
say it's a better fit for your talent, Kennedy adds.

CHARLES ODEGAARD, 88, EXPERT ON TEACHING HEALTH SCIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Odegaard, who was president of the University of
Washington during years when it expanded greatly and was a
nationally prominent expert on education in the health sciences,
died on Nov. 14 at his home in Seattle. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Odegaard, whose doctorate was in medieval history, was a dean at
the University of Michigan before heading the University of
Washington from 1958 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In those years the university's enrollment rose, despite some
notable campus unrest, to 34,000 from 16,000. Its two-year
operating budget soared to almost $400 million from roughly $37
million. Thirty-five buildings were added, and the university's
health-sciences schools grew, nourished by federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation issued a report, based
on a study by Odegaard, that said efforts to increase the
enrollment of minority medical students had been inadequate. The
report called for more effective recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Odegaard was a member of the American Medical Association's
Citizen's Commission on Graduate Medical Education and the Public
Health Service's National Advisory Health Council.
</P>
<P>
   His writings included the book ``Dear Doctor: A Personal Letter
to a Physician'' (1986, Kaiser). In it he emphasized the need to
educate doctors in the humanities and the nurturing of
relationships between doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Odegaard was born in Chicago Heights, Ill. He received a
bachelor's degree from Dartmouth in 1932 and his doctorate from
Harvard in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Mary Ann Quarton, who lives near
Seattle, and four grandchildren.

MIAMI ROUTS HAPLESS RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For the first time in a Division I-A game this season,
first-year freshman quarterbacks started for both teams Saturday.
But any other similarity between Rutgers' Chad Schwenk and Miami's
Ken Dorsey was quickly dispelled.
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk, who had thrown for 258 yards and a touchdown in the
Scarlet Knights' dramatic upset of Syracuse last week, could not
find comparable magic Saturday , and Rutgers went down limply,
55-0, before a crowd announced at 21,617 at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk, who persevered until he was mercifully replaced by Mike
Jones late in the game, completed 8 of 18 passes for 51 yards with
an interception, as Rutgers lost for the 10th time in 11 games. He
was sacked nine times, including six in one seven-play sequence,
excluding punts.
</P>
<P>
   On Miami's side, it was not evident that Dorsey had thrown only
29 collegiate passes coming into the game. As a fill-in for Kenny
Kelly, Dorsey completed 19 of 26 passes for 194 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey had one distinct advantage over Schwenk: he was operating
against an injury-riddled pass defense rated next to last among 114
Division I-A teams.
</P>
<P>
   And that rating was attained before two more defensive starters,
strong safety Brian Bender and free safety Shahib White, left with
injuries. Bender had to be helped off the field early in the second
quarter. White, with a hip pointer, couldn't play after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   White was replaced by Phil Douglas, an untried sophomore wearing
No. 84, a stark reminder of his recent switch from wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   If this had been a boxing match, they would have called it at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (1-10 overall, 1-6 Big East) could muster just five
first downs in the game, a season low, and experienced its most
decisive shutout since a 62-point whipping by Notre Dame in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes (6-4, 4-1) scored on five of their first six
possessions to put this game away. If not for linebacker Wes
Robertson's fumble recovery at the Rutgers 35, the rout could have
been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk started with some promise, as his second pass went to
tight end C.J. Smith for 16 yards on a third-and-seven play. But
then he didn't complete another pass until midway through the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami opened the game by going 72 yards in 8 plays. The Rutgers
defense attempted to make a stand on that drive when the Hurricanes
reached its 20, but on fourth-and-one Dorsey faked a handoff and
threw to backup tight end Ivan Mercer, who was all alone in the
right flat, for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's fumble recovery soon gave the Scarlet Knights
possession at their 35, but Schwenk, operating without his top
rusher, Jacki Crooks (suspended for missing a practice), could do
nothing against Miami's swarming defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a game when Jarrett Payton, a freshman running back
and son of late NFL great Walter Payton, replaced Clinton Portis in
Miami's lineup. A loud cheer went up for Payton, and he responded
with his best performance of the season, carrying four times for 38
yards, including a 16-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk continued to look overmatched as Miami tacked on field
goals of 30 and 43 yards from Andy Crosland and Dorsey's 7-yard
touchdown pass to fullback Mondriel Fulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers' second first down of the game didn't come until the
score was 27-0. Even then, after Schwenk engineered two quick first
downs, including one on a 16-yard pass to flanker Errol Johnson,
Miami's blizzard of sacks was about to commence.
</P>
<P>
   Santana Moss' 67-yard punt return 1 minutes 20 seconds before
from halftime made the rout official.

GIRARDI LEAVING YANKEES, HIS AGENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Girardi, who played an integral role as the
Yankees won three championships in the last four seasons, will be
with another team next year, his agent said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Alan Nero, Girardi's agent. ``It's not
because the Yankees haven't treated him right. It's just that it's
the right decision for Joe, the right decision for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, 35, has started less than half of the Yankees' games
each of the last two seasons, sharing time with Jorge Posada, 28.
With Posada still developing his more potent offensive potential,
many Yankee officials believe it is time that he be given the
responsibility of catching every day _ 125 to 135 games a year. At
the same time, Girardi wants to play every day again, as he enters
the final years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Nero, who also represents Posada, said that three teams _ the
Chicago Cubs, the Colorado Rockies and the San Francisco Giants _
had all indicated that they'd like to acquire Girardi as an
everyday catcher for next season. Girardi is from the Midwest,
attended Northwestern University, broke into the majors with the
Cubs and recently built a house in the Chicago area, making the
Cubs seem like a natural fit for him.
</P>
<P>
   Nero said there was a question as to whether the Cubs were ready
to commit to Girardi for the next few seasons. Nero also
anticipates that the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers and
Baltimore Orioles might look into signing Girardi for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi is leaving the Yankees on good terms. Nero mentioned
repeatedly how much Girardi loved playing for the Yankees, and how
good the Yankees were for Girardi's career. The Yankees weren't
expected to keep Girardi for the 1999 season, but at the behest of
manager Joe Torre, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal
owner, exercised a $3.4 million option at the last minute. But
Girardi's time with the team apparently has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   In looking for a backup catcher, the Yankees have spoken to the
representatives of free agent catchers like Joe Oliver, Greg Myers
and Chad Kreuter. They've also inquired about Dave Nilsson, a
hard-hitting catcher who batted .309 with 21 home runs last season.
Nilsson, who is tempted by the idea of playing in the Olympics next
summer, might fit in well with the Yankees as a part-time backup
for Posada while also filling in at designated hitter, first base
and the outfield. But there might be a question of cost for the
Yankees.

EDITORIAL: THE BATTLE OVER ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Customers are expressing outrage at the surcharges banks impose
on them for using automated teller machines owned by banks other
than their own. The cities of Santa Monica, Calif., and San
Francisco recently banned these surcharges. The New York City
Council is planning to do the same. But before customers get too
riled up about paying fees for the privilege of reclaiming their
own money, they need to recognize that businesses do, after all,
have a right to charge for their services. More important, efforts
to ban the surcharges are apt to backfire and cause bank customers
more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Consider depositors at, say, Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. Most of them pay no fee if they withdraw money from one of
Chase's machines. But if they withdraw money from their Chase
accounts by using one of Citibank's machines, they pay two fees.
</P>
<P>
   The first goes to Chase, which keeps some of the fee and passes
the rest on to the computer network that processes the transfer and
to Citibank. The second fee goes directly to Citibank as additional
compensation for providing its machines to noncustomers. It is this
second fee that particularly angers many consumers and leads to
complaints that the banks are charging the noncustomers twice.
</P>
<P>
   But those consumers forget that before ATMs, depositors
sometimes had to pay fees to get a bank to cash a check drawn on
another bank. Often they could not get cash at all from banks other
than their own. Now they can, but for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, as surcharges have taken hold, banks
and other institutions, such as merchants, have installed ATMs in
airports, gas stations and nearly everywhere else. Surcharges make
it profitable for merchants to own ATMs, and the competition from
these merchant-owned ATMs keeps the banks from imposing excessive
charges for use of their own machines. If Citibank tried to charge
noncustomers excessive fees, nearby merchants would profit by
installing their own ATMs and luring users by setting lower
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of surcharges argue that they drive depositors from
small banks to large banks so that they can take advantage of
machines spread all across town that are free, of course, only to
the large bank's depositors. There is, however, no evidence that
this has happened. In fact, it is the bans on surcharges that most
threaten to harm small banks. After Santa Monica passed its ban,
two large banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, shut their
machines to noncustomers. That, more than modest surcharges,
threatens to make customers flock to big banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banning surcharges will have three economic reverberations, none
good. Some banks will close down machines in underpopulated regions
because, in the absence of surcharges, they will generate too
little revenue. Other banks will block depositors from other
institutions from using their machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common reaction may well be that banks sell their
ATMs to nonfinancial owners, such as individual hotels and
restaurants, which remain eligible under most state and local
surcharge bans to keep imposing fees. The rationale is that the
exemption for nonfinancial owners preserves their incentive to
install machines. But the odd result is that bans designed to
protect depositors may wind up preserving surcharges even as they
make finding ATMs more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are challenging local bans on surcharges in the
courts. However, neither legislation nor litigation should cloud
the central goal of consumer protection. The best policy for
consumers is to steer clear of local regulations that will help
concentrate business in a few big banks and make it harder for many
citizens to obtain cash.

 &HT;    CLINTON LEAVES GREECE EXPRESSING REGRET FOR U.S. SUPPORT OF COLD
WAR COUP
 &HT;    With CLINTON-TOURIST-1121.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ President Clinton arrived in this renaissance
city along the banks of the Arno Saturday night on the latest leg
of a 10-day swing through southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Athens, a day after demonstrators took to the streets
to violently protest his short visit there, Clinton acknowledged
one of their key grievances: U.S. support for a military
dictatorship in Greece at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of an apology, Clinton cleared the air on
American support for a military junta that overthrew the elected
government in Greece in 1967. The coup ushered in nearly a decade
of often harsh political repression and left an enduring stain on
U.S.-Greek ties.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech before several hundred government, business and
community leaders in Athens, Clinton said U.S. backing for the
dictators had placed the country on the wrong side of democracy, if
not history, at a critical moment when policymakers in Washington
feared the growing strength of the Communist party in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the junta took over in 1967 here, the United States
allowed its interest in prosecuting the Cold War to prevail over
its interest _ I should say its obligation _ to support democracy,
which was, after all, the cause for which we fought the Cold War,''
Clinton said. ``It is important that we acknowledge that.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark, which drew sustained applause, was contained in a
45-minute speech during which Clinton praised U.S.-Greek ties and
the development of Western democracy in Athens two and a half
millennia ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton arrived in Athens on Friday night, an estimated
10,000 demonstrators protested his visit. Police in riot gear used
tear gas to disperse the crowd, but many demonstrators hurled
firebombs and rocks, smashing windows, burning out shops and banks
and wreaking havoc in the heart of downtown Athens. The protest was
aimed against U.S. policy in Kosovo and Bosnia and the American-led
bombing of Yugoslavia, a traditional Orthodox Christian ally of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Following a tour early Saturday of the Acropolis _ site of the
Parthenon and several other Classical Greek monuments _ Clinton
held a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Konstandinos
Simitis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the demonstrators had the right to protest his
visit, but not to destroy property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to _ especially in Greece _ reaffirm the right
of people to protest in a democracy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe the protest should be peaceful,'' he
continued, ``and, therefore, I deeply regret the Greeks who had
their property injured and who suffered losses through these
demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Simitis agreed that the protests were overshadowed
by deepening ties between the United States and Greece. Clinton
stressed that the relationship could withstand disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is confirming the historic friendship relations
between the two countries and between our two peoples,'' Simitis
said. At the same time, he said, ``there is still considerable
margin for the improvement of the cooperation between the two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on board Air Force One heading to Florence, by way of
Pisa, passengers were asked Saturday by the Secret Service to
inspect carry-on luggage for ``anything suspicious.'' Officials
would give no details on the threat. Nothing suspicious apparently
was found aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
   After Air Force One landed in Pisa, Clinton continued by
helicopter to Florence, where he will participate Sunday in a
day-long conference on governance with his counterparts from Italy,
Britain, Germany, France and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   He flies late in the day to Sofia, Bulgaria for a two-day state
visit, before returning to Washington late Tuesday after scheduled
stops en-route in Macedonia and Kosovo.

REAL ESTATE: OPTIONS IN REPLACING A WOOD FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mo., N.C.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the advantages of wood floors is that when they get
scuffed, scratched or just plain sorry-looking, they can usually be
restored to like-new condition by simply sanding off the surface
and refinishing the newly exposed wood.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, though, when a wood floor has reached the end
of its useful life _ for example, when too much of the surface has
been removed by refinishings or when water or pet stains have
seeped so far into the wood that even the most aggressive
refinishing won't remove them.
</P>
<P>
   While one way to address such a problem might be to cover the
old floor with carpeting, there are many other options available,
ranging from a full-scale, professional replacement of the floor
itself to do-it-yourself solutions that may not even require the
use of a hammer or nail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an enormous variety of wood-flooring products on the
market today,'' said Edward Wilkes, the owner of Fairfield
Floorworks, a wood-flooring contractor in Ridgefield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes explained that in addition to the most common wood
flooring material used in homes _ the 2\-inch-wide oak strips that
most people are familiar with _ there are dozens of other types,
grades and sizes of wood that can be used to replace, or, in some
cases, cover over an existing wood floor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to various species of solid wood planking available
in 2- to 9-inch widths, he said, flooring material is also
available in preassembled parquet panels, prefinished strip
planking, and in finished or unfinished engineered laminates _
multilayered, dimensionally stable wood strips that can be glued
together and then nailed, glued or ``floated'' over an existing
wood floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes to install a new wood floor, it is usually
best to remove the existing one,'' Wilkes said, explaining that
there were two main reasons for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The first, he said, results from the fact that since solid wood
flooring material is usually three-fourths of an inch thick, the
added thickness often presents a problem if doors open into a room,
one room leads into another with a different type of floor, or a
floor meets a stairway. Removing the existing floor, he said,
eliminates such problems.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for removing an existing floor before
installing a new one has to do with the dimensional stability of
solid wood. Since wood expands and contracts with changes in the
weather, Wilkes explained, attaching a second layer of solid wood
to an existing layer creates stresses that could result in gaps and
splits.
</P>
<P>
   While that problem can generally be avoided by installing the
new floorboards at right angles to the existing ones, he said, that
can result in an odd look for the new floor, particularly if an
existing floor in an adjacent room is going to be unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Wilkes said, the cost of installing and
finishing a floor made of No. 1 common oak starts at a little more
than $7 a square foot. Better grades of oak, which generally have
fewer knots and surface imperfections, can cost $8 or $9 a square
foot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that notwithstanding his recommendation to remove an
existing floor before installing a new one, there is one exception
to that rule _ when ``engineered flooring'' is being used in place
of solid wood.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lux, president of the National Wood Flooring Association, a
trade organization based in St. Louis, said engineered flooring is
made of several layers of glued-together thin plywood or pine
topped with a layer of solid wood. The thickness of the finished
product, Lux said, ranges from three- to five-eighths of an inch,
with those at the lower end of the range thin enough to be used
over an existing floor without major problems in floor height.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some confusion in consumers' minds about the
difference between engineered floors and laminate floors,'' Lux
said. He explained that since engineered floors are laminated
layers of wood, they are often mistakenly believed to be the same
thing as the plastic-based laminate floors that are now being
marketed for use in areas like kitchens, bathrooms and basements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineered floors are real wood,'' he said, adding that since
the top layer of engineered flooring is about an eighth of an inch
thick, such floors can even be refinished a couple of times, just
like a solid wood floor. But the real benefit of engineered
flooring, Lux said, is that it is easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineered floors are really very easy to put down,'' he said,
explaining that while such floors can be nailed or glued to an
existing wood floor or subfloor in the same way that solid wood
floors are installed, engineered floors can also be ``floated''
over an existing wood, tile, or concrete surface.
</P>
<P>
   A floating floor, Lux explained, is one that is installed over a
thin layer of polyurethane foam that acts as both a cushioning
material and a vapor barrier. The strips of flooring, which have
interlocking tongues and grooves on their sides and ends, are then
simply laid on the foam and glued together.
</P>
<P>
   Lux said that it was possible to install engineered flooring at
the thinner end of its range over an existing floor without
appreciably increasing the floor's height.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, he said, it costs about the same to install
an engineered floor as a solid wood floor _ even though the former
is a bit more expensive _ because engineered floors are typically
presanded and prefinished at the factory, thereby eliminating those
steps in the installation process.

<P>
   For those who want something different from the standard oak
floor, more exotic choices are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We manufacture 12 different flooring materials,'' said John
Fisher, the owner of J.L. Powell &AMP; Co., a flooring manufacturer
based in Whiteville, N.C. ``And five are made from reclaimed heart
pine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher explained that most pine planking available today has
been cut from relatively young trees in second- and third-growth
forests. As a result, he said, the wood is generally too soft to be
the ideal choice for flooring. The pine planking his company
produces, however, comes from reclaimed timbers used as structural
members for ships and large industrial buildings in the early part
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   That wood, the most common of which was southern yellow longleaf
pine, was cut from 200-year-old trees harvested from virgin
forests. With such old trees, Fisher said, the center portion has
turned into densely grained, resinous wood that is resistant to
decay and rot and has a strikingly beautiful grain pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't fill orders with a single width,'' he said,
explaining that in most cases the product is shipped in bundles
containing 4- to 5-foot planks of three different widths. The
widths that are available range from 2 to 9 inches in 1-inch
increments, he said, and all planks are 3/4 inch thick _ the same
as other standard solid wood flooring products.
</P>
<P>
   The product is installed, Fisher said, by running planks of
similar widths end-to end. The second course, which should be made
up of planks of a different width from the first, are then
installed adjacent to the first course, and so on. Generally
speaking, he said, reclaimed heart pine flooring costs about $12 to
$15 a square foot installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the business of reclaiming old wood, because people
in the market want it,'' Fisher said. ``And they want it because it
makes a real pretty floor.''

PETER WILDEBLOOD, 76, OPPONENT OF ANTI-GAY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Wildeblood, a former journalist and television producer
whose personal war against British law helped lead to the
decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967, died on Nov. 13 in
Vancouver, British Columbia. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications resulting from a paralyzing
stroke, said Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, 1954, Wildeblood, having freely said in court that
he was a homosexual, was found guilty of conspiring to incite a
young man to commit what were then described in law as indecent
acts. He and a co-defendant, Michael Pitt-Rivers, were sentenced to
18 months in prison. Lord Montagu, another defendant, was given a
one-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, Wildeblood was dismissed from his job as
diplomatic correspondent for The London Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Wildeblood's account of his experiences in the courts and in
prison in a book called ``Against the Law'' (Weidenfeld and
Nicholson, 1955 and 1999) prompted debates in both houses of
Parliament and led to the establishment of a government panel
called the Wolfenden Committee to review the law dealing with male
homosexual practices and female prostitution; lesbianism had never
been illegal in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the committee recommended the decriminalization of
private homosexual acts between consenting adults over age 21, and
suggested that prostitution, which was not illegal, be allowed to
continue. But it was not until 10 years later that the
recommendations were made into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right which I claim for myself, and for all those like me,
is the right to choose the person whom I love,'' Wildeblood once
said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Against the Law,'' he contended that imprisonment of
homosexuals made no sense, because acts in private by consenting
adults should not be considered criminal, and that in any case
prisons encourage homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The London Daily Telegraph called ``Against the Law'' ``a very
courageous, honest book,'' but public libraries and bookstores in
Britain were reluctant to stock it at the time. It has recently
been republished by Weidenfeld in a new edition in celebration of
the publisher's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wildeblood was born in Alassio on the Italian Riviera in
1923, the son of a retired engineer. He went to Oxford on a
scholarship, but became ill and dropped out after only 10 days. He
was accepted as a pilot by the Royal Air Force and was sent to what
was then Southern Rhodesia for training. After several crashes, he
was grounded, and he served during World War II in the
Meteorological Branch.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Oxford and graduated two years after the war, and
then worked for a series of newspapers in the north of England and
sold freelance articles to Punch and Vogue. He joined The Daily
Mail in 1950 and was soon named diplomatic correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison, he operated a popular bar in the
Soho district of London and published a fictionalized biography,
``A Way of Life'' (1956), followed by two novels, a play and
several musicals for which he wrote the book and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Wildeblood shifted his attention to television
production and was so successful that in the early 1970s he
accepted a lucrative offer from Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and
moved to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a stroke left him almost completely paralyzed and
speechless but he remained mentally alert. He learned to
communicate by operating an electric typewriter with his chin.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

 &HT;    Bush foreign policy is garden variety
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush did not take reporters' questions,
and he did not mention many foreign leaders by name. And his
eagerly anticipated speech on foreign policy Friday was free of the
gaffes that have made him a staple of late-night television humor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed a view of U.S. foreign policy that could have
come from Democratic candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley or
Republican rival John McCain. He cautioned against isolationism and
protectionism and endorsed active but clear-headed relations with
Russia and China. He also was highly critical of Russia and its
policy toward Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   FOWLER CASTS EYE AT MAYORAL RACE
</P>
<P>
   From Saudi Arabia to City Hall? Wyche Fowler, the U.S.
ambassador to Saudi Arabia and former U.S. senator from Georgia, is
considering jumping into the Atlanta mayor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler was in Atlanta for the World Series and in Washington
more recently for a reunion of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Fowler was on the committee when he was Atlanta's representative in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   He's not unfamiliar with city government. When Maynard Jackson
became mayor in January 1974, Fowler took over as president of the
City Council.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN: CAN'T AFFORD AN IOWA CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   McCain informed Iowa Republicans last week that he will not
spend any time or money campaigning for their caucuses, scheduled
for Jan. 24. McCain opposes subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based
alternative fuel that is popular in corn-growing Iowa. But he said
Friday, ``I'm not worried about ethanol questions as much as
spending time on the ground.'' McCain estimated that it would take
$2 million to mount an effective campaign in Iowa. In a letter to
Iowa GOP Chairman Kayne Robinson, McCain wrote that his decision
``is based solely on the compressed nature of the primary schedule
and the increasing influence of big money on the nominating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain continues to rise in the polls there. He reached 12
percent in one poll last week, which put him close to Steve Forbes,
who has spent much time and money in the state. Bush has a sizable
lead.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES CLAIMS BUSH BEHIND ATTACK ADS
</P>
<P>
   Forbes filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
against a centrist Republican group that is airing a commercial
that attacks the candidate. Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col
said the group, the Republican Leadership Council, is closely
aligned with Bush and that its $100,000 ad campaign targeting
Forbes amounts to an excessively large contribution to Bush's
campaign. To bolster his complaint, Dal Col pointed to a $2,000
contribution from the council to Bush's campaign for governor last
year and the fact that most of the council's top members are Bush
contributors. McCain voiced his support for Forbes, calling the ads
unwarranted. Bush and the council denied any connection. Both said
the Bush campaign played no role.
</P>
<P>
   JUST PROP HIM UP, KEEP HIM SMILING
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican presidential candidates painted two different
views last week of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board. First, Forbes chided Greenspan for the Fed's third increase
in interest rates this year. ``Enough, Alan, enough. You and your
colleagues risk harming the whole economy the way you've already
harmed the farm economy,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, McCain paid Greenspan the ultimate compliment, at
least for aficionados of bad and silly movies. ``If he died, I'd
try to do like they did in that movie `Weekend at Bernie's,'''
McCain said about a film in which a dead man is dressed in false
mustache and sunglasses to fool people into thinking he's alive.
``His stewardship of this economy has been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY NOT DENYING THIS WOMAN'S CLAIM
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was criticized over a new television ad in which a woman
credited him with passage of a law that allows women to stay in the
hospital for 48 hours after giving birth. ``Thanks to Senator
Bradley, my daughter is alive today,'' Maureen Drumm says. But the
law passed several years after Drumm's difficult delivery of her
first child. Her second child, mentioned in the ad, did not have
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers called the ad misleading, and the Gore
campaign asked Bradley to fix the ad's ``misleading elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Drumm explained she ``would not have had the physical and mental
courage to deliver my third child'' if she had to fight her
insurance company once more for an extended hospital stay. Bradley
has not altered the ad.
</P>
<P>
   SPIN TAKES OVER AFTER CALIFORNIA VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Californians elected Democrat Joe Baca in a special election
Tuesday to replace the late Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.). Baca beat
Republican Elia Pirozzi 52 percent to 44 percent. The outcome was
expected, as was the spin. Democrats saw momentum building in their
march to the 2000 elections. Republicans found the election too
close for comfort for the Democrats, suggesting an underlying
support for the GOP message even in a district with a long history
of electing Democrats.

AMERICA TRUE STAYS COURSE IN TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America's Cup veteran Dawn Riley awoke Saturday in New
Zealand feeling, in her words, ``a little dusty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night,'' she said, ``was the first one in quite a while
that I allowed myself to go out and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, the captain and chief executive officer of the San
Francisco-based America True syndicate, was not the first sailor to
greet a new day suffering the consequences of a big evening. But
she had more reason to celebrate than most.
</P>
<P>
   When the cup trials started last month, many gave Riley's team
little chance of advancing. In fact, most believed that America
True _ the only coed squad competing in the regatta _ was the
weakest of the five U.S. syndicates. But after blazing through the
second round of challenger trials, which ended Saturday, with an
8-2 record, America True is now holding a firm second place in the
standing. Italy's once-defeated Prada Challenge remains in first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who had us deep in the rankings are respected for
their opinions,'' Riley said in a phone interview from Auckland,
New Zealand. ``I don't know why, but they really didn't believe we
could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we always hoped to be in second at this point. We
didn't have any grand illusions about Prada falling apart; we knew
they'd covered their bases. But we hoped to be up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a stunning reversal of fortune after a strong
performance in the first round robin, the New York Yacht Club's
Young America team dropped to sixth place among the 11 challengers.
It's a tenuous position. The third round in the Louis Vuitton
series to determine the cup challenger begins Dec. 1. But only six
boats will advance to January's semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Young America's skipper, Ed Baird, said
via telephone. ``We had a couple of things happen that were
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird is a master of understatement. The first crack in New
York's armor, literally and figuratively, fissured just before the
midway point of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a lead over Japan's Nippon Challenge with one leg to go
in a crucial race on Nov. 9, Young America's carbon-fiber hull
folded like a beer can and the crew took to the sea. Luck and fine
seamanship spared the vessel from sinking, but the New Yorkers were
forced to sail their second boat _ one supposedly configured for
lighter air _ for the remainder of the round.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't entirely up to the task. After two quick victories,
the second Young America handed a race to Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP;
Stripes because of rig problems. And then the syndicate became
embroiled in a rules imbroglio after withdrawing from a race
because of yet more breakage, an incident that resulted in charges
of misleading race authorities and the news media as to its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was misquoted,'' Baird said in response to reports that the
deck of Young America's second boat had cracked. ``Our deck did not
crack. We've got no reason to deceive anyone. Some folks say we're
about to self-destruct. Well, that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the incident appeared to be a tempest in a teapot.
But for the New York Yacht Club, desperate to escape the
distractions that have plagued its most recent cup efforts, the
closing days of Round 2 had a disquieting familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America True's rise and Young America's descent were not
the round's only surprises. With an aggressive performance from the
helmsman Ken Read and the addition Tom Whidden, a longtime Conner
lieutenant, to the afterguard, Stars &AMP; Stripes squeaked past Paul
Cayard's America One to take third place in the standing. The
Nippon Challenge, with the skipper, Peter Gilmour, steadily raising
the level of his game, is holding fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The final U.S. team, Hawaii's Abracadabra, received a needed
boost when the syndicate chief, John Kolius, handed the wheel to
the sailmaker, Chris Larson, in the round's latter stages. But
Abracadabra, in eighth position, will need a strong third round to
avoid being home for Christmas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Riley, the best race in the series came early on, when her
America True knocked off Cayard's America One, the crosstown rival.
There's no love lost between the teams: Cayard, a San Francisco
native, has not-so-subtly accused Riley, originally from Michigan,
of carpetbagging.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that Cayard felt she was impinging on his
turf, Riley's answer was short. It could also have served as a
description of how her once-demeaned team performed in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough,'' she said.

 &HT;    McCain run for presidency puts Arizona votes at premium
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Arizona has not traditionally been an important
stop on the road to the presidency. But the rapidly growing state
has an interesting, if not decisive, role to play in 2000 because
of the candidacy of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).
</P>
<P>
   McCain and three other competitors for the GOP nomination, but
not Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will meet for a debate tonight on
the campus of Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign strategy is to focus his time and money on the
first two primaries, in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Then, armed with at least one victory (McCain has predicted a
win in South Carolina), he could expect to come home to a big
triumph in Arizona on Feb. 22, three days after the vote in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush may
complicate those plans. Bush has the backing of the state's
Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull, and he has talked about
spending a couple million dollars in Arizona. He can afford it,
with more than $57 million in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain would rather not expend his more limited resources on
his home turf. He has raised about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush goes ahead and spends $2 million to $3 million, McCain
can still win, but only if he spends money,'' said Bruce Merrill, a
mass communication professor at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   Hull spurred a round of stories about McCain's famous temper
when she described it in biting detail to The New York Times. The
Arizona Republic, the state's largest newspaper, followed up with
an editorial questioning the temperament of Arizona's senior
senator.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his supporters shrugged off the newspaper's attack as
the latest round in a long-running feud.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has deep support here. He won re-election to a third
term in the Senate last year with nearly 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Arizona primary during a stop in Atlanta on
Friday, McCain said flatly, ``We've got nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But several McCain backers in the Arizona congressional
delegation said Bush is forcing McCain to give the state more
attention than he otherwise would. ``It's because of the amount of
money Bush has,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.)
</P>
<P>
   The two men also are closely matched in Arizona polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain led Bush, 39 percent to 31 percent in a recent survey by
the university. Magazine publisher Steve Forbes, who won the
state's primary in 1996, was a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question, of course, is why is it so close? He's a
favorite son, a popular senator. Why should it be close?'' said
Merrill, who conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill thinks the poll holds some clues. After asking
Republicans their choice in the primary, he asked who would be the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of McCain's lead, 75 percent of those surveyed picked
Bush as the eventual nominee. Even among McCain supporters, 60
percent chose Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dilemma for the senator,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faces the same question elsewhere and his campaign hopes
to begin answering it by running well in New Hampshire and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill said, if Bush were to score a victory in Arizona,
``it's really a silver stake in McCain's heart. If he lost Arizona,
his own state, how could he go to neighboring California two weeks
later and ask for their votes?''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's debate is not likely to gain a large national audience
because it will not begin until 10 p.m. EST, with C-Span
broadcasting live. The late start is to avoid conflict with an
Arizona Cardinals football game that also will be played on the
college campus.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, former U.S. diplomat Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch
(R-Utah) also will participate.
</P>
<P>
   When Forbes won the primary in 1996, he received a third of the
vote in a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said he expects Forbes to do less well this time because
the migration of people to Arizona has had a moderating influence
on the state's politics. Arizona has gained enough new residents to
pick up two new congressional seats after the 2000 census,
demographers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is avidly pursuing the votes of social conservatives in
this campaign. But he too is expected to use television and radio
commercials to make his presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been reluctant to debate his opponents before January.
But the quickening pace of the campaign led him to accept debates
in December, including a Dec. 6 invitation in Arizona. McCain,
however, will not be at that one.

ELLIOTT SANGER, 77, PRODUCER FOR TIMES-OWNED RADIO STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elliott M. Sanger Jr., a news producer for WQXR, the
radio station owned by The New York Times, and a corporate
relations executive for New York Times Co., died on Friday at his
home in Manhattan. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said his wife, Joan Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned four decades at The Times, Sanger held
a variety of positions at the newspaper and at WQXR, which his
father, Elliott M. Sanger Sr., helped begin in 1936. It was bought
by The Times eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   When The Times was closed by a 114-day strike that began in late
1962, Sanger directed a project to put nonstriking correspondents
on the air. The project won a George Foster Peabody Award, and it
proved so popular that it continued after the newspaper resumed
publishing. For the next seven years, Sanger headed a staff of news
writers in the Times newsroom who worked with reporters and editors
for assignments on the air.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Sanger became the executive producer of ``Insight,'' a
nightly program of news analysis moderated by Clifton Daniel, a
former managing editor of The Times, who interviewed correspondents
about the top stories of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Sanger joined the corporate relations department of
Times Co. He became manager of corporate relations in 1980. He
retired in 1987 but continued working for New York Times Co.
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Maxwell Sanger Jr. was born in Manhattan and graduated
from Columbia College in 1943. He served in the Army, landing in
Normandy a few days after D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Sanger is survived by his mother,
Eleanor Sanger of Manhattan; a brother, Kenneth Sanger of White
Plains, N.Y.; his daughter, Elizabeth Sanger of Larchmont, N.Y.;
and two grandsons.

U.S. READIES A MAJOR LAND-PROTECTION INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ariz., Calif., Mont., Ore., Utah)  (Adds list of sites at end) 
(bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTEZ, Colo. _ As one of its last major public land
initiatives, the Clinton administration is preparing to designate
as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the West that
federal officials say need protection from future commercial
development and recreational overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who came to Colorado for the
weekend to build support for the action, said the administration
had decided to act because, in many cases, Congress had failed to
act on proposed legislation that would accomplish the same thing.
Delays, he said, had prompted President Clinton to consider
invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the president the
authority to act by executive order in the case of any lands that
have scientific, historic or archaeological significance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, every president except Richard M.
Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush has designated at least one
national monument. There are now more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the administration was more than willing to allow
Congress to take the lead. But conceding that opposition in some
cases might be strong, he said the president was willing to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope this is not our last major initiative, but it
is a major undertaking,'' Babbitt said in an interview Friday
before hiking through part of the 73,000 acres he wants added to
the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction. Saturday he
toured ancient Indian ruins on a 165,000-acre site here that he
wants declared a monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are growing year by year,'' he said, referring to
commercial and recreation pressures on the lands in question.
``Congress hasn't responded at all. So rather than leave it all to
the 11th hour, the president is ready to consider these on a
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two Colorado sites, the other proposed monuments are
in Arizona, California, Montana and Oregon. Having toured them all
within the last year, Babbitt said he had found growing public
support for granting them monument status, which would effectively
provide greater protections through the National Park Service or
the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   All the lands under consideration are managed by the land
bureau, but monument status would add access restrictions and
ensure that they cannot be developed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation groups and environmentalists are applauding the
administration initiative. ``It sends a very important signal that
these special places deserve more protection than they're
getting,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation. ``This tells the world that they are very
significant sites.''
</P>
<P>
   But many opponents view it as little more than a political
gambit by Clinton, a way for him to seal his legacy as an
environmentalist and cement environmental groups' support for Vice
President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers from Western states, like Sens. Robert
Bennett of Utah and Wayne Allard of Colorado, object to federal
intervention within their borders without sufficient local input.
And commercial interests say the initiative is yet another attempt
by the administration to ignore the economic consequences of
environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly smacks of another anti-mining advocacy
effort,'' said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining
Association. ``We can't arbitrarily move mines around. You have to
go where the minerals are, and if they continue to withdraw lands
where the mines are, it means going elsewhere to develop, which
means out of the country and the loss of millions of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Myra Hyde, director of environmental issues for the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose members own herds that graze on
open lands, said: ``The economics are far-reaching. Once you take
lands out of production, it affects whole communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Interior Department said that some of the lands
in question have mineral resources but none have active mines. They
also said grazing rights would probably not be affected by the
designations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of a House national parks
and public lands subcommittee, sponsored legislation two years ago
that would require approval of Congress as well as the governor and
state legislature to designate a national monument that exceeds
5,000 acres. It passed the House, but a companion Senate bill is
still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the most recent national monument _ Grand
Staircase-Escalante, a 1.9 million-acre tract in southern Utah _
was designated by Clinton in 1996, Hansen called the designation
``the biggest land grab in the nation.'' And in a letter in October
to Babbitt expressing concern over monument designations in their
state, three Colorado lawmakers _ Allard, Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell and Rep. Scott McInnis _ described it as a ``heavy-handed
federal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said in an interview last week that Babbitt had yet to
respond to the letter. He criticized administration officials for
``storming in and storming out without doing the proper legwork''
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, who attended a public forum led by Babbitt at the
Colorado National Monument on Friday, predicted that Congress would
expand the monument, which is in his district, within the
administration's timetable. With regard to the other lands, he
added: ``Executive order is not the way to go. The Antiquities Act
was never intended to bypass Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Freemyer, staff director of Hansen's subcommittee, said
that even without Hansen's bill, the administration already had
``hundreds of tools'' to manage public lands without drawing on a
93-year-old measure that was passed before agencies like the park
service were created to manage and protect federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big photo-op declaration, which really isn't
necessary,'' he said of Babbitt's initiative. ``They're just doing
what Al Gore likes to do best, the champion of the environment
warning that if we don't make these places monuments, the
bulldozers are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   To administration officials and environmental groups, that
prospect is not much of an exaggeration. As the expanding national
economy of the 1990s has created more business opportunities and
disposable income, they contend, open lands have become more
vulnerable to commercial development, recreational use and
encroaching sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, which was attended by about 200 people, Babbitt
said that whether it is Congress or Clinton who makes the
designations, monument status would assure that ``the next seven
generations'' have the same opportunity to enjoy the lands that
visitors have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My object, unequivocally,'' he said, ``is to bring this to a
mutually agreeable conclusion.''

GOMEZ SPARKLES IN DEVILS' VICTORY OVER SENATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With all the energy and enthusiasm that
the Devils rookie Scott Gomez is showing, how can he possibly
sustain this pace for the last three-quarters of the season and up
to two months of playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The questions don't end there. Because he is a center playing
out of position on the left wing, is it not inevitable that Gomez
will get hit too much into the boards or get caught in the wrong
location on defense? And because Gomez has so many points so early,
aren't opposing coaches and their scouts soon going to devise ways
to stop him?
</P>
<P>
   Enough questions. Let's be frank. Gomez was positively
delightful to watch again Saturday as the New Jersey Devils beat
the Ottawa Senators by 3-1 at Continental Arena. During a match
that was otherwise pedestrian, Gomez sparkled by setting up the
first Devils goal in the first period and scoring the game-winner
in the third. Gomez put five shots on goal, tied for the most on
the team. And he helped defenseman Ken Daneyko get his first assist
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After 19 games, Gomez has 21 points, from five goals and 16
assists. He leads his team in scoring and he is the top point
producer among rookies in the National Hockey League. A 19-year-old
from Alaska who could become the sport's first Hispanic star, Gomez
is charming his teammates, his coaches, the fans and the news media
with a blend of innocent enthusiasm and precocious skill that is as
refreshing as it is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't jinx him,'' said Brian Rafalski, an older rookie at age
26. ``You don't want to say anything to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard not to gush. Even Robbie Ftorek, the Devils'
taciturn coach, struggled to keep the smile off his face and the
words from his lips when asked to discuss Gomez. ``He's just
playing,'' Ftorek said. (Translated from Ftorek-speak, that was
``Whoopee!'')
</P>
<P>
   The Devils trailed, 1-0, after goalie Martin Brodeur missed the
first shot of the game, at 41 seconds, by Magnus Arvedson. Gomez
tied the score by setting up Sergei Nemchinov at 12 minutes 39
seconds with a pass to the slot from behind the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right on the stick,'' Nemchinov said of the pass. Their
exchange was typical of the give-and-go technique that comes
naturally to Gomez. ``He yelled at me,'' Nemchinov said, ``and then
he made a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   The game slogged along at 1-1 until 7:26 of the third period,
when Gomez stayed long for a shift. After passes from Daneyko and
Scott Niedermayer, Gomez darted into the Ottawa zone, drifted right
to left, used a defenseman as a screen and whipped a wrist shot
past goalie Ron Tugnutt. Gomez fired to the stick side, he said,
because his coaches warned him about Tugnutt's good glove. Scott
Stevens scored into the empty net in the final minute after the
goalie was pulled for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who turns 20 on Dec. 23, is not yet well rounded in the
postgame interview routine. He tries for the requisite humility
(``I'm not doing everything by myself'') and he attempts the right
cliches (``Great to win and get the two points''). Under relentless
interrogation, he breaks down. His eyes brighten and he confesses:
``I get excited when there's a game day and I'm about to play
another National Hockey League game.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits it tickles him when veterans like Randy McKay tease
him to keep him humble. McKay, Gomez said, keeps threatening to
beat Gomez in a skating race. ``I never would have thought it,
growing up,'' Gomez said of the friendly banter. Why? ``I wondered
what these guys were really like,'' he said. ``They are kids at
heart. It's a business, but the reason we all start playing is it
is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much fun for the Senators these days. They have lost
three in a row and four of their last five after a torrid start.
Several key players are injured and their best player, Aleksei
Yashin, has been suspended in a contract holdout. Rather than trade
him to improve the team, the Senators are determined to teach him a
lesson and punish him, a strategy that could eventually damage the
team, its fan base and the quality of the league as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all their problems, the disciplined and hard-working
Senators _ wearing hockey's snazziest uniforms _ made the Devils
earn their points as they extended their home winning streak to
8-0-2. Ottawa put 30 shots on Brodeur, who said: ``They don't have
all their big players and they gave us all we could handle. They
remind me of us a few years ago.''

  (SUBS to insert `on Friday' in 4th graf and to add clarification to

(mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is always a touch of zaniness surrounding the
rush by Congress to get out from under its workload on Capitol
Hill, and this year was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   What else but the approaching millennium could explain Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., walking in tandem with a six-foot cow across
the sparkling Capitol?
</P>
<P>
   The picture prompted a perfectly apropos question: Had Obey, the
chief Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, suffered through
one too many marathon sessions with Republicans and the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   There he was at 11 a.m. on Friday, ambling clear across the
Capitol, with that very tall cow, a pair of black boxing gloves and
a couple of Wisconsin colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Obey and Reps. Ron Kind and Thomas Barrett,
who are also Democrats from Wisconsin, had persuaded two aides to
slip into a cow costume and trot on over to the offices of Sen.
Herb Kohl. Kohl is the Wisconsin Democrat who led the lonely fight
in the Senate against legislation that he said would hurt
Midwestern dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl walked out of his office to find the cow on his carpet, a
set of boxing gloves with a cow charm attached and a group of
chuckling lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the heavyweight champ of dairy,'' Obey proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Becker, Kohl's press secretary, said with a smirk, ``The
cow got cow fur all over Sen. Kohl's sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxing gloves proved more symbolic than anything else,
though. By the end of the day, Kohl had dropped his threat to keep
the Senate in session by reading dairy recipes on the Senate floor,
allowing the legislation to pass and vowing to fight it another
day.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a fight for another day.
</P>
<P>
   There were other last-minute incongruities.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert stood before a near-empty House
chamber to deliver an end-of-session speech. A few of his aides sat
in the seats ordinarily reserved by members, completing unfinished
paperwork or gazing out into the ether. Two untouched glasses of
water sat on a table nearby, in case the speaker needed to clear
his throat. It was a speech tailor-made for C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The newest representative, Joe Baca, D-Calif., who won a special
election last week, swooped into the Capitol on Thursday to get
sworn in and join the congressional club. His first vote: a motion
to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., tried to adjourn, but somehow
wound up back in the Capitol when he should have been on a plane.
With his car idling in front of Ronald Reagan National Airport,
Shays raced back to the Hill after he heard that Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., might be threatening hijinks on the Senate floor in an
effort to protect his state's coal miners from a court ruling
ordering them to stop dumping waste from mountaintop mines into
valley streams. No sooner did Shays get back to the Capitol, ready
to fight over the coal issue, if need be, than he realized it had
been a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Home for him would have to wait until well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been anyone but Sen. Byrd, I would have gotten on
that plane,'' Shays said, referring to Byrd's ability to hurl
thunderbolts and tie the Senate up in knots when he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there was a touch of envy toward the House, hard
as that is to believe. Home was still a distant thought for most
senators early Friday morning. Expectations were for a Saturday
departure, with the risk of the session spilling into Sunday and
beyond. Sen. Trent Lott. R-Miss., the majority leader, and Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, worked to toss aside the
clutter, bit by bit, without angering recalcitrant senators or
igniting a bunker mentality.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely smooth going. Lott told reporters that one
infuriated senator almost broke the majority leader's desk, he
pounded on it so magnificently at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But for those not involved in the adjournment negotiations, time
ticked by slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Once a deal was reached with Kohl, the Senate, known for its
snail-paced deliberations, flipped on the power jets and switched
to warp speed. As members stood up to praise Kohl and his efforts
to protect dairy farmers, Lott interrupted the colloquy, saying
``be profound, but be succinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Senate jumped on its omnibus bill and pulled out
of Capitol Hill.

H. CLAY EARLES, 86, SPEEDWAY OWNER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   H. Clay Earles, who 53 years ago carved a hardscrabble racetrack
out of the red clay of southern Virginia and then painstakingly
turned it into a cash-spewing shrine to the cult of the stock car,
died Tuesday at his home in Martinsville, Va. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Earles' Martinsville Speedway, famed and feared for its cramped,
dangerous track, is striking testament to the growth of an
industry. At the first race in 1947, the year after Earles starting
building the track, Red Byron won a purse of $500; winners' purses
in recent years have surpassed $170,000. The track now has 81,000
seats, 26 corporate suites and a helicopter for the speedy
evacuation of anyone seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The speedway was almost as renowned for its springtime azaleas
as its growling 750-horsepower engines. Earles made special efforts
to keep things nice, such as repainting the white walls after each
race, although some in attendance could not help suspecting the
consummate showman might have been more interested in a fresh
canvas for new scrawls of automotive violence. He raffled off
diamond rings and new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trophies, he gave winners grandfather clocks. Richard
Petty, the king of stock car racing and the record winner at
Martinsville, got 12. (He would have gotten three more, but the
practice did not start until 1964.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that success and wealth appear to have gone to Earles' head.
His home was a trailer parked next to the track. On a wall plaque
were his old brass knuckles, a reminder of the gritty sprouting of
the sport from the souped-up cars that operators of illegal stills
used to elude the law during Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Earles is credited with being an instrumental figure in taking a
county fair competition among daredevil good ol' boys and turning
it into one of America's richest sporting spectacles. An early
partner in his new Martinsville Speedway was Bill France, who
provided a field of drivers and paid for advertising in exchange
for 25 percent of the profits. The next year the National
Association of Stock Car Auto Racing was incorporated, with France
as its first president. Martinsville is the only one of NASCAR's
original tracks still in operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay Earles was one of the original pioneers of stock car auto
racing,'' said Mike Helton, senior vice president and chief
operating officer of NASCAR. ``Clay and Martinsville Speedway
played an integral role in the early years of NASCAR's
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Earles was one of four children born on a tobacco farm near
Axton, Va. He was educated in a one-room school and earned his
first money at the age of 5 by selling unwanted leaves from his
father's crop. He dropped out of high school at 16 to help his
family by making 25 cents an hour in a furniture factory.
</P>
<P>
   He soon went into business for himself. A pool hall he opened
failed in six months. He then bought a gas station, which turned a
profit. He was able to qualify for a loan to buy the first drive-in
restaurant in Martinsville. The restaurant also succeeded. He sold
that to buy another gas station, which he kept until 1954 and sold
because the track was taking so much of his time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after seeing the crowds that races in nearby North
Carolina attracted, he bought 30 acres to build the track. At the
time, stock car races were mainly held at fairgrounds, and
free-standing tracks were rare.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the first race in 1947, he and France proclaimed that
it would be dust-free because of the oil and other materials they
spread on the track. More than 6,000 fans, most dressed in their
Sunday best, showed up for the race, where only 750 seats were
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be the dustiest race I've ever seen,'' Earles
recalled in a 1998 interview. ``When the race started, it looked
like someone had dropped the atomic bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The 0.526-mile track was paved in 1955 and since then has
expanded to cover 300 acres, including a chalet village for tent
entertainment. But it is the track itself, half the size of some of
the giants on the prestigious Winston Cup circuit, that captivates
aficionados. It has 800-foot straightaways and short, tight turns
banked at only 12 degrees. It has been called two drag strips with
short turns.
</P>
<P>
   This shorter course created a different sort of racing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the superspeedways where the big-dollar cars and their
horsepower advantage over the smaller teams and independents made
the big teams clear favorites,'' said an article by Matt McLaughlin
in the magazine Speedworld, ``Martinsville was a driver's track
where strategy and luck often won out over brute horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   But this has meant that races almost always leave cars with
smudges of other cars' paint. ``No car completes 500 laps without
damage,'' proclaimed the speedway's own press release.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numerous wrecks and flips, the track maintains that
there have been few serious injuries. Two racers have died at the
track: Richie Evans in 1985 and Charlie Jarzombeck in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the two worst days in my life,'' Earles said.
</P>
<P>
   Earles got numerous industry and local civic awards, and he
appeared in the 1973 movie, ``The Last American Hero,'' as himself.
The film was later retitled ``Hard Charger.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues remembered him as congenial but determined, a hard
driver who last took a vacation in 1959. ``He knew what he wanted
to do and how he wanted to do it,'' said Junie Donlavey, a
Richmond, Va., car owner. ``If you wanted to try to lead him in
another direction, that's when he got tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Dorothy E. Campbell and Mary E.
Weatherford, both of Martinsville; two grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren. His grandson Clay Campbell has been serving as
president of the speedway board.
</P>
<P>
   His sympathies were always with the little guy, with people who
had to strain to pay the cost of a NASCAR ticket. In 1987, he
battled unsuccessfully against a decision to reschedule a
rained-out weekend race for the following Monday. He said people
had jobs to go to, and they were entitled to see the makeup race in
their off hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sell a man something, I want him to have his money's
worth,'' he said. ``How would you like to put out $35 for a ticket
and not get anything for it? I know I wouldn't.''

 &HT;    Survey: Attendants dread flights with New York, Palm Beach
travelers
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A recent survey of U.S. flight
attendants sought to find out what assignments they dreaded most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to Australia,'' was the most popular response,
followed by ``Anything to Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Obvious choices, of course, given the exhausting physical
demands of Trans-Pacific travel.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a surprising salvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything with New Yorkers or Floridians on board,'' the flight
attendants answered. And most of those responses specifically
singled out trips to and from Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine, exposed an
industry secret long hidden behind the smiling ``buh-byes'' at the
cabin doors and the ``love to fly'' marketing campaigns. Nothing
strikes fear in the hearts of an otherwise emotionally grounded
flight crew the way a fuselage full of Palm Beachers and New
Yorkers does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Beach people are used to getting what they want,'' said
Barbara Peck, Travel &AMP; Leisure's executive editor. ``New Yorkers,
too, demand a certain level of professionalism. When they're
disappointed, it's the flight attendants who hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The snowbird season begins in earnest this weekend with the
annual holiday migration of northern visitors to Palm Beach
International Airport. Even optimists within the industry
acknowledge the weeks ahead will be troubled by oversold flights,
weather delays and stress.
</P>
<P>
   Seats are tighter, schedules are looser, ticket prices are
higher and passenger satisfaction lower. Who would you expect to be
on the cutting edge of the complaint wave?
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers and Palm Beachers, naturally. Within the ranks of
flight attendants, the Palm Beach-New York flights have gained a
dubious notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flight is high service and has high load level,'' said
Patricia Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants
in Washington, D.C. ``It's a hard 2 1/2 hours. Often, there's a
higher expectation among passengers of the service they should
receive than we're able to deliver. When they don't get it, there
can be problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural mix has always been explosive on runs between the
islands of Palm Beach and Manhattan. Palm Beachers believe their
right to comfort is inherent and self-evident; New Yorkers expect
to be satisfied because no one wants to see them when they're not.
The components for ugliness are lined from aisle to window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the stereotypes,'' said one veteran flight attendant,
who asked not to be identified, ``and you'll get the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   That picture includes overhead luggage compartments jammed with
winter coats, tennis racquets, golf clubs and uptown shopping bags
stuffed with boxed gifts. Flight attendants are besieged by
mournful cries for decaffeinated coffee and pleas for blankets.
</P>
<P>
   At mealtime, flight attendants ask the obligatory question _
``chicken or beef'' _ and get ``fish'' for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Just leaving the gate is an ordeal in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to get passengers on and off these flights can be
difficult,'' said Jean Reetz, a 13-year veteran with Delta Air
Lines who has flown the Palm Beach-New York route often. ``When you
start out with too much carry-on luggage, it sets a bad tone for
the flight. Passengers are upset because they can't find a place
for it, and we're stressed because we have to take their bags and
check them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flights between PBIA and New York typically rank among the worst
for on-time performance. Three of the 10 most chronically late
flights at PBIA last tourist season were New York segments,
according to Bureau of Transportation statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Friend, a United Airlines attendant for 33 years and the leader
of a union that represents 46,000 flight attendants with 28
carriers, believes all parties must accept new realities about air
travel and its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the companies' commercials would make you think that
flying is a luxurious experience,'' she said. ``But it is no longer
luxurious. It is mass transit in the air. As a flight attendant, I
have to deal with the brunt of the false expectation. But, hey, I
didn't make the decision to move the seats so close to each other.
Yet, I'm the one who gets chewed out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On computer bulletin boards and within their work ranks, flight
attendants have taken to a new term for passengers: The Enemy.
Responses to the survey graphically underscored the widening gap in
relations between customer and employee. Seventy-four percent of
flight attendants responding said they had experienced incidents
when a passenger interfered with a crew member. Some examples they
cited of their testy times in air travel:
</P>
<P>
   ``A man was going to punch his wife but missed her and nailed
the flight attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman doctor brought five carry-ons. When told she had to
check three, she went and hit the pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A female passenger who appeared to have taken drugs in the lav
started ripping hair out of the flight attendant's head.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 flight attendants responded to the Travel &AMP;
Leisure queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's generated a lot of interest because this is inside
information you don't usually ask flight attendants,'' said Liz
Curtis, spokesman for the magazine. ``They know a lot about flying,
but it isn't often you hear much from them.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be for good reason. Lily Ledbetter is in her first
year as a Delta flight attendant. She is a New Yorker who regularly
works the flight from LaGuardia to West Palm Beach. Ledbetter says
she has already figured out the best way to deal with New Yorkers
and Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to just stay mellow, no matter what,'' she
said. ``And bite your tongue.''

 &HT;    Cloudy weather dims turnout for pandas
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gray skies and forecasts of long lines dampened ticket
sales for the debut of Zoo Atlanta's panda exhibit, but nobody was
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials predicted up to 15,000 people would enter the
gates Saturday. The final tally was more like 6,000, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be bad. I thought there was going to
be a crush of people out here,'' said Amy White of Sandy Springs,
who arrived shortly after 11 a.m. ``We waited for just five minutes
to get our tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest visitors began showing up at 6:30 a.m. and formed a
long line at the front gate. By noon, however, the line had
disappeared, and inside, the wait to see Yang Yang and Lun Lun was
15 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a blessing in disguise because every visitor
who came out got to see them,'' said Zoo Atlanta spokeswoman Megan
Winokur, who attributed the lower-than expected turnout to the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Calvin, his wife, and 7-year-old son arrived at 8:15 a.m.
and saw the pandas about an hour later. The Huntsville, Ala.,
family drove to Atlanta on Friday, and after spending Saturday at
the zoo, planned to catch a NASCAR race today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the pandas) looked very sleepy, very peaceful,'' said
Calvin, a Zoo Atlanta member. ``They popped up once and kind of
rolled over and went back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening-day activities began with the same pomp and circumstance
that has accompanied the pandas since they left China in early
November. Zoo officials held a ribbon-cutting in front of the
exhibit at 8:30 a.m. The entertainment that followed paid tribute
to the bears' Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese dragons undulated to the beat of drums, while three
women dressed in colorful silk kimonos sat outside the gift shop
plucking traditional tunes on stringed instruments. Panda dancers
waved bamboo stalks as they twirled to the music of the Orient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese president came to the United States and didn't get
treatment like this,'' said Ming Jiang, whose daughter was one of
the dancers. ``That's the good part. There's no politics involved,
and it lets people really come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside the bears, the panda pavilion's Pandamonium gift shop was
a huge hit. Among the items 9-year-old Ben Magill of Lilburn
carried in a shopping bag were two panda teddy bears, a panda
flashlight and a panda key chain.
</P>
<P>
   Magill's father was surprised at the size of the bears. Each
weighs less than 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a lot smaller than we thought they were going to
be,'' said Will Magill.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee resident Dot Farthing invited her daughter and
granddaughter from Virginia to see the pandas on opening day. The
three were impressed by the exotic bears, but it was another animal
that captured their fancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to start an international incident,'' said Dot's
daughter, Patricia Young. ``The pandas were cute, but Willie B.
(the gorilla) will always be the king.''

GOVERNOR UPSTAGES A RIVAL OVER CLEANUP OF RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On Friday, Nov. 12, aides to Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer let reporters know that New York state was about to
sue General Electric over the dumping of toxic waste in the Hudson
River, a move long demanded by environmentalists. The news
conference would be on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, an aide to Gov. George Pataki called reporters
to say that the governor would be making his own announcement about
GE on Saturday, two days before Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was curious. The Pataki administration rarely makes
news on a Saturday, an inconvenient day for state officials and
reporters alike, and there was no hurry about the governor's
announcement, an order that GE clean up PCB-contaminated soil at a
defunct factory, which had been in the works for months.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest evidence that for the Republican governor and
his aides, the sudden prominence of the Democratic attorney general
on environmental issues has become a sore spot. When asked,
administration officials did not deny that their Saturday
announcement was intended to take a little wind out of the attorney
general's sails and keep Pataki's name in the news.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office dismisses the suggestion that there is any
competition to be the state's leading defender of air and water,
fish and fowl. ``The governor has a long and distinguished record
on environmental protection,'' said Michael McKeon, his press
secretary. ``He is very secure in his record.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that the dynamic has changed. For four
years, Pataki was, without question, New York's most prominent
conservationist. There were always legislators and advocates who
took some positions before he did, or criticized his record, but
there were serious limits on what they could accomplish without his
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spitzer took office this year, taking control of the
state's power to prosecute and litigate. His actions have gained
heavy coverage from the news media and rave reviews from
environmentalists and editorial writers.
</P>
<P>
   He sued 17 power plants in other states over air pollution that
blows across state lines, making New York the first state to try
that tactic. He was the first in the state to sue GE over the
dumping of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, into the river.
Specifically, he charged that for years the contamination has kept
the state from dredging a shipping channel, the Champlain Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The danger to Pataki is not only that he might have to share the
stage with Spitzer, but also that the administration's responses to
the situation will seem petty or political. Recently, when the
governor announced a major clean-air project, environmentalists who
had criticized him were barred from the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   After Spitzer announced his suit against GE, administration
officials, in some cases, seemed to be reaching for arguments
against it. In particular, they insisted that there was no need to
dredge the canal, because boats could use it with no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to people who live and work along the 35-mile-long
canal, which links Lake Champlain to the Hudson River. ``I see
boats get stuck in the mud all the time,'' said Joanne Fuller,
tourism promotion administrator for Washington County, who has
lived beside the waterway for 19 years, as silt deposits have made
it shallower. ``Some tour-boat companies have given up coming
through here. It has hurt the economy of the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the village of Fort Edward say the landing there
has become inaccessible to most boats, hurting local business. John
Tobin, a lawyer for a group of barge, tugboat and tanker operators,
said: ``It's a huge problem. You can't get boats through, and if
you try, you can get hung up on the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Thruway Authority, which operates the canal, conceded
that getting boats through sometimes meant removing cargo, or using
dams to raise the water level.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, environmentalists are happier now with
Pataki than ever before. He recently ordered New York's power
plants to meet the toughest air emissions standards in the nation.
He made New York the second state, after California, to adopt new
emission controls for new cars and trucks. And this month he
ordered the strictest rules in the country for cleaning up a
gasoline additive that has polluted ground water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like there's some competition going on, and that's
fine, because they're both doing some good things,'' said Cara Lee,
environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a conservation group.
``But whether or not there's competition, I don't understand the
administration's reaction. They have been a little touchy.''

MARBURY'S ATTITUDE RUBS NETS THE WRONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the New Jersey Nets ran through plays at their
shoot-around before Friday night's game against Boston, Stephon
Marbury pointed at Keith Van Horn and told the power forward to set
a screen for him. Van Horn replied that the play did not call for a
screen, but Marbury said to do it anyway because it would loosen up
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence for a few moments as everyone's eyes shifted
from coach Don Casey to Marbury to the assistant Jimmy Lynam. Who
was going to take control, they wondered? When the issue was
settled, Van Horn ran over to set the pick, and Marbury got his
way. To some Nets players, the incident illustrated one of the
team's major problems: Marbury's personality is too domineering and
no one in the franchise will press him to tone it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just abrasive,'' said one Nets veteran, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``He gets on Kerry Kittles and Keith. He
doesn't respect them as players, and I think that hurts us. I hate
to see expressions on guys' faces now. When they walk into the
locker room, their heads are down and nobody talks to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player. You can't take nothing away from him. But
we see right through him. Maybe it's not even his fault. They put
him in the driver's seat, handed over the keys and said, `Make us
go.' At 22 years old, that's a lot to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   For fear of ruining their relationship with the franchise, no
players or officials would speak on the record about the tension
between Marbury and some of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But several members of the organization made it clear that as
the Nets (1-8) prepare for next week's critical four-game Western
Conference road trip, one that could determine Casey's future, the
biggest player controversy facing the club has nothing to do with
Kittles or Jamie Feick and everything to do with the team's star
point guard. Not his game, but his personality, which some of his
teammates view as selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nets players began souring on Marbury, they said, after he
led the National Basketball Association in scoring, assists and
steals during the preseason; they overheard him telling people he
was going to lead the league in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   One player said Marbury told Indiana's Al Harrington that he
wanted to win the scoring title. From then on, some players began
thinking that Marbury, who entered Saturday night's home game
against Philadelphia ranked third in the league in scoring with
27.1 points a game, cared more about scoring points than winning
games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had made such a statement to Harrington,
Marbury said, ``I have no comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps five or six Nets players, including some starters, have
a beef with Marbury. And just about all the coaches and players
agree that the youngest and most talented Net has a domineering,
sometimes harsh personality. But not everyone in the Nets locker
room believes that Marbury is a problem. Some say that he is a guy
who just wants badly to win and that the team would benefit if more
of the Nets had his toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just real,'' one player said. ``He's not afraid to speak
his mind. Some of the guys who are talking just need to step up
their games and play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's audacity was evident on March 12 in his first
appearance as a Net. Elliot Perry and Chris Carr, whom Minnesota
had traded to the Nets with Marbury, were sitting on the dais with
Nets hats in front of them. When Marbury walked in, he grabbed
their hats and told them to put them on. They did. That night,
after Philadelphia handed the Nets their 16th loss in 19 games,
Marbury, who did not play, tore into some of them, particularly
Kittles, about what they had done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I think some guys arched their eyebrows at his
verbal barrage,'' General Manager John Nash said during the
preseason. ``But I think he toned it down as he gained a respect
and appreciation for them. But I think they all upped their effort
a little bit, too. Nobody wants to be singled out as the guy not
pulling his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steph demands effort, like Michael Jordan did. If he passes
you the ball and you're wide open, you're expected to make the shot
because don't expect to get the second pass if you threw a brick up
the first time. Don't let me work my tail off to get you a
wide-open shot and you don't make it, especially if it's because
you're not in shape or didn't practice hard yesterday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marbury, who admits to having a dominant personality, said
before this season that he did not worry about hurting feelings
when critiquing a teammate's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about that; it's about winning,'' he said. ``If I'm
not doing something right, or if you think I'm not doing something
right, then tell me. And if I can say something to a guy that's
going to help us win, then I'll say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's strong disposition might not be viewed so negatively
by certain players if the Nets were winning. When the club won five
of eight preseason games, those players seemed willing to overlook
Marbury's ways. But the losing, which has often underscored his
strong play and some of his teammates' poor play, has worsened the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of respect that some players have for Marbury seems to
be reciprocal. Marbury has made several comments that belittle his
teammates or imply an absence of faith in their ability. For
instance, after Friday's loss to Boston, in which he scored 14 of
his team-high 26 points in the third quarter, Marbury said, ``When
I come out of the game and we're down five and then I get back in
the game and we're down 11, it's so hard to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when Marbury was taken out with three minutes eight
seconds left in the third quarter, the Nets trailed by 10 points.
The Nets cut the deficit to five points heading into the fourth,
and when Marbury returned with 9:54 to play, the Nets were down by
nine. So they actually gained a point with him on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With 72 games left to play and few realistic trade scenarios,
Marbury and this collection of Nets will probably be together for a
long time. When asked what it would take to mend the differences
between Marbury and some of his teammates, one veteran pointed to
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Casey's got to start going off on Stephon,'' he said.
``Case needs to realize that if this continues, he's going to lose
his job anyway, so he might as well go off on him and stop letting
him get away with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be in Casey's personality to pull rank, and his
one-year, $1.1 million contract gives him far less security than
Marbury, who last season signed a six-year, $70.875 million
extension. But if the coach does not assert his authority, his team
may soon be in shambles and his job may be history.

U.S. READIES A MAJOR LAND-PROTECTION INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ariz., Calif., Mont., Ore., Utah)  (Adds ``In addition to the two Colorado sites'' before list of
sites in last graf) 
(bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTEZ, Colo. _ As one of its last major public land
initiatives, the Clinton administration is preparing to designate
as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the West that
federal officials say need protection from future commercial
development and recreational overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who came to Colorado for the
weekend to build support for the action, said the administration
had decided to act because, in many cases, Congress had failed to
act on proposed legislation that would accomplish the same thing.
Delays, he said, had prompted President Clinton to consider
invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the president the
authority to act by executive order in the case of any lands that
have scientific, historic or archaeological significance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, every president except Richard M.
Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush has designated at least one
national monument. There are now more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the administration was more than willing to allow
Congress to take the lead. But conceding that opposition in some
cases might be strong, he said the president was willing to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope this is not our last major initiative, but it
is a major undertaking,'' Babbitt said in an interview Friday
before hiking through part of the 73,000 acres he wants added to
the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction. Saturday he
toured ancient Indian ruins on a 165,000-acre site here that he
wants declared a monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are growing year by year,'' he said, referring to
commercial and recreation pressures on the lands in question.
``Congress hasn't responded at all. So rather than leave it all to
the 11th hour, the president is ready to consider these on a
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two Colorado sites, the other proposed monuments are
in Arizona, California, Montana and Oregon. Having toured them all
within the last year, Babbitt said he had found growing public
support for granting them monument status, which would effectively
provide greater protections through the National Park Service or
the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   All the lands under consideration are managed by the land
bureau, but monument status would add access restrictions and
ensure that they cannot be developed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation groups and environmentalists are applauding the
administration initiative. ``It sends a very important signal that
these special places deserve more protection than they're
getting,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation. ``This tells the world that they are very
significant sites.''
</P>
<P>
   But many opponents view it as little more than a political
gambit by Clinton, a way for him to seal his legacy as an
environmentalist and cement environmental groups' support for Vice
President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers from Western states, like Sens. Robert
Bennett of Utah and Wayne Allard of Colorado, object to federal
intervention within their borders without sufficient local input.
And commercial interests say the initiative is yet another attempt
by the administration to ignore the economic consequences of
environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly smacks of another anti-mining advocacy
effort,'' said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining
Association. ``We can't arbitrarily move mines around. You have to
go where the minerals are, and if they continue to withdraw lands
where the mines are, it means going elsewhere to develop, which
means out of the country and the loss of millions of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Myra Hyde, director of environmental issues for the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose members own herds that graze on
open lands, said: ``The economics are far-reaching. Once you take
lands out of production, it affects whole communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Interior Department said that some of the lands
in question have mineral resources but none have active mines. They
also said grazing rights would probably not be affected by the
designations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of a House national parks
and public lands subcommittee, sponsored legislation two years ago
that would require approval of Congress as well as the governor and
state legislature to designate a national monument that exceeds
5,000 acres. It passed the House, but a companion Senate bill is
still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the most recent national monument _ Grand
Staircase-Escalante, a 1.9 million-acre tract in southern Utah _
was designated by Clinton in 1996, Hansen called the designation
``the biggest land grab in the nation.'' And in a letter in October
to Babbitt expressing concern over monument designations in their
state, three Colorado lawmakers _ Allard, Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell and Rep. Scott McInnis _ described it as a ``heavy-handed
federal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said in an interview last week that Babbitt had yet to
respond to the letter. He criticized administration officials for
``storming in and storming out without doing the proper legwork''
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, who attended a public forum led by Babbitt at the
Colorado National Monument on Friday, predicted that Congress would
expand the monument, which is in his district, within the
administration's timetable. With regard to the other lands, he
added: ``Executive order is not the way to go. The Antiquities Act
was never intended to bypass Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Freemyer, staff director of Hansen's subcommittee, said
that even without Hansen's bill, the administration already had
``hundreds of tools'' to manage public lands without drawing on a
93-year-old measure that was passed before agencies like the park
service were created to manage and protect federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big photo-op declaration, which really isn't
necessary,'' he said of Babbitt's initiative. ``They're just doing
what Al Gore likes to do best, the champion of the environment
warning that if we don't make these places monuments, the
bulldozers are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   To administration officials and environmental groups, that
prospect is not much of an exaggeration. As the expanding national
economy of the 1990s has created more business opportunities and
disposable income, they contend, open lands have become more
vulnerable to commercial development, recreational use and
encroaching sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, which was attended by about 200 people, Babbitt
said that whether it is Congress or Clinton who makes the
designations, monument status would assure that ``the next seven
generations'' have the same opportunity to enjoy the lands that
visitors have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My object, unequivocally,'' he said, ``is to bring this to a
mutually agreeable conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two Colorado sites, the areas designated are
the Arizona strip, on the north rim of the Grand Canyon; Perry Mesa
near Flagstaff, Ariz.; La Cienega near Tucson; the Missouri Breaks
along 140 miles of the Missouri River in Montana; Steens Mountain,
in southeast Oregon; Soda Mountain, in southern Oregon; the Santa
Rosa Mountains, near Palm Springs, Calif.; the Carrizo Plain, in
California's central valley; the Otay Mountains, east of San Diego,
and thousands of islands and rocks off the California coast.

35 PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS FAIL NATIONAL CIVICS TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for change in 6th graf: read it as from $4.4 million, sted
to) 
(bl) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One-third of the country's high school seniors do not understand
the fundamentals of American government, according to results of a
national test administered by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   The tests showed that 26 percent of high school seniors had
``proficient'' knowledge of the workings of the government. And
most of those polled, 65 percent, were defined as ``at or above'' a
basic level. But 35 percent were below the minimum requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The test was part of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, often called the nation's report card.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diane Ravitch, a member of the governing board that designed
the test and an education official in the Bush administration, said
the results were ``deeply troubling'' and called for a
strengthening of civics curriculum. ``Only 9 percent of the kids
were able to give two reasons why it is important for citizens to
be involved in a democratic society,'' said Dr. Ravitch of a
question posed to high school seniors. ``These are questions where
you would expect voters to know how to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ravitch pointed out that the seniors would all be eligible
to vote in next November's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, however, said he was pleased
that 25 percent reached proficiency, especially given widespread
voter apathy and adult ignorance of the democratic process. He
called the results ``an opportunity for renewal and improvement''
and said the department would increase funds for civics education
to $10 million from $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The tests included multiple choice and answers that had to be
written out. They were conducted in 1998 with nationally
representative samples of 22,000 4th-, 8th- and 12th-graders in
public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, even critics conceded, were not easy. One
question, with no options listed to choose from, asked high school
seniors to list two ways the American system of government is
designed to prevent ``absolute arbitrary power'' and ``governing
without settled laws.''
</P>
<P>
   At the eighth-grade level, 81 percent of the students identified
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as someone who was concerned
about the injustice of segregation laws, although only 6 percent
were able to describe two ways that countries benefit from having a
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The test found that 74 percent of the fourth graders tested knew
that in the United States, laws must be applied to everyone
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Students in center city schools had lower scores on average than
those in urban fringe or large town and rural locations, although
by senior year there did not appear to be a difference based on
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``By themselves these efforts cannot overcome the general
indifference that so many adult Americans seem to have about
participation in our democracy,'' Riley said. ``If older Americans
will not model good behavior, we should not expect our young people
to be any different.''

HINGIS DOWNS WILLIAMS, WILL FACE DAVENPORT IN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the crowded concourse at Madison Square Garden
Saturday, the sound system blasted a zippy Spice Girls soundtrack
and the beading booth did a booming business decorating heads of
all hues with the hairdo Venus and Serena made famous: the place
positively pulsated to an up-with-women's-tennis beat.
</P>
<P>
   Things were a little more cut-throat inside, where the theme for
the afternoon was a variation on feeding time at the zoo. The
Garden arena possessed the bite and snarl of a lion's den, but
rather than watching the inevitable chemistry that unfolds when
meat is tossed to hungry animals, the spectators at Saturday's
first Chase Championships semifinal got to see what happens when
Martina Hingis and Venus Williams are tossed to each other in a
main event. Then it became a waiting game to see who devoured whom
first for bragging rights to a primary role in the year's final
final.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Hingis had her smile and savvy; the 6-foot-2-inch
Williams had her shriek and physique. Nothing in common, everything
at stake, including a crack at this event's $500,000 title.
</P>
<P>
   After 109 minutes of impassioned rallies and breakneck volleys,
it was Hingis, the defending Chase champion, who flashed her
well-rehearsed Garfield grin upon assuring herself of a 6-4, 7-6
(7-2) decision while Williams, wincing from a secret neck injury
she'd been hiding and harboring all week, departed in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played nicely,'' said Williams, not particularly nicely.
``Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up with her today because of
extenuating circumstances. All in all, I wasn't very healthy, and
my dad advised me not to play,'' Williams said of her month-old
neck strain. ``Naturally, as a child I didn't listen, and now I'm
in a worse situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's best-of-3 set finale, Hingis will tackle another
three-time Chase finalist, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who
crafted a relentless recovery from a slow start against
seventh-seeded Nathalie Tauziat to secure a 7-6 (7-3), 6-0 victory,
her 12th in 15 meetings, at the expense of the increasingly
flummoxed 32-year-old Frenchwoman.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing a set point with a flimsy return in the 12th game
of the opening set as an obviously regrouping Davenport, back from
a 4-1 deficit, attempted to force the tiebreaker, Tauziat seemed to
unravel. In the second set, she won just four points, a statistic
that, in Davenport's opinion, spoke for itself: ``Once I got the
first break to go up 2-0, it was pretty much over,'' said the
winner, who refused to accuse Tauziat of tanking. ``It has been an
extremely long year for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The starring cast for the 1999 Chase final replicates last
year's, where Hingis, determined to extract some revenge after
losing her number one spot to Davenport, wore her down and out in
four sets. This year Hingis' rank is not endangered, but her title
defense could be: Davenport has the edge in their rivalry, 8-7, and
had defeated the Swiss teen in their two previous meetings, the
most recent of them last week's Chase tuneup in Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis, energized by her success against Williams, claimed
she would carry only positive thoughts into the finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I played almost perfect,'' said Hingis, who's never been
shy about patting herself on the back after a good day at the
office. ``I played much better, much smarter.'' Asked whether she
had outsmarted her bigger, stronger opponent, Hingis elected to be
coy: ``I don't know, I tried to, but I had to do something because,
as I've said, I can't overpower her. I've been more lifting weights
a bit, and also I think I got better technically in my ground
strokes and my serve.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hingis, she would have appreciated the caliber of
Saturday's semifinal even if Williams had been the player to
survive it: ``Even if I lost, I think it still had been a great
match,'' said Hingis, whose semifinal struggle against Williams at
the U.S. Open was the most fiercely contested match of the
tournament and the most debilitating defeat of Williams' career.
``I think we played even better here at the Garden, even more
rallies; you would think on a fast surface like here, there's no
way you're going to have rallies like today, but everything is
possible,'' said Hingis, who won the majority of them, notably the
16-stroke barrage that played out like a heated conversation and
guaranteed the opening set to Hingis on a netted backhand from
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After another doomed backhand cost Williams her service game in
the first game of the second set, she was tended to by a trainer in
her changeover chair, and continued to ice her neck during every
ensuing break. But just when Hingis, who had snuffed out all eight
break points she'd confronted, appeared to be coasting toward a 4-2
advantage, Williams unleashed a laser of a forehand return at break
point to level things 3-3, then held serve to sneak ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the tiebreaker, Williams regressed: a double fault put
her 4-1 in arrears, and two consecutive unforced backhand errors, a
key contribution to her 33 unforced errors, ushered Hingis into
match point territory at 6-2. Though Williams had a chance to take
control of the point with her serve, Hingis wrestled it back to her
side of the net and ended things with a down-the-line forehand pass
off a brilliant crosscourt forehand volley from the loser. Against
anyone else, the volley would have proved daunting; against Hingis,
it was simply fodder for one last bit of one-upsmanship.

CLINTON, IN GREECE, SUGGESTS US ERRED IN BACKING JUNTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ A day after anti-American protesters rioted in the
streets here, President Clinton came close Saturday to apologizing
for the tacit US support for the military junta that ruled Greece
from 1967 to 1974, suggesting that the United States should have
been more supportive of democracy in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the junta took over in 1967 here, the United States
allowed its interests in prosecuting the Cold War to prevail over
its interests _ I should say, its obligation _ to support
democracy, which was, after all, the cause for which we fought the
Cold War,'' Clinton told a group of Greek political and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we acknowledge that,'' the president
added to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks a day after demonstrators went on a
rampage in downtown Athens, smashing storefronts and setting fires.
The expectation of protests had led authorities to impose
especially strict security measures, including closing off entire
sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton received a bit of a security scare aboard Air
Force One en route to Florence. Secret Service agents, responding
to a threat, asked plane passengers to check their hand luggage for
``anything suspicious.'' Nothing was found, and the plane landed
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb threats against the White House are not uncommon, but it is
highly unusual for agents to check passengers on the president's
plane during a flight. Passengers and their bags are routinely
checked thoroughly by both agents and bomb-sniffing dogs before a
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conciliatory comments Saturday played well to a Greek
populace still deeply disappointed that the United States had not
condemned the junta, or had not acted when Turkey invaded Cyprus in
1974. Many Greeks are also angry at the NATO bombing this spring of
Yugoslavia, whose Orthodox Christian population shares religious
ties with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The White House downplayed Clinton's remarks, issued at a
diplomatically sensitive time. The president had just arrived in
Athens after five days in Turkey. In both Greece and Turkey,
Clinton called on the parties to come to an agreement on Cyprus,
which is occupied by both ethnic Greeks and ethnic Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an apology,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the
National Security Council. ``The comments represent an affirmation
of the president's views in supporting democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had cut short his visit to Greece from three days to one
after warnings of widespread protests. On Friday night, police
subdued rioting communists and self-described anarchists with tear
gas, resulting in 16 reported injuries and 41 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters were on the rain-soaked streets Saturday, but
security remained extremely tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop, young man, and show me your passport. The communists are
back in power,'' an elderly Greek woman said to a man as he passed
her on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shopkeepers paced around their stores, sweeping up
broken glass and assessing fire damage to their property. The
letters ``USA'' _ with the ``S'' redone to resemble a swastika _
were painted on fences, the work of what government officials
describe as a small group of extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Clinton. It's just a few people who do this,'' said
Dimitra Tsekoura, who owns a Greek art shop in the Plaka, the old
marketplace of Athens. ``Nobody here in the Plaka agrees with it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Saturday brushed off the anti-American protest as an
expression of free speech, adding that he felt ``regret'' at the
merchants' loss of property.
</P>
<P>
   But the president took pains in his public comments to reach out
to the Greeks, mentioning Greek-American friends, White House
aides, and political leaders. He spoke about his childhood home in
Arkansas, where ``my very favorite place to eat with my father was
the Pappas Brothers Cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked that Greek and American business leaders match US funds
for Fulbright scholarships, and that one of the academic grants be
named for Yannos Kranidiotis, a diplomat and former Fulbright
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his visit Saturday morning to the Acropolis, Clinton
drew applause when he told the business group he was ``grateful for
the deep ties of history, kinship and values that bind America and
other freedom-loving nations to Greece _ ties that prove the truth
of Shelley's line, `Eimaste oli Ellines.' We are all Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton even promised to ask the British prime minister, Tony
Blair, about handing back the Elgin Marbles, the Greek sculptures
that the 17th-century British archeologist Lord Elgin took and sold
to the British Museum, Greek Minister of Culture Elisavet Papazoe
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke warmly of the Greeks' friends, the Serbian people,
who the president said have a ``a deep love of freedom,'' and he
noted that the Serbs of Kosovo should be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The conciliatory tone has been a common theme of Clinton's
10-day European trip. In Turkey, Clinton tweaked the government
about human rights abuses, but added that the nation has come a
long way in advancing freedom of speech and other rights.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were immediately followed by the blunt admission by
Turkish President Suleiman Demirel that ``clearly, there is
torture'' in Turkey. Demirel added that the torture is not
state-sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   At the Istanbul conference of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Clinton publicly admonished Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin for Moscow's seven-week bombing campaign
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also tempered his remarks by telling world
leaders: ``I have often asked myself, as I hope all of you have,
what I would do if I were in President Yeltsin's place. I think
before any of us sit in judgment, we should be able to answer that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's warm comments in Greece were peppered with pleas to
advance two foreign policy objectives in the region: European Union
membership for Turkey and an agreement on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's near-apology Saturday recalled occasions when the
president said he was sorry for things the US government did before
he was president. In May of 1997, he apologized to the victims of
the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, which began in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, he apologized for Cold War radiation
experiments conducted on humans from 1945 to 1947. And last March
he apologized to a group of Guatemalan leaders for US support for
right-wing governments that have been linked to the deaths of tens
of thousands of rebels in a civil war that began in the 1960s.

SMITH STORY IS NO SLAM DUNK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the plausible exceptions of Vlade Divac's flop defense,
shoeless Dennis Rodman, Latrell Sprewell's interpretation of
getting a grip, the rumor that Rick Pitino invented basketball,
Shaq's 15 feet of fame, David Stern's beard, Michael Jordan in
right field, the Mark Jackson shimmy, the challenge of typing
``Szczerbiak'' and Donald T. Sterling's not-so-secret desire for a
salary scale that corresponds to his players' heights, Leon Smith
may have provided the most-disturbing, NBA-related news we've
fielded in quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   Here's last week's skinny for those of you just climbing down
from the tree:
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 Smith, who was the last selection in the first
round of the 1999 NBA Draft, decorated his face with green war
paint, overdosed on aspirin and told responding police officers he
was a Native American at war with Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   His path to a psychiatric ward near Dallas, began in Chicago,
where Smith was a ward of the state of Illinois. He lived in
several group homes and played at famed Martin Luther King High for
Landon ``Sonny'' Cox, the Don King of Illinois basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey included a rumor that Smith was to enroll at Compton
High.
</P>
<P>
   In four years at MLK, Smith didn't develop any skill to speak
of, but he was large, athletic and a bit short of having the
academic scoring average to qualify for NCAA eligibility. So he
entered the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dallas Mavericks coach and general manager Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Nelson's personnel maneuvers can be as
frightening and clumsy as Mr. Magoo turning cartwheels in a mine
field.
</P>
<P>
   In this exercise, Nellie convinced the San Antonio Spurs to
draft the ultra-raw Smith at No. 29, then he handed over
second-round picks to acquire his rights. To Nelson's credit, he
and Smith's agent had a plan: Leon would play at a lower level of
pro ball this season, then with requisite improvement, and still a
Mavericks property he'd check in at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith changed two things, his agent and his mind; we're
uncertain as to which occurred first. Without consistent life
lessons from a respected adult, Smith according to acquaintances
preferred listening to anyone saying what he wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cutting his teeth in Europe, the CBA or IBL, Smith
decided he could handle Dallas and the NBA now. Nelson had the
balking option, but he was greedy, wanting to ``steal'' a kid with
potential. To keep Smith a first-round pick, mind you Nelson put
the franchise on the hook for three seasons and $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was less than sensational on the Mavs' summer team, wasn't
wanted at training camp, and was given tickets in the vulture
section when he did show up in Dallas to watch the Mavericks early
this season. His next stop was a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to his agent's office haven't been returned, but Smith
reportedly is out of any physical danger. Basketball, which may
qualify as both problem and solution, is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But don't drop Leon Smith's tale at the doorstep of the NBA. The
tragic circumstances of Smith's life had this one choreographed
long before Don Nelson noticed his won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix point guard Jason Kidd continues cuing up hosannas with
his look-away passing, incongruous rebounding and steal-oriented
defending. But the choir should pause long enough to notice that on
a team with Penny Hardaway, Tom Gugliotta, Cliff Robinson and
bouncy rook Shawn Marion Kidd has squeezed off the most field-goal
attempts. If you haven't noticed, Kidd's accuracy brings to mind a
baseball bat and a piata ... That eerie stat won't stop the search
for the ``next'' Kidd from continuing. A few NBA sharpies have
zeroed in on Miami, where Carlos Arroyo handles the rock at Florida
International University. One pro scout referred to the 6-2 junior
from Puerto Rico as the ``closest thing to Kidd out there,'' while
another seasoned evaluator defined Arroyo as a ``cinch first-round
pick whenever he comes out.'' The topper is provided by a college
coach who recently spent several hours rewinding videotape of the
FIU whiz: ``He's the best point guard in the country.'' ... Perhaps
the most unfairly hyped player in the land is UConn forward Ajou
Deng, a 6-10 redshirt freshman (with a 7-2 reach) from Aweil,
Sudan. While on his post-NCAA championship interview tour, Huskies
coach Jim Calhoun referred to the 195-pound Deng as ``a 6-10 Reggie
Lewis,'' and potentially the best player he's ever coached.
Calhoun, of course, coached Lewis and Ray Allen. But he's abandoned
his early hyperbole, urging witnesses to be patient. While in town
to audition for the Clippers prior to the draft, ex-UConn star Rip
Hamilton said Deng could be ``one of the all-time greats.'' After
watching Deng in UConn's visit to Madison Square Garden last
weekend, one NBA scout is convinced the accused ``next Kevin
Garnett'' is at least a year away from having an appreciable impact
at the collegiate level. Beyond that? ``What I noticed,'' the scout
said, ``is that he really doesn't have quick feet.'' In the NBA,
that's a rotten deficiency. ...
</P>
<P>
   We haven't seen the ``next Tim Duncan'' hanging around either,
but one college center who, at least, sort of survived his showdown
with the Wake Forest star three seasons back seems to be returning
to prospect status. Remember, Brad ``Big Continent'' Millard?
Right, the 7-3, 345-pounder from St. Mary's who impressed scouts by
not getting embarrassed when the Gaels played the Demon Deacons in
the first round of the NCAA tournament. Slow feet? No feet. Well,
Millard's still in the baby-steps stage while recovering from
prolonged foot agony, but he did score 18 points and blocked 9
shots in St. Mary's season-opening loss at Colorado. ... Another
ex-prospect sighting has been recorded in LaCrosse, Wis., where
omm'A Givens (UCLA, Pepperdine, obscurity) is hoping to inspire NBA
bounty hunters through his work in the CBA. Givens happens to be
6-11 and burdened by being able to run fast and jump high. ...
</P>
<P>
   Givens' former UCLA teammate, J.R. Henderson, can be found
playing for the IBL's Las Vegas entry. Henderson spent last season
as a second-round apprentice of the Vancouver Grizzlies. One of his
Vegas teammates is DeeAndre Hulett, who flirted with the NBA draft
last summer after one season at College of The Sequoias. One of
their coaches is ex-Clipper assistant Barry Hecker. ... The IBL's
San Diego entry provided the last hoop sighting of rap superstar
Percy ``Master P'' Miller, who announced that being cut by the
Toronto Raptors was an injustice. According to witnesses at Michael
Jordan's camp at Santa Barbara, the unenrolled Mr. P was taken to
the classroom for harsh pickup-game lessons taught by the high
schoolers in attendance. And we've experienced P's mastery at the
Summer Pro League, where each possession was initiated with his
double-edged request for unfortunate teammates to ``Move!'' ...
Despite the best intentions of the NBA's kinder, gentler referees,
the Clippers have managed to rank third in the league in free-throw
attempts and last in scoring. ... Despite his slow statistical
start, the market value of Clipper free-agent-to-be Maurice Taylor
may be airlifted by the likelihood that Detroit's Grant Hill and
San Antonio's Duncan figure to stay put. ... We were squared up to
launch a parting shot, but Stephon Marbury already took it.

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS' SALARIES HIGHEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich are getting richer, and that includes college
presidents, according to an annual national survey released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of college presidents earning more than $500,000 in
salary and benefits grew to eight in 1997-98 from three the
previous year, according to the survey of private college
presidents by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one made more than $300,000, up from 50 the year before,
and 25 four years ago _ making this what the weekly trade newspaper
called the most lucrative year to be a college president.
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Burnett, the outgoing president of Washington and
Jefferson College, near Pittsburgh, left office as the highest-paid
president in the land that year, earning $1,082,624 in salary and
benefits. That was largely because of a generous retirement package
in recognition of years of good service, the Chronicle said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the second-highest-paid president, Orley Herron of
National-Louis University in Evanston, Ill., counted a severance
package, given as inducement to quit, in his overall compensation
of $639,694. For packages that didn't include retirement or
severance, Torsten Wiesel, president of New York's Rockefeller
University, earned the most of any president, at $555,864.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University Chancellor John R. Silber, long among the
nation's highest-paid college executives, earned a total of
$564,690 in salary and benefits, according to the Chronicle, about
$186,000 more than his successor, as BU president, Jon Westling.
But Silber's salary has remained almost the same since 1993-94,
while about 20 presidents on the list reported raises of 25 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Simmons, president of Smith College in Northampton, ranks
among the top-paid presidents at colleges that focus on primarily
undergraduate education, earning $320,478.
</P>
<P>
   The publication surveys the tax forms of 475 private colleges
and universities every year, leaving out the presidents of public
institutions, who tend to earn relatively less than their private
school counterparts.

GORE CAMPAIGNS DOOR TO DOOR, ASSAILING DRUG FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ In the first primary state, senior citizens
frequently drive over the border to fill prescriptions for medicine
in Canada, where the cost is often half of what is charged here.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that drug prices and the competing health
care plans of Al Gore and Bill Bradley are crucial issues in the
race for president.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, pursuing a new line of criticism of his opponent
for the Democratic nomination, Gore suggested that Bradley is a
shill for the pharmaceutical industry and will not help senior
citizens obtain their medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances in Manchester, Keene, Lawrence, Mass., and here
at a conference on disabilities, Gore held himself out as someone
who fights drug companies on behalf of consumers. By contrast, he
said Bradley has an 18-year Senate record of helping the
pharmaceutical giants at the expense of senior citizens and the
poor who struggle to afford prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been a champion of the pharmaceutical industry? You
bet. The record speaks for itself,'' Gore said at a sheet-metal
company in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   The health care issue was also playing in Iowa, where Bradley
argued that this country has been far too timid in broadening
health coverage during an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be fixing our roofs while the sun is shining,''
Bradley said at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Despite
economic growth, he said, ``I see 44 million Americans living
without health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health care plan would expand Medicare to provide
prescription drugs for senior citizens covering costs up to $5,000
a year. Bradley's plan would cover everyone's prescription drugs
after they paid the first $800 in drug costs annually; low-income
people would be subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that threshold is completely unreasonable,'' Gore said
in Lawrence after receiving the endorsement of Senator John F.
Kerry. ``The problem is, the people who most need the help, the
majority of them, will not get it. The contrast is very striking
and very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradley campaign contends that Gore's proposal, which
would cover a little more than 90 percent of all seniors, does not
go far enough. ``Al Gore cuts them off at their moment of greatest
need, compared with Bill Bradley, who helps people with a chronic
problem,'' said Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's New Hampshire director.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also disagree on the issue of generic drugs,
which are less expensive for consumers. While in the Senate, Gore
opposed legislation in 1982 that would have extended patents for
new drugs an additional seven years, preventing them from being
copied by other companies and sold more cheaply as generics.
Bradley cosponsored that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1991, Bradley ranked second for receiving
donations from drug industry political action committees, taking in
$99,707. During that period, he represented New Jersey, home to
many major pharmaceutical companies. He recently said those
contributions had ``zero influence'' over him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also opposed each other in 1993 over a
provision that gave drug companies tax breaks for every worker they
employed in Puerto Rico. The administration tried to eliminate the
loophole to save $7.3 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the General Accounting Office, the provision
provided more than $71,000 in tax benefits for every worker in
Puerto Rico, although the companies pay those workers about
$33,757. Bradley, who said that eliminating the provision would
throw Puerto Rico's economy into chaos, negotiated a compromise
that cut the benefit in half.
</P>
<P>
   The tension over who would do more to help people afford
prescription drugs is part of a bigger battle for dominance on
health care. In recent weeks, Gore has attacked Bradley
relentlessly, contending that Bradley's health care plan, by
eliminating Medicaid, would disproportionately hurt
African-Americans and Latinos, as well as half of all people with
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has responded by saying that Gore's charges
are baseless and employed only to scare people from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bradley last week won the support of Nebraska
Senator Bob Kerrey. ``I do get a little hot under the collar coming
from individuals who were responsible for the failure of health
care reform in 1994 and then gave up on it,'' Kerrey said. ``In
1995, what was the White House doing? They were triangulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey took umbrage at Gore's assertion that Bradley would hurt
low-income blacks by eliminating Medicaid. ``Does he say what the
welfare reform bill did?'' Kerry said of legislation that was
supported by Gore and signed by Clinton into law. ``It eliminated
AFDC. It eliminated a 60-year commitment to support dependent
families.''

TOWN AND TRIBE TAKE STEPS TOWARD HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ Wearing a traditional Native American
headdress, Mashpee Wampanoag Chief Vernon ``Silent Drum'' Lopez on
Saturday sat for the first time beside suited town officials during
the annual Thanksgiving parade.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual scene in this town, where friction between
Native Americans and Pilgrims and their descendants has lasted more
than 350 years.
</P>
<P>
   But two years after a clash between Native American protesters
and Plymouth police resulted in a lawsuit, leaders from both groups
said they hope Saturday's union would mend the rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much going on in the past couple of years
between the Native Americans and others,'' said Kenneth Tavares,
chairman of the Board of Selectmen. ``We are really hoping for a
real healing process and that the two groups could come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Police had no estimate of how many watched the parade, but
organizers put the figure at 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Native leaders from seven tribes and from across the country
were invited as honored guests, said Rodney Randy Joseph, a
Plymouth native and a Wampanoag leader.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who helped organize the event, said all the Native
American leaders arrived Saturday and rode to the parade in
limousines. ``The Town of Plymouth wanted to honor the Indian
people, so they honored us as dignitaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Native American leaders sat down with town officials
Saturday to discuss issues concerning tribes across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd Gray, who was arrested in 1997, said he still has bad
feelings about the disturbance, as well as the long battle over
land between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, 47, said he was not part of a larger protest two years
ago, but was representing his Onondaga Nation in Western
Massachusetts when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pepper-sprayed, thrown on the ground, and my head was
pounded to the ground on the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest erupted into a confrontation with police.
Twenty-five people were arrested at the annual National Day of
Mourning, an observance that challenges stereotypes that paint
Pilgrims as pioneers and Native Americans as savages.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement last year, Native American protesters dropped
police brutality charges, and the town provided $135,000 to the
United American Indians of New England.
</P>
<P>
   While town officials say the pact helped bring Plymouth and
Native American leaders together during Saturday's event, Gray and
others said the invitation still does not change their belief that
Native Americans should not celebrate Thanksgiving. Many tribe
members said they believe their people were killed by Europeans who
arrived in Plymouth in 1620.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (invitation) was more of a symbol to people in
Plymouth than to us,'' Lopez said. ``In the beginning, I didn't
know what to expect. But I guess the purpose is to heal the rift
between natives and European people.''

THE WRONG SIDE AT AMHERST HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art, music, choreography, and common sense were all shunted
aside in Amherst, Mass., last week when the regional high school
decided not to perform the modern American classic ``West Side
Story'' because it might give offense. The complaint, voiced by
some students and parents, was that the score contains racial slurs
and stereotypes that denigrate Puerto Ricans and violence is
portrayed as a way to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Side Story'' is, of course, Leonard Bernstein's brilliant
musical transposing Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to the streets
of mid-20th century New York. Juliet becomes Maria, an ``oh so
pretty'' Puerto Rican.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Shakespeare surviving at all at Amherst
High. Lady Macbeth most certainly advocates violence to solve
problems, and ``Macbeth'' is probably demeaning to Scots and women.
``Hamlet'' contains violence and an unpleasant maternal stereotype.
As for opera, Giuseppe Verdi's ``Aida'' indulges in stereotypes of
ancient Egyptians and Ethiopian slaves. Gaetano Donizetti's ``Lucia
di Lammermoor'' can be written off as being unkind to the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   After straining all the substance out, Amherst may fall back on
a production of ``Bambi,'' unless animal-rights advocates take
offense at Bambi's mother getting shot.
</P>
<P>
   As the century ends, America has become a society of competing
victimizations, where the very language is asked to change daily
lest a word give someone, somewhere, offense.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Culture of Complaint: The Fraying of America,''
Robert Hughes writes: ```Multiculturalism asserts that people with
different roots can coexist, that they can learn to read the
image-banks of others, that they can and should look across the
frontiers of race, language, gender, and age without prejudice or
illusion and learn to think against the background of a hybridized
society.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what ``West Side Story'' offers. It is sad to
see Amherst students deprived of it, and sadder still to see their
elders descend into priggery.

FAITH IN ALLAH

<TEXT>
<P>
   It may yet prove to be that EgyptAir pilot Gamil El Batouty took
down Flight 990 in a wild suicide plunge into the sea off
Nantucket, killing himself and everybody aboard. But we are
uncomfortable with the suggestion that a mention of God indicates
evil intent. It appears from the flight recorder that Batouty
uttered the words ``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' which, translated from
the Arabic, means: ``I put my trust in God.''
</P>
<P>
   What is worrying is the assumption that any reference to God by
a Muslim smacks of a fanaticism that renders the speaker open to
suspicion. ``People of other religions say `Jesus Christ,' or `Oh
my God,' '' said one of Batouty's pilot colleagues, ``and that does
not mean they are preparing to kill people.Why wouldn't it be the
same with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Arabic-language speakers and scholars have pointed out
that the phrase is common in the Middle East and might be uttered
hundreds of times a day by Muslims, just as the word ``Inshalla,''
meaning ``if Allah wills it,'' is used any time anybody in the Arab
world speaks of future intent. The Arabic language is crowded with
Koranic references, just as Western languages were larded by
biblical phases not too long ago, when religion had a firmer hold
in the West than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have become used to suicide bombers in Lebanon and
Israel _ fanatics who invoke Islam for their dastardly deeds _ but
the fact is that suicide is forbidden to devout Muslims. Our worry
is that once again the Muslim religion is being subtly demonized,
just as it was in the rush to blame Islamic fundamentalists for the
Oklahoma City bombing before we learned that that particular
outrage was home-grown _ as American as apple pie and the militia
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the end, Batouty will be found to have crashed the
plane in some inexplicable fit of depression, but it is a sad day
when expressing one's faith in God is so quickly taken as something
sinister.

BETTER RULES FOR FOOD STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, November 22, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hunger pains ripple across America even in the midst of plenty.
A new bill in Congress, the Hunger Relief Act, promises to help by
increasing the reach of food stamps to more hungry families.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy is good, hunger rages. The General
Accounting Office estimates that in 1997 at least 350,000 children
left poverty. Paradoxically, almost four times as many _ 1.3
million children _ stopped getting food stamps. Ten percent of the
population, according to the US Department of Agriculture, lacks
secure access to nutritious food.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunger Relief Act mandates four sound steps:
</P>
<P>
   --It would restore food stamps to legal immigrants. Taxpayers
who played by the rules to immigrate here, they lost access to food
stamps in 1996 as part of welfare reform. Last year Congress
restored eligibility to a third of this population. The relief act
would finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   --It would change the rules on food stamps and car ownership.
Currently, recipients can own vehicles worth just $4,650 or less.
The act would let states apply their own, often more generous rules
on vehicle worth. It's a smart move given the many poor parents who
need cars to get work.
</P>
<P>
   --It would make families who spend more than 50 percent of their
income on housing eligible for food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   --It would provide a 10 percent federal funding increase to the
Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides US Department of
Agriculture commodities to food banks and charities that help
families in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill doesn't mention it, positive publicity is also
needed. Various studies indicate that many families don't know they
are eligible for food stamps. Others are deterred by the stigma of
using them.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put a chicken in every empty pot has multiple
benefits. It stands to improve school and job performance, family
stability, and economic independence as well as warding off
illness, despair, and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pass this bill. It is better to offer meals to
those in need than cope with the long-term ravages of neglected
hunger.

FOR COWBOYS, TODAY IN TEMPE ABOUT STAYING IN PLAYOFF RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuff happens. Things change.
</P>
<P>
   The late summer NFL forecast was mighty wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Cardinals are not the ``in'' team. Jake Plummer is
not the ``in'' quarterback. Jake can't be in, because he's been out
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are not out, but Troy Aikman is. Knocked out, you
might say.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Tempe, Ariz., it's the 5-4 Cowboys, led by Jason
Garrett, against the 3-6 Cardinals, led by Dave Brown. But don't be
yawning. The Cowboys are still in. In the postseason picture of the
NFC.
</P>
<P>
   The way this conference is going, 22 drunk sailors could team up
and might make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff happens. Things change.
</P>
<P>
   In or out for the Cowboys was supposed to be determined by a
current killer stretch of schedule. But that's out. One team in
this stretch has been impressive _ the Indy Colts. Minnesota is
bad. Green Bay is worse. Arizona is out, but will play today with
more gumption than either of those.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it could possibly be a double-W week for the Cowboys.
Survive in Arizona, and then Miami is at Texas Stadium in only four
days after a tense AFC East encounter today with New England. The
Jimster's offense couldn't score on Jacksboro Highway.
</P>
<P>
   But the quickest way to go from in to out is looking ahead. Even
four days ahead. The Packers looked right past the ailing Cowboys
last week. When Green Bay didn't see Emmitt, Aikman or Irvin, it
saw an easy W. It saw wrong. Today will be different. Arizona has
nothing to play for, except this win.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also won't have Sherm Lewis as the offensive
play-caller. After last week, Sherm is out forever as an NFL
head-coaching candidate. Last week's big mystery at Valley Ranch
was why Lewis, the Packers' offensive coordinator, didn't
constantly attack Nine-Toed Deion, who did much more limping than
covering at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Deion is in again today. In as the starting cornerback. But
should he be out? There's a new ailment every week, but the one
that can be believed is the hamstring. Nine-Toed has been whipped
repeatedly in three consecutive games. That's not him.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the Just-Say-When guy for the Cowboys? As in say when
Troy Aikman shouldn't play the next game after a concussion. Or say
when Deion needs to be yanked because he can't do what he does best
_ cover. Is that you, Chan Gailey? Or is only Jerry Jones allowed
to make those calls on the stars?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of in, there will be that in-my-face argument about
constantly harpooning Deion for not playing, and then when he plays
hurt, saying he should be out instead of in.
</P>
<P>
   What are you asking for, fairness? Then it must be a case of
mistaken idenity.
</P>
<P>
   Since Deion has missed so many games in his Cowboys career, why
would he rather be in than out? Why would Mr. Big Shot tolerate
this current steady dose of humiliation?
</P>
<P>
   It's the money, my man. Nine-Toed is in, because by playing 70
percent of the defensive snaps and also making the Pro Bowl, it
will bring a contractual bonus of $1.5 million. And the Pro Bowl
berth could also come as a punt returner, hence Deion inserting
himself for that punt return late in the Green Bay game with the
Packers backed up in their own end.
</P>
<P>
   After an all-day limp-athon against the Packers, especially when
he was beaten by a receiver, Deion wanted to field a punt. It makes
no sense, but nothing does when a team is void of a Just-Say-When
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-Toed will be in today. And the Cardinals will try him,
something Arizona didn't do back in early October when Deion was
testing his toe for the first time. Remember the toe? Whatever
happened to that supposedly huge issue?
</P>
<P>
   Today will be different, of course. And why not? No matter how
much Deion shows us his limp, he's not coming out. There's big
bucks to be made by staying in.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Deion also floated his first rumor about
returning to play baseball next season. The Cincinnati Reds even
cleared a spot on their 40-man winter roster for him. The
contractual leverage game for next season is already being used
against Jones. And just think, these two call themselves ``great
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next season, of course, is not exactly a worry for
the Cowboys. Today is the worry. Only in the NFC could a team
struggle as this one has and still consider itself a playoff
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Tempe is all about staying in, instead of being counted
out.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff happens. Things change.

 &HT;    Jarretts: Father and son champions
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look into their eyes, and you can see the depth of
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett tears up when he talks about following his father
as a stock-car racing champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett's eyes moisten when he talks about what kind of man
his son has grown up to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been blessed,'' Ned Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have a year to savor the history they have forged over
a lifetime of racing. Dale Jarrett became the Winston Cup champion
last week, making the Jarretts only the second father and son to
reach the top of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   First there were the Pettys, Lee and Richard. Now there are the
Jarretts. Ned won the title in 1961, barely a year after joining
the series full-time and at the age of 29, and again in 1965. Dale
has won it in his 15th season, at 42.
</P>
<P>
   Ned was in Homestead, Fla., to enjoy the moment, although his
network, CBS, was not covering last week's race. A NASCAR
announcer, Ned has been in the delicate position of having to
comment on his son's struggles over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, all he had to do was cheer. ``I was relieved, to a
degree, that I didn't have to call that race,'' Ned said. ``But
when I am calling the race, I'm in better position to see what's
going on, and occupied to the point I don't have as much time to
get concerned about little things that might be on the race
track.''
</P>
<P>
   This week he reflected on his champion kid and how he became a
chip off the old block. He went all the way back to 1963, Daytona.
Dale was 6 and standing on the family car in the infield with his
mom, as his father led the field on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it made,'' Ned said, ``but I ran out of gas,
and Tiny Lund went on to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The more important memory is of his son at the races. They'd go
off, just the two of them, when dad went racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mature enough that I felt comfortable taking him,
putting him in the infield with Larry Pearson and Kyle Petty and
the other kids that had come with their fathers,'' Ned said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, he'd stand on top of a car. Sometimes, he didn't
pay a whole lot of attention to what was going on. Certainly, after
the race, on the drive home, he'd ask about the finish or why we
didn't do better. He could probably tell how we did by my mood. He
still was a boy. He'd play around with the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 9 when Ned retired in 1966 after winning the title
again in 1965. There would be a lot of time to try steering the boy
toward golf. Or basketball or football or baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were still one or two races left in the 1966 season, and
I vowed, however far up the ladder I got, I'd quit while I was
there. I'd never go down the other side,'' Ned said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a tendency to remember you for the last thing you
did, and I didn't want them to remember me as a has-been. I wanted
them to remember me as a champion. To this day, and I don't say
this in a boasting manner, but it's a fact, I'm still the only
driver that's ever retired while they were still the champion.
Granted, it was the end of the year and David Pearson was going to
be the champion, but he had not officially been crowned when I
quit. I was the reigning champion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a different sport then. Ned won the 1961 championship
even though he won only one race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The points were awarded on a different basis back then,
according to the amount of prize money,'' he said. ``Some of the
basics (of racing) are the same. There wasn't nearly as much
attention paid to it. The way you went about things was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially trying to pay the bills and raise a family on what
the sport paid at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett remembers trying to buy a '57 Ford to replace a
Chevy that didn't last through races. With 43 of his 50 Cup wins in
Fords, he is Ford's all-time biggest winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett waited until the banks closed at noon Saturday and wrote
a check for $2,000 that he didn't have. But he already had worked
out his plan to go to Myrtle Beach and win that race for $950 and
then return to Charlotte, N.C., for the Sunday race and another
$950. ``So that's $1,900 and I can scrape up that other $100 before
the bank opens on Monday morning,'' he told his brothers and a
friend. They took the car to Myrtle Beach. But someone had put
electrician tape backwards around the steering wheel. ``The sharp
edges of that tape literally chewed the meat to the bone on my
right hand, but we got through the race and won it,'' Ned said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loaded up and headed back to Charlotte and found a hospital
in Conway, S.C., which is about 20 miles up the road, and they
bandaged it up and put on some sort of antibiotic. We went on to
Charlotte and worked the rest of the night on that race car to get
it ready. I was not in condition to drive, but we had a job to do,
so I started the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running along in fourth place, right there with the
leaders, and fortunately for me Junior Johnson was driving the Wood
Brothers car that day. The engine blew on it and when a caution
came out I saw Junior standing over there in the pits, so I wheeled
in and got him to drive the car the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the race. I got the credit for it, and, of course, word
had gotten around about the bad check, and Junior wouldn't take any
money for it until later. I ran that car five races, won three,
finished second once and finished third once, so I finally got
Junior to take $100 for driving the car.''
</P>
<P>
   His uniform, Ned recalled, had nothing commercial on it besides
Ford No. 11. ``By the way, I still fit in that thing, too,'' he
said. ``You had half a dozen contingency decals on the front
fender. Ford had come back into racing. and we were fortunate to be
one of the teams they were supporting. They would give you the
cars, the parts and $2,000 cash for every race 250 miles or longer.
There were 17 of those on the circuit back then. So we had a cash
deal of $34,000, cars and parts. We had a Ford dealer that would
furnish me a personal car to drive and a pickup truck that we used
in the business and a two-ton truck to haul the race cars on back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem like the kind of life a father would want for his
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did try to steer him toward golf,'' Ned said. ``Dale has a
lot of God-given talent as an athlete. We felt he was going to be a
professional athlete of some sort. I knew how tough it was in
racing. If he ever made it to the top, I knew the sacrifices that
he'd have to make, the tough time that he'd have to go through, and
I didn't want to see him have to go through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought golfing would be easier. Of course, we've learned
since then that it's equally as hard or even harder. A friend of
his is still trying to get his PGA card and hasn't done it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Jarretts get emotional talking about each other.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Ned got teary-eyed recalling how his son quietly
replaced the Christmas gifts that had been stolen from a single
mother. Dale had read about that family in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for getting choked up when I talk about that,'' Ned
said. ``That's an example of things that he does, week in and week
out. Things he doesn't talk about. I think it comes through to the
fans. They perceive him as a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale admitted he choked up, too, when his plane landed in North
Carolina after clinching the points title and his father said, ``I
don't want this to be our championship; I want it to be yours.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has learned more than racing from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something my father taught me long ago was patience. He showed
me that it was a quality that I had within me that I had to learn
to use in the right situations. When I first started my racing
career, he didn't have the money to give me to say `Here, go race.'
But he did help me in other ways like helping me find sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to work on the cars and run the business. He
helped me set up, but it was up to me to take it and use the money
accordingly and learn the cars. I had to work on the cars, do the
books, pay the bills, drive the truck and get to the race track and
work on the car there. It is something that I look upon now as a
benefit. And Dad knew it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up the son of Ned Jarrett was exciting. Certainly, the
sport wasn't where it is today. But it was still fun. I got to
travel a lot, see and do a lot of different things. I think it was
probably later in my dad's career _ he was still a young man when
he retired _ but I realized that he was doing something special and
he was a special athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   When he raced, Ned was known as ``The Country Gentleman.'' Maybe
it goes back to the day he landed in a woman's lap at Daytona, back
when they raced on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   A blinded driver had rammed Jarrett's car from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spun and started to roll and ended up right out in the ocean
with water up to the floorboard,'' he said. ``I was momentarily
knocked out, but track attendants got me out of the car. I was
still dazed and disoriented when I broke free and went right
through the oncoming cars across the track. By the grace of God, I
made it to the piece of twine that separated the fans from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I passed out again. Next thing I knew, I was
laying in some fat lady's arms, and she was taking a real interest.
She had a quarter of a pint of Early Times, and she was trying to
put it down my throat to revive me. I was bleeding from a cut on my
head, and, being young, I was pretty sure I was gonna die. So I
fought to get free. I didn't want the smell of liquor on my breath
ruining any chance I had of going to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, his son has grown up to be the people's
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been blessed,'' Ned Jarrett said.

 &HT;    Park dispels skeletons with ride on front row
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt winked at Steve Park after Park's
qualifying effort for today's NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   Park will share the front row with pole sitter Kevin Lepage at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. The No. 2 starting position is Park's best
in his Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasing sight for Earnhardt, who owns Park's No. 1
Chevy race team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Earnhardt) is excited for me,'' Park said Saturday.
``He really doesn't say much. He treats me like one of his sons.
When you do something good, you might get a wink or a little bit of
a nod. But if you do something bad, he takes you out back and whips
your tail to teach you a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a lot of praise from him, but just getting a
wink or nod from Dale Earnhardt is enough for you to understand
that he thinks you are doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Park conquered his demons at the 1.54-mile quad-oval in Friday's
first round of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Park suffered the worse injuries of his
racing career at AMS. During practice for the March 1998 race, Park
wrecked his car and broke his collarbone and right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I guess you could say (earning the No. 2 position) was a
moral victory for me, after what I have been through at this
track,'' Park said. ``It was all the more reason to really go all
out and aim for the pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of emotions for me at Atlanta. I guess you
could now say that I have gone from one of my worst days (two years
ago) in my Winston Cup racing to one of my best days, so that's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Baldwin Jr., crew chief for Ward Burton and one of Park's
close friends, said Park's performance in qualifying might've
finally erased any AMS fears he had after the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think doing so well in qualifying built a lot of confidence
for Steve and the team, so they know he's not afraid of anything
any more'' Baldwin said. ``Then again, Steve Park is not afraid of
anything any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, 32, was forced to miss 15 events last season while
recovering from the wreck. He insists painful memories about the
incident never enter his mind. Park says he only reminisces about
it when he is questioned by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born a racer, and the only thing it made me realize what
how much I really did love the sport and how much I missed it when
I couldn't participate in it,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really took it for granted until I couldn't do it anymore. I
sat on the sidelines (recovering) for six months, and that hurt me
more than the injuries did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't run like we did (in qualifying) if you have
skeletons in your closet. I love (AMS). If every driver is supposed
to get hurt one time in your career, then hopefully I got it out of
the way my rookie year and we can go through the next 20-30 years
injury free.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the second half of the 1999 season, Park has been one of
the hottest drivers on the circuit. He is ranked ninth overall in
points earned since the July race in Daytona. Park ranks No. 15 in
the Winston Cup points standings heading into today's final event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the ingredients to be a great race team, with Paul
Andrews (crew chief), Steve Hmiel (technical director) and all the
other guys we have here,'' Park said. ``I'm starting to get caught
up a little bit with the experience we lost from me being injured.
I feel like we're just now touching the tip of the iceberg.''

 &HT;    Mast hopes to keep streak alive
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a struggling race team, little things mean a lot
at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For Rick Mast and the No. 98 Ford team, merely finishing today's
NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway might be almost as good as
winning. Mast is the only Winston Cup driver who has not posted a
DNF (did not finish) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   How big a deal is this? Jeff Gordon had six DNFs this season.
Terry Labonte had five; Bill Elliott four; Dale Earnhardt three.
Even Dale Jarrett, the new Winston Cup champion, had one.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rainbow for Mast in an otherwise dreadful year: A
ninth-place finish was his best in 33 starts. He's 33rd in points.
He nearly suffered a DNQ for this race.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he blew two engines and was dead-last, 46th, in
first-round qualifying, limping around the track at 170.302 mph, 23
mph slower than the top qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was the recirculator system, wouldn't you know.
</P>
<P>
   The 98 crew fixed it Saturday and Mast had the fastest car in
second-round qualifying, 191.199 mph. He'll start 26th today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little valve (on the recirculator system) was stuck and it
wasn't circulating the water when we were running,'' Mast said of
his Friday troubles, ``so it was basically sitting there running
the motor. It was the same as no water in it and that's what burnt
both motors up.''
</P>
<P>
   This team can ill-afford to blow through equipment. But at least
the 98 made the show. Now, its goal is to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very ironic that (non-DNF streak) would happen with us
because of the situation this team has been in all year with being
under-funded, under-staffed and under-resourced,'' Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, a few times this year, to me, it was amazing that the
guys were able to get the car prepared and physically show up at
the race track because things got so bad at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mast is surprised as anyone about finishing every race he's been
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of it is just luck,'' he said. ``We've avoided all
the big wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is the engine department. We have a lot of
overachievers. They know they're short-staffed and under-funded and
maybe that makes them dig a little bit harder and pay more
attention to that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting in the race on provisionals were: Bobby Labonte, Mike
Skinner, Terry Labonte, Kyle Petty, David Green, Brett Bodine and
Dave Marcis.

 &HT;    Valuable lesson for Hornaday
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell and Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ron Hornaday was just out for a little experience
Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. But he'll tell you, there's no
finer experience than winning.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday made the most of his information-gathering ride in the
Georgia Boot 400 ARCA race. He took the lead on lap 101 and ran
away with the 162-lap race in the No. 31 Chevrolet, beating Derrick
Gilchrist by 4.366 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, the former truck series champion, is taking over Dale
Earnhardt Jr.'s car next year in the Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can test all you want but it's not the same as when you
ride side by side and are three-wide coming off turn four,'' said
Hornaday about his first race at AMS. ``I've got some big shoes to
fill next year and everything I learn on the race track is going to
help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday won $23,370 in the car originally built for Winston Cup
driver Steve Park by owner Dale Earnhardt and raced previously at
Rockingham. The average speed was 129.246 mph.
</P>
<P>
   RUDD'S LAST CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is on Ricky Rudd today: it's his final chance to
extend his streak of winning at least one race in a season in the
past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now or never,'' Rudd said. ``Fortunately, we are having a
real good weekend here. The car is really running well in practice
... hopefully we can turn that into good luck for the race. I know
I'll have a good run, but I don't know if we are going to win or
not. I feel like we have a top-five car right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who will start 15th, said he won't be upset if the streak
comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world,'' Rudd said. ``We have given
(the streak) 120 percent, and we definitely want to keep it going.
If it doesn't work out, then we'll start a new streak.''
</P>
<P>
   AMS TRADITION
</P>
<P>
   The next time there is a drought in Georgia, state officials
might want to schedule a Winston Cup race. The past three events at
Atlanta Motor Speedway have had delays because of inclement
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel's forecast for today is a 20 percent of rain
and a high of 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Atlanta _ that's all I can say,'' Bill Elliott said.
``When we come here, it rains.''
</P>
<P>
   Said No. 3 Chevy owner Richard Childress said, ``I'd like to see
(NASCAR) move this race up a few weeks earlier in the season. We
always end with rain here. We need to go somewhere where it ain't
raining this time of year, but I know it's important for AMS to
have this (season-ending race).''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Baldwin, Ward Burton's crew chief, offered a positive
spin, ``At least it's not freezing weather.''
</P>
<P>
   GORDON-WALLACE RIVALRY
</P>
<P>
   Longtime rivals Jeff Gordon and Rusty Wallace are tied with 49
career victories. It is no secret that both want to be the first to
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a fun rivalry between us,'' Gordon said. ``I
think he'd like to get to 50 before me, but I have never really
thought about it like that ... I just want to get to 50.''
</P>
<P>
   GORDON MAKES OFFER
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he has an offer on the table to buy Ray Evernham's
interest in the No. 24 Busch Series team of Gordon-Evernham
Motorsports. Evernham was Gordon's long-time crew chief in Winston
Cup before resigning last month to lead Dodge's return to the
major-league circuit in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a proposal to purchase Ray's equity in the team and
it has nothing to do with our friendship,'' Gordon said. ``We're
still great friends, but there are conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Dodge vs. Chevy, that's a huge conflict. He got
approval from Dodge to remain involved with our Busch team (which
uses Chevrolets) and that's great. But to get it approved and to be
committed to it is two different things. After we won the race in
Phoenix, Ray couldn't wear a Chevy hat. The sponsors can't use him
next to the car in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER WINNING MARTIN
</P>
<P>
   His car is painted just like his dad's and his uniform would
remind one of a pint-sized Mark Martin, but he was shy about
wearing it to the track for a family news conference. Matt Martin,
7, won the Mid-Florida Quarter Midget Association Junior Novice
championship Friday night in Apopka, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to win, it was fun,'' Matt said. ``I can't
wait to race again.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA LAPS
</P>
<P>
   About 9,200 reserved tickets in the East and Weaver Grandstands
will be on sale today at their respect gates. ... Buckshot Jones
hired Ronnie Silver to be his crew chief for today's race.

 &HT;    'Noles stuff Gators
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Under coach Bobby Bowden, Florida State has
posted 13 consecutive seasons with 10 wins or more but has never
been undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the No. 1-ranked Seminoles moved one step closer to
that dream. They marched into Florida's fabled Swamp and strolled
out with a convincing 30-23 victory before 85,747, the largest
crowd to watch a game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State capped an 11-0 regular season and earned a berth
in the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl, where it will play for the national
championship. The Seminoles' opponent will be decided Dec. 5, when
the final Bowl Championship Series rankings are released.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (9-2) was knocked out of the national championship mix,
but the Gators will play in the SEC championship game Dec. 4 at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Down 23-16 in the fourth quarter, Florida had a chance to tie
the score when it used a pair of big plays _ a 39-yard pass to Kirk
Wells and a 24-yard catch and run _ to reach the Florida State
8-yard line. The Gators reached the 1 on a pass to tight end Erron
Kinney, but the play was called back because of a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   After a delay-of-game penalty put the ball back to the 18, Doug
Johnson's pass near the goal line was intercepted by the Seminoles'
Chris Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Two possessions later, quarterback Chris Weinke took Florida
State on a 78-yard drive that concluded with a 27-yard touchdown
pass to Marvin Minnis with 6:03 left to make it 30-16.
</P>
<P>
   Florida added a late touchdown when it drove 80 yards to score
with 3:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But an onside-kick attempt was recovered by Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 13-6 at halftime, Florida missed a golden opportunity
to tie the score on its second possession of the third quarter. A
25-yard pass to Travis Taylor and a 39-yard catch and run by Bo
Carroll gave the Gators a first down at the Florida State 20. On
the next play, Earnest Graham ran 19 yards to the 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gators could not stick the ball into the end zone. On
first down, Florida was called for a motion penalty, and the ball
was moved back to the 6.
</P>
<P>
   After three incomplete passes, Jeff Chandler came on to kick a
22-yard field goal to cut the Florida State margin to 13-9, with
8:52 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tenor of the game changed dramatically. On second-and-8
at his 22, Weinke was pressured and lofted a ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   Florida cornerback Bennie Alexander intercepted it and raced 43
yards for a touchdown. The crowd erupted as Florida took its first
lead, 16-13, with 7:39 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was short-lived. Florida State's Sebastian Janikowski
kicked a 54-yard field goal moments later to tie the score.

 &HT;    BCS bid, Heisman dreams doused by Demon Deacons
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Any pretense of maintaining national
prominence came to an end for Georgia Tech on Saturday. As did the
best chance yet to bring the Heisman Trophy to the campus where its
namesake one coached.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance for a Bowl Championship Series berth and an $8
million payday in the Orange Bowl still in the works, the No.
14-ranked Yellow Jackets crashed and burned, losing 26-23 to Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Hamilton derailed his Heisman campaign with two
drive-killing interceptions. And Tech failed even to lock up a
Gator Bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   Things quickly got off to a bad start for Tech (7-3, 5-3 ACC),
and soon they got much worse as the Demon Deacons (6-5, 3-5) built
a 20-0 first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   On its first possession, the nation's No. 1-rated offense got
one first down, then was forced to punt.
</P>
<P>
   An otherwise routine play proved disastrous when Dez White was
blocked in the back on a punt return and sustained a pulled right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   White did not return, and without him to draw double coverage
and open the field for flanker Kelly Campbell, Hamilton and his
offense were hamstrung throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Through three quarters, Tech, which entered the game averaging
510 yards of offense, had managed 306, but Hamilton's interceptions
were key.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets also were erratic on third downs, and kicker
Luke Manget, who had made six field goals in a row, missed badly
from 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Gregory, who had racked up four consecutive 100-yard
rushing games, found little room to run. The Jackets' normally
robust offensive line opened few holes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tech's defense was again not up to the task. Demon
Deacons tailback Morgan Kane piled up 197 rushing yards through
three quarters and finished with 189.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is left to be made of this season will be settled
Saturday when Georgia visits Bobby Dodd Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only a second win in a row over the Bulldogs would make the
season, which started with so much promise, palatable.

SEMINOLES BEAT GATORS, 30-23  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Sebastian Janikowski left no doubt with his
kicks, and Tom Polley demonstrated it by blocking a punt. And
finally, with six minutes remaining in the game, the Florida State
offense showed that it wanted to go to the Sugar Bowl and play for
a national championship, too. The Seminoles will play for the
national championship in New Orleans after beating the Florida
Gators, 30-23, Saturday in the Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles clung to a 23-16 lead midway through the fourth
quarter, largely because Florida's offense was dreadful enough to
get just 3 points after twice having first-and-goal in the second
half. First, the Gators settled for a field goal. Then, Florida
quarterback Doug Johnson threw an interception at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Seminoles' offense had a chance to show there was a
reason the team has been ranked No. 1 from the beginning of the
season. It took it. First, quarterback Chris Weinke connected on a
38-yard pass play to Peter Warrick. Then Weinke, who was 24 of 36
for 263 yards, went to the corner of the end zone to Marvis Minnis.
When Janikowski converted the extra point, the Seminoles looked
Bourbon Street-bound with a 30-16 lead with less than four minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gator offense held it together for an 80-yard drive that
Johnson (20 of 36 for 214 yards) capped with a 2-yard touchdown
pass to Brian Haugabrook to cut the lead to 30-23. When the defense
held, the Gators had 59 seconds to go 88 yards for a tying
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Johnson got 39 yards when he hit Darrell
Jackson streaking down the sideline at the 50-yard line. But
eventually it came down to a single tick left on the clock and
Johnson's desperation pass into the end zone, where there wasn't a
Gator who could hang on to it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither coach, Florida's Steve Spurrier or Florida State's Bobby
Bowden, wasted any time turning this bitter rivalry into an
offensive circus. Florida, as expected, alternated quarterbacks
Johnson and Jesse Palmer on every play.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden topped Spurrier and the Gators at quarterback by
employing the starter Weinke, his backup Marcus Outzen, fullback
Matt Kendra and Warrick. Weinke was the drop-back man, Outzen and
Kendra ran the ball in short-yardage situations and Warrick passed
and ran: one incompletion and five rushes for 19 yards; as a
receiver, he had nine catches for 90 yards.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a mistake-filled first half in which the Seminoles
controlled the clock, 15:10 to 14:50, and the yardage, 184-133, it
was the Seminoles quartet 13 and the Gators duo 6.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State put points up first on an 80-yard drive that,
because of costly Florida mistakes, was sustained for 18 plays and
chewed up 7:02 of the first quarter. Twice on third and long,
overanxious Gator defenders jumped offside to give Florida State 5
yards and another down. On third and 19, Minor took a swing pass 12
yards that grew to 17 when Gerald Warren grabbed his face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Again the drive could have been snuffed out at Florida's 40-yard
line, when Gator safety Marquand Manuel could not hold on to a
possible interception, and the ball instead ricocheted to Seminole
Ron Dugans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators were further insulted when, on second and goal from
the 3-yard line, Warrick lined up in the shot gun at quarterback.
He took the snap, ran left where linebacker Andre Davis appeared to
be waiting, but then reversed field and tip-toed into the end zone
untouched to give Florida State a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's defense twice found the resolve to stop the Seminoles
inside its 15-yard line to settle for Janikowski field goals of 22
and 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Johnson nor Palmer could ignite the Florida offense.
Johnson drowned a promising drive when he was picked off by
linebacker Bradley Jennings at the Florida 48. It resulted in a
22-yard field goal by Janikowski to put the Seminoles ahead by
10-0.
</P>
<P>
   And Palmer did manage to gain a crucial first down on fourth and
1 at midfield, but he barely moved the Gators any further. In fact,
it was up to kicker Jeff Chandler to give the Gators any offense.
He turned Palmer's effort into a career best 50-yard field goal.
The half concluded with a 45-yard boot to keep Florida within a
touchdown at 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Gator defense stepped up its dominance of the Seminole
offense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And finally a Florida offense that had been sputtering _ but
ultimately outgained the Seminoles in the game, 442-346 _ scored
some points. Starting on its own 16-yard line, the Gators fired off
two straight pass plays that chewed up 64 yards.
</P>
<P>
   First, Johnson hit Travis Taylor on a slant pass to the 41-yard
line. Then, on a fake reverse, Palmer, hit Bo Carroll in the flat
and the speedy wide receiver took it 39-yards to the 20.
</P>
<P>
   When Earnest Graham blasted up the middle to the 1-yard line it
looked like Florida was certain to tie the game. But two costly
penalties thwarted a touchdown effort and Jeff Chandler was called
upon to kick his third field goal of the day _ a 22 yarder to
narrow the Seminoles lead to 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   So the Florida defense took scoring touchdowns into its own
hands. With the Seminoles facing third and 7 on on their 23-yard
line, Weinke rushed a deep pass to Marvin Minnis, who was blanketed
by Florida cornerback Bennie Alexander on the Florida State 43-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore cornerback snatched the ball and zipped straight
up the field for the score, giving the Gators a 16-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But only briefly. The Seminoles tied the game at 16-16 when
Janikowski kicked a 54-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Jeff Chaney capped the Seminoles' 21-yard drive with a
2-yard touchdown to reclaim the lead, 23-16.

COMEBACK LIFTS TEXAS TECH OVER OKLAHOMA AS DYKES GOES OUT A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Texas Tech's 38-28 victory over Oklahoma in
Spike Dykes' last game as the Red Raiders' head coach was apropos
of a career of success against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great win,'' said Dykes, who told his players of
his decision to retire after the game. ``Our chances weren't very
good. I don't think everyone picked us to win. For us to do it was
really something, a great effort out of those players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this a long time. Someone asked me
\Rrecently\S what my biggest win was and I think it was when
Coahoma \Rhis first head-coaching job\S beat Aspermont in '64. But
I believe this one topped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing starting quarterback Rob Peters and running back Shaud
Williams because of injury, the Red Raiders, 13-point underdogs to
OU, nevertheless carried Dykes off the field on their shoulders as
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tech led 10-0, fell behind 21-10, then rallied to score 25
consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great scenario,'' Dykes said. ``We were down 21-10 and
that was a pretty good time to choke your chili down, but they
didn't do it and I'm really proud of them for that. These guys have
a lot of character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds have been against us all year and everyone had
counted us out,'' redshirt freshman backup quarterback Kliff
Kingsbury said. ``But we kind of knew it was going to be Coach
Dykes' last game _ and the seniors' last game _ and we wanted to
win it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech finishes the regular season 6-5 (5-3 Big 12) and has
qualified for a bowl game for the seventh consecutive year. By
handing the Sooners (6-4, 4-3) a third loss, Tech makes Texas (9-2,
6-1) the outright South Division champion regardless of the outcome
of the Longhorns' game against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury completed only nine of 17 passes, but those
completions produced 259 yards and three touchdowns and, along with
the play of senior back Sammy Morris and the defense, were key to
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Morris caught three passes for 102 yards. Included was a 67-yard
touchdown, a 32-yard scoring reception and a 3-yard catch for a
two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' 67-yard reception was the game breaker, giving Tech a
31-21 lead with 1:13 left in the third quarter. It came on a broken
play off Kingsbury's scramble out of the clutches of OU defensive
lineman Bary Holleyman. Kingsbury went left on a bootleg, scrambled
right and threw deep to Morris, who had slipped behind the coverage
at the OU 28. He scored untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the ball in the sun for little bit and it was wobbling
in the wind,'' Morris said. ``I just wanted to make sure I caught
the ball and got into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Dykes did a great job this week of keeping our
enthusiasm up and keeping our focus on going to a bowl game.Coach
Dykes never wanted the focus on him. He always wanted it on the
team and on Tech. I'm glad he was able to give his going-away
speech after a victory.''

BAYLOR ENDS SEASON WITH ANOTHER LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When the announcement drifted over the public
address system late in the second quarter, it seemed a perfectly
logical _ if desperate _ cry for assistance:
</P>
<P>
   ``Will all former letter-winners please report to the Baylor
sideline?''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, few responded. ]They were only needed for a halftime
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, the long-suffering Bears finally brought to an end a
season (1-10, 0-8 Big 12) that would have taken a dozen Don Trulls
or Mike Singletarys to save. In the final act yesterday, Oklahoma
State (5-5, 3-4) cruised to a 34-14 victory that kept alive its
hopes of becoming bowl eligible. The Cowboys play Oklahoma on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears became the first Big 12 team to finish a season
winless in conference play, finishing last in the South Division
for the fourth consecutive year and suffering their first one-win
season since 1971. Spurred by a halftime tongue-lashing from coach
Kevin Steele, they battled back with two second-half touchdowns,
but fell well short.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had the ball 43 minutes, ran 95 plays, rolled up 442
yards, marched to 25 first downs, and held a 27-0 halftime lead. In
17 minutes of possession, Baylor managed four first downs, 86 total
yards and one offensive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Steele admitted that at the half, when his team had one first
down and 12 yards, he was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the maddest I've ever been in my lifetime without
actually being in a fight,'' he said. ``I didn't cuss _ I expressed
my feelings in a professional manner. I just told them we would
find out who the fighters were.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by Randy Davis' 55-yard kickoff return, the Bears drove
41 yards, with quarterback Jermaine Alfred running the final 24, to
cut it to 34-7 in the third quarter, and Daniel Wilturner's 52-yard
interception return brought them to within 20 in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too little, too late. Oklahoma State's Tim Sydnes
kicked two field goals and the Cowboys scored on a 34-yard drive
set up by an interception, a 27-yard drive set up by a blocked
punt, and a 52-yard punt return by Terrance Richardson. On the
fourth TD drive _ 35 yards following a punt _ Tony Lindsay threw a
24-yard pass on fourth-and-one at the Baylor 26, and OSU scored on
the following play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing that we couldn't get a win in the Big
12,'' said Steele, whose team _ ranked 112th nationally in scoring
and 111th in scoring defense _ was outscored, 347-60 in conference
play. ``Obviously, we have a lot of work to do, rebuilding this
team during the off-season. I proved I'm not the genius to come and
turn it around in nine months. We tried, but it didn't work. I'm
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been dealt a lot of adversity for a while now,
and when that happens, people eventually become numb to everything.
It's the same in any area of society. This was created over a
period of time, and it will have to be rebuilt with patience, hard
work, diligence and intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele praised the departing seniors, saying, ``They tried to do
their best, and it's been very difficult. I'm the third head coach
they've had here. They did their best, and I'm proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the overall mood, cornerback Gary Baxter said, ``I
figure this is the worst it can get. This is as low as you can
go.''

IN SHAKY WORLD OF BACKUP QBS, JASON GARRETT SOLID AS A ROCK FOR
COWBOYS 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ With seven weeks remaining in the NFL season,
with 87 percent of the teams still eligible for a playoff spot, 20
of the 31 teams have started more than one quarterback because of
injury, ineptitude or both.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are one of those teams. Yet Jason Garrett is one of
only three backups-turned-starters who hasn't lost. Garrett,
Seattle's Glenn Foley and Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb are 1-0 as
1999 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, a seven-year backup to the same quarterback _ which is
more rare by today's standards than a seven-year marriage _ will
make his second consecutive start for the injured Troy Aikman
(concussions), today against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   But the sense around the Cowboys _ and it's been there again
these past two weeks _ is that when Garrett takes over the team,
there isn't a sign of panic. Those outside the Cowboys always seem
surprised that Garrett does so well; those inside the Cowboys
maintain a level of confidence that almost contradicts the loss of
a three-time Super Bowl winning quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's Garrett's experience (he's eight months older than
Aikman). Maybe it's Garrett's acumen (he's a Princeton grad). But
probably most of all, it's the fact that Garrett has proven himself
as a part-time starter. He is 6-2 as a career NFL starter,
including 4-2 over the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't just hand off and pitch out. In his six career
victories, the Cowboys have averaged 29.7 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   In working his way from third-string quarterback in 1993 to
backup the past two seasons, Garrett has formulated a philosophy
about being a successful backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the difference between being confident and having an
ego,'' he said. ``Who cares if they call you a starter or if they
call you the 12th guy? If you get a chance to play, you go out and
do your best, try to win and be confident in what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he plays in the NFC makes him even more rare. Of
the 11 teams with the same starting quarterback all regular season,
only four are in the NFC: Green Bay with Brett Favre, Washington
with Brad Johnson, St. Louis with Kurt Warner (who went from backup
to starter when Trent Green was injured in the preseason) and
Carolina with Steve Beuerlein.
</P>
<P>
   The seven AFC teams that haven't had to resort to their No. 2 as
a starter are Indianapolis (Peyton Manning), Buffalo (Doug Flutie),
New England (Drew Bledsoe), Jacksonville (Mark Brunell), Pittsburgh
(Kordell Stewart), Kansas City (Elvis Grbac) and Oakland (Rich
Gannon).
</P>
<P>
   In what has been reflected in the NFL standings as a topsy-turvy
season, the league's marquee position _ quarterback _ has been
unpredictable at best. Whereas premier running backs have either
retired (Barry Sanders) or been lost to season-ending injuries
(Terrell Davis, Jamal Anderson and Garrison Hearst), the
quarterback dirge has created opportunities for former players of
the Arena Football League (Warner), Canadian Football League (San
Francisco's Jeff Garcia) and NFL Europe (Seattle's Jon Kitna,
Washington's Johnson, Philadelphia's Doug Pederson).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Chicago, five-year career backup Jim Miller threw
48 times for 422 yards in a 27-14 loss to Minnesota last week. In
his first four NFL seasons combined, with three teams, Miller threw
81 times for 520 yards before this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, third-year quarterback Damon Huard is 3-1 as an
emergency starter for the injured Dan Marino. Huard attempted nine
passes before this season.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the quarterback legacy is over. Joe Montana's
and Steve Young's latest successors are Garcia and now Steve
Stenstrom. The latter couldn't make it with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets officially have achieved meltdown with former
special-teams standout Ray Lucas now the starting quarterback; he's
1-1. Rick Mirer was 2-4 before being benched.
</P>
<P>
   NFL backups are a combined 23-32 as starters this season. The
Cowboys have one of the few who can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason makes good decisions,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
``Quarterbacking is more about making good decisions than it is
about how strong your arm is or how far you can throw it or how
tight a spiral you have or how fast you can run.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's attitude: ``This is my ninth career NFL start. So
what's that over seven NFL seasons? Each week, each player has
something to prove all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the game, not the career, that commands Garrett's focus.
And that may be the secret for his success as an occasional
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett keeps it in the short-term.
\Nsubheds:Understudy or underachiever? The seven players who have
been Troy Aikman's primary backup in his 11 seasons with the
Cowboys have distinguished themselves in one way or another. The
honor roll includes: Player Seasons W-L Comment Jason Garrett

   NEW HAVEN _ The celebration came before the signal. A line of
blue jerseys sprinted into the end zone and congratulated wide
receiver Eric Johnson before any of the officials could raise their
hands to indicate a game-winning touchdown. While the men in
stripes took a little extra time to consider their call, Yale did
its best impression of a football team on the cusp of a big
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The end zone revelry, with 29 seconds still to play, disguised
any doubts the Elis may have had about the play's legality, though
some teammates did ask Johnson if he made the catch. From any
television angle, it was hard to tell.
</P>

along Harvard's goal line. Johnson ran a post pattern a few yards
deep in the end zone, just right of center. Harvard's Chris
Nowinski deflected the pass with the side of his left hand. The
ball sank toward the turf; when Johnson cupped his hands around the
ball, it was no more than an inch off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial catch, and the extra point that followed, gave
the Bulldogs a 24-21 victory in the Yale Bowl. It was a fitting
conclusion to a Harvard season that had several close losses, and
also added one more play to the lore of Harvard-Yale football. In
recountings of the 116th meeting of the rivals, the catch likely
will be a source of heated discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it . . . I'm sure it didn't . . . but I thought . .
. it's probably wishful thinking on my part . . . I thought the
ball hit the ground,'' said Harvard coach Tim Murphy. ``Did anyone
else think that for even a second? Raise your hand if you did.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had strong supporters on his own team. Nowinski was 10
yards in front of Johnson when he tipped the ball. The
6-foot-5-inch senior out of Needham High School thought he had
diverted the ball better than he actually had. He turned around and
found himself with a clear view. From Nowinski's vantage point, the
ball looked like it hit the ground and Johnson grabbed it by the
sides, trapping it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the kind of guy to moan after the game, but
from what I saw, I didn't think it was a catch,'' he said. ``It
would have been one thing if he had his hands underneath the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was Yale's turn to describe the play, its version
matched the one told by the Crimson contingent until the final
instant. Johnson smiled broadly and laughed when the topic of the
catch came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught it,'' he said. ``Let that be known. I caught that
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the celebration, Johnson added, ``(My teammates)
knew it was good and so did I.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elis' receiver had good reason for his overflowing
confidence. He set a school and Game record with 21 catches for 244
yards. All  &UR; afternoon &LR; , working mostly against a linebacker,
Johnson found openings in the defense. He had 16 receptions in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the greatest hands of any receiver I've ever
coached,'' said Yale coach Jack Siedlecki. ``You watch him. You
talk to receivers all the time about catching the ball with their
hands. He catches every ball with his hands. He can pick them right
off the ground. He can pick them right off his shoetops. I've never
seen a kid catch a ball like that. That was an amazing catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Many on the Harvard side also never had seen someone catch a
ball like Johnson did at the end of the fourth quarter with The
Game on the line.

EMPTY FEELING CREEPING INTO ARENAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each day, the numbers are there. They don't always tell the full
story, but they are telling a story.
</P>
<P>
   And the story is, people aren't going to NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it in almost every city, with the exception of New
York (automatic sellouts) and Chicago (the same, although we still
don't know why). The league says attendance is down by only 2
percent, which, technically, is true. What that number doesn't
reveal is that there were enormous crowds in Japan for the two
Minnesota-Sacramento games (67,000, and they count) and attendance
for teams like the Clippers, Pacers, Hawks, and Nuggets all are up
(the Clips by an astonishing 65 percent) because of new venues.
</P>
<P>
   But already we've seen some revealing numbers in many locales,
including Boston. The Celtics drew the smallest crowd of the Rick
Pitino era Wednesday against Cleveland; and that's after their
auspicious start. (Maybe they should call their building the Sprint
Center. You can hear a pin drop.) The Rockets lost their sellout
streak on opening night; Vancouver continues to have poor crowds,
including the lowest in the history of GM Place for a game against
Atlanta; the Warriors drew 10,340 to see the Bulls _ capacity in
their new building is 19,596.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, none of the league's nine games sold out. And
it's not that there weren't some interesting matchups. The Heat
went to Philly and 23 percent of the building was empty. The Trail
Blazers went to Orlando _ their only visit _ and 21 percent of the
O-Rena's chairs remained folded. Even Utah couldn't sell out the
Delta Center for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was more of the same. Six games, six nonsellouts.
The Lakers didn't bang out the new Pepsi Center. Washington,
already down more than 18 percent, played to 59 percent capacity
for its game with the Raptors. Milwaukee, off to a terrific start,
didn't come close to selling out the Bradley Center (81 percent
full) for the one visit of the champion Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The league has explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is a notoriously slow starter, it says. The teams that
are dramatically lower (Washington, New Jersey) also have bad teams
(and in Jersey's case, a bad building, too). Yet the Celtics are
down more than 10 percent and already have had two of the smallest
crowds in the short history of the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a huge cost factor here, but corporations have long
paid the freight since ticket prices went through the roof. What's
more revealing is that those deluxe seats that have been paid for
still go unoccupied. You have to wonder how ordinary people can
afford to attend games, and if they can, why they'd want to.
</P>
<P>
   Making the attendance dropoff more dramatic is that the figures
are off from a disconcerting 1999 season, when we had the lockout,
fan fury, and crazy schedules. There was none of that this time
around. Teams had summer leagues, training camps, exhibition games,
and all the usual preseason publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But once you're in the building, you are bombarded with the
idiocy that makes you realize why many people stay away. None of
the boorish marketing schlock, inane Jumbotron nonsense, free
T-shirts, or halfcourt shot contests can distract from the
underlying reality: The product still isn't what it should be
(although it's better than last year). Basically, it's hard to make
a case that an NBA game is worth it. Unless, of course, you happen
to be one of the lucky ones who play. Then it's found money.
</P>
<P>
   Daily double
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan was everyone's preseason choice for Most Valuable
Player, and it's hard to make a case for the contrary now. He is,
by most accounts, the best player. However, Kevin Garnett is making
a strong case early on with some dazzling displays, including
Wednesday's 23 points and 20 rebounds in a loss to the Clippers.
Garnett is an automatic double-double and is among the league
leaders in scoring and rebounding. ``I think up until this season,
he doubted himself,'' said Cavs coach Randy Wittman, who was an
assistant at Minnesota the last few years. ``Now, I don't think he
does and that's a scary thought. But before, he was always
concerned about different things. And I also think playing with the
Olympic team (this summer in Puerto Rico) and in Japan really
helped him. He realized people are coming to see him, now. I don't
think he ever saw that before. Yeah, he was good, but he never got
the national stuff he's getting now because his team didn't get out
of the first round, stuff like that.'' . . . Things are really
getting crazy in Denver. The $461 million sale of the
Nuggets/Avalanche/Pepsi Center to deep pockets/short arms Donald
Sturm has fallen apart. There are all kinds of theories, one of
them being that the intensely private Sturm didn't like being in
the public eye and realized at some point after making the
commitment that he wasn't going to make a lot of money out of this.
Other Italian-suit kind of things are at work here, but what could
be very interesting is the status of coach Dan Issel. You may
recall that Issel waited until Sturm's offer was accepted before
firing Mike D'Antoni and taking back the job he walked away from a
few years back. He also jacked up the Nuggets' payroll more than 30
percent and fired a few shots at previous owner Ascent, shots that
were hardly prudent. You burn a bridge, you'd better hope there's a
rowboat nearby. Ascent still wants to unload the properties, but
who will step up now? Apparently not Sturm. Certainly not Bill
Laurie, who thought he had a $400 million deal until the Ascent
stockholders objected. The guess is that Sturm paid $461 million
because he (a) knew that the properties would go to the highest
bidder and (b) somehow discovered that one of the bids was for $460
million. If I were Ascent, I'd be calling that $460 million guy
pronto and hoping the package hasn't depreciated . . . Speaking of
the Nuggets, they had a big win Thursday over the Lakers, during
which Shaquille O'Neal again showed his true colors. Big numbers
everywhere, including missed free throws. He was 2 of 14 from the
line, including 1 for 12 in the fourth quarter. ``I ain't no punk.
Ain't nobody going to break me down,'' Shaq told reporters
afterward. Coach Phil Jackson suggested that O'Neal's free throw
problems could be the hoop equivalent of alcoholism. ``Some of it
is physiological and some of it is psychological,'' Jackson said.
Responded Shaq, ``I don't know what that means.'' Nick Van Exel
said he's never seen Shaq so bad from the line, while Eric Montross
is believed to have called Shaq, offering advice. But maybe Raef
LaFrentz said it best: ``If Shaq hit 80 percent of his free throws,
the rest of the league wouldn't have a chance. There wouldn't even
be much point to playing the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott on their minds
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are in town this Wednesday and they aren't quite the
same. They're walking around with bull's-eyes on their foreheads.
And they're missing a critical player. ``We're decent,'' coach
Gregg Popovich says. ``We're different without Sean (Elliott). He
was such a stopper on defense and he had the ability to break down
defenses. We don't have that.'' Elliott, of course, is out after
undergoing a kidney transplant last summer. For how long? Popovich
says he's not sure. ``Sean would like to play,'' said the coach.
``If it happens, I hope it's later rather than sooner. Like next
year. It's just not that important to rush him back for the sake of
a few wins. I would gladly give up that for his health.'' Popovich
thinks Elliott may be inclined to wait after going through some
noncontact drills with the team, which he has been cleared to do.
``They were a lot tougher than he thought. He was tired
afterwards,'' said Popovich. ``And the word he used was
`exhausted.' He's still anemic, although this was part of
(conditioning) even if he wasn't coming back. But I think now he
knows it's a long-term thing. And next year? It might be time for
him to think, `What can I achieve now?' He's got his money. He's
got a ring. I'm not so sure there's that much out there for him to
prove.'' . . . When things go haywire, there's usually more than
one cause. But it's hard to overlook the season Keith Van Horn is
having, given the Nets' horrible start. Theories abound as to why
his offense _ 36 percent shooting out of the box _ has disappeared.
They range from the absence of Jayson Williams, who tended to cover
for him, to the pressure of his big contract (which doesn't kick in
until next year). The loss of Williams has been huge, for he would
likely be a strong locker room force to deal with the nonsense. But
now, he's on the outside, looking in. Maybe this is what Jackson
meant when he told Nets bosses that the job didn't appeal to him
because it was a 24/7 affair, it was a team that would not make the
playoffs, and it was a team that had two or three players who, in
his view, would not submit to team structure with the triangle
offense . . . Van Horn remains the only player from his draft class
that re-signed for the $71 million maximum, although Duncan could
have had he so desired. Seven players from the 1996 draft class,
the first eligible for the $71 million hit, re-upped for that
amount: Allen Iverson, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Ray
Allen, Antoine Walker, Kobe Bryant, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. Other
than Duncan, the two from the Class of 1997 in line for big hits
this summer look to be Maurice Taylor and Tracy McGrady. Ron Mercer
should also get big numbers, a lot more than three players taken
ahead of him: Chauncey Billups, Antonio Daniels, and Tony Battie,
who already re-signed for $25.2 million over six years . . . Hersey
Hawkins probably deserves to ride into the sunset on something
other than a Clydesdale. Yet he's in Chicago, playing for the worst
team in the league, and doesn't have a lot of time left. Would he
ask for a trade for one more chance with a contender? ``I've
thought about that, but that would be like quitting and not
accepting the responsibility that I have now that I'm here,'' he
said. ``They got me here to help rebuild the team, to help the
younger players, to get the team turned around. It just wouldn't
set right with me, that I wanted out because I wasn't on a
championship team. I've been around. I've learned there's no
guaranteed paradise. If my family is happy here, then I will stick
it out and remain committed.''

YALE KNOCKS OFF HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ Yale senior quarterback Joe Walland connected with
junior Eric Johnson of Needham, Mass., on a short, deflected
winning touchdown pass with 29 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander hit on 33 of 49 passes for 413 yards in the
second half. Yes, the second half.
</P>
<P>
   His quarterback, said Yale coach Jack Siedlecki, was struggling
in the first half and probably was not thinking too clearly.
</P>
<P>
   He sure snapped out of it.
</P>
<P>
   And because Walland managed to come out of the hospital and
fight off a fever and bounce back from a rough first half and hold
off Harvard, the Elis were able to knock off the Crimson, 24-21,
Saturday in front of 52,484 in the Yale Bowl. The win gave the Elis
(9-1 overall, 6-1 Ivy), who had managed at least one title in each
Ivy decade, a share of one with Brown. They made it just in time:
It was Yale's first title since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Walland was nursing a thumb injury on his throwing hand and then
had bigger problems later in the week. He was hospitalized with
tonsillitis on Friday and given antibiotics intravenously. He was
in the hospital and said he woke up at 2:30 a.m. Saturday and had a
temperature of 103.1.
</P>
<P>
   He was at least that hot in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Joe Walland, I don't know if they win today,'' said
Harvard coach Tim Murphy, an unabashed Walland fan in just a bit of
an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Walland completed 42 of 67 passes for 437 yards and three
touchdowns and twice led Yale from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson caught an astounding 21 passes for 244 yards. No one
ever had caught more than 11 passes in The Game. ``Eric Johnson is
a terrific football player,'' Murphy said. ``But Joe Walland, he's
one of those guys, for a lack of a better way to put it, he almost
wills things to happen. He's going to have legendary status after
today.''
</P>
<P>
   He should.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard finished 5-5, 3-4 in the Ivy League, after one more
tough 1999 finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson lost their five games this season by a total of 18
points. In all of them, they led or were tied in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every game we had we lost late,'' said Harvard
receiver Chris Eitzmann, a senior and captain. ``It gets more and
more frustrating. This one especially. It's Yale. It's The Game.
It's extra special. It hurts a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard led at halftime, 7-3, on a 7-yard pass from Brad Wilford
to Troy Jones in the second period. Jones, a senior, was playing in
his first game since injuring his ankle in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Yale owned the third period statistically as the Crimson ran off
only three offensive plays. But Harvard still entered the fourth
ahead, 14-10, thanks to Mike Brooks's 66-yard return of a blocked
field goal for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Elis took the lead 37 seconds into the final period on a
28-yard Walland-to-Jake Fuller strike.
</P>
<P>
   Jones answered that one, racing 18 yards into the end zone, to
put Harvard ahead, 21-17, with 12:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard defense held once for a punt and then stopped Yale
again when Kane Waller intercepted one of the gazillion Walland
passes. But the Yale defense stiffened and Harvard had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Walland had another chance from Yale's 42 with 2:53 left. He
took his team down the field. He passed for three first downs and
then converted when Yale had a third and 3 from the Harvard 13.
Walland scrambled and made it by inches.
</P>
<P>
   He then passed to Johnson for 6 yards. On second and goal from
the 4, he dropped back to pass. Harvard's Chris Nowinski got a hand
on the ball and it fluttered. Johnson dove for it in the end zone
and, he swears, got his hands on it and kept it off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Catch. Touchdown. The Game.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy thought the ball might have hit the ground. No
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moot point,'' Murphy said. ``They win the football
game. They made the plays and it's ancient history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale, after losing its opener to Brown, 25-24, after the Bears
turned a blocked extra point kick into a 2-point conversion, ran
the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Elis completed a tremendous turnaround. This year's seniors
had a ledger that reads: 2-8, 1-9 as sophomores in Siedlecki's
first year, 6-4, and now 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids will become a part of the lore of Yale football,''
said Siedlecki.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a left-handed quarterback with tonsillitis.

BC THUMPS NOTRE DAME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ They came here on Tim Hasselbeck's wing (and
legs) and a prayer for redemption. They were determined to make up
for that blasted 1 yard they'd fallen short in a stinging setback
to Notre Dame a year ago at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth anniversary of Boston College's momentous toppling
of a top-ranked Fighting Irish team, the Eagles soared again
Saturday, withstanding a furious fourth-quarter rally by Notre Dame
for a 31-29 triumph before a Notre Dame Stadium crowd of 80,012.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which evened the career record of BC coach Tom
O'Brien at 16-16, virtually assured the Eagles (8-2) of a bid to
the Insight.com Bowl Dec. 31 in Tucson while ending the bowl
aspirations of the Fighting Irish, who needed to win this weekend
and next to remain alive for one of the Big East-allotted
postseason slots.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck had the Eagles flying high as he completed 20 of 30
passes for 272 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to redshirt
freshman Jamal Burke (22 and 34 yards). With starting running back
Cedric Washington and backup Carlton Rowe both hobbled, Hasselbeck
also wound up as BC's leading rusher, gaining 60 yards on 15
carries and scoring on a 1-yard run in the third quarter to break a
17-17 tie and put the Eagles ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath an overcast sky, the game began ominously for the Eagles
when Notre Dame won the toss, elected to defer, but had to wait
just a little more than two minutes before getting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish started at their 6-yard line but wasted
little time in getting into BC territory. Jackson came out firing
on the first play. Rolling right in his end zone, he found a
wide-open Raki Nelson, who had beaten RaMon Johnson deep, for 45
yards. On the next play, Tony Fisher ripped off a 20-yard run. Joey
Getherall caught a 10-yard pass on the play after that.
</P>
<P>
   Before you knew it, Notre Dame was threatening to punch it in.
The Irish did four plays later, when Fisher took an option pitch
and swept around the right side for a 5-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   BC was forced to punt from the 26 on its next possession, and
the game began to have a scary resemblance to the first of this
series, known as ``Holy War I,'' when the Irish came flying out of
the tunnel and rolled to a 54-7 victory. After taking over at their
37, the Irish rolled toward the end zone again, and when freshman
Julius Jones ran in from 11 yards, it was 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles needed a break _ any break _ to keep from getting
inundated by a tidal wave of Notre Dame emotion. And they got it
when Johnson atoned for his earlier blown coverage by making a huge
interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles capitalized. After taking over at their 47, they
drove to the Notre Dame 28 and faced a critical fourth-and-1 _
reminiscent of last year's 31-26 loss at Alumni Stadium, when BC
failed to convert. This time the Eagles were successful, when
Hasselbeck kept it for a 1-yard sneak. And on the next play,
Hasselbeck rolled left and threw across the field to Bryan Arndt
for a 27-yard touchdown that made it 14-7 with 26 seconds left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck rallied the Eagles to a tying score with 9:01 left in
the half, capping a five-play, 49-yard drive with a 22-yard TD pass
to Burke, who was interfered with but still managed to make a
brilliant one-handed grab at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   BC surged ahead on its next possession. After taking over on
their 1, the Eagles drove to the Notre Dame 5 before settling for a
23-yard Matich field goal and their first lead, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles failed to hold it, as Notre Dame went 40 yards in
six plays to tie the game, 17-17, on a 44-yard field goal by Jim
Sanson on the final play of the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles broke the tie early in the third quarter, as
Hasselbeck directed an 11-play, 93-yard scoring drive. He connected
with Arndt on a 22-yard completion to the BC 32; found Dewalt on an
11-yard screen; gained 14 on a keeper; kept it again for 9 to the
ND 3, and, finally, sneaked in from the 1 on second and goal to
make it 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   After an exchange of possessions, BC took over with 14:38 in the
game and roared from its 20 to the ND 25. The drive appeared to be
stalling when Hasselbeck's apparent 25-yard TD run was nullified by
holding penalty. But the quarterback, on third and 19 from the 34,
lofted a spiral to a streaking Burke for a TD and a two-touchdown
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a buffer BC would need, as Notre Dame went 62 yards in 10
plays to climb within a touchdown on a 9-yard pass from Jackson to
Fisher _ on fourth and 6. However, Jim Sanson missed the extra
point, bouncing it off the left upright. The Eagles were still
ahead by 8.
</P>
<P>
   BC needed the breathing room, as Julius Jones scored on a
67-yard punt return to cut BC's lead to 2, 31-29, with 3:27 left.
The Irish went for 2 and failed.
</P>
<P>
   After BC's offense failed to generate any momentum and the
Eagles were forced to punt with 2:18 left, Pedro Cirino delivered
the crowning blow _ as he did in last week's victory over West
Virginia _ when he intercepted Jackson at the ND 35 to seal the
victory.

<P>
   Any discussion about Wayne Gretzky and what he meant to the
National Hockey League in the latter stages of the 20th century
inevitably leads to money. Every player in today's game, and many
already retired, could point to their paychecks twice a month and
see the Great One's No. 99 factored prominently in their take-home
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who will be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame Monday
in Toronto, won't be remembered as a ``money player'' _ not in the
traditional sense, that of bringing out his top performances at the
most opportune times.
</P>
<P>
   But through his game, fame, and glory, he forever will be
remembered (owners might say disdained) for leading the players
from the sports industry's financial backwaters to the deep,
roiling sea of $10 million-a-year contracts. In that sense, the
game never will see a bigger money player.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget, Gretzky didn't do that alone. He got a key
assist from the wide-walleted Bruce McNall, the former Los Angeles
Kings owner who continues to serve out his time in a hall of shame
known as federal prison in Lompoc, Calif. In January 1997, McNall
was sentenced to five years and 10 months on two counts of bank
fraud, one count of conspiracy, and one count of wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It took McNall's vision and money (some of it, shall we say, uh,
borrowed) to import Gretzky to LA from Edmonton and make his wide,
toothy smile a virtual secondary logo for the league.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, check out the top curving edge of the NHL's
black-and-orange shield. Who says that isn't actually modeled after
Gretzky's upper lip?
</P>
<P>
   For those who arrived a few minutes late to the Great One's
two-decade run, his game, his style of play, and, ultimately, his
points amounted to about half of his hockey being. The other half
was the way he carried himself in public, which was as meticulous,
as crafted, and as productive as he carried himself on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever flaws Gretzky undoubtedly has, they were never seen or
heard _ at least never captured on videotape or in a reporter's
notebook. Many a tainted icon got a free pass through the '60s, but
as Pete Rose keeps finding out over and over again, the end of this
century left little room for unquestioned idolatry. If Gretzky
truly had been something other than the squeaky-clean Ontario kid
who grew up playing on the backyard rink that dad hosed down each
night, trust me, by now his aching bones (see: Tylenol commercial)
would have been pulled apart and scattered throughout Canada and
the US.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Gretzky was/is some gee-whiz country
bumpkin. Far from it. Just out of his teens, he quickly realized
his talent, grasped his out-of-game earning potential, and promptly
handed it all of over to trusted friend and agent Mike Barnett
(today head of all things hockey for IMG). All the while, however,
he maintained his playing excellence, helped establish a Stanley
Cup empire in Edmonton (where he won four Stanley Cups), and packed
it all in last April as the game's career leader in goals (894),
assists (1,963), and points (2,857). In the playoffs, he collected
another 382 points, alone the kind of production some NHLers don't
amass over a dozen full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins netminder Byron Dafoe spent two seasons in LA, one of
them while Gretzky still played for the Kings. Dafoe keeps an
office at home, the walls adorned by a pair of autographed Gretzky
photos, both of them cherished mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just this aura about him,'' said Dafoe. ``It's hard to
describe. I mean, certain people have it, you can see it when they
just walk in a room. Wayne Gretzky's one of those people. For him
to be in Hollywood all those years _ a place full of actors, sports
stars, legends _ and to be that big, that says a lot when you're
talking about one of the craziest cities in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins forward Anson Carter also grew up in Ontario, where, he
said, every kid on every corner wore a No. 99 sweater during street
hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone but me,'' he said. ``I wasn't a Gretzky guy. I was a
Mike Bossy guy, because he was a righthanded shot. That's why I
wore No. 22, all the way through college. Gretzky shot from the
left side. I just couldn't relate.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, of course, Carter found himself flying down the hardtop
in front of his house, cutting behind a street hockey net, and
finishing off with a soft-touch goal as he wheeled out in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'd yell, `What a great goal by Gretzky!' '' Carter
recalled, chuckling at the memory. ``My friends would get all over
me for that. They'd be there, giving it to me, `Hey, what's this
Gretzky stuff all about? You're a Bossy guy.' And I was a Bossy
guy. But there was just something about being around the net like
that, right around the crease _ you had to be Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston winger P.J. Axelsson grew up in Sweden, thousands of
miles from where Gretzky became famous. He was a Gretzky guy from
start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my hero,'' said Axelsson. ``In Sweden, in the mid-'80s,
every kid in Sweden wanted to be like him. If you were a D-man, OK,
it was probably Borje Salming, but for any forward it was
Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob DiMaio grew up around Calgary, about a three-hour drive
south from Edmonton. In the '80s, the Oilers and Flames waged the
heated ``Battle of Alberta.'' There were hockey fans in Calgary,
said DiMaio, who disdained the Oilers and everything about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hated Gretzky, too,'' said DiMaio. ``But they appreciated
his talent. For the most part, no matter what team you rooted for,
you loved to watch him play. He made a name for the game. The
biggest part of pro hockey history is Wayne Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, his name and his accomplishments will be placed in
hallowed space. The game's biggest producer and greatest name will
be remembered for his points, his Cups, and for the good life he
led both on and off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   A simple show of Gretzky kindness, said Dafoe, will be among the
things he always remembers about 99.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Ottawa one day for a practice, and there had to be
200 people in the stands, just because Gretzky was there,'' he
said. ``We're all getting on the bus after, and Gretz is out there,
just mobbed, signing and signing autographs. Finally, the guys
inside are yelling, `Come on, Gretz, we gotta get goin'. Move it.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky hopped on the bus, walked to the back, and plunked
himself in a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he looks out the window,'' recalled Dafoe, ``and he sees
this one kid with a Gretzky shirt, and the kid's just sobbing
because he didn't get an autograph. Gretz says, `Wait a minute!'
and asks the Kings' PR guy to go out and get him. The next thing
you know, here comes this little kid, holding the shirt up under
his chin with both hands, making his way to the back of the bus. He
was just shaking. Gretz tells the kid he's sorry that he missed
him, signs the shirt, and the kid goes flying out of there. You
know that kid will remember that the rest of his life. I will, too.
It just shows you how genuine the guy is.''
</P>
<P>
   See you later
</P>
<P>
   The news only gets worse for the hard-hit Canadiens. On
Thursday, team captain Saku Koivu had surgery to fix his dislocated
shoulder. Doctors needed to do more work than first thought and the
Finnish dynamo will be sidelined until probably mid-February. By
then, the Habs might be so far out of it that the only logical
thing to do will be to tell Koivu to hold off until September
training camp . . . Belmont Hill's Paul Mara remains on the
sidelines for the Lightning recovering from a broken jaw suffered
in his only NHL game this season. Suited up against the Capitals,
Mara took a Chris Simon shot to the kisser, fracturing the jaw in
two places . . . Still unable to come to terms with the Phoenix
Coyotes, netminder Nikolai Khabibulin last week offered to come
back for a five-year deal worth $22 million _ about 60 percent of
which ($13 million) would be paid over the final two seasons. But
GM Bobby Smith nixed that one, too, prompting Khabibulin again to
ask for a trade . . . Look for LA GM Dave Taylor to get a contract
extension soon. Taylor has only next year remaining on his current
deal and team president Tim Leiweke said, ``People we want to keep,
we don't want to get into their option year.'' . . . Boston
netminder Gerry Cheevers, enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1985, on
the genesis of those trademark stitch marks that were ``sutured''
by felt-tip marker across his mask: ``It all started one day when I
was trying to get out of practice. I took a shot off the mask and I
was in the room and in comes Harry (Sinden, then the coach), and he
says, `Get out there, it didn't hurt you.' Harry leaves, and I say
to Frosty (trainer John Forristall), `What are we gonna do?' We
used the marker and made what looked like about an 18-stitch gash _
but I still had to go practice.'' . . . Ted Donato was one proud
Boston boy when he played for the Bruins, but it's possible to
leave the Hub and find happiness in Anaheim (yes, there's hope, Mo
Vaughn). Donato's oldest son, 3 1/2-year-old Ryan, loves the Ducks.
``I couldn't have a better job,'' said his dad. ``He loves the
Mighty Ducks movies. He loves the series. If the Power Rangers had
a hockey team, that would be the only other squad he would want me
to be on.''
</P>
<P>
   New York or bust
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fee, the Woolf &AMP; Associates agent who helped Joe Murphy
negotiate his one-year deal here in Boston, acknowledges the abrupt
change in financial climate that unrestricted free agents have
experienced this fall: ``It was clear at the start of the summer,
if you weren't on the Rangers' shopping list, you were in for a
long, long wait.'' . . . One insider, familiar with many NHL clubs'
financial dealings, contends that Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos
by the end of this season will have lost at least $80 million in
his three years since abandoning Hartford. Even if Karmanos wanted
to sell, it would be difficult to imagine anyone offering to buy
the franchise. Ultimately, his only out might be handing over the
keys to someone willing to take it and perhaps assume some of the
debt . . . One thing about Pittsburgh GM Craig Patrick: He knows
when it's time to dump high-paid players. He shoveled Kevin Stevens
off on the unsuspecting Bruins in the summer of '95 and did the
same with Kevin Hatcher this fall, dropping his $3.1 million burden
on the Broadway Blueshirts. Another thing about Patrick: He's
recovering from a couple of broken ribs after running his 4x4 off
the road Nov. 9. The GM was talking on a cell phone when an animal
dashed across the road, forcing him to steer into the rough . . .
The Rangers this year have given new meaning to the phrase
``embarrassment of riches'' . . . Personally, I'd rather have Ray
Sheppard on my team for $750,000 (and a Panthers option at $1.2
million for a second year) than Murphy at a pro-rated $900,000
(about $750,000 for this season) . . . In Edmonton, Alex Selivanov
is showing some surprising offensive charge, recently popping in
four goals in one victory. Selivanov began his career in Tampa,
where he married Carrie Esposito, daughter of former Bolts GM Phil
Esposito. ``I tried to talk her out of going with a hockey
player,'' kidded Phil, who now splits color duty with Cheevers for
Channel 38's Bruins broadcasts. ``But he's a great kid. He asked me
for permission to marry her even before he asked her. I said, `You
want to do what?!' I thought he was going to ask me for more ice
time.'' Headed into weekend play, Selivanov had 14 goals on only 32
shots. ``I've never heard of anything like that,'' said linemate
Doug Weight. ``Alex kind of lulls you to sleep. A lot of times, I
don't notice he's with me, then there's a loose puck, it's in his
feet, and, boom it's in the net.'' Selivanov went unclaimed in last
June's expansion draft (Atlanta) and was shopped over the summer by
Oilers GM Glen Sather, who found no takers for the 28-year-old
right winger . . . Veteran blue liner Steve Smith will remain out
of the Calgary lineup until Christmas after a painful dislocation
of his elbow. Medical staffers had to snap the forearm back in
place moments after Smith returned to the room. ``I screamed so
hard when they did it,'' said Smith, ``I cleaned out the room.''

HASSELBECK PROVIDES PUNCH IN ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ They will watch the tapes and see what he did
wrong. That's what football coaches do. They sit in film rooms,
hold a clicker, and nitpick like obsessive film critics.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College coaches will try to do that with Tim
Hasselbeck in the next few days. They won't find much. After the
junior quarterback led BC to a 31-29 win over Notre Dame Saturday,
the only logical criticism would go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Tim. Uh, your posture in the pocket is not quite what it
should be. Move an inch or so to the left next time, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck threw 30 passes and completed 20. He threw three
touchdown passes and had 272 yards in the air. He ran 15 times and
gained 60 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown carry. He didn't
throw an interception. He was sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   You asked yourself the last time you saw someone throw this
precisely. You answered your question: Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   With their win at Notre Dame Stadium, the Eagles solidified
their bowl position and snatched any bowl hopes from the Irish.
There were representatives from the Insight.com Bowl in attendance,
but the Eagles are thinking larger than that. They travel to
Blacksburg, Va., Friday to face the No. 2 team in the country. They
think they can beat Virginia Tech. They want their last game of the
season to come in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck and the rest of the Eagles are thinking that way,
mostly due to what the quarterback did.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he played well is a humorous understatement. What he did
was play the best game of his career. He ran like one of those
fleet quarterbacks you see at Army and Air Force. The service
academies always produce quarterbacks who really should be running
backs (remember Dee Dowis?), while Notre Dame usually produces
all-around quarterbacks such as Hasselbeck (we won't ask if you
remember Joe Montana).
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Hasselbeck told his father, Don, that he was
going to choose to attend Notre Dame over BC. He changed his mind
after he considered what the Irish were doing with their QBs. They
were recruiting Tee Martin and had Jarious Jackson backing up Ron
Powlus. They had thoughts of either switching Jackson to receiver
or having him compete with Hasselbeck as an option quarterback. It
was too much chaos for a kid who simply wanted to play. Jackson
kept his position, Martin chose Tennessee, and Hasselbeck wound up
in Boston, to be praised by two television networks.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the Notre Dame Network (NBC), showing the nation how
the quarterback position is supposed to be played. The cameras
spotted Don Hasselbeck standing near the 10-yard line and
dispatched a reporter to speak with him. It was Jim Gray. If Sports
Illustrated dedicated its swimsuit issue to reporters who have
enraged the public, Gray would be the cover model. But the man who
so forcefully asked Pete Rose about his gambling problems was
gentle the elder Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Tim Hasselbeck was mentioned prominently on
the ABC sitcom ``Two Guys and a Girl.'' Basically, one of the
characters mentioned that Hasselbeck moves so well that he probably
knows 40 different ways to make love with a woman. I cannot comment
on that, but I do know he found about 20 different ways to sap some
love from Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a huge rivalry for us,'' he said as he stood
outside the team's locker room. Behind him, BC fans could be heard
cheering and chanting. It was one of the few times on the day they
were the cheering majority. You've heard of the nosebleed section
in a stadium or arena, right? During the game, many BC fans were
situated in what should be called the airplane section. Their seats
seemed to be about 30,000 feet above the earth. When they finally
descended to field level, they got to give a little grief back to
the Notre Dame fans who had talked trash most of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC has come full circle,'' Hasselbeck announced. He spoke of
former coach Tom Coughlin, tight end Pete Mitchell, linebacker
Stephen Boyd, and other stars of the early and mid-1990s. Now, he
said, people can start to pay attention to Cedric Washington, Pedro
Cirino, and Chris Hovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good team. We're going to a bowl,'' he said. ``How
many people would have believed that at the beginning of the
season?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans here didn't believe it. Before the game began,
some BC cheerleaders walked through a parking lot of tailgating
Irish fans. They were teased until they disappeared into the
stadium. One of the fans mocked, ``Where is Flutie? You better go
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie is in New Jersey preparing with the Buffalo Bills
for Sunday's game against the Jets. He had a terrific career at BC,
winning a Heisman Trophy and throwing one of the most magical
touchdown passes in the history of college football. But this
Eagles team doesn't need Flutie to save it. It already has a
quarterback. His name is Tim Hasselbeck.

OLD HAND PITCHES FOR NEW SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Holtzman, who turned 73 in July, was a sportswriter for
53 years before he retired from the Chicago Tribune this past June.
He was a baseball beat reporter for 28 years and a baseball
columnist for an additional 14 years, and yes, when it was time to
vote for the Most Valuable Player, he voted for pitchers.
Sometimes, he said, he had as many as four or five pitchers on his
ballot in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   But Holtzman, who now works out of the commissioner's office as
baseball's official historian (he recently completed a review of
the Shoeless Joe Jackson case), has had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to go the other way; I decided that this morning
when I saw the paper,'' Holtzman said Friday from his home in
suburban Chicago, alluding to the controversy surrounding Ivan
Rodriguez's selection over Pedro Martinez as the American League's
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can compare pitchers to everyday players.
They're just two separate categories, and how do you compare them?
Pitchers today, they throw only 200 or so innings. They used to
pitch 300 innings. And relief pitchers? A closer might only pitch
80 innings.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's to be done? Holtzman is vehemently opposed to
changing the name of the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave it for most outstanding performance,'' he said,
``Willie Mays would have won it 20 years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to say that pitchers are not eligible for the
award. And as much as I hate to add awards, maybe you have to come
up with another award for relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think Martinez got enough as the Cy Young winner. Maybe
he was the MVP, too, but isn't Pudge Rodriguez entitled to some
recognition? He just had the greatest season ever in history by a
catcher? Give him a piece of bric-a-brac, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to diminish the magnitude of Martinez's performance,
which Holtzman acknowledged was one of the greatest in recent times
by a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a pitcher gives up fewer hits, walks, and hit batsmen
than innings pitched, he's had a hell of a year,'' Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   But so did Rodriguez, and it's just too difficult to compare the
relative merits of each. So let the pitchers have their award,
Holtzman said, legislate them out of the MVP balloting, and share
the glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just making some suggestions,'' Holtzman said. ``Just like an
old guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not what the doctor ordered
</P>
<P>
   It should be troubling to the Red Sox that both the
commissioner's office and the players' union had to get involved in
trying to broker an agreement on how Tom Gordon's medical treatment
should proceed. No team has been brought to the attention of the
players' association over medical-related issues as the Sox have,
according to one source, and that can lead to a very unhappy
clubhouse, not to mention send a highly charged message to free
agents contemplating coming to Boston. Reggie Jefferson, Jeff Frye,
and Scott Hatteberg all were unhappy with the way the Sox handled
their rehabilitation assignments last summer, and the Gordon case
has been a PR nightmare, with a total breakdown of trust between
the team and the player, a vital and popular member of the Sox who
has said he would rather be traded than remain in what he considers
a poisoned atmosphere of mistrust. General manager Dan Duquette is
not alone among baseball front-office people who have problems with
Dr. James Andrews, whom Gordon was relying upon for medical advice,
though Andrews's reputation with players is essentially
unchallenged. Some clubs believe Andrews is too quick to recommend
surgery. The Sox threatened Gordon if he did not heed the club's
advice instead of Andrews's; Gordon eventually went to a doctor the
Sox OK'd, the highly respected Lewis Yocum, and Yocum is
recommending elbow reconstruction. Sox doctor Arthur Pappas wants
Gordon to undergo exploratory surgery to determine whether
reconstruction is necessary or whether less-severe measures can be
taken, like the surgery performed on Hatteberg this year that
allowed him to be back in three months. Eventually, an
understanding will be reached, but at what price? . . . Buck
Martinez, now a broadcaster for the Blue Jays, played for Jimy
Williams in Toronto. ``I always thought Jimy Williams was one of
the best baseball people ever around,'' said the former catcher.
``His understanding of the game was remarkable, but at the same
time he was almost apologetic with his suggestions. I was a
catcher, and he'd always come up to me and say, `You know, I don't
know much about catching, but have you ever thought of trying
this?' And they were always good suggestions.' '' But Williams,
whom Martinez first knew as a coach with the Blue Jays, had a tough
time making the switch to manager, especially when that switch came
with the same club. ``You go from confidant to adversary, and I saw
that first-hand with Jimy,'' Martinez said. ``And then came the
George Bell situation, and Jimy got absolutely no backing at all.''
A decade later in Boston, Martinez can't imagine a better man for
the job. ``His response to winning the manager's award was typical
Jimy Williams, thanking everybody and saying it was a team
effort,'' Martinez said. ``Some people think that's a bit
calculated, but he's so sincere with that. He's probably as good a
baseball guy as we've seen in a long time. He's old-fashioned. His
team plays hard, and with a lot of pride, and he tells them, you do
that, and things will take care of themselves. This past year was a
great example of that. That was not a tremendously talented team,
but with a couple of more hits in Game 5 (against the Yankees), who
knows? Jimy likes to come across as that old country boy from
Arroyo Grande, but certainly nobody outthinks him. He's so focused
during the game. I think he's going to be around a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, he has doubts
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that he'd already taken the job as Don Baylor's
bench coach with the Cubs, Frank Robinson said at the end of the
week he still wasn't sure that, at age 64, he wants to put a
uniform back on. If he does take the job, it would give the Cubs
two former MVPs on their staff (Baylor was one, too). Among
managers and coaches, the only other former MVP in uniform is
Yankees manager Joe Torre, with Rod Carew's eight-year run as
Angels hitting coach apparently at an end after the hiring of new
manager Mike Scioscia. The Cubs also would have two Hall of Famers
as coaches, in Robinson and first-base coach Billy Williams . . .
Indians GM John Hart gave his strongest indications to date that
the Tribe will not be able to re-sign slugging outfielder Manny
Ramirez before he becomes a free agent after next season. ``I don't
think it would be wise or economically viable to give one player
that kind of money,'' Hart told reporters Thursday, when Ramirez
and teammate Robbie Alomar tied for third in MVP balloting. ``We've
been through this before, when Albert Belle left and when we traded
Kenny Lofton. It would be difficult to do a deal with Manny this
winter. That doesn't mean we're shopping Manny around. But we have
to keep all of our options open to see what makes this a better
club now and for the future.'' A year ago, Ramirez turned down a
seven-year extension for a guaranteed $56 million. He'll probably
command at least double that on the open market next year. ``I
don't know if it makes sense to have one guy go so far above your
payroll structure,'' Hart said. ``Then you have to start moving
people around to fill holes.'' . . . Wilfredo Cordero, who won't be
re-signed by the Indians (they have Jacob Cruz and Alex Ramirez to
fill his role as left fielder/DH), has drawn interest from several
clubs . . . Hart is putting the heat on disappointing young pitcher
Jaret Wright, whom he says will be no better than the No. 5 starter
when camp opens this spring. The Tribe already dispatched new
manager Charlie Manuel to California to pay a visit to Wright and
remind him that much more is expected than what he has so far
delivered . . . With the Diamondbacks planning to move first
baseman Travis Lee to right field, Tony Womack should become the
everyday shortstop. Womack played 122 games in right field last
season and 19 at short . . . Rockie reconstruction: Less than two
months into his tenure as Colorado general manager, Dan O'Dowd has
traded cleanup hitter Dante Bichette, Opening Day starting pitcher
Darryl Kile, and relievers Dave Veres and Curtis Leskanic. Third
baseman Vinny Castilla is the only player left from the original
expansion Rockies of '93, and he has been mentioned in numerous
trade rumors. Eleven players who were on the Rockies' 25-man roster
in 1999 already have departed, and O'Dowd is still believed to be
interested in making a run at Expos outfielder Rondell White . . .
The Rockies are putting great faith in new pitching coach Marcel
Lachemann to make an impact on new acquisitions Manny Aybar, Jose
Jimenez, and Rick Croushore, all of whom came from St. Louis in the
deal for Kile and Veres. Jimenez threw a no-hitter last summer, and
Aybar has been considered the Cards' top young pitching prospect
for the last several years. There is some thought to auditioning
Aybar as the Rockies' closer. Veres becomes the closer in St.
Louis, where it is hoped that his split-fingered pitch will have a
better break than it did in Colorado . . . By trading third baseman
Kevin Orie to the Dodgers, who are worried about losing Adrian
Beltre because of the controversy over his age when they signed
him, the Marlins have made Mike Lowell their unquestioned starting
third baseman, within a year of his recovery from testicular
cancer. The Marlins last week dropped outfielder Jaime Jones, a
former No. 1 draft choice, from their 40-man roster. Jones, the
sixth pick overall in the '95 draft, cleared waivers and was
outrighted to the team's Triple A Calgary farm club. He has yet to
hit more than 10 home runs in five minor league seasons. He becomes
the second high-profile Marlins draft pick to flame out. In 1994,
the Marlins, picking fifth, chose shortstop/third baseman Josh
Booty ahead of Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek, among others.
Booty is now playing football for LSU.

   Which direction for Rhodes?
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who signed free agent reliever Mike Trombley away
from the Twins to set up for Mike Timlin, are facing competition
from the Yankees in their efforts to retain Arthur Rhodes as their
lefthanded specialist. The Sox also have shown interest in Rhodes,
but it's going to take a four-year contract to get the deal done
and the Sox won't go that route for Rhodes, whose reported
preference is to stay in Baltimore, where he recently bought a new
home . . . The Orioles, looking for a lefty to add to a rotation of
Mike Mussina, Scott Erickson, Sidney Ponson, and Jason Johnson, are
in the hunt for free agent Chuck Finley, who at age 37 also is
seeking a four-year deal . . . Reds GM Jim Bowden told a Cincinnati
radio station that he has spoken to Deion Sanders's agent, Eugene
Parker, about the football player coming back to baseball, which he
hasn't played since 1997. Sanders was added to the Reds' 40-man
roster Thursday, a procedural move that would keep another team
from taking him in next month's Rule V draft. Bowden said Sanders,
32, ``has expressed some interest in returning to baseball,
possibly full-time.'' . . . Mark McGwire extended his love affair
with St. Louis when both he and the club agreed to exercise his $11
million contract option for 2001, and there were some indications
that Big Mac might be willing to defer some of the $9 million owed
him next season to allow GM Walt Jocketty more flexibility in
acquiring other players . . . Among his other achievements,
American League MVP Ivan Rodriguez became the first big-league
catcher to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases in the same season.
Rodriguez said his goal is to become a 30-30 player next season.
Rangers have won three of the last four MVP awards (Juan Gonzalez,
traded this fall to Detroit, won two) but Texas has not made it
past the first round of the playoffs. The last team to have at
least three MVPs in a four-year span was the New York Yankees, from
1960-63; they went to the World Series in all four of those years,
winning twice . . . The Mariners think they may sign free agent
first baseman John Olerud as soon as this weekend. GM Pat Gillick
was fined $5,000 for contacting Olerud's family before he
officially became a free agent. Gillick has known the Oleruds since
1989, when he drafted and signed Olerud out of Washington State for
the Toronto Blue Jays. The five grand will be chump change if he
gets his man . . . Former Red Sox minor league hitting instructor
Gerald Perry is Lou Piniella's new hitting coach in Seattle. Former
Sox hitting coach Richie Hebner also interviewed.

<P>
   New guardian for Angels
</P>
<P>
   In hiring Scioscia, the Angels are banking heavily that a dose
of Dodger Blue tradition will play well on their end of Interstate
5. Scioscia, who as a catcher with the Dodgers in the '80s was the
best plate blocker of the last generation, beat out five other
candidates, including former PawSox manager Ken Macha. Some say the
Angels hired Scioscia because he cost a fraction of what one of
their own former stars, Baylor, would have cost. But Scioscia, 41,
was hugely respected as a player, and though he'll be a rookie as a
big-league manager, he was Bill Russell's bench coach with Los
Angeles, managed in the minor leagues, and would seem to be
well-grounded. Angels pitcher Tim Belcher, who was a teammate of
Scioscia on the Dodgers, said Scioscia's big-league credentials _
and World Series rings _ would hold him in good stead in a
clubhouse in which carping was heard about the non-playing
background of fired manager Terry Collins. Scioscia called the
Anaheim offense ``a sleeping giant,'' but Angels players are
concerned that the club will not re-sign staff ace Finley. ``If
Chuck turns us away, what's that saying to me, to Mo Vaughn, to all
of us?'' said right fielder Tim Salmon. ``I've been through a
rebuilding phase, but I'm at the point now where I want to be on a
team that's going to win.'' . . . Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles
Times notes that with the Angels' hiring of Scioscia and the
Brewers' hiring of Davey Lopes, four of the eight position players
on the 1981 World Series-winning Dodgers became managers. Dusty
Baker and Russell were the others. That team had other achievers as
well. Dave Stewart is the assistant general manager of the Blue
Jays, and Reggie Smith, Burt Hooton, Ron Roenicke, Mike Marshall,
and Pedro Guerrero all have coached. Jerry Reuss, Rick Monday, and
Steve Sax, meanwhile, have become broadcasters . . . When minor
league managers were polled to identify the top 10 prospects in
every league, only one team had just one: the Red Sox . . . Don't
be surprised, by the way, if the Sox give another chance to
outfielder Michael Coleman to win a job next spring. Even Williams,
who was turned off by Coleman's attitude two years ago, has an open
mind on it. Coleman could take the place of Damon Buford, who is
being shopped around, with the Cubs, among other teams, showing
interest.

HOLE IS NO BOTTOMLESS PIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all its greatness and inherent beauty, golf is not at all
fair. Bobby Jones understood this. The splendid talents who
followed him _ from Hogan to Palmer to Nicklaus _ realized it, too,
as they were humbled more often than they prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean there is no room for compassion. You would
have to have a cold heart not to feel for Jamie Neher. Understand
that he isn't beating himself up over an encounter with one hole on
one golf course in one tournament, which served to remind him that
the game always demands respect. Instead, give the Weston native
credit for keeping perspective _ and a sense of humor _ and showing
spirited resolve.
</P>
<P>
   There are names for scores on a hole _ eagles, birdies, pars,
bogeys, doubles, triples _ but ``I don't think they even have a
name for it,'' said Neher, referring to his misfortune during last
week's second stage of the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 holes, Neher was as good as anyone at Bear Lakes, a
supreme test of a course in West Palm Beach, Fla. Unfortunately, it
was a 72-hole challenge and all holes counted. Thus, the 13 he made
at the par-5 second in the second round was figured in. So, too,
the double-bogey at that same hole in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven under par for 70 holes. Ten over on two holes. Sad as it
is, Neher's 1-under 287 was one shot from qualifying for this
week's final stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discouraging,'' said Neher, who will head to South Africa for
some competition, then come back for Monday qualifiers on the
BUY.com (formerly Nike) Tour. ``But I know in my heart that I
belong. I don't have any doubts. I'd be more concerned if I had
played my best and had not done well, but I played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for one hole.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a 555-yard challenge and usually plays into the wind.
There is out of bounds right, so the play off the tee is to take it
left, even though water and bunkers run from tee to green. Neher
did just that in the second round (he started on the front, so it
was his 11th hole). He thought he had landed in a bunker, but
discovered that the ball was in the water hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could get it out,'' said Neher, who was medalist
at his first-stage site. ``Not only get it out, but advance it.
I've hit out of worse, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   His second shot hit the lip of the hazard and bounced back in.
Again he tried, but it rolled back in, this time forcing him to
drop. The drop was 20-30 yards back toward the tee, and bad luck
got even worse when his drop settled deep into the Bermuda rough.
His fifth shot found the water, thus another drop.
</P>
<P>
   After a lay-up, Neher had 240 to the green and knew a 3-wood
would get him there. But he hit it thin and landed it in water that
guards the green. Another drop, a wedge that spun back off the
green into thick rough, a chip, and two putts later, Neher had
given up eight shots to par on one miserable hole and was on his
way to a horrendous round.
</P>
<P>
   Or so one would think. Neher regrouped, put the hole behind him,
and made some birdies down the stretch. He shot 77, 3 under on the
other 17 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in (to the hazard) clear-headed,'' said Neher. ``I can
look back and certainly second-guess myself, but I was composed. I
didn't let it ruin me.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot 72 the next day and was still in the picture. Neher
needed a great closing round _ and he nearly got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad swing,'' he said, cognizant of what one bad swing
means in an event of this magnitude. It came again on that par-5
second (again played as his 11th). This time he pushed a shot
right, the ball hit a cart path, and he made a double.
</P>
<P>
   But as he did two days earlier, Neher showed heart. He birdied
his 15th, 17th, and 18th holes to finish with a 68 and earn a small
consolation prize _ one of six in a playoff for three alternate
spots. He was ousted in the playoff, but that hardly mattered;
Neher earned something far more valuable: a measure of pride and a
large dose of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   He's only 25, and, he said, ``I'm getting better each year. I
really played very good golf. I'll learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer glitch
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, the points system that determines
the LPGA Tour's Player of the Year has served up a bogey. Last
year, Annika Sorenstam earned the title, though Se Ri Pak deserved
it with two major championships. This year, Karrie Webb finished
first, but it says here that Juli Inkster, on the strength of her
two majors (the two most coveted, no less), is Player of the Year .
. . If there is justice in the pro golf world, Lorie Kane will win
four or five times in 2000. She was in the hunt at the LPGA Tour
Championship last Sunday but had to watch as her good friend Pak
walked into the winner's circle. That Kane, who finished fourth,
has yet to win on tour is hard to imagine . . . No doubt the men's
tour will gather the bulk of the attention next year, but keep in
mind that perhaps the best story of 2000 will be the rivalry
between Pak and another Korean, Grace Park . . . If you have a
passion for travel, you may want to consider a life on the European
Tour. The 2000 schedule has already begun (last week's Johnnie
Walker Classic in Taiwan kicked off the campaign, strange as it may
seem), though it will not be until the seventh event _ in Portugal
in February _ that they actually play in Europe. There are stops in
Australia, South Africa, Malaysia, Dubai, and Brazil. Yes, Brazil,
though the tour's first journey to South America is squeezed into
the schedule the week before the Masters, so fans at Sao Paulo GC
shouldn't expect to see the likes of Colin Montgomerie, Lee
Westwood, Darren Clarke, and other notables . . . The unmatched
drama of the Ryder Cup has helped push the Presidents Cup into the
shadows, which is probably where it belongs. It is a contrived,
unnecessary event (most of the International Team members play in
the US and live in Orlando, for crying out loud) and here is
another reason to dislike the 2000 event: It is scheduled opposite
the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews, an event that is soaked in
charisma, charm, and good taste. Given the choice of representing
the US in the Presidents Cup or the Dunhill Cup, here's a vote for
the latter . . . There actually is an award for ``shot of the
year'' for a member of the European Tour and it went to Sergio
Garcia for his dramatics at Medinah in the PGA Championship. No
doubt you recall his 189-yard 6-iron that he shaped at the 16th
hole, after his ball had come to rest at the base of a tree, right
next to roots. Garcia defied logic and sliced his shot to the
green, saved par, and put a scare into Tiger Woods, only to fall
one shot shy . . . Woods isn't afraid to attempt the impossible,
either. At the Tour Championship last month, he hit a shot after
his ball had settled next to a rock and risked serious injury to
his wrist. In the third round of last weekend's Johnnie Walker
Classic, Woods's drive came to rest at the base of a tree. He hit
the shot and on his follow-through the shaft whipped against the
tree and he had to let go. He was not injured, and also made par .
. . This week's reflection on Woods: As a youngster, there was no
more important tournament to him than the US Junior Amateur; as a
teenager, the US Amateur was his ultimate goal; and as a
professional, the Masters, US Open, British Open, and PGA
Championship are what he plays for. Therefore, he has won a major
championship each season since 1991, save for 1998 . . . Caddies
continue to shuffle in and out of the spotlight. While it wasn't
much of a shock that Garcia fired Jerry Higginbotham, it was a mild
surprise that Fanny Sunesson no longer works for Nick Faldo. She
had, after all, been at his side (and behind him, lining up
virtually every shot he has made for 10 years) for so many good
times and stuck with him in times of trouble, too. But she has
decided to move on (the rumors are swirling; she may land with
Garcia). As for Higginbotham, it marked the second time this year a
prominent player has fired him (Mark O'Meara was the other).
Higginbotham apparently did not help his cause by getting into a
fight _ then publicizing it _ in the lounge of the Holiday Inn in
Brookline hours after the Europeans lost the Ryder Cup at The
Country Club, particularly since Garcia keeps a low profile off the
course. The relationship was strained at the American Express
Championship in Spain (wrong club selection) and at last week's
Taiheiyo Masters in Japan (illegal drop leading to a two-shot
penalty) . . . In case you missed it: Baseball Hall of Fame third
baseman Mike Schmidt advanced to next month's Senior PGA Tour
Qualifying Tournament. Former Quechee, Vt., pro Bob Lendzion also
will be in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Just rewards
</P>
<P>
   Word that Charles River CC in Newton and Wellesley CC will be
host for the 2003 USGA State Team Championships (the men at Charles
River, the women at Wellesley) is a just reward for two of Donald
Ross's finest creations. Exquisite courses, both of them . . . Dan
Baker, who was the PGA of America's tournament director for the
1999 Ryder Cup, has been named tournament manager of the Greater
Hartford Open. The 2000 GHO is scheduled for June 26-July 2 . . .
Eight-year-old Brittany Weddell of Sandwich finished third at The
Golf Channel's Drive, Chip &AMP; Putt National Finals at Bay Hill in
Orlando last weekend. She had qualified during regional competition
in August . . . A round of applause to the folks at Stow Acres,
whose annual customer appreciation week enabled the club to donate
$1,075 to local food pantries. During four days in mid-October,
instead of green fees, the club asked golfers to donate money to
the charity drive . . . Scott Trethewey of Wellesley CC recently
finished 12th in the PGA Assistant Pro Championship in Port St.
Lucie, Fla. . . . Belgrade Lakes GC in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, was
No. 5 in Golf Digest's list of best new upscale public courses in
1999. Brian Silva's Cape Cod National in Brewster was fourth on the
list of best new private courses . . . The New England Golf
Association elected its slate of officers for 2000 _ Michael Knox
of Searsport, Maine, president; Wilfred Hill Quechee, Vt., first
vice president; Dennis Greenwood of Greenland, N.H., second vice
president; Harry McCracken of Westwood, secretary-treasurer; Robert
Dowling of Centerville, tournament director; Andrew Bailey of
Dedham, counsel; and Daniel Hurley of Andover, Thomas Lane of
Orange, Conn., and Scott W. Cooke of Warwick, R.I., to the
executive committee.

GALAXY'S STARS ALIGNED FOR FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The MLS Cup final has a brief history. But the result of
Sunday's game between the Los Angeles Galaxy and D.C. United at
Foxboro Stadium will likely have long-lasting ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Though this match will not be nearly as wet or wild as the
inaugural final between the Galaxy and United in 1996, it should be
an exemplary presentation of the tactical and technical side of
soccer. Both teams have variety in their game, and are driven by
creative, attacking midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   And both teams have strong motivation to win this game.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy were 10 minutes away from capturing MLS Cup '96 in a
heavy rainstorm and have been hoping for revenge since losing that
game, 3-2, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   United has been MLS's best team but fell to Chicago, 2-0, in
last year's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.C. has been the dominant team since then,'' Galaxy defender
Robin Fraser said of the 1996 final. ``But we were the better team
that year and the better team going into that game. It was our game
to win. We were up, 2-0, and we had momentum in the second half. To
be that close to winning and then lose makes it more
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   United has essentially maintained the momentum of that victory
through this season. Bruce Arena, then an unproven coach at the
professional level, showed he could push the right buttons under
pressure and, against the odds, has become a highly credible US
national team coach. The reputations of young Bolivians Marco
Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno were justifiably elevated, as was Eddie
Pope, who launched the deciding goal in the 94th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Galaxy suddenly were perceived as less glamorous,
and coach Lothar Osiander was soon banished to the Project 40 team.
A year later, three Galaxy starters were sent away in the expansion
draft. Only Fraser and Cobi Jones among the key US players have
been able to maintain their positions and reputations.
</P>
<P>
   So the combination of high stakes and a reduced-width field (68
yards by 106 yards) could influence the Galaxy to play
conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Osiander encouraged an attacking game, catching
many spectators and possibly United by surprise. Sigi Schmid, who
was named MLS coach of the year after replacing Octavio Zambrano,
will likely be more careful.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy set an MLS record by allowing only 29 goals this
season, and allowed more than one goal only twice in the final 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are better organized than last year,'' Fraser said.
``Everyone understands or is aware of their defensive
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   United will hope to set the tone early. D.C. has been vulnerable
to tough tactics, as displayed by Chicago in last year's game and
in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, a 5-1 loss to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won two championships and I'm sure teams want to knock
us off,'' United midfielder Richie Williams said. ``And that is the
right attitude for them to have. You shouldn't be playing unless
you have that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But United has a pragmatic, even arrogant, side. The
aggressiveness of Jeff Agoos, Carlos Llamosa, Pope, and Williams
supports an explosive attacking game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get a point across against Columbus,'' Williams
said. ``We are confident and competitive and we want to play well.
If people want to take that as being arrogant, so be it. I don't
think that's being cocky or egotistical. We respect the opposition
when we go on the field. LA is a good team but we are confident
about what we can do and we will try to play our best game.''

49ERS HAVE REACHED BREAKING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last two moves were signs of desperation, but nobody wanted
to see that. They wanted instead to believe in genius, when genius
was no longer enough.
</P>
<P>
   The last two moves showed how far they'd drifted from what they
used to believe in, but nobody wanted to see that. They wanted to
believe in second chances and the past.
</P>
<P>
   The last two moves were the final acts in a football tragedy
that has been unfolding in San Francisco this season, but the stage
for the collapse of the 49ers had been set years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A generation of football fans has grown up around the Bay area
believing it is their team's right to win 10 games a year and its
duty to win a Super Bowl every 3 1/2 years. Since 1981, the 49ers
have averaged 12.6 wins a season and have won five Super Bowls.
Because of that success, few loyalists saw what was happening to
their team as it slowly began to disintegrate after years of
short-term thinking, salary cap mismanagement, free agency
blunders, and draft errors that made you wonder whether their
scouts spent each fall blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   All of those problems finally were revealed on Sept. 27, the day
the man who'd been hiding them suffered his fourth concussion in
three years. When Steve Young went out, this time without even
being hit in the head, he took the 49ers with him. Symbolically, he
never saw it coming. Neither did they.
</P>
<P>
   Not, at least, until last January, when Bill Walsh was elevated
to general manager after a purge of the front office and an ugly
change in ownership in which Eddie DeBartolo was overthrown by his
sister and his own bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh will be blamed for much of what has followed, including a
3-5 record, because he long ago anointed himself a genius and such
a person doesn't get much slack, but this mess was not of his
creation. Although he has contributed his own mistakes to the dung
heap _ signing troubled Lawrence Phillips and paying a washed-up
Charles Haley a $1.2 million signing bonus this year for no
apparent reason except nostalgia _ he is as responsible for the
collapse of the 49ers as M.L. Carr was for the collapse of the
Celtics. Both just happened to be in the office when it finally
rotted out around them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Walsh failed to provide the 49ers with an adequate
backup quarterback for the antiquated Young, whose bell has been
rung more than the one at the Arlington Street Church. Walsh lost
Ty Detmer to Cleveland and thus left the team vulnerable when Young
went out, probably for his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh inherited a financial mess: a $28 million overage on
the salary cap that called for the kind of draconian cuts only a
Republican could love. And he is facing another $12 million overage
next year, which means more heads will roll at a time when
reinforcements are needed.
</P>
<P>
   After months of whispering around the league about the 49ers,
veteran safety Tim McDonald finally said last weekend, following a
24-6 pasting by the New Orleans Saints, their fifth straight loss,
what everyone else was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not very good,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 19 years since the Niners lost five in a row, but
it's a circumstance they had better get used to. Rome wasn't built
in a day and the 49ers won't be rebuilt in a day. Or even in a
season or two.
</P>
<P>
   This fall has been coming for years because the future was
mortgaged time and again by DeBartolo and Carmen Policy in exchange
for a quick-fix free agent who might help them stay competitive for
one more year. Time and again this was done without regard for what
the new contract would one day mean, and now DeBartolo is gone,
Policy is gone, and the 49ers are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this, but when a team turns old and
feeble, you can usually trace much of the problem to the draft
room. Since 1989, San Francisco has had an incredible string of
drafts that were barren at the top. Keith DeLong, Dexter Carter,
Dana Hall, Todd Kelly, Israel Ifeayani (are you kidding me?), Jim
Druckenmiller (are you kidding me again?), and R.W. McQuarters have
done little to maintain the 49ers' dominance but they've had much
to do with their demise.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Dana Stubblefield arrived in 1993 and Bryant Young
and William Floyd came a year later, but Stubblefield and Floyd are
gone already and Young is damaged goods after the terrible broken
leg he sustained a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Stokes was a No. 1 pick in 1995 and Terrell Owens arrived
in the third round in 1996, but retaining them this year cost the
49ers millions they couldn't afford. Little other desperately
needed talent followed them to San Francisco, so now they are rich
losers, which is better than just being losers but barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the heck did you not see this coming?'' veteran linebacker
Ken Norton asked recently.
</P>
<P>
   Well, player greed, ownership arrogance, and the mirage that
Steve Young's talent created had a lot to do with it. Over time
those things ate away at the foundation of the organization until
it finally had to make panic moves like signing Phillips, whom they
now are trying to dump, and Haley, who brought nothing to the table
but good jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Left with the likes of Jeff Garcia and Steve Stenstrom at
quarterback, the Niners spent last week pursuing 38-year-old Jeff
Hostetler, who hasn't completed a pass since 1997 and started
negotiations by saying he couldn't show up for three weeks because
he had to take his recovering son on vacation in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Following last Sunday's dismal loss, Jerry Rice spoke to his
teammates from the heart. He spoke of 49er pride and of a refusal
to give up and of everyone being responsible. The next day, the
entire team was taken to a horror film _ a replay of all the
mistakes they had made against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the Niners watch film in units, but coach Steve
Mariucci had them all in one room. The symbolism was clear. They're
all in this together.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo next in line?
</P>
<P>
   Word is Buffalo has turned a keen eye toward Phillips, the
troubled running back who is likely to be cut this week by the
49ers if they are granted some cap relief. When running backs coach
Tom Rathman asked Phillips to practice last week, he refused,
saying he was never used anyway. The former Nebraska star has now
washed out in St. Louis, Miami, and San Francisco, proving one
thing: He's not a very good back when he's not running against
college defenders. Still, the Bills are desperate, with their two
top backs hurting. Coach Wade Phillips, general manager John
Butler, and even owner Ralph Wilson all refused to say they would
not sign Phillips if he is released. Each said ``no comment,''
which was interpreted as ``yes'' by the Buffalo media, who roasted
management for even thinking about that. But other sources say the
Bills are not willing to risk the chemistry of a potential Super
Bowl team on Phillips, despite their interest in him last spring
when he played in NFL Europe. In 35 NFL games, Phillips has
averaged 3.4 yards a carry; he also can't catch and won't block.
What he will do periodically is throw a tantrum if he thinks he
isn't getting enough playing time. Some people never learn from
either the facts or their own mistakes. A year ago, Buffalo signed
linebacker Wayne Simmons, who had been waived by the Chiefs in the
middle of the season because he caused more problems for his own
coaches than opponents. He took the Bills' money and didn't give
them a thing, but now they're zeroing in on Phillips, which only
confirms what his first NFL coach said a week ago. ``Obviously
there are some flaws there,'' said the Rams' Dick Vermeil.
``Obviously he has some problems he can't overcome right now. But I
think he'll probably get another opportunity. That's the way it is
in this country, but it's nuts.'' Vermeil should know. He swallowed
Phillips's nonsense for two years before finally giving up on him .
. . The problem for the 49ers is that they already are $12 million
over the salary cap for next year and if they release Phillips
immediately, another $212,500 in bonus money would be heaped on. A
clause in Phillips's contract could reduce that figure in a
giveback, but not significantly . . . Last Sunday, Bengals top
running back Corey Dillon threw a fit after he was removed from the
game against Tennessee with the ball at the Titans' 1-yard line. In
the locker room, he threatened to sit out next season if Cincinnati
tried to use his status as a restricted free agent to retain his
services, saying, ``I will be delivered.'' Well, maybe if he did
deliver, they wouldn't have taken him out. Dillon has run the ball
on third-and-1 situations 11 times this year, tied with the Titans'
Eddie George for tops in the league. His production? He has failed
to get the yard more than half the time (6) and had been stuffed
for no gain on four of his last five tries. That's not all Dillon's
fault, but he must have had something to do with it . . . Sometimes
it's not easy being Jim Miller. Especially if you work for the
Chicago Bears. Not the Jim Miller who will start at quarterback for
them Sunday, having moved from third string in September to No. 1
in November, but the Jim Miller who is director of business
operations. On a recent trip to Tampa, that Jim Miller went to his
room, only to find two double beds and Cade McNown's luggage on one
of them. When he went back to the front desk to check on the mixup,
he was directed to the other Jim Miller's room. When he got there,
there was the quarterback under the covers of a king-size bed,
watching a football game. He dressed and moved. The other Jim
Miller now uses his initials on the road.
</P>
<P>
   A penalty puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Penalties are supposed to be of some import in the NFL. Too many
signals confusion and lack of discipline, leading to defeat. Or so
coaches will tell you. So how come the Dolphins have had fewer
penalties than their opponent only twice all season and lost both
games? . . . Remember how Bill Parcells took a swipe at Pete
Carroll for overusing Curtis Martin in the running back's final
season in New England? Funny how things can change. Martin leads
the NFL in rushing this season with 895 yards and has carried the
ball 38 and 31 times the last two games. That makes it six times in
his career he's carried 30 or more times _ only one behind all-time
leader Walter Payton. It took Payton 13 years, however. Martin is
on pace to rush nearly 400 times this season. Parcells has lamented
many times how he shortened the career of Joe Morris and vowed not
to make the same mistake with Martin. Apparently he forgot . . .
The Colts' Marvin Harrison not only will be in his native
Philadelphia handing out dozens of tickets to his relatives, he'll
be back home on Tuesday to hand out the same number of Thanksgiving
turkeys as his jersey number _ 88 . . . Since we're talking about
holiday good guys, how about Tampa's Warrick Dunn? For the third
year, Dunn will make down payments on new houses for three single
mothers in his hometown of Baton Rouge, La., just before
Thanksgiving and three more in Tampa Bay just before Christmas. He
also stocks the kitchens with a turkey and all the fixings for a
holiday meal. There are still some good guys left in sports . . .
After Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer was benched he held a
press conference in which he said an injury to Eric Zeier would
eventually bring him a second chance. Ten days later he looked like
Nostradamus when Zeier went down with damage to four ribs. Dilfer
has not only returned, he's played like the quarterback the Bucs
thought they drafted in 1994. In his last two games, he has
completed 68 percent of his passes and delivered five touchdown
passes for a 129.5 quarterback rating, about twice what it was when
he sat down. And he's done it without the services of Bert Emanuel,
who is supposed to be his best receiver. Emanuel is back but it may
take some doing to convince Dilfer to look away from tiny Jacquez
Green, with whom he has done a lot of damage deep . . . Bucs
fullback Mike Alstott fumbled three times last Sunday, so coach
Tony Dungy made him run the gantlet in practice, with two rows of
players pummeling him with blocking pads. Dungy also took his time
blowing the whistle during offensive practice while ordering the
defense to try to rip the ball from the normally reliable Alstott.
</P>
<P>
   Pack mentality
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren knew when to get out of Green Bay. These are hard
times for the Packers. Quarterback Brett Favre's thumb is
throbbing, his game is hurting, and even his father has said he's
lost some confidence. The Pack has lost four of five and scored
just one offensive touchdown in six of its nine games. Things have
gotten so bad that head coach Ray Rhodes sat in with the offensive
coaches last week even though he's been a defensive coach his
entire career. GM Ron Wolf was publicly critical of the offense,
which put further heat on coordinator Sherm Lewis. No one is
feeling the heat more than Favre, however. He is 26th in
quarterback rating, leads the NFL in interceptions, and said last
week, ``I may have to pull the reins back and not make some of the
throws I make.'' . . . Vikings coach Dennis Green has shifted
272-pound tight end Jim Kleinsasser to fullback to utilize his
blocking ability and reduce his opportunities to drop passes. The
Vikings traded three draft choices to move up and grab Kleinsasser
in the second round, but when he fumbled twice against the Bears
and dropped the only pass thrown to him, Green began to rethink his
position. What makes Green think Kleinsasser can make the shift?
Unofficially, Viking coaches say, he has made blocks that bent in
more than 20 face masks this season. As unofficial stats go, that
is pretty convincing . . . With a date on Thanksgiving, Detroit
will have to go at least two more games without Charlie Batch. Not
that Batch plans to take the holiday off, but his battered thumb
and the short practice week will make it impossible for him to get
back before December . . . Sometimes a little-used backup defensive
back can be an unsung hero. That was the case for Earl Little in
the Browns' stunning 16-15 win over Pittsburgh a week ago. Little
was trying to get a good view from the sidelines of Phil Dawson's
winning field goal try when he realized somebody was missing:
Dawson. The Browns' kicker was still on the sidelines, hitting
practice kicks into a net behind the bench, assuming quarterback
Tim Couch would spike the ball once to stop the clock. But with
Cleveland having no timeouts, head coach Chris Palmer had decided
to just go for it. Apparently no one told Dawson. When Little saw
the holder in the huddle but no kicker, he found Dawson and told
him the field goal team was on the field. Not another Brown noticed
. . . Here's proof that some stats mean nothing. The Seahawks are
7-2 but are ranked 26th in defense and 23d in offense. How can that
be? Because they're seventh in average points allowed and eighth in
average points scored, the only stats besides wins that mean
anything . . . New Orleans running back Ricky Williams watched last
Saturday as Wisconsin's Ron Dayne broke the NCAA career rushing
record Williams set only a year ago at Texas. ``Now I know how Miss
America feels,'' Williams said . . . Apparently, that very public
spat between Chargers quarterback Jim Harbaugh and defensive back
Michael Dumas didn't end on the field last Sunday. Word out of San
Diego is it flared up again in the stadium tunnel and the two had
to be dragged off each other.

COATES INSISTS TIME ISN'T CATCHING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After his outburst three weeks ago in Arizona, Ben
Coates still hasn't experienced a return to the golden days of his
career. He still is often a decoy. He still is not registering big
reception numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Coates acknowledges that his role has been reduced in the
Patriots offense _ and that pass-catching numbers for tight ends
have dropped around the league _ but he does not think he has lost
a step, or that he can no longer play at the level he once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me a little upset, but it doesn't really matter what
people say about me,'' said Coates, who plays in his 135th game
Sunday against the Dolphins. ``All that matters is what I think of
myself. I'm out there playing. I can see what I can do and what I
can't do. I see myself on film, I can still play.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday against the Jets, Coates caught two passes for 14
yards. He was often kept in to block on two-tight-end sets, while
his understudy, Rod Rutledge, went out to catch passes. Coates
couldn't even draw an interference call when linebacker Roman
Phifer mauled him in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few Boston athletes with as much personal pride
as Coates. Few have been so driven for so long to succeed. Coates
was not supposed to be a big factor in the NFL when Bobby Grier
found him at tiny Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C., nine
years ago. But he has been. He flourished in New England under Bill
Parcells, and after that 24-17 loss to Parcells and the Jets, his
former coach patted Coates's head and laid it against his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Coates is the poster child for the Parcells regime. The
combination of Parcells's offense and Coates's initiative made him
unsurpassed at his position.
</P>
<P>
   But Coates was bashed for speaking out in anger and frustration
after a 27-3 victory in Phoenix. He has been accused of being
selfish, of being all done. The critics say he has taken too many
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt I was slowing down,'' said Coates, ``I'd just say,
`Here's my helmet, my uniform, I'm done.' I would know best if I'm
done. I'm not here to fool anyone. I'm not going to fool myself.
I'm not going to be one of those guys who just hangs around and
hangs around. If I can't play at a high level anymore, I'd be the
first to notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 18 receptions in nine games, it is somewhat surprising
that Coates still leads by a comfortable margin in All-Pro fan
balloting for tight ends. San Diego's Freddie Jones (37 catches)
and Kansas City's Tony Gonzalez (33) are having better years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice,'' said Coates. ``I'm surprised with that, but
maybe I'm the name they recognize at this position. I'm flattered
by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems that all teams are going down the field more.
Everybody's stats are way down. The young guys are getting catches.
But I'd say it's a down year for tight ends.''
</P>
<P>
   With zone blitzes becoming more prevalent, it seems teams are
keeping the tight end in to block more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the emphasis has gone back to blocking,'' said
Rutledge. ``Every week we're faced with teams just blitzing Drew
(Bledsoe) all the time. We have to keep more protection in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that explanation, the whispers of Coates's demise
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Shawn Jefferson, who practices with Coates every day,
said, ``He hasn't slowed down one bit. He's a superstar at his
position and just because his catches are down doesn't mean he's
slowed down. Because I can see he hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates still draws a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm doubled more than the other tight ends, and that
comes because of respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a double-team with a safety or a linebacker or two
linebackers. That should open things up for other guys. Like on
Monday night, I sometimes had three guys on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Coates was able to get better separation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate yourself,'' said Coates. ``You've got to
get the ball quicker and you've got to run a lot of timing routes.
If not, it gives the second guy a chance to come over to cover
you.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dolphins did less doubling on him than usual in their
31-30 victory Oct. 17, Coates doesn't necessarily agree that
linebacker Zach Thomas did a great job shutting him down, even
though Coates had only two catches for 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you play against a guy so many times you start
to learn the little things about a guy,'' said Coates. ``I guess
he's watched a lot of film of me. But he did a good job. They
singled me sometimes, but not all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a lack of respect for Coates when Rutledge, a second-year
player, is sent out for passes while he is kept in to block?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were trying to mix up the defense a little bit,''
said Coates. ``They overpursue to me, so let him go out just to
create some confusion with the defense. It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates has mentored Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming along pretty good,'' said Coates. ``He's going to
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether he's mentoring him too well _ whether
Rutledge's increased playing time is a signal to Coates that he's
being pushed out by a younger player.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that's the way of the world in the NFL. With salary
caps come tough decisions even on great players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to go out and try to catch everything that's
thrown to me, try to throw a key block, and just do some things to
help the team win,'' said Coates, who is trying to separate himself
from the angry words he uttered back on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were a few things talked about but I really
don't want to be involved in that anymore. Now, just let bygones be
bygones and try to help the team win and get into the playoffs. The
main goal is to get into the playoffs and see where we can go after
that.''

WIN OR LOSE, IT'S A LEARNING EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Once upon a time, there was a team known as the Boston
Celtics. They played basketball, and they played it very well. On
the rare occasion when they would lose a regular-season game, their
reaction was very simple. The next night, they were ready to kill
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously. A single loss made people like Larry Bird, Kevin
McHale, Robert Parish, and Dennis Johnson feel morose, and never
mind that it was just one lousy little loss out of 82 games. They
hated to lose. They considered losing to be an aberrant fluke of
nature. This is why, assuming they were in at least reasonably good
health, they didn't lose two in a row very often.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll never has coached in the NBA, but among the stops
during his 25-year coaching career was San Francisco, and his
business there had nothing to do with the Giants or Warriors. In
1995 and 1996, he was the defensive coordinator of the 49ers, who,
while even then on the decline, nevertheless had the bearing and
aura of a true champion. There was a clear 49er way of life, and
dealing with a simple ``L'' on the schedule was one of its aspects.
Simply put, no proper 49er ever felt that he had lost a game, or
even that he plus the other 44 men in uniform had lost the game.
No, a loss was disturbing because it meant that the hallowed San
Francisco 49ers had lost a game, and that was a very bad thing.
Those guys felt very proprietary about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about a tradition of excellence, a legacy,'' Carroll
recalls. ``Those teams had very high standards. But it's easier to
get that feeling when a group has spent a lot of time together. In
this era of free agency and so forth, it's harder to capture that
feeling. But if you've been paying attention, we've been trying to
do that here by keeping our key players together.''
</P>
<P>
   We will learn a little something about the 1999 New England
Patriots at Pro Player Stadium this Sunday afternoon. A W would be
nice, but it isn't mandatory. Of course, if no W is forthcoming
Sunday, then one next week in what we can can assume will be frigid
Orchard Park, N.Y., actually will be mandatory. No, a W is always
desirable, but what people need to see this week from the Patriots
are two things _ a pulse and a heart. Neither were very visible
against the Jets in Foxboro Stadium last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, as we've learned, is a glass-is-90-percent-full guy, no
matter what the circumstances. So when he tells us he has a good
feeling about Sunday's game, we are tempted to roll our eyes and
seek a more realistic appraisal elsewhere. But here, for the
record, is the Pete Carroll preparedness take on Sunday's
Patriots-Dolphins matchup:
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly about the way we approached this week. We
especially practiced very hard on Thursday. It was one of our most
physical practices of the year. I was concerned we were taking it
all out on ourselves. We need to save it for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance you've been trekking the outback these last
few months, be advised that the Miami Dolphins have undergone a
complete identity makeover under Jimmy Johnson, not all of it
voluntary. For most of the last 20 years, the Dolphins have been
more about offense than about defense, and beyond that, more about
passing than running. Now they are all about defense. Offense is
now the annoying down time until the feared Miami defense can get
back on the field to create either points or better field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a terrific defense,'' salutes Carroll. ``And it's built
from the defensive tackles out. They've got (Daryl) Gardener and
(Richard) Owens, and then they fill in with great speed. They are
very aggressive and they are willing to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dan Marino still not ready to play, third-year man Damon
Huard is overseeing a safety-first offense. His obvious mandate is
to avoid turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other major consideration when you play the
Dolphins. Life is a lot better on such a limited offensive team if
said squad is in possession of a superior placekicker. Olindo Mare,
who has kicked as many as six field goals in a game, is such a
kicker. He is one of those rare long-range field goal kickers who
affects the decision-making of both coaches, as Carroll readily
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very, very good kicker,'' Carroll points out. ``He can
hurt you from a long way out. He also has a very effective onsides
kick you must be aware of. So, yes, we have adjusted our plans to
account for him. Six field goals in a game will get your
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, no one connected with the Patriots was paying
attention. The coaching staff had a game plan purchased from some
guy standing out on Route 1, and the players embarrassed themselves
on both sides of the ball. We might be willing to forgive them all
for one bad night.
</P>
<P>
   One, I say. But that is the quota. Sunday we will learn whether
playing for the New England Patriots means anything to these guys.

OPPONENTS MIRROR EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Sam Madison sat at his locker, was told his
interviewer was from Boston, and got ready to answer the expected
questions. About Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Madison held Glenn without a catch in the first
Patriots-Dolphins game in October. The Miami cornerback had
answered the question many times during the week. It wasn't just
him stopping Glenn, said Madison, teammates were in the coverage,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And two or three times Terry was open, but (Drew) Bledsoe
didn't get him the ball. So it wasn't just me, '' Madison said.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions followed. Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson had made
this ``Patriots Week,'' demanding that his team focus on the
Patriots and nothing else. A bad loss in Buffalo last week deflated
the Dolphins' balloon and Johnson felt a factor in the Buffalo loss
might have been a mental lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do that every week,'' said Madison, when asked if the
Dolphins were completely focused on the Patriots. ``You're not
looking ahead, you're not looking back, you're just looking to the
team you're playing now. And he just made us focus on it, that it's
something we need to do better, focus on the team we're playing,
and what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Two desperate teams will be in Pro Player Stadium Sunday. Teams
coming off losses, teams that can't afford another loss in the
ultra-competitive AFC East, but most of all, division rivals. Two
desperate teams that know each other well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this game so competitive and what will
probably make this into a great football game,'' said Madison.
``You know it's going to be a hard-fought game because we know each
other so well. And you know it's going to be close. And you know
it's going to be going down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison said that is because the teams are so familiar with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard because Glenn and (Shawn) Jefferson know you
and you know them,'' said Madison. ``During the week you're
thinking, `Now what are they going to do this time?' And, `How are
they going to attack us this time?' They know your weaknesses and
now you're thinking, `I got to go work on my weaknesses.' And they
know your strong points.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Division rivals in the National Football League know each other
well; in many cases, too well. Familiarity breeds contempt, but
usually familiarity breeds the same old results, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like going one-on-one with your brother, division rivals know
what to expect of each others' moves, and the result is often the
same, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and the Jets? New England will be outcoached. The
Patriots and the Colts? New England always manages to win, no
matter how many coaches, quarterbacks, or general managers are
changed in Indianapolis. The Patriots and the Bills? To a lesser
extent, the Patriots usually do very well against Buffalo. The
Bills' Bruce Smith, for instance, is a league terror but recently
has had little impact against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and the Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   A true rivalry, an evenly matched battle, a matchup too close to
call. When Miami and New England play, the game will be close, no
matter the location. The last five regular-season games have been
decided by a margin of 3 or fewer points.
</P>
<P>
   And, even more so this season, the Dolphins and Patriots are
mirror images. Each team is coming off an embarrassing divisional
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Both have troubled offenses and depend too much on their
defense; both have an unhappy tight end (the Dolphins' Troy Drayton
and the Patriots' Ben Coates) who want to catch more passes and
block less.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are considered offense-oriented, even though they
have been woefully inconsistent. The Dolphins' offensive problems
are more understandable since Dan Marino has been out a month. His
backup, inexperienced Damon Huard, has been instructed to play
conservatively. Against the Bills, Huard made many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin was asked if one trait can
separate these two very similar teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude,'' said Martin. ``The team that goes into the game
wanting it more, that will be the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the Patriots and Dolphins know each other very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Patriots will come out and (Jefferson and Glenn)
will be saying, `We have to do this, because they did that to us
the last time,' '' said Madison. ``And we're out there thinking,
`We have to do this to stop them.' Most of all, it's because we
know what they're going to do and they know what we're going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison doesn't expect to shut out Glenn again (``That first
game was about the best I've played,'') just as he doesn't expect
the Dolphins to change defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Offense is a different matter. The Dolphins have been confused
and bothered by the Patriots' blitzes. Johnson had his team
practice against the New England blitzes all week and Huard is
expected to take shorter drops and make quicker throws to offset
the blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets' defense confused the New England offense as
few teams have done in recent years, it won't make any difference
to the Dolphins. Miami will not be trying to duplicate the Jets'
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to go out and play our defense,'' said
Madison. ``We don't need to go out and try to change our whole
defense just because somebody else did something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Patriots are professionals and they're going to
make adjustments off what happened last week to them. We're going
to keep our same defense and hopefully the right call at the right
time will confuse them. And that's what happened with the Jets
against the Patriots last week: The Jets had the right calls on at
the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots and Dolphins, division rivals who know each other so
well.

SHAQ THE 40-MINUTE MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers didn't need Shaquille O'Neal to play 43
minutes to beat the Chicago Bulls on Friday. But some night,
against some opponent, they will need a marathon effort from
O'Neal, and coach Phil Jackson wants him to be ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   That, Jackson said, is why O'Neal played continuously through
the entire first, second and third quarters Friday, finally heading
to the bench for the first time with 4:39 remaining in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my plan,'' Jackson said Saturday, ``to make him have
to think about carrying that game idea of a 40-minute plan _ where
to use his energy, where not to expend energy and save himself at
certain times.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that offensively he doesn't have to go every time he
catches the ball. He can make passes, let somebody else do the
work. . . . I thought he carried that concept really quite well
last night, but when the game got into a certain position where
they were just going to foul him every time, he'd already shot 31
free throws, I didn't want to wear him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noticed early on that the Lakers were on pace for only
80 possessions, not 100, meaning O'Neal could play all 48 minutes
of the down-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to finish . . . so he would feel good about
playing the whole game on a back-to-back night,'' Jackson said. ``I
just wanted him to know that he's capable of doing it
strength-wise, mentally and psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Jackson acknowledged, this was also a statement about the
Lakers' lack of depth in frontcourt muscle. O'Neal's backups are
spindly 7-footer Travis Knight and unretired 35-year-old John
Salley. Neither has impressed in short stints at center; they have
been used sparingly. Salley has played one minute over the last
three games; Knight is averaging a team-low 5.0 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seems intent on following through with his earlier plan
to have O'Neal average 40 minutes a game this season. Not including
the two games from which O'Neal was ejected, he's averaged 38.9
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he's neither surprised nor daunted by the long
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Phil needs me to do, I just have to do it,'' he said.
``That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dribbles: Guard Tyronn Lue, who was placed on the injured list
last Monday, has been diagnosed with a bone bruise in his ailing
right knee. He's eligible to be activated after Wednesday's game
against Utah. . . . O'Neal and Ron Harper were limited to
conditioning exercises Saturday after both played long minutes this
week.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Where do wax figures go when they die?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter of a century, the Country Music Wax
Museum was one of Nashville's most colorful tourist magnets. One in
every nine visitors to Nashville walked through its doors, gawking
at life-size replicas of Hank Williams, George Jones and Dolly
Parton.
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary wax museum. Performers like Minnie Pearl
and Johnny Cash donated clothes and instruments and even tended to
their characters. Once, after Jim Reeves had died and his ex-wife
dropped by to brush the hair on his exhibit, employees saw she had
put a picture of herself on the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Country Music Wax Museum quietly shut its doors two
years ago, a casualty of Nashville's self-conscious rush toward
modernization. In 1971, when the museum opened, Nashville was a
small city with a handful of studios; today the population of the
metropolitan area has boomed past 1 million, and there are 400
music studios. Professional hockey and football teams have moved
into town, and health care has replaced country music as the city's
No. 1 moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   The wax museum was once part of a thriving tourist mall, along
with the Hank Williams Jr. Museum, Barbara Mandrell Country and the
Car Collectors Hall of Fame. Now they, too, are closed, and there
are plans to supplant them with a traffic circle, offices and a
Ritz-Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened to the cherished wax figures of country music
greats with their vintage finery and original instruments?
</P>
<P>
   Not even officials of the Country Music Hall of Fame across the
street knew the answer. This reporter crisscrossed Nashville on the
trail of the missing wax figures, encountering tales of a vanished
promoter, a Kennedy campaign consultant and a Taiwanese herb
vendor. But nothing could prepare him for what he found.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three shopkeepers who remain in the area _ once
called the gateway to Music Row but now nicknamed ``death row'' _
knew the figures' whereabouts. Rumor had it that they had been sold
to the Music Valley Wax Museum, a newer attraction on the city's
outskirts, where the Opryland USA theme park, since demolished, had
lured the tourists who once kept the mall's shops in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did offer their collection to us,'' said Doris Harvey,
the assistant manager of the Music Valley Wax Museum. ``But they
didn't want to break the set, and we already had many of the same
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries at the Country Music Hall of Fame revealed little.
Administrators said they were never offered the figures. But one
employee brought out a charmingly crude wax museum coloring book
she had recently bought for 99 cents at the local grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brazzell, the proprietor, found the books in the back
of the store when she bought the place some two years ago. Phone
calls to former employees of the museum produced the vague
conjecture that the figures had been melted down.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 figures were missing. And it wasn't so surprising
in a city that likes to reinvent itself every few years,
complaining about the loss of tradition while paving over its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city decided that they want the convention business,''
said Jim Cook, the owner of Hat Country, a wax museum neighbor that
is going out of business. ``But they can't create that new image of
Nashville without killing the old one.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago the Country Music Wax Museum was tied to the most
powerful people in the city. Aurora Publishing, a failed book and
entertainment venture that had managed to pull most of Nashville
into its orbit, founded the museum. One of its first chiefs was
Paul Corbin, a political operative who worked on campaigns for John
F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. After their assassinations,
Corbin found respite from politics in wax figures, often borrowing
their boots to wear around town.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's most notorious operator was Dominic DeLorenzo,
an Aurora founder described by former employees as a good-looking,
slick-talking charmer who persuaded Nashville luminaries like Chet
Atkins, Minnie Pearl and the newspaper mogul John Seigenthaler to
invest in the publishing company and museum. It was while dining at
the Peking Restaurant, a country star hangout, that DeLorenzo
discovered the museum's future: Daniel Hsu, the son of a leading
herbal medicine authority from Taiwan, who had given up his
microbiology studies at Vanderbilt University to open the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu soon became majority shareholder in Aurora, and DeLorenzo
left Nashville for New York and disappeared, leaving behind a pile
of creditors, some of whom believe that he faked his death.
DeLorenzo's son, Dominick, who used to spend his summers working at
the museum, said his father died of cancer in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hsu, the wax museum thrived and the area around it
blossomed into a tourist mecca of offbeat novelty stores and
shrines to country stars. In a bold move in a world of Hank
Williams Jr. fans, Hsu opened a Chinese art museum above the wax
museum. And when Hsu learned that a relative of Seigenthaler's was
an artist, he commissioned her to make new wax figures.
</P>
<P>
   The last one she made was of George Strait. A faded wood sign
above the old museum still advertises the addition to the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Opryland closing, tourism slumping, the Hall of Fame moving
downtown and tour buses rerouting to the more package-tour-friendly
Branson, Mo., the death knell for the neighborhood rang in 1997
when a city-sponsored study determined that a business district
would be more useful.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hsu had left to work for his family's herbal medicine
business in California, selling the buildings to a developer named
Jim Caden, who converted them into office space and a shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wanted us out of there,'' said Phyllis Shoemake, a
former wax museum employee who now distributes herbal medicines,
including Hsu's. ``They thought we were an eyesore. Now it's a
ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Caden's office buildings became home to a magazine called
Country Weekly. And it was there that the trail of the wax figures
got warm again. Visitors reported seeing the Hank Williams dummy in
the reception area, leaning against the wall in his original suit
designed by Nudie the Rodeo Tailor.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure enough, a reporter for Country Weekly, Bob Cannon,
knew exactly where the figures were: They had never left the
building and were locked up, deteriorating, in the basement. ``The
weird thing is, if you go down there at night, it's real spooky,''
he said. ``You have 40 wax figures looking at you. And they all
look like Buddy Ebsen, whether they're male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring phone calls for a week, Caden eventually agreed
to open the storage room, which was once home to the car
collectors' museum. ``But,'' he warned as he unlocked the door, ``I
don't want you to write anything making fun of the South, or some
of the positions these figures are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the pieces looked more as if they belonged to a country
music chamber of horrors than a wax museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Michael Horton, the building's maintenance man,
``was Ronnie Milsap's head.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to a wax face that had been smashed by vandals.
Barbara Mandrell's head, with a hairpiece she had designed, was
impaled on a stick, yards away from her torso. Johnny Cash, all in
black, stood against the wall, one arm hanging below his knee. Pop
Stoneman's autoharp rested on a bench, covered with detached
fingers. Uncle Dave Macon's gold teeth had been stolen. And Hank
Williams Jr. lay on his back with two disembodied hands across his
chest and a giant crack running along his neck
</P>
<P>
   Just who owns these figures _ 62 of them not counting various
busts and body parts _ is in some doubt. Caden said they either
belonged to him, to Hsu or to Aurora. ``But,'' he added, ``I don't
even know where Daniel Hsu is, to be quite honest.'' Hsu, who works
in the Irvine, Calif., office of Brion, his family's herb company,
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Nashville's delinquents didn't recognize the value
of what they were vandalizing, and left the costumes intact. When
Mark Medley, the archivist for the Country Music Hall of Fame,
walked into the storeroom to determine the collection's worth, his
jaw dropped. There were clothes from the entire Carter Family,
Jimmie Rodgers' singing brakeman outfit, a rare Gretsch guitar that
once belonged to Jim Reeves, handwritten lyrics from the Stoneman
Family and more than a dozen stage suits by Nudie, the
rhinestone-loving designer who created country high-fashion in the
late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collection of suits is really the most complete I've ever
seen,'' Medley said. ``Their historical and monetary worth is
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange,'' he continued. ``These things belonged to
people who are so exalted, and now their costumes end up on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long they will stay on the floor is anybody's guess.
``I don't have a clue what I'm going to do with them,'' Caden said.
``I thought some bolt of lightning would strike us, and we would
figure it out. But we really have no plans.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the figures remain in limbo, a waxy analogy for country
music itself as they decay untended while Nashville races after its
cosmopolitan dream.

Texas Tech's Dykes goes out in style
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ ``It was time.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sharon Dykes, said she has known it for a few weeks.
Texas Tech players said they have felt it in the past couple of
weeks. Saturday, Spike Dykes made it official.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes announced his retirement after 13 seasons as Tech's head
football coach, adding that he could not have asked for a better
way to go out than to have his team topple 13-point favorite
Oklahoma 38-28 at Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this a long time, and I don't know if I've
ever had a better win,'' Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Red Raiders gave Dykes a ride on their
shoulders across the field. After dismounting, he stood hugging his
wife of 40 years in one arm and his daughter, Bebe, in the other as
the Tech band played the school alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   The three remained interlocked as Dykes made his final walk to
the locker room, with fans lining the railing above the tunnel
shouting best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be hard riding off into the sunset,'' Dykes said. ``It's
more than just a job to me. I can truly say I am proud to be a Red
Raider. I don't know anyone in the world any more proud of being a
Texas Tech Red Raider than I am, and I always will be. It's been a
great ride. It has really been a fun deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was heavy (leaving the field). You can't hardly do
this and not have strong feelings. But I've strong feelings about
red and black and strong feelings about Texas Tech. It was hard.
There was a big lump in my throat. I had goose bumps the size of
silver dollars. That was a neat deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, 61, won the hearts of many with his lovable West Texas
persona and self-deprecating humor. He won the hearts of Tech fans
with victories on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, whose team qualified for a bowl with Saturday's win, has
posted an 82-67-1 record, making him the winningest coach in Tech
history. His 13-year tenure is the longest of any Red Raiders
coach, and he was the first Tech coach to lead his team to four
consecutive bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 season has been a trying one for Dykes, who began
his coaching career as an assistant at Eastland High School in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the season, there were feelings in some corners that
it was time for Dykes to step down. A loss to 30-point underdog
North Texas on Sept. 18 turned those feelings into a full-scale
movement.
</P>
<P>
   But Dykes' squad quieted the crowd with a 21-19 win over
then-No. 5-ranked Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more reason for the anti-Dykes faction to get
upset, however. Tech would go on to lose three more games after the
A&AMP;M victory, and in none of those losses were the Red Raiders
competitive, losing each by at least 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State beat Tech 41-21, and Missouri notched a 34-7 win
over the Red Raiders. Tech responded to both of those losses with a
rousing win, but when Texas handed the Red Raiders their worst loss
in history (58-7) on Nov. 13, it was all but a foregone conclusion
that now was the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a crazy year,'' said Dykes, whose first college
coaching job was as an assistant at Texas under Darrell Royal.
``When you go through a year like this, you think, `I believe I'll
get me a rod and reel, get me a driver and some shag balls and see
if I can't hit 'em and catch 'em.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's up-and-down play may have fueled the critics' fire, but
the Red Raiders said Dykes could not be blamed for their troubles
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the reason we were able to bounce back the way we have
all season long, not why we didn't play well at times,'' offensive
lineman Jonathan Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand how unfair it was to blame him,''
senior quarterback Rob Peters said. ``He is Tech football. He built
the program up to where it is. They will know how much he meant
when he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The criticism) hurt him, but he always made sure not to let
it affect his coaching us. He never brought it in to work. He kept
us out of that and concentrating on football.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ricky Williams, who entered the season as a Heisman
Trophy candidate but injured his knee in the first half of a
season-opening loss at Arizona State, said the disappointment of
missing almost the entire season pales in comparison to the loss of
Dykes as his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will be back and play again, but he won't be on the
sidelines, and that'll be tough,'' Williams said. ``The stuff he
took this year was unbearable, and it was hard on the team. It's
hard to hear your father, your friend, your family member talked
about the way he has been this year. And coach Dykes is more than a
coach to us; he's like a father to many of us. He's our friend.
He's family.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source in the athletic department, Tech would
like to hire a former head coach or a current offensive coordinator
to replace Dykes, who had one year remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The source indicated he was unsure if Tech would be willing to
pay the high salaries being sought by top coaches, so a coordinator
might be a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma offensive coordinator Mike Leach is reportedly tops on
the school's wish list. Leach said Saturday he had talked to
``someone'' at Tech about the position, but the talks were
``general'' in nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Lubbock Avalanche Journal has reported of sources who claim
Tech has asked Clemson for permission to talk to its offensive
coordinator, Rich Rodriguez, about the head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, a native of Lubbock, took over on an interim basis for
David McWilliams _ who left for Texas after one season at Tech _
before the Red Raiders played in the Independence Bowl in 1986.
After being named head coach, Dykes led the Red Raiders to
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his good-natured personality, Dykes will likely be most
remembered for his success against the state's two largest schools
_ Texas and Texas A&AMP;M. He posted 12 wins over the two powerhouses
in his career, going 6-7 against both.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes said he is unsure of how he will be remembered, but as per
his style, he has a hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be remembered as thin, I can't be remembered as smart,
and I can't be remembered as fast, so that eliminates a lot of
things,'' Dykes said. ``I ain't gonna be thin, I ain't gonna be
smart, and I ain't gonna be fast, but I'd like to think I was
real.''

LONG BEACH STATE PUTS ON GOOD SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ They hustled and scrambled and clawed for the
entire 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They led by as many as 11 points (20-9) on one occasion and it
even momentarily appeared that they might silence the frenzied home
crowd and run away to an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't faintly resemble the listless, disjointed team that
opened the season a year ago with that humiliating 83-65 loss to
Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Long Beach State 49ers did commence their season
Saturday afternoon with another loss that left their beleaguered
coach, Wayne Morgan, frustrated and agonized and philosophizing,
``As Pat Riley says, there's only winning and misery in basketball
and this is misery for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Morgan and his fast-moving, fast-attacking troops
had nothing to be ashamed of after their 76-74 setback to the
University of Pepperdine at the Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu in a
match that the 49ers had a chance to win in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   D'Cean Bryant's desperation 35-footer might have gone awry, but
it didn't take away from an inspired Long Beach effort against a
Pepperdine team returning four starters from last season's NIT
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 49ers should have won this one, and didn't because
they impersonated Shaquille O'Neal at the free throw line, missing
10 of 18 attempts while the Waves made 16 of 19 in an entertaining
affair in which both teams played with admirable emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach's most heralded offensive player, Ramel (Rock) Lloyd,
even gave new meaning to his nickname in the first half when he
threw up an O'Neal airball rock, but he wasn't the only 49er player
to struggle from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morgan has been under sweltering heat in Long Beach for
fielding losing teams, but this is one game when not even his
severest critics could point the finger of blame in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the 49ers did display a bad old habit they committed 23
turnovers but they also passed the ball unselfishly and played
relentless defense, forcing the Waves into making 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   And several of those came in the final four and a half minutes
when the 49ers rallied from a nine-point deficit (71-62) to a 74
tie with 1:04 remaining on a Mate Milisa three pointer.
</P>
<P>
   What was most impressive about the 49ers is that they never got
discouraged and kept making serious challenges even though they
trailed throughout the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Long Beach is better than it was last season,'' said
the Waves' top scorer, Dominguez High graduate Tommie Prince (17
points), who broke free underneath with 32.4 seconds left for the
game-deciding basket.
</P>
<P>
   I do, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know why Morgan's team is favored to win the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure he has the most talented group of players in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   His top performer Saturday was Antrone Lee, the graceful 6-7
senior forward who scored 19 points, had five rebounds, three
assists and two steals. Lee gives a clinic on the court and simply
doesn't make mistakes, as evidenced by the fact he wasn't assessed
with a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 49er game, the 6-9 junior college transfer, James
Williams, lived up to expectations, collecting 17 points and nine
rebounds. He figures to have a lot of games like this, except with
even more rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined not to let Lloyd beat us and he didn't,''
said Jan van Bred Kolff, the Pepperdine coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves double-teamed Lloyd almost every time he touched the
ball he had it in those final seconds before he was forced to pass
to Bryant and restricted him to 11 points. Lloyd could have had
more had he not twice blown free throws on the front end of one and
one opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morgan alternated his three point guards, Charles O'Neal,
Ron Johnson and Keith Felton, against the Waves, and none played
well enough to earn the starting position permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were shaky against the Waves' press that van Breda
Kolff employed with success throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Morgan is going to have to hurt a couple of guys'
feelings and settle on one player to direct his team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if there was one negative about Morgan's coaching in
this game, it is that he substituted too liberally, with Lloyd
implausibly being on the bench the final couple of minutes before
Morgan rushed him in for the dramatic final seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I'm sure I hold the distinction of being the only
person alive to have witnessed the first game van Breda Kolff
coached at Pepperdine and the last game his father, Bill van Breda
Kolff, coached with the Lakers. The latter milestone came in the
spring of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was a disappointing defeat for the 49ers, but not an
embarrassing one as so many others have been in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard and gave it our best effort,'' said a
crestfallen Morgan. ``We had a few lapses. I thought we could have
rebounded a little better and put more pressure on the ball. But if
we make our free throws, we win.''

MAPLE LEAFS BEAT RANGERS, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The only time the Rangers seem to play well is when
they are desperately behind. And Saturday night, their desperate
play culminated in an unlikely comeback from three goals down.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about the only satisfaction the Rangers could take
out of another disappointing defeat, after Igor Korolev banged home
a rebound of a Sergei Berezin shot 1 minute 16 seconds into
overtime to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   At least the new rules in the National Hockey League this season
allow the Rangers to salvage a point in the standing with their
regulation tie. The question that remained was whether they had
done enough to allow their coach, John Muckler, to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves, Tim Taylor and John MacLean scored the Rangers'
goals, and Alexandre Daigle set up the last two scores in his
Ranger debut. It enabled the Rangers to come back from a 3-0
deficit after one period, and not to embarrass themselves totally
in front of their former teammate Wayne Gretzky, who was honored
here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who will be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame here
on Monday night, was, like everyone else, searching for an
explanation of what has gone wrong with this season's Rangers. They
are 2-9-2 in their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going bad, they really go bad,'' Gretzky said
during the first intermission Saturday night, about an hour after
being honored in a pregame ceremony. ``It was 2-0 Leafs before I
actually got in my seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto led by 3-0 after one period, because the Maple Leafs
scored on three of their four first-period shots against Kirk
McLean. But then a funny thing happened on the way to Muckler's
firing. Mike Richter replaced McLean with 3:15 left in the first
period and did not allow another Toronto goal in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers came back, and tied the game midway
through the final period on MacLean's first goal of the season,
which was also the Rangers' first power-play goal on the road this
season.
</P>
<P>
   On the night his good friend Gretzky was honored, Kevin Stevens
was a healthy scratch for the first time this season. MacLean, who
on Thursday in Boston had been scratched because of his play for
the first time in over a decade, was back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was asked if he felt that he and MacLean had been
scratched because Muckler could not afford to scratch other
high-priced underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' said Stevens, who has two goals in 18
games this season. ``You guys can figure that one out. He's trying
to do whatever he can to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said he was not singling anyone out. But Stevens sounded
as if he felt he had been singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the only guy that's had bad games in here, that's
interesting,'' Stevens said earlier in the day. ``I'm not saying
we're out there tearing up the league, but if I was the only one
doing it, I don't think we'd be 6-11.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' replacement Saturday night was Daigle, the Rangers'
latest reclamation project. On Friday, Muckler said the Rangers had
hurried up their plans to recall Daigle from Hartford after Todd
Harvey (knee sprain) and Manny Malhotra (ankle sprain) went down
with injuries in Thursday's 5-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   But for Daigle, the timing was off for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not soon enough,'' said Daigle, eager to play in the big
time again. Muckler, Smith and Don Maloney, the assistant general
manager, had debated Thursday night on whether to recall Daigle.
And only after Daigle and P.J. Stock practiced with the team in
Boston on Friday afternoon did Muckler decide both would be making
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Daigle up here,'' Muckler said Saturday. ``I wanted
to see what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigle showed just that late in the second period, when he freed
Taylor in alone on Curtis Joseph as the Rangers scored their second
goal. But that only meant the Rangers were a goal behind entering
the third period, because of the horrible first period they had
played.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Doig was in the lineup for the second straight game, as
Kevin Hatcher was scratched for the fourth time in six games. But
Doig took a bad penalty just 1 minute 36 seconds into the game.
Thirty-seven seconds later the Leafs led, 1-0, on the game's first
shot, a little wrister from above the circles that Yanic Perrault
deflected to McLean's left.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:01 of the period, Perrault made it 2-0 with his second goal
on his _ and the Leafs' _ second shot, which went high and to the
far right corner over McLean's glove, after Perrault had pounced on
a egregiously bad cross-ice pass from Sylvain Lefebrve in his own
zone.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dmitri Khristich scored on a deflection off Brian
Leetch's stick one second after a Toronto power play had ended at
16:45 of the first, the Leafs had three goals on four first-period
shots and Richter was on his way into the game.

49ERS TRIP OVER LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By GORDON VERRELL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The effort was there from start to finish, the
shooting was excellent, a solid 58 percent, better than in all but
two games all last season.
</P>
<P>
   So, what went wrong for Long Beach State's men's basketball team
in its season-opener Saturday, a 76-74 nonconference loss to
Pepperdine in Malibu?
</P>
<P>
   Free throws, to start with. The 49ers missed 10 of them,
Pepperdine a mere three. Rebounds, too. The 49ers had 30,
Pepperdine 31 --- but in the critical second half, the Waves showed
a decisive 15-8 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And, when the game came down to the closing seconds --- the
score was tied, 74-74, with 1:06 remaining, when Mate Milisa's
3-point basket capped a Long Beach State charge back from a
nine-point deficit --- the Waves executed perfectly, the 49ers did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's Tommie Prince, a 6-5 senior guard from Dominguez
High, got away with a backdoor play, scoring with 32 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a Pepperdine timeout with seven seconds remaining,
Prince put the squeeze on the 49ers' Ramel ``Rock'' Lloyd, keeping
him from getting off a shot. Lloyd managed to get the ball to
D'Cean Bryant, whose off-balance desperation shot from 35 feet at
the buzzer didn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of positives I can draw from this game,'' said
49er coach Wayne Morgan, ``but ... anytime you lose, it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's Jan van Breda Kolff, in his coaching debut with the
Waves after six seasons at Vanderbilt, empathized with Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to the last shot,'' he said. ``One team wins,
one team loses. And I've been on both sides. It's a shame one team
had to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But one team did, Long Beach State, which hasn't been above .500
since the opening game of the 1997-98 season, a season that quickly
deteriorated into a 19-loss year. The 49ers never made it above the
break-even plateau all last season, finishing 13-15. This, then, is
supposed to be Morgan's break-through season.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that occurred Saturday before a Firestone Fieldhouse
crowd of 1,163 would indicate anything else, even with the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers snapped out to an 11-point lead less than halfway
through the first half, and they refused to wilt, even after going
down by nine with 4{ minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them credit, too,'' said Morgan, with a nod
toward the Pepperdine lockeroom. ``They have four starters back
from an NIT team, have some good recruits ... and they had to play
like hell to win on their home floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers outscored Pepperdine, 12-3, down the stretch to get
even at 74-74, Milisa making his 3-pointer after Prince threw the
ball out of bounds. In the final minute, the Waves tried to get the
ball in deep to Nick Sheppard, their 6-11, 270-pound center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw they were doubling Shep,'' Prince said, ``and I saw Rock
look away from me. I went backdoor and Tezale (Archie) got the ball
to me. It worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves then called a timeout with seven seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough choice,'' van Breda Kolff explained. ``It
would give us time to set up our defense, but it would also give
them time to set up their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   It would also enable the 49ers to get Lloyd back into the game
after sitting out for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Lloyd would get a touch,'' van Breda Kolff said, ``and
Tommie did a great job keeping him from getting a good look at the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, having to pass off to Bryant, who was practically at
halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Antrone Lee led the 49ers with 19 points, James Williams had 17
--- 15 in the second half --- and Milisa and Lloyd had 12 and 11,
respectively. Prince led Pepperdine with 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of things that are encouraging,'' Morgan said,
``but you can't look at a loss as a positive. It's a loss.''

PEPPERDINE IN HIGH GEAR

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Drastic might be too harsh a word to describe
the differences between this year's Pepperdine men's basketball
team and the one from last season.
</P>
<P>
   But it's close.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the methodical, grind-it-out club that former coach
Lorenzo Romar preferred, the Waves unveiled new coach Jan Van Breda
Kolff's uptempo style Saturday with a 76-74 nonconference victory
over Long Beach State before 1,163 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obvious changes from the Romar regime is fullcourt
defensive pressure _ which the Waves used to force 23 turnovers _
and a slick motion offense in which players are urged to shoot the
ball when open rather then run plays all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   It's a style that takes advantage of Pepperdine's depth and
athletic ability, and one the players have enthusiastically
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way I like to play,'' said Tommie Prince, who
scored a team-high 17 points, including the game-winning layup off
a nice assist from Tezale Archie with 33 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was frustrated in Romar's meticulous scheme, to the point
that he set aside offensive aspirations in favor of defense just to
have some kind of impact. He averaged just seven points a game last
year but wound up as the West Coast Conference Defensive Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get known some kind of way, just to keep my name
around,'' Prince said. ``Now I can show everybody I can play
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The game-winning layup was an example of the flexibility Van
Brenda Kolff's approach allows. The play was designed to go to Nick
Sheppard in the post, but Long Beach overplayed Prince on the wing,
allowing him to dart free with a hard cut along the baseline.
Archie read it perfectly, then delivered a bullet pass to Prince
for an open basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I was responsible for calling that one in the
huddle,'' said Van Brenda Kolff, who coached six years at
Vanderbilt before replacing Romar, now the coach at St. Louis, in
April. ``But that was a case where Tommie made a great cut, then
Tezale read it and made a great pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach had a chance to tie it, but Archie forced D'Cean
Bryant into a desperation 35-footer, which bounced harmlessly off
the backboard at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was balanced offensively, getting the 17 points from
Prince, 13 from Brandon Armstrong and 11 from Kelvin Gibbs, who
overcame a slow start with nine points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Antrone Lee scored a game-high 19 points for Long Beach, while
James Williams added 17.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, preseason favorites to win the Big West Conference,
led 19-9 midway through the first half but caved in under the
Waves' fullcourt press. Pepperdine closed the half with a 26-13 run
to lead 35-32. Prince, a senior, scored eight of the final 12
points, although he didn't attempt his first shot until 14 minutes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine never trailed in the second half, and led by as many
as nine points before Long Beach tied it 74-74 on a 3-pointer by
Mate Milisa with 1:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine answered with Prince's layup on its next possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get a lot of touches, it's not a point where
you (begin ital)can't(end ital) shoot the ball,'' Prince said. ``If
you're open you're open, if you can make the play you make the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine plays at Fresno State on Tuesday and returns to
Malibu next weekend to host a two-day tournament.

SIXERS BEAT NETS, 100-96  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In an instant, he was back, stomping his
feet on the sideline, screaming out plays and turning Continental
Arena into his own personal stage. The scenario was so delicious
that it appeared to be scripted.
</P>
<P>
   John Calipari, who was vilified upon being fired by the Nets
last March, returned to the Meadowlands Saturday night as a coach.
A head coach.
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 29 seconds left in the first quarter, Philadelphia
Coach Larry Brown, a friend of Calipari's for nearly 20 years,
began ranting at the referee Marc Davis about a meaningless foul
call on the Sixers' Bruce Bowen. Refusing to let the issue die,
Brown was called for consecutive technical fouls and automatically
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Calipari, who joined the Sixers as an assistant
coach in September, stood up. From that point on, the contest was
all about him. And on Saturday night, victory was his.
Philadelphia, behind Allen Iverson's electrifying 37-point
performance, defeated the Nets, 100-96.
</P>
<P>
   And Calipari, whom the Nets will pay $6 million over the next
two seasons, had the pleasure of dropping his former club to 1-9,
its worst start in franchise history. As exciting as Iverson was _
he scored on graceful finger rolls and improbable jump shots _ the
scene stealer was Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing as comfortable and collected as ever, Calipari moved
smoothly along the court, clearly enjoying his redemption. The
Nets, meanwhile, were visibly shaken. As if they needed anything
else to go against them, Calipari's unforeseen ascension seemed to
totally psyche them out.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, the only assistant who was not fired along with Calipari
last season, looked sick. His face was red, his hair was disheveled
and his thoughts were obviously on Calipari, as he kept glancing
down at the Sixers' bench. Calipari's former players seemed just as
distraught.
</P>
<P>
   The injured center Jayson Williams, whose nettlesome
relationship with Calipari was well-documented, was more fired up
than anyone. On the bench in street clothes, he stood and pumped
his fist during Nets rallies and delivered short impromptu speeches
to his teammates during timeouts. And like Casey, he could not stop
looking down at his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Nets officials also seemed uneasy and the prevailing
sentiment among them seemed to be that Brown and Calipari had
staged the entire thing. Though Calipari has been cordial in his
comments since being fired, Brown blasted Casey, General Manager
John Nash and the Nets team president Michael Rowe in September,
saying they conspired to have Calipari dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led by 21-20 when Calipari took over, and after six
minutes of nip-and-tuck play, Philadelphia took control late in the
second quarter behind Iverson's 14-point scoring barrage.
Destroying the Nets' Elliot Perry and Sherman Douglas, Iverson
scored 26 first-half points to give the Sixers a 55-49 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia raised the advantage to 15 points heading into the
fourth before the Nets charged back within 92-87 with five minutes
to play. After a timeout, the fans began chanting ``Let's Go Nets!
Let's Go Nets!'' as the players spurred them on by raising their
arms. But seconds later, Iverson nailed a 3-pointer and gave
Philadelphia some room.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, however, pulled back within 97-95 on a steal and layin
by Marbury (22 points). On the Sixers' next possession, Marbury was
called for his sixth foul, and Aaron McKie sank the ensuing free
throws to seal the victory.

MCCAIN'S GRAVE CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They changed the McCain for President campaign commercial
because it violated Army Regulation 360.5, not because it violated
the memory of Army Sgt. George Dalton Libby.
</P>
<P>
   The ad showed the presidential candidate and former POW
strolling through Arlington National Cemetery. It ran in several
states before members of Sen. McCain's staff were told filming in
Arlington is against Army regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial reaction was, ``So?''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said no one approached them
while the filming was being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will show the ad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's father and grandfather are buried at Arlington. So is
Sgt. Libby.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea on July 20, 1950, the truck full of soldiers in which
Libby rode was disabled by enemy fire. Most were wounded or killed.
Libby loaded the wounded onto another truck, then jumped on the
side board and shielded the driver with his body until it was safe.
He was wounded, and later died, receiving the first Medal of Honor
awarded during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was Army Regulation 360.5 that caused McCain to edit
the Arlington footage from his television commercial, not Libby.
</P>
<P>
   And not Army 1st Lt. Edward Doherty, whose gravestone at
Arlington reads, ``One of three officers in command of the troops
that pursued and killed John Wilkes Booth after the killing of
Abraham Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   And not Walter P. ``Slug'' Szeliga, a 23-year-old turret gunner
on a B-24 Liberator bomber that crashed near Port Moresby, New
Guinea, in December 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Or U.S. Marine Cpl. James C. Knipple, one of 241 killed in the
terrorist bombing of a barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, on Oct. 23,
1983. &QL; 
NO PARTISAN ACTIVITIES &QL; 
When the Army found out about McCain's TV commercial, a spokeswoman
for the Military District of Washington, which had jurisdiction
over Arlington, said partisan activities are prohibited on cemetery
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think such regulation wouldn't be necessary. You'd think
respect, reverence, common decency would prevent anyone from using
the honored dead for personal or political gain.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think McCain, more than any politician in America, would
know this.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't why the ad was changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator's initial reaction, when he learned that filming
was done against regulations, was to edit the ad,'' said Dan
Schnur, the campaign's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff urged him to let the matter pass because we believed
that changing the ad would cause even more of a ruckus. It was
faulty logic on our part, which he pointed out to us the following
day. He thought it over and said, `You guys are wrong, change the
ad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's grandfather, John, and his father, John II, may not
mind having John III climb on their tombstones to boost his
political profile. &QL; 
HOW WOULD THEY FEEL? &QL; 
But what about John Roy Lynch?
</P>
<P>
   He was born a slave in the mid-1800s who went on to become a
lawyer and paymaster of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   What about the 250 men of the U.S. Coast Guard ammunition ship
USS Serpen? It exploded and sank at Lunga Beach, Guadalcanal, in
the Solomon Islands on Jan. 29, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, are buried at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   So are Gen. John J. ``Black Jack'' Pershing, William Jennings
Bryan, John Foster Dulles, Medgar Evers, Dashiell Hammett, Joe
Lewis, John Wesley Powell, Abner Doubleday, Audie Murphy, Thurgood
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Civil War dead are there. Two of the Challenger
astronauts. The Tomb of the Unknowns. In all, more than 250,000 are
buried in the hills across the Potomac from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   None of them prevented McCain's campaign from filming at
Arlington in the first place, or caused them later to edit the
footage from the TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was changed because of Army Regulation 360.5, which was
pointed out by a living soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were not consulted. &QL;

was done against regulations, was to edit the ad,'' said Dan
Schnur, the campaign's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff urged him to let the matter pass because we believed
that changing the ad would cause even more of a ruckus. It was
faulty logic on our part, which he pointed out to us the following
day. He thought it over and said, `You guys are wrong, change the
ad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's grandfather, John, and his father, John II, may not
mind having John III climb on their tombstones to boost his
political profile. &QL; 
HOW WOULD THEY FEEL? &QL; 
But what about John Roy Lynch?
</P>
<P>
   He was born a slave in the mid-1800s who went on to become a
lawyer and paymaster of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   What about the 250 men of the U.S. Coast Guard ammunition ship
USS Serpen? It exploded and sank at Lunga Beach, Guadalcanal, in
the Solomon Islands on Jan. 29, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, are buried at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   So are Gen. John J. ``Black Jack'' Pershing, William Jennings
Bryan, John Foster Dulles, Medgar Evers, Dashiell Hammett, Joe
Lewis, John Wesley Powell, Abner Doubleday, Audie Murphy, Thurgood
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Civil War dead are there. Two of the Challenger
astronauts. The Tomb of the Unknowns. In all, more than 250,000 are
buried in the hills across the Potomac from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   None of them prevented McCain's campaign from filming at
Arlington in the first place, or caused them later to edit the
footage from the TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was changed because of Army Regulation 360.5, which was
pointed out by a living soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were not consulted. &QL;

VALLEY'S WINTER VISITORS REDEFINE CONCEPT OF HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When North America tips toward winter and the Kentucky warbler
appears in Arizona treetops, another kind of migratory visitor
begins streaming into the Phoenix area from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Some, expert observers say, are of the ``rooted'' variety.
Others belong in the ``suspended'' or ``footloose'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   By February, their numbers throughout Arizona will swell to
320,000.
</P>
<P>
   And while they're sometimes mocked by Phoenix area
ley residents, they may be helping redefine America's concept of
``home'' for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   They are, of course, the snowbirds, and among their most serious
observers are Kevin McHugh, Arizona State University geography
associate professor, and demographic analyst Tom Rex.
</P>
<P>
   Although snowbirds may look alike _ especially when driving
slowly in front of you _ McHugh advises that the distinct varieties
are useful to note.
</P>
<P>
   First, the 320,000 snowbirds are quite different from the
600,000 retirees who live in Arizona full time. An estimated 23,500
move to Arizona each year.
</P>
<P>
   True snowbirds rarely own homes in the Phoenix area, McHugh and
Rex say. They stay for six months or less, from October to April.
They flock in greatest numbers to Apache Junction and east Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Half of them live in RVs or mobile homes, the other half in
apartments, condos or with family members. While they are of
retirement age, McHugh and Rex say, only 7 percent are older than
80.
</P>
<P>
   Resident retirees, who moved from out of state, are a bit
younger _ some moving in their 50s. Most live in retirement
communities in the northwest Area. Smaller pockets can be found in
the southeast area.
</P>
<P>
   One similarity: Both variations can be found in Scottsdale,
especially the wealthier ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some joke about all the leisure time on their hands: ``We're
busy doing nothing, and then we get a half-day behind that,'' said
Don Kleinkauf of North Platte, Neb., an East area snowbird.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's snowbirds don't all arrive at once. The traditional
migration pattern begins in October and ends in April. The height
of the season is January and February.
</P>
<P>
   State historian Marshall Trimble says the snowbirds began coming
in great numbers in the 1950s, as the postwar boom, the convenience
of interstate highways, and the novelty of travel trailers and
motor homes exploded. Cactus League baseball didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all that, mainly just the rich wintered in Arizona,''
Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbirds now come in such numbers that the Phoenix area's
over-65 population swells to 19 percent in winter from 13 percent
in summer _ that's one in five drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Resident retirees are likely to come from big careers in big
cities, anywhere in the United States. Snowbirds, on the other
hand, usually have fewer financial resources, and often hail from
modest careers in Midwestern farming communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer Canadian snowbirds than before, due to Canadian
health-care policies that penalize people for being out of the
country too long, and due to unfavorable currency exchange rates,
making America more expensive for Cana dians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two winters, snowbird migration to the Phoenix
area has been down, while the number of resident retirees has
increased. Some believe the rapid development of the East may be
driving some snowbirds away.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area snowbirds _ like many full-time residents _
complain that the desert disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Stamback, 70, and his wife, Pat, have wintered in the
Phoenix area for 11 seasons at Superstition Sunrise RV Resort on
the edge of Apache Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Stamback, a retired Boeing accountant, used to ride a bike down
Main Street, but it's too busy these days. The park, once out in
the middle of nowhere, is now embraced by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Urban development, urban air and urban prices are sending some
snowbirds to the post-urban trailertopia of Quartzsite in western
Arizona and the nearby string of ad hoc winter cities lining the
Colorado River. Outside Phoenix, Yuma has the largest snowbird
flock.
</P>
<P>
   Whether roosting in Parker or Peoria, the three varieties of
snowbirds get along well and form instant communities of friends,
according to McHugh's research.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rooted'' variety _ with permanent nests ``up north'' _ get
along fine with those who no longer describe home geographically.
</P>
<P>
   The ``suspended'' variety consider Arizona one of their two or
more homes. They have friends, memberships, subscriptions and
enemies in both places. If you ask them where they live, it takes
them a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is home?'' Gus Stamback pondered the question. He and
Pat live in the Phoenix area six to seven months a year. But they
also have friends in an RV park in Oregon, where they live and fish
three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a small town in Kansas _ Gus' home state _ where
they live for a short time each year with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon!'' Stamback decided _ that's where their vehicle is
licensed. But if he and Pat couldn't travel, he added, they would
settle down in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The third variety, the ``footloose,'' look confused by the word
``home,'' which may describe a vehicle and a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The more footloose often have been on the road for years. They
may come back next year, but maybe not to the same RV park or to
the same friends. They need to keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Eier, 69, staying this season at Apache Palms RV Park in
Tempe, travels year-round. Last year he traced the East Coast from
Florida to Nova Scotia. This April, he'll slowly head up to Alaska.
Next year it's Florida again.
</P>
<P>
   A single man retired from AT&AMP;T, Eier's glad to be free as a
bird. But wherever he goes he likes to pitch in a little bit. He is
volunteering at Desert Samaritan and singing in the choir at St.
Matthew's United Methodist Church in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   But when the road calls in April, he'll say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Loper, manager of Superstition Sunrise RV Resort, says the
snowbirds are changing. They want computer rooms to keep up with
grandkids and cross-country friendships via e-mail. They partake in
more active sports, like motorbiking and cycling _ not as much
dancing or shuffleboard, maybe a comedy night or some karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   ASU geographer McHugh believes that Phoenix area residents'
stereotype of sterile, shallow life in RV parks is off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter communities are places of meaning and support in older
age,'' he said. ``Important friendships and support structures are
formed, and the people are there to help each other when times get
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bea Olson, a longtime resident of Superstition Sunrise RV
Resort, said, ``We see changes every year _ people getting sick and
passing on.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other women there were making paper flowers to put on a
bush beside the space of a resident who was returning from an
emotionally rough summer up north.
</P>
<P>
   Many snowbirds hail from small towns and bring small-town
friendliness and values with them. This group, McHugh said, has
redefined ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home for them, unconsciously in many cases, is a state of mind
centered around belonging and security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Engstrom of Omaha, Neb., sitting outside with friends along
Errol Flynn Street in the Superstition Sunrise RV Resort, put it in
simpler terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Home,'' he said, ``is wherever the weather is nice.'' &QL;

NY WRITER THROWS CURVE ON MVP PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez failing to win the American League's Most
Valuable Player Award is starting to shape up as a New York
conspiracy. The New York Post writer who snubbed Martinez and said
pitchers shouldn't be named MVP reportedly listed two _ David Wells
of the Yankees and Rick Helling of the Rangers _ on his 1998
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez finished second in the voting, it was revealed
that his name did not appear on the ballots of two of the 28
writers who voted (two scribes from each American League city vote
for 10 players, in descending order). It can be argued that
Martinez, who had more first-place votes than any other player, did
not win because of the omissions by La Velle Neal of the
Minneapolis Star-Tribune and George King of the Post.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed that both writers snubbed Martinez because of a
belief that no pitcher should be considered for MVP. Neal stated in
interviews that this was his position. King, reportedly out of the
country, could not be reached for comment. But in Friday's Post,
Tom Keegan quoted his colleague as having said, before leaving on
vacation, ``MVP is for everyday players. Pitchers have their own
award.''
</P>
<P>
   However, an officer of the body that conducts the MVP election
Saturday night provided interesting new information. Jack Lang,
assistant secretary of the Baseball Writers Association of America,
said he spoke with secretary-treasurer Jack O'Connell, the man in
charge of the balloting, and ``Jack told me that George King had
two pitchers listed on his 1998 MVP ballot _ David Wells and Rick
Helling.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither O'Connell nor King could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   King clearly likes his Yankees. This year he was the only writer
to list Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter first on the MVP ballot.
O'Connell, the other New York writer who had an MVP ballot, ranked
Jeter second and Martinez seventh.
</P>
<P>
   One of three things happened here: 1. King changed his mind
about the worthiness of pitchers for MVP; 2. King thought Pedro
Martinez in 1999 was something less than Wells and Helling in 1998;
3. King wanted to stick it to Boston and take care of the Yankees.

TINY RADIOS LINK DIGITAL DE VICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You crawl out of bed and slug down a double cappuccino. While
you shower, your computers begin talking to the world and each
other. Your PC downloads your e-mail, which it transfers to your
hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   It also sends a memo from your spouse reminding you of your
dental appointment.
</P>
<P>
   When you walk into your breakfast meeting, your hand-held
schmoozes with its digital brethren, collecting electronic business
cards and handing out yours.
</P>
<P>
   The chatty technology opening lines of communication between
these appliances is called Bluetooth. And while its gee-whiz
features make it sound like something from the distant future, its
first applications are expected to show up on electronics store
shelves next year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Comdex, the Las Vegas technology extravaganza,
Ericsson, Motorola and Acer demonstrated Bluetooth products
scheduled to ship this summer. The Motorola products will use
technology developed in part at Motorola Semiconductor Labs in
Tempe and bearing components to be manufactured by Motorola in
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth uses tiny, inexpensive short-range radios to connect
digital devices. Any Bluetooth device can talk to any other, no
matter what brand name is on the label or what software forms their
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   From those two powerful attributes comes a technology that may
bring computers into our lives over the next five years the way the
Internet has over the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no obvious competitors or major visible hurdles
in Bluetooth's future, there are no sure things in predicting the
success of technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who have not yet spotted any obstacles, estimate that
more than 100 million devices will contain Bluetooth chips by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By linking digital devices without wires, Bluetooth creates
customized connections of computers, phones, digital cameras and
entertainment appliances formed simply by carrying a Bluetooth
device into a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one guy stop by the booth who said, `I've been coming
to Comdex for 15 years. It's always been bigger, better, faster,
until this. This is the next wave,' '' said Kevin Curry, Motorola
Bluetooth development manager.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the significance of the technology came in the form
of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, who toured the Bluetooth demonstration
area of Comdex on Tuesday. The most powerful man in computing
walked up to the XyLoc booth, where Ensure Technologies was showing
off a Bluetooth device that allows access to your computer when you
are at the keyboard but quickly locks it when you turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could integrate it into Windows,'' Gates said to his
nodding assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very interesting technology you have there,'' Gates
said before heading off to another demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' tour followed a Monday visit by computer manufacturer
Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wondering who is going to come by today,'' Curry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth takes its name from Harald II, the monarch known as
Bluetooth, who consolidated the Danish realm into a single kingdom
in the 10th century. The Scandinavian influence in the name is
appropriate considering that two of the founding Bluetooth
companies are Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson. The
other founding companies are Intel, IBM and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   The original Bluetooth brought previously warring factions into
an enduring nation. The electronic Bluetooth produces a similar
level of cooperation to enable communication between the products
of fiercely competitive phone and computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,200 companies have agreed to the Bluetooth industry
standard, which sets the technical standards for manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some technological advances, such as HDTV and Iridium satellite
phones, come at a steep cost that slows consumer acceptance. Other
technologies are physically too bulky to crack the ever-shrinking
hand-held computer and mobile phone markets. Bluetooth is not
expected to face either hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Motorola and Ericsson say that they are already scrambling to
drive down the cost and size of Bluetooth.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, probably around $5 per chip, Bluetooth will
become a standard feature on almost every electronic device, rather
than a pricey option. Motorola's Curry expects the price to drop
below $5 within three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Standing front and center at Ericsson's booth, Jens Lehmann
displayed a working prototype of what will be the company's first
Bluetooth product, a wireless headset that permits hands-free
operation of a cell phone. It contains one Bluetooth module built
into the headset and another that clips onto the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The headset demonstrates the simplest function of Bluetooth _
the elimination of wires. It promises to rid the world of the rats'
nests of cables behind home entertainment centers and computer
desks.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth can transmit about one megabyte per second, which is
plenty of speed to transmit voice from a headset to a phone or
digital audio from a CD player to a stereo amplifier. A second
generation, Bluetooth II, is being designed to transmit four
megabytes per second, which would be enough to broadcast video to
any television or monitor in a house.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann demonstrated a digital camera connected to a cell phone
via Bluetooth. The device includes an instant postcard function
that adds text such as ``Wish you were here'' to the photo. The
image is then sent from the camera, via the phone, to the Internet.
Within seconds, your snapshot from Niagara Falls can be zapped
anywhere in the world as an e-mail attachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the demonstration, the photos appeared seconds later on a
nearby laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Acer Computers and Handspring, a new hand-held computer
manufacturer, showed off a Bluetooth attachment that Acer will
manufacture for the Handspring Visor. It allows Internet access for
the little computer through a cellular phone. Through Bluetooth,
the Visor can send and receive e-mail and browse Web pages that
have been designed for small screens.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola recently purchased a Danish Bluetooth company,
Digianswer, to augment its own efforts. The initial Motorola
products will come from Digianswer, which is working on a PC card
to retrofit existing computers and on a cellular phone application
for use in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is also demonstrating computer-to-computer
communication via Bluetooth. With the press of a button, a
hand-held synchronizes information from its calendar and other
programs wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, the two will synchronize automatically,
eliminating the need to press the button.
</P>
<P>
   While the first devices are scheduled to trickle onto store
shelves in the summer, the pace is expected to pick up
significantly, making 2000 a big year for Bluetooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this time next year I think we'll see a tenfold increase in
the number of devices coming out,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bluetooth devices are probably only the most obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth gamepads will likely run PlayStation games in one room
and PC games in the next. Your hand-held computer may become the
universal remote that controls the television, the stereo and the
set top box. Your telephone may know when it's outside of the
house, where it will function as a cell phone, or inside, where it
will respond to the cheaper land lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to think of why our PDA (personal digital
assistant) should talk to our refrigerator, but there may be a good
reason that someone will think of,'' said Sonny Hsieh, vice
president and general manager of Acer NeWeb Corp., the Acer
division producing the Bluetooth accessory for the Handspring
Visor. ``I'm old enough to remember when no one could imagine why
we would need computers.'' &QL;

PUSH FOR GENDER AND RACIAL EQUITY SHAPED THE 1960S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1960s haunt us and propel us.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of order. The splintering of a national community. The
violence and invective. The sexual adventurism. The experimentation
with drugs. It was an out-of-control feeling most Americans
couldn't stomach for long.
</P>
<P>
   Few decades this century have contained so much change _ and
chaos. The Great Depression, of course, but its cause was no
mystery. Same with the 1940s and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The times certainly were changing in the 1960s. You could see it
on the streets and on television, hear it in the lyrics of Bob
Dylan and the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, social scientists ceaselessly pick through the
decade. Where liberals detect enlightenment and social conscience,
conservatives find valueless self-indulgence. Author Francis
Fukuyama puts a name to the upheaval: The Great Disruption.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the 1960s can be defined as a
group-by-group, national clamoring for rights, begun at a time when
most Americans, white Americans, felt comfortable, even prosperous.
(A majority owned their homes for the first time in U.S. history.)
</P>
<P>
   But an uneasiness seeped in. To young people, the generation
that beat back Nazi tyranny had delivered new terrors: the
potential for mutually assured, nuclear destruction, and then
Vietnam, a far-off unwinnable jungle war.
</P>
<P>
   Some also heard the complaint of Beat writers, who blamed 1950s
social rigidity and hypocrisy for sapping individualism and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And some watched with discomfort as a good-sized minority,
whites and blacks, were left out of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   To women, the post-war world _ at least the one prescribed by
men _ had been centered on finding a husband and running a home. In
The Feminist Mystique in 1963, Betty Friedan described the fate of
college-educated women frustrated with their societal role as
housewives.
</P>
<P>
   There was more: Rachel Carson in 1962 told of environmental
threats in Silent Spring, and in 1965 Ralph Nader published Unsafe
at Any Speed.
</P>
<P>
   So began the clamoring for rights and personal freedoms. Civil
rights, student rights, the rights of the poor, women's rights, gay
rights, consumer rights, workers' rights, the rights of criminals.
Even the right to wear long hair and short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time to renegotiate every aspect of American life, and
no facet was more in need of new rules than race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Rights language among Americans wasn't invented in the 1960s.
After all, the United States boasts the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But ``rights consciousness'' gained new legitimacy with the
civil rights movement, said Michael Kazin, co-author of a new book,
America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction between the American ideal of equal rights and
the treatment of black people was so obvious that the call for
change couldn't be ignored _ although many tried.
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1962, Becky Jaramillo and her husband, Joe, sat
down for dinner at a Kansas City-area restaurant but couldn't get
the waitress' attention. Finally, a man in a cook's apron emerged
from the kitchen. He didn't serve ``their kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1963, police arrested protesters at segregated
Fairyland Park in Kansas City. They sang songs and rode amusement
park rides _ and then spent the night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City's public accommodations ordinance came up for a
vote in 1964, the Jaramillos joined African-Americans in a voter
registration drive. The law passed by 1,614 votes out of about
89,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of minority dissatisfaction here exploded in April
1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. A march on
City Hall, protesting the decision not to close Kansas City schools
for King's funeral, turned violent. In three days of rioting, six
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shook a lot of people's sensibilities,'' said Joel
Rhodes, a historian who wrote his master's thesis on the riot.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1968 shook America. Two assassinations. Civil rights
violence. Campus violence. Anti-war violence. And at countless
family supper tables, shouting matches between the generations,
about the war, about race, about politics, about personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Violent protest is rooted in the American Revolution. But the
magnitude in the 1960s _ some 300 riots over four years _ was too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal allies grew isolated and civil rights support dried up
among the white working class. In 1968, calling on his silent
majority, Richard Nixon was elected president. Even before the
decade ended, the pendulum got a push back.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the 1960s experienced consciousness-raising of their
own. Laboring for civil rights and against the Vietnam War, they
began to question why they were the ones making coffee and taking
minutes at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A useful phrase in the women's liberation movement was ``the
personal is political.'' Child-rearing, housework, sex and equal
pay for equal work were no longer solely private or family matters
but issues of political and social power.
</P>
<P>
   On college campuses, women's political groups, rape services,
shelters and health clinics were common by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Scholl, a nurse in Kansas City, was a teen-ager in the 1960s
when she first considered the abortion issue. She heard on the news
about a pregnant woman who had taken thalidomide, which caused
horrible birth defects. The woman had to leave the country to end
the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an age of awakening,'' Scholl said.
</P>
<P>
   Scholl has accepted that her adult children oppose abortion
rights. But, she said, she was able to pass on something lasting
from the 1960s: a social conscience, trained to examine social
justice issues, infused with a spirit of voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
   The women's movement, although still incomplete, forever altered
the role of women. No one can make a believable argument that women
make good teachers and nurses but not lawyers, doctors and business
executives. A new understanding arose among men and women about
sharing child-rearing and household duties, even if in practice
women still bore the bigger burdens.
</P>
<P>
   The gains led to submission of the Equal Rights Amendment to the
states and to the legalization of abortion by the U.S. Supreme
Court in the early 1970s. Later, women demanded they be free from
sexual harassment in the workplace, where they had arrived in huge
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the notion that everything wrong with America went wrong
in the 1960s is so familiar it hardly sounds hyperbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty programs backfired, the argument went, giving impetus to
welfare reform. The women's movement, the sexual revolution, the
rise of divorce, the absence of fathers, the scourge of drug use:
all ingredients for the deterioration of the family, all with roots
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Fukuyama argues that the birth-control pill, first marketed in
1960, and the sexual revolution were more ``liberating'' for men
than women as men accepted even less responsibility for
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll by The Kansas City Star, respondents named
``decline of the family'' as America's biggest moral problem in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s did propel us. America hammered out new social
contracts with young people, with women, with gays, with blacks and
with other minorities. New laws now protect Americans with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-war movement, too, wrought changes. The ``Vietnam
syndrome'' has informed every military decision since the end of
that war. The draft ended.
</P>
<P>
   But the rights pendulum continued to swing away from the 1960s:
</P>
<P>
   - Abortion opponents have successfully pushed for restrictions.
Abortion access in some states is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   - Gays saw some corporations expand benefits to their partners,
but the military rejected openness among homosexuals. The notion of
gay marriages is deeply divisive.
</P>
<P>
   - The courts now hear the call of crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   - And for many African-Americans and other minorities, the
legacy of the 1960s remains mixed.
</P>
<P>
   From a historical perspective, the last 40 years have indeed
witnessed progress.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s and beyond led
the way. By the 1990s, blacks graduated from high school at the
same rate as whites. Blacks held political offices in sizable
numbers. The black middle class grew and gained clout.
</P>
<P>
   But full equality? No.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action remedies took a beating in the 1990s. Earlier
this month, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida announced plans to stop a
minority set-aside program for state contracts and to alter
race-based college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Pew Research Center reported that 69
percent of white Americans oppose preferential treatment for
minorities. Asked if the country has ``gone too far with equal
rights,'' 51 percent of whites agreed. Among blacks, however, 79
percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pew poll, 71 percent of whites said blacks would close
the income gap with whites, but only 42 percent of blacks thought
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go any further,'' said Rhodes, ``we're going to have to
address economic opportunities. That's something Americans are very
reluctant to do. It's the last frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The push and pull over rights _ expanded as never before _ is
the broad legacy of the 1960s, and there is no real end to that
process. America's future is in the struggle.

SCHOOL DESEGREGATION EFFORT LEAVES A MIXED LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN HORSLEY AND PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After 22 years and $2 billion spent on its
desegregation lawsuit, the Kansas City School District is smaller
and less integrated, has more disadvantaged students and is still
academically deficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the nation's most expensive and ambitious
desegregation effort is not all negative. The money prompted an
unprecedented school building boom, bought educational innovations
that attracted national attention and boosted teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy also forced a city steeped in racial segregation to
confront one of its most vexing social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've learned that, while we've not achieved this goal
(of optimal integration), that racial integration in public schools
is extremely important for children of all races because it adds
valuable world lessons to formal learning,'' said Arthur A. Benson
II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren, who has been
involved in the case since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple stunned the city
by dismissing the school desegregation case. He said that, despite
many remaining problems, the district had done all it could to
eliminate segregation and should be freed from court control.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any appeals, that means the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Benson will meet soon with district parents before deciding by
Dec. 16 whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple used his opinion to pinpoint a puzzling aspect about
desegregation law in this country: The courts are obligated only to
ensure children a nonsegregated education, not a quality education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's desegregation orders are only intended to enforce
constitutional guarantees of an equal education,'' Whipple wrote.
``They do not and cannot make a high standards education the
primary focus of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Steele, a longtime parent in the district, said he was
frustrated with the desegregation effort's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were using integration as a means to a quality education.
We seem to have gotten neither one,'' he said. ``I think it was a
well-meaning plan with lofty goals that never had grass-roots
participation and ownership. And there were too many cooks, it was
too adversarial and the planning process was flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-school board President Edward Newsome three years ago
orchestrated a financial settlement with the state to begin winding
down the desegregation case. He said last week that many black
parents thought the litigation had to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better off in terms of having the infrastructure in
place,'' Newsome said. ``But in terms of where (the district)
should be educationally and academically, I think it's been a
dismal failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Former school board member John Still has been involved with the
district since the desegregation lawsuit was filed, and his
youngest son graduated from Lincoln Prep High School last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is now at the University of Kansas, and he thinks he's
been very well prepared. He is doing very well,'' Still said. If
students and parents sought out a good education they could get it,
Still said, but too many children were underserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The educational and academic achievement gap (between white
and black students) was not addressed until the end of the lawsuit
was imminent,'' Still said. He was disappointed that Whipple ruled
everything possible had been done, because that achievement gap has
not been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can he now say we've done everything we can do?'' Still
said.
</P>
<P>
   The district was in deplorable condition in the late 1970s.
Buckets caught rain from leaky roofs. Students struggled to see in
dimly lighted classrooms. Classes of 40 students were common. There
were no art, music or physical education classes. Textbooks were
decades out of date.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1977, the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The case finally went to trial before U.S. District Judge
Russell G. Clark in November 1983. In June 1984, he found the
Missouri suburbs did not have to participate in the desegregation
remedy. On a 4-4 vote, a federal appeals court refused to overturn
that decision. That loss was a deep disappointment to the lawsuit's
backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been an entirely different and less expensive
case if the suburbs had been made part of the remedy,'' Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the suburbs meant the district could not compel large
numbers of suburban white students to integrate the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, nearly all other districts with successful
desegregation efforts had large countywide remedies with mandatory
busing of black or white students.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1984, Clark found the district and state liable for
creating the unequal school system that had evolved over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered a unique approach _ trying to create schools that
were so appealing that suburban students would voluntarily flock to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The costly desegregation remedy began in 1985 and peaked in
expense and results in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The district spent more than $400 million on a mammoth building
construction program, including 15 new schools and 70 renovations
or additions.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning teacher salaries rose from $17,000 to $22,000 annually
in the early 1990s. Salaries this year range from $25,275 to
$47,851.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy also created 20 different magnet themes. Students
studied Suzuki violin, robotics, animal science and languages from
French to Swahili. Teachers finally enjoyed plenty of supplies and
support staff.
</P>
<P>
   For a time in the early 1990s, hope flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment rose. The district's brightest students could attend
foreign language immersion, computer, Montessori, performing arts
and college preparatory classes comparable to any in the area. A
few students went on to Harvard and other Ivy League schools.
Students at the district's arts magnets got lucrative scholarships
to prestigious Eastern schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the district could never parlay its individual examples of
excellence into systemwide success.
</P>
<P>
   Joy West-Spearman, whose daughter is a junior at Lincoln Prep,
questioned whether the money was always spent with children in
mind. ``We're always told to put the children first. I have
questions on if that's what we really did,'' she said. ``I think
the monies sometimes were spent more on management of the school
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also found that money alone could not solve certain
problems, including a politically charged school board, lackluster
teaching, staff turnover, weak leadership, low expectations, poor
discipline and students' disadvantaged home lives.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban enrollment never reached the original optimistic
expectations of 10,000 new white recruits. At the height of the
effort, in 1993-94, the district attracted 2,400 new white
students, but lost 2,300 white students from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the crux of the
desegregation plan _ trying to lure suburban white students to the
magnet schools _ was legally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Clark approved an agreement to wean the district
off state funding within three years. He left no doubt that he
thought the experiment had failed to create a good school system.
</P>
<P>
   The district still struggles to improve student performance.
Even during the height of the remedy, Kansas City high school
students, on average, tended to score below the national average
and often even below the national average for similar urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
   On new Missouri tests given last spring, the number of students
scoring at proficient or advanced levels continued to be dismally
low. These deficiencies led to the recent state decision to strip
the district of its accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nation can learn a lot from Kansas City's grand
experiment, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't throw money at something and think it's going to
improve,'' Still said. ``It takes more than just a financial
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers union President Judy Morgan, a 29-year district
veteran, thinks planners tried to do too many magnet programs too
fast and failed to focus on a basic, strong academic curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district was going in so many different directions,'' she
said. ``The teachers were clamoring for a core curriculum. It took
us a long time to get that. ... There's still the lack of a strong
reading program.''
</P>
<P>
   Still worries about the next generation. ``Our kids have been
more racially aware and socially attuned to what's going on, and it
was beneficial to them,'' he said. ``I am concerned about the kids
today. They'll be less and less aware.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benson said the desegregation case left the district with a
clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the right administration, the right reform programs, and
efforts by teachers and others, our kids can learn at high
levels,'' Benson said. ``And I'm hopeful they soon will.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks the city learned something about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've also learned that these problems of race and
integration are difficult and require patience and persistence and
that there are no quick fixes,'' Benson said. ``After 300 years of
virulent segregation, it may have been wishful thinking that we
could erase it all in 15 years of a schools-only remedy.''

FOR BILL ESREY, DREAMS BECOME THE STUFF OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Some kids play house. Others dream of
becoming sports heroes, musicians or astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   At age 8, Bill Esrey wanted to be a businessman, and invented an
appropriately buttoned-down alter ego to play the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd sit by the hour with a pencil and a telephone: `Owens
here, can I help you? ... Hello, this is Mr. Owens. ... Owens here,
can I do anything?' '' recalled his brother, Bob Esrey, now a
principal with Cohen-Esrey Real Estate Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it up. That was his business persona.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Esrey, however, it was no childish fantasy but a
precocious master plan in the making. The arc of his resulting
career has been a near vertical line through the ranks of
telecommunications and investment banking, with few detours to his
ultimate goal: ``To run the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, just over half a century later, Esrey, the chief executive
of Sprint Corp., sits astride a global telephone company, arguably
the most influential businessman in Kansas City, attempting the
biggest merger in business history.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey is a man of action, not reflection. Even as he sits in his
Mission Hills, Kan., mansion, casually fingering a crystal orb and
sharing anecdotes from his past, he reveals little of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to define his motives, his driving force, the kind of
legacy he desires, his response sounds like a corporate mission
statement: ``To create wealth for shareholders, career
opportunities for employees and a solid foundation for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   With the muscles of Mr. Clean, ice-blue eyes and rigid
self-discipline, he has the air of a capitalist machine, an
executive cyborg programmed with equal parts work ethic and
competitive zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates say there's a relaxed, compassionate and
family-oriented guy behind the poker-faced businessman, a voluble
storyteller, and an adventurer with an appetite for extreme sports
and punishing workouts.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers tried a folksier
spin on Esrey when announcing his company's proposed $129 billion
merger with Sprint in October. Ebbers called him ``a cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds absurd for a man who seems to have been born in
wingtips, but Esrey has been a lone ranger in his industry.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, the longest tenured leader of any major telephone
company, leads a company that has built rather than bought its way
into the top ranks of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   While he is no technology guru, his aim has been true in an
industry experiencing immense upheaval. Under the guidance of Esrey
and his predecessor, Sprint has placed a series of long-term bets,
many of them _ in hindsight _ visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always thinking about another angle,'' said Malcolm
MacNaughton, a friend and classmate at Harvard Business School. ``
`How do I get ahead of the tide so that when things change, I'm
already on my way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to mark Esrey as a local boy. But his family settled
in Mission Hills in 1954, moving from Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The family home, now torn down, was a stone's throw from where
the Esreys live today, in a formally decorated Tudor bought from
real estate baron Miller Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey's father, Alexander ``Tod'' Esrey, was an AT&AMP;T executive
and led the company's long-distance business in 22 states from
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Tod'' was ``all business,'' said Bob Esrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a strict disciplinarian, and that's an
understatement,'' he said. ``He was extremely dedicated to his
work, which came first. ... He wasn't the warm and fuzzy guy where
you ran home and jumped in his lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1940, when his father was 40, Bill Esrey said they
didn't have ``a buddy relationship in any way. We didn't have the
opportunity to go play ball or go see movies,'' a relationship he's
worked to develop with his own two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, young Bill held his father in such esteem that he
changed his middle name to Todd when he was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   His given middle initial, D, stood for nothing. But Esrey
figured that as the fourth son, he was supposed to be a girl, named
after his mother Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't sit well with me, so I said I wanted to change my
name,'' he said. ``I named myself after my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   If Esrey's discipline stems from his father, his competitive
fervor comes from growing up with three older brothers. He
describes his relationship with Bob as a ``class A sibling rivalry.
We fought all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Esrey entered Pembroke-Country Day school in the ninth
grade. Small but scrappy, he became second baseman on the baseball
team, manager of the football team and business manager of the
yearbook, where he sold more ads than anyone had before.
</P>
<P>
   His ambition, stated in his senior yearbook, was ``to live up to
his initials,'' presumably a reference to his father.
</P>
<P>
   He briefly attended his father's alma matter, Swarthmore
College, but found the atmosphere overly academic. After one
semester he transferred to Denison University in Ohio, where
brother Bob was enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey graduated in 1961, a Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in
economics. His senior year, he was president of his fraternity and
vice president of the Interfraternity Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I remember ever really wanting
something _ the election to be president of the house,'' Esrey
said. ``It was a big deal, or at least I thought it was. ... I
really wanted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of college, Esrey joined a training program with Merrill
Lynch in New York. While there, he met his future wife, Julie, then
an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by a roommate, they discovered they both worked in
the Wall Street area, and Julie mentioned that they ought to meet
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' responded Esrey. ``How about tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   The two dated while Esrey completed his master's degree at the
Harvard Business School, and they married after he graduated in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Loath to work for a rigidly hierarchical company, Esrey
nonetheless was lured to AT&AMP;T by a program that put talented
business school graduates on a fast track _ a program he later
duplicated at Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   College and business school buddies downplay notions that Esrey
had a career blueprint. Nevertheless, he set specific goals early
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be at a certain level in an organization,''
Esrey said. ``I wanted to see what I could do and how far I could
go. ... When I started working in the Bell system, it was quite
clear that I wanted to run it someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also observed that half the people didn't want to do that.
They didn't want to make the commitment and the sacrifices to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey wanted the position, not for the money, he said, but for
the authority to make things happen. In the back of his mind, he
was already planning for the day he'd run it.
</P>
<P>
   In a chance encounter with the chief executive of New York
Telephone, Esrey was asked _ perfunctorily _ for his game plan,
which he delivered in a snappy, bullet-pointed summary.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, at the age of 28, he was promoted to president
of a 3,000-employee AT&AMP;T subsidiary that maintained underground
conduits.
</P>
<P>
   While seeking financing on Wall Street, Esrey was spotted by
Nicholas Brady, the future Treasury secretary, then a partner at
the investment banking firm Dillon Read. Brady lured Esrey to be
Dillon Read's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey made partner within a year and over the next nine years
was put in charge of equity and debt trading, the syndications
department _ virtually everything but the firm's investment banking
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, however, said he never really fit the maverick, rainmaker
mold of an investment banker. He disliked the long commute and the
prospect of raising a family in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   He also was frustrated when forced to shoulder blame for some
unauthorized trading on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey long had been courted by Paul Henson, chairman of United
Telecom, to return to Kansas City and the telephone industry. In
1980, he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to work at United for 25 percent of what I was making
at Dillon Read,'' he said. ``I realized I really had enough to do
the things that were important to me. ... I didn't need a fancy
car. Money wasn't going to be the criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   That would come, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Sprint has been very good to Esrey.
</P>
<P>
   He is the highest-paid chief executive of a public company in
Kansas City. Sprint stock and options he owns are reportedly worth
nearly $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about that. It's nice,'' he said. ``But I also
feel good about people who say, `I invested when you became CEO,'
or, `I met you and I bought Sprint stock.' Everybody's done
exceedingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey has four homes _ in Mission Hills; a Park Avenue apartment
in New York; a ski house in Vail, Colo.; and a 5,000-acre ranch
west of Vail that he owns with several other families.
</P>
<P>
   He drives fancy cars _ a BMW and a Porsche, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He travels the world in limousines and corporate jets. And he's
familiar with the global power elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the fortune of counting among my friends ... really,
virtually anybody,'' Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   He avoids name-dropping. But Esrey has gone ballooning with
Malcolm Forbes in China. He has met with Mikhail Gorbachev in the
Kremlin. He is an annual visitor to Wall Street deal maker Herb
Allen's Sun Valley, Idaho, gathering of corporate titans.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, he goes to the Bohemian Grove, an all-male summer
retreat in California for the elite of business and politics. There
he reportedly stays in the most exclusive enclave, called the
Mandalay camp, with Riley Bechtel, the DuPonts, Henry Kissinger and
Gerald Ford, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his global social circle, Esrey also made a choice
early, friends say, to make time for his wife, Julie, and sons,
Bill Jr. 32, a vice president at Sprint PCS, and John, 30, who
works for an Internet start-up in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``As busy as his schedule is, he always seemed to make time to
kick back and spend time with us,'' said Bill Esrey Jr. ``Not a day
goes by that I don't talk to him at least once.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Esrey says there is little distinction between business
and personal time for her husband. Wherever they go, he's tethered
to the company by phone, fax and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Christmas or whatever, he's on the phone, having
meetings. He answers a lot of e-mail. That's just part of the
deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Esrey's free time is spent skiing, snowmobiling,
horseback riding, hunting or golfing, often with his wife and sons.
At 59, he is a fitness fanatic, able to hold his own with athletes
half his age.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Esrey workout, five days a week, includes up to an
hour on a bike or elliptical trainer and another hour of weight and
agility training. For the duration of most sessions, he is on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey's energy level is legend among acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is out of bounds,'' said Jack Lockton, a regular
visitor to Esrey's homes in Colorado. ``A day with Bill is likely
to include 36 holes of golf, horseback riding, skeet shooting, then
sitting around the fire pit telling stories till midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Esrey has a reputation of being somewhat cold, aloof,
even arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   That perception, in part, is a byproduct of his predecessor's
popularity. Paul Henson was a man of the people, a charismatic
walk-around manager who ate in the company cafeteria, knew
employees' names and cut a wide swath in the local civic community.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey is more reserved, and the circle of people who know him
well is much smaller. Many long-term Sprint employees in Kansas
City have never seen him.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a fund-raising campaign for Union Station, Esrey is
largely out of the public eye and often out of the city on
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was criticized a lot early on, including by some members of
our board who said I ought to be more involved in the local
community,'' Esrey said. ``My response is that I can do more for
Kansas City by building a really globally successful company.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a school of thought that Esrey was simply in the right
place at the right time, that he rode the juggernaut that Henson
created.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a runaway stock market and mushrooming demand for
communications services fueled Sprint's performance. Moreover,
Henson left Esrey a solid base to build on and championed the
company's move into the long-distance industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the record is fairly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Under Henson, United Telecom assembled an impressive array of
local telephone companies, but the company's stock languished. It
was actually cheaper in 1985 than in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chief executive in 1985, however, Esrey has
transformed a $2 billion local telephone company into a nearly $20
billion conglomerate with stakes in the fastest-growing segments of
the communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey dismisses the who-did-what debate, calls Henson a father
figure and credits employees for Sprint's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often take the company and assume it's the guy running
the company. It's not. It's the team,'' he said. ``If I've had a
couple good ideas, great, but it's really the ability to recognize
good ideas and put them together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esrey's ego has been part of the equation. Instead of
running a large collection of local phone companies based in the
Kansas City area, he wanted to be a global player.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has engineered a series of partnerships during Esrey's
tenure _ with GTE to build the long-distance network, with three
cable companies to build a national wireless network, and with
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to serve multinational clients.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those partnerships ultimately fizzled. But Sprint has
consistently walked away with a big new business in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even the international partnership, Global One _ which Esrey
describes as a ``failure, absolutely'' _ generated a $3 billion
investment from European partners that Sprint used to fund Sprint
PCS.
</P>
<P>
   During Esrey's tenure, the company has generated a total return
for shareholders of about 2,500 percent, almost two and a half
times that of the surging Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   The only major telephone company whose long-term returns exceed
Sprint's is MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, Esrey was entertaining guests at the King Creek
Ranch, his Colorado retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The group was out for an eight-hour trail ride, ``literally in
the middle of nowhere,'' he said, when his ranch radio squawked to
life. It was his secretary, with a password to call Bernie Ebbers,
the chief executive of MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting under a tree overlooking a mountain meadow, Esrey pulled
a satellite phone from his saddlebag, called Ebbers, and agreed _
in principal _ to sell Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember this place,'' he told the ranch manager. ``I want to
come back here someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey says he's more sentimental than people think. He thought a
lot about the company's 100th anniversary this year. The irony
wasn't lost when he dedicated the company's new Overland Park
headquarters while negotiating the purchase price for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey doesn't know, or isn't saying, what he'll do with his
riches, although he says he'll pass some along to his kids. And he
bristles at the notion that he agreed to sell Sprint for personal
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at this deal as making me hardly a dime,'' he
said. ``All the money that's been written about, obviously it's a
very large number, I would have made it anyway. Those options had
nothing to do with this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey says he has no regrets, then briefly reconsiders. Sprint
actually considered bidding for MCI before WorldCom ultimately
bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have jumped in before they did,'' Esrey said. ``We
sort of kicked it around, but never seriously. That's one thing
that it might have been possible to do. We could have been the
WorldCom of today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would much rather be an acquirer.''

COMMENTARY: A RURAL OUTPOST WHERE IMMIGRANTS ARE HANDY, BUT NOT
ALWAYS WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREWSTER, N.Y. _ Depending on whom you talk to, Tony Hay is
either the soul of a new suburban xenophobia or the last bulwark
against Brewster as barrio.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Village of Brewster is in the outer suburbs where
minivans are replacing tractors and immigrants come in handy to mow
the lawn or build a stone wall. Sixty miles north of New York City,
Brewster has taken on a distinctive Latin flavor. Taco Loco is one
of Main Street's busiest restaurants, Manny's Taxi is owned by
Manny Illescas, an Ecuadorean immigrant, and the Spanish-language
newspaper El Diario is available at Scally's Deli.
</P>
<P>
   Like corners in Brooklyn and Queens, and the main drags of
close-in suburbs like Mount Kisco and Glen Cove, the sidewalks here
and in other semirural towns are now impromptu hiring halls where
immigrants gather each morning waiting for contractors to hire them
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of work as land turns into lots in Putnam County,
one of the fastest-growing counties in New York. But some of the
fresh ground that the immigrants are manicuring has proved acidic.
</P>
<P>
   Hay owns ``Brewster's No. 1 discount beer supermarket,'' which
he named On the Border back when the border on everyone's mind was
the one between New York and Connecticut. He has tapped a keg of
his strongest stuff and is pouring it freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cultural difference between Americans and Latinos,''
he says. ``We don't stand on the street looking for work. The
average person will wake up at 8 o'clock and go to work. They wake
up and go stand on the street corner and look for work. I call it
visual pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hay is no trained cultural anthropologist, but neither is he
simply a prominent beer distributor. He's the elected chairman of
the Legislature in Putnam, a county that is 95 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   In a proposed resolution, he asked federal immigration officials
to address what he believes is an illegal immigration problem so
``it will no longer return to plague our community.'' His vision is
cataclysmic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Trade Center blew up, planes are blown out of the
sky,'' he said. ``I'm not saying it's Latinos, but they're all
immigrants. The West Nile virus, they laugh at me, but we don't
know where that came from. If Saddam Hussein shaved his mustache
and spoke Spanish, he could come here and stand on the streets of
Brewster. Moammar Gadhafi, he could come here.''
</P>
<P>
   No terrorism has hit Brewster. Nor has crime increased, said
Sheriff Robert Thoubboron, although three immigrants were charged
recently with prostitution, which is unusual here.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Hay had a point about illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when his officers arrest illegal immigrants,
overwhelmed immigration officials tell the sheriff to let them go.
``Either change the law so it's not on the books and it's not a
crime, or beef up enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Opdyke, who owns the Bagel Depot opposite the train station,
said, ``Until Tony Hay made a statement, everybody else had their
head in the sand.'' He said women are afraid of being harassed and
some of the immigrant job-seekers urinate in public. ``This was
always the country,'' he said. ``Now we're a little like the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   And as in cities, there are opposing viewpoints, strong ones.
``It's big-time prejudice,'' said George Sclavounos, a refugee from
earthquakes in Greece in the 1950s who now owns the 3 Star Deli
here. He said immigrants have revived a fading Main Street, and are
needed because ``we're not willing to cut our grass or climb up on
our roofs to clean our gutters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to do our chores, but we don't want them living
around us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a legislative meeting last week, Hay's opponents came armed
with a ``Say No to Hate!'' petition.
</P>
<P>
   Hay withdrew his resolution after immigration officials agreed
to meet with Brewster officials to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger continued. One man said, ``When they jump the
border down in Mexico, do they give them a map of Mount Kisco and
Brewster?''
</P>
<P>
   A county employee told Hay she found his words ``very hateful.''
Sam Oliverio Jr., another county legislator, said Hay's actions
threaten ``the constitutional rights that I, as a former
serviceman, fought for.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lone Hawk, of White Plains and the Gwe'chin Nation of
American Indians, rose to say the debate grieved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our land,'' he said. ``We lived in peace until the
white man came.''
</P>
<P>
   He was generous enough not to ask everyone to leave.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; MISTLER'S EXIT &LR;  By Louis Begley. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12. In
this dark novel by an author long preoccupied by the falsification
of the self, a rich executive who can't, or won't, separate his
truth from his lies escapes to Venice after learning he has
terminal cancer. ``The theme of self-deception at the end of life
... may be the supreme test for a novelist with this of all
obsessions,'' Jack Miles wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1998. ```Mistler's Exit' meets the test.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TIME OF OUR TIME &LR;  By Norman Mailer. Modern Library, $24.95.
Not surprisingly, this bulky retrospective of Mailer's work since
he kicked things off in 1948 with ``The Naked and the Dead'' shrugs
off conventional literary form; instead of organizing the
selections chronologically or thematically, the author arranges
them based on the period they describe. The resulting grab bag of
hits and misses is ``that rarity, an anthology that can be read
straight through,'' James Shapiro wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``Its neatly interwoven sections collectively
tell a story of their own, a social history of postwar America, at
the heart of which is Mailer's own tangled love affair with this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREAKFAST ON PLUTO &LR;  By Patrick McCabe. HarperPerennial, $13.
Patrick ``Pussy'' Braden is an effusively cheerful Irish
transvestite with a temper, looking for love in a London paralyzed
by IRA bombings during the swinging '70s. This novel by ``a master
of the literary macabre'' may be ``the most successful book yet to
be born'' out of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Courtney Weaver
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE WHEREABOUTS OF ENEAS McNULTY &LR; , by Sebastian Barry
(Penguin, $12.95), a patriotic out-of-work Irishman joins the Royal
Irish Constabulary after World War I and finds himself marked for
death by his boyhood friend, an enforcer for the IRA. Throughout
his hero's travails, ``Barry's sweet, lyrical pitch never
falters,'' Aoibheann Sweeney wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1933-1941 &LR;  By
Victor Klemperer. Modern Library, $14.95. In this intensely German
insider account of the Nazi tyranny, a Jewish-born Protestant
professor tells of Hitler's escalating persecution of the Jews and
of the many episodes of cruelty, cowardice and decency he
encountered in his daily life. The result is ``a fascinating
self-portrait and an equally fascinating portrait of a regime whose
consequences haunt the world to this day,'' Peter Gay wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; OFFICIAL SECRETS: What the Nazis Planned, What the British
and Americans Knew &LR; , by Richard Breitman (Hill &AMP; Wang, $13), a
history professor argues that the British government knew more
about the Holocaust than they let on. Breitman ``weaves solid new
scholarship into a gripping narrative that reveals a startling
nonchalance in facing evil,'' Peter Grose wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MACHINE DREAMS &LR;  By Jayne Anne Phillips. Vintage Contemporaries,
$14. The author's first novel explores the private legends of a
small-town American family, as expressed by each of its members.
The shocking moments arise from small, ordinary ones. In 1984 the
reviewer Anne Tyler called Phillips ``an assured and gifted
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN &LR;  By Paula Fox. Norton, $13. The widow in
this novel dies in a nursing home while her middle-aged children,
only one of whom learns of her death, are holding a family reunion
of sorts in which feelings of resentment and hostility boil over.
In 1976, Norma Rosen admired Fox's ``special brand of unemphatic,
perceptively detailed writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLIND MAN'S BLUFF: The Untold Story of American Submarine
Espionage &LR;  By Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, with Annette
Lawrence Drew. HarperPaperbacks, $7.99. Sontag is an investigative
journalist, Christopher Drew is a reporter at The New York Times,
and Annette Lawrence Drew is a researcher. Together hey explore the
history of underwater spying during the Cold War. In 1998 the
reviewer Timothy Naftali called this an ``important look'' at one
of the ``most harrowing battlefields of the superpower conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPALACHIA &LR;  By Charles Wright. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet's 13th volume reveals a yearning
for mystical or religious transcendence. Earlier this year the
reviewer Adam Kirsch called Wright's self-reflective, questioning
verse ``a significant and true reflection of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPEN MINDED: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &LR;  By Jonathan
Lear. Harvard University, $15.95. A psychoanalyst and philosopher
issues a defense of Freud, arguing that democratic societies need
Freudian insights to comprehend the dark side of the psyche in
order to make the best-informed choices. The result is ``a
remarkable book _ highly articulate, learned, thoughtful and
fresh,'' Mark Edmundson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ACHESON: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World &LR; 
By James Chace. Harvard University, $17.95. This biography portrays
Dean Acheson, the secretary of state from 1949 to 1953, as a
visionary public servant who laid the groundwork for today's
international order. Last year the reviewer Francis Fukuyama found
the book to be ``engrossingly good reading.''

TWO DEAD, ONE WOUNDED IN KANSAS CITY SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY AND KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The chilling call crackled over the shuttle
bus radio shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday: ``Don't come back here;
people are getting shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting was over, two men who worked at The Parking
Spot, a private parking lot near Kansas City International Airport,
lay dead and a woman co-worker was in critical condition after
being shot in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police did not release the identities of the victims
Saturday. However, co-workers who either witnessed the shootings or
knew the victims identified them as Nugusi Zalky, an Ethiopian
immigrant who had worked at The Parking Spot for several months as
a shuttle bus driver; Michael Scott, another driver; and Traci
Riehle, a dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Airport police found Scott shot dead at the lot. Zalky's body
lay outside the parking lot dispatch office, and Riehle, who was
critically injured, was slumped over the wheel of a shuttle bus two
miles away at airport Terminal A. She had driven to the airport
seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to release any details, but those who witnessed
the shootings said Zalky shot Scott and Riehle before killing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a gun and a typewritten, signed note near Zalky's
body; they said the note might contain clues about a motive. They
would not reveal the note's contents.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Saturday afternoon, a man who identified
himself as Zalky's 18-year-old son said he never would have thought
such a tragedy could happen. He said he last talked to Zalky on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hugged him,'' he said. ``I do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to talk further about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is in a very bad condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca McEntire, a shuttle bus driver, said she talked to Scott
shortly before the shootings. This weekend was to be his last
working at the parking lot; he had gotten a better-paying job to
help support his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the conversation, McEntire and a trainee left to
take several passengers to KCI to catch flights out of Kansas City.
The shootings happened right after she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left, thank God,'' McEntire said. ``I had an angel by me
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived at her first passenger drop, McEntire said, she
tried to radio Scott. When she couldn't reach him, she called the
dispatch office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard screaming over the radio,'' she said. ``The dispatcher
was screaming, `Get to Conoco (a nearby gas station). Call the
police.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As McEntire pulled her bus into the Conoco parking lot, the
dispatcher she had been talking with also pulled in, with another
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (bus) window was broken,'' McEntire said. ``There was
blood all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Kalm was working at the Conoco station when the two buses
pulled up. She said the dispatcher got out of the van and came in
for help, talking hysterically.
</P>
<P>
   Kalm called the police, and then the dispatcher calmed down
enough to tell her what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher said Zalky shot Scott and Riehle. Scott was dead
in the driver's seat of his bus, which had the keys in the
ignition. His hand was on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Riehle, although shot in the face, was able to jump into another
bus and also drive for help. She stopped at Terminal A, where she
honked the horn frantically. Airport workers heard the horn and
called 911.
</P>
<P>
   When firefighters arrived, they found Riehle hunched over the
steering wheel, blood coming from a head wound. She was flown to
North Kansas City Hospital, where she was listed in critical
condition late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As Riehle was being treated by rescuers in front of Terminal A,
the other dispatcher was pushing Scott's body out of the bus at The
Parking Spot, leaving it where police later found it. She then
drove the bus a mile and a half to the Conoco station.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Kahn, another driver, also said he had talked with
Zalky before the shootings. Zalky sat in Kahn's bus, and they
chatted until Kahn was dispatched to a terminal to pick up a
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn drove to the airport, where he heard the pleas for help on
the shuttle bus radio.
</P>
<P>
   He drove back to the parking lot and arrived about the same time
as another driver, Makesh Patel, who was arriving for work. The
police stopped them and ordered them out of their vehicles. They
told them to lie on the ground and then handcuffed both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Police later let the two men go. The two drivers then had to go
around the terminals, telling people on arriving flights that they
couldn't get their cars out of The Parking Spot lot because police
had roped it off.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a cordoned-off area on the road in front of Terminal
A, KCI was not affected by the shootings and no flights were
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers finally were able to get their cars about 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy,'' said Stacy
McCullough, a spokeswoman for The Parking Spot, which has been open
about six months. ``Our prayers go out to the victims and their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to talk about the three who were shot. She also
would not give details of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the company does background checks on its
employees, she said she did not know.
