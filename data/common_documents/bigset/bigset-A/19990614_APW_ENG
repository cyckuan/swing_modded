<HEADLINE> Show Tips Cops Off to Mass. Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLAND, Maine (AP) -- A Massachusetts child molester who vanished  
during his trial more than a year ago, leaving behind a suicide 
note, was captured in a shootout at a homeless shelter in Maine 
just hours after being profiled on ``America's Most Wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Burdick, 49, was shot in the weekend gun battle and  
hospitalized, but his wounds were not believed to be 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces possible life imprisonment in Massachusetts for child  
rape and indecent assault. He was convicted in absentia two days 
after failing to show up for his trial in Northampton, Mass., in 
1998. He was accused of assaulting a girl, now 17, from the time 
she was 10 until she was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	When Burdick and his wife disappeared, they left behind a note  
claiming they had committed suicide in anguish over false 
accusations. Investigators were immediately skeptical, in part 
because the couple claimed that they had taken steps to ensure that 
their bodies would not be found for ``quite some time, if at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in Maine, the Burdicks didn't use an alias, and shelter  
workers knew they were from Massachusetts. The couple lived there 
rent-free in exchange for doing yard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just showed up one day last summer and offered to do  
grounds work. They had been living in a tent,'' said Lucy Poulin, 
president of HOME Inc., which operates the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went downhill swiftly for Burdick after the 10-second  
``America's Most Wanted'' spot aired Saturday night. Producers 
received eight tips. 
</P>
<P>
	When three deputies arrived at the shelter at 12:45 a.m. Sunday,  
Burdick came to the door. A struggle broke out, and Burdick 
allegedly shot a deputy twice in the chest before being wounded by 
another officer. The deputy was wearing a bulletproof vest and was 
not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	State police fired tear gas through a window and arrested  
Burdick. 
</P>
<P>
	Gina Long, associate producer for ``America's Most Wanted,''  
said: ``It doesn't happen that often that we capture the same night 
that it's aired. It's pretty spectacular.''

<HEADLINE> Taxpayer Uncovers Va. Mayor's Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP) -- Charlie Kambarn's curiosity about the  
Florida trip taken by town leaders has turned up a small-town 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of what he found, the mayor was suspended, the town  
manager resigned and the police chief was fired. The three men had 
skipped most of a hurricane conference in Florida and run up big 
bar and restaurant tabs at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought in their wildest dreams I would get this far,''  
said Kambarn, whose Freedom of Information Act request documented 
the men's spending spree of about $3,000. ``It will be a long time 
before anyone eats and drinks big on the town of Chincoteague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials went to Orlando for the conference in March but  
later acknowledged playing hooky. Mayor Harry Thornton, Town 
Manager Stewart Baker and Police Chief Willis Dize drove a rental 
car six hours south to Key West to visit a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about their side trip spread when they returned to  
Chincoteague, a town of 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Kambarn, who runs a boat dealership and real estate  
business, decided to get to the bottom of things. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Kambarn filed a request to make public the officials'  
expense account reports. Town officials charged Kambarn $1,300 for 
photocopies. The Town Council has since voted to refund the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation's credit card receipts included a $2,075 hotel  
bill from Orlando, including $365 for ``lobby bar/pool service''; 
$320 for one dinner; $420 for a rental car that traveled 831 miles 
in six days; and $54.31 for a lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe in Key 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after news of the spending spread, Baker resigned, the Town  
Council fired Dize and a judge suspended Thornton pending further 
review of the case. Lawyers for Thornton and Baker declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dize's attorney, Rick Matthews, said the police chief was just  
following orders and will sue if necessary to get his job back. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kambarn and others are pushing for a state  
investigation of the island's finances.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Plane Crash in N. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- A small plane crashed Monday soon after the  
pilot reported engine trouble, setting a small fire in a heavily 
wooded area. All four people on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot had just picked up three passengers at the Concord  
airport about 17 miles north of Charlotte when he reported a 
malfunction, airport spokeswoman Melissa Brafford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cessna 421 crashed nose down about 100 yards from some  
houses and started a brush fire. The area is so wooded rescuers had 
to bring in machinery to clear a path to the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were not identified. Brafford was unaware of the  
plane's destination or where the pilot came from before arriving in 
Concord.

	U.S. Satisfied With Yugoslav Effort  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials say they are  
satisfied that the Yugoslav military is making a sincere effort to 
meet Tuesday's deadline for emptying a swath of southern Kosovo of 
all soldiers and police. The territory includes a section of Kosovo 
being patrolled by American troops. It remained unclear how NATO 
would respond if it discovered Serb stragglers. ``They are making a 
strong effort to get them out,'' the Pentagon's chief spokesman, 
said Monday. NATO had said it would resume bombing Yugoslavia if 
the Serbs deliberately dragged their feet in leaving Kosovo, a 
province of Serbia. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Leave for Europe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, leaving tonight for Europe,  
is joining with allies to launch a costly rebuilding plan for 
war-torn Kosovo and other trouble-plagued nations of southeast 
Europe. ``The coming months will be a period of return and 
reconstruction,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 
Monday. European nations will bear the largest share of the 
financial burden of rebuilding, Albright said, because the United 
States absorbed the heaviest cost of the 78-day bombing campaign 
against Yugoslavia. She said that as of Monday, 13,000 to 15,000 
Serb forces have pulled out of Kosovo and 14,000 peacekeeping 
troops have begun to deploy.

	South Korea Sinks North Korean Ship  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's Defense Ministry says  
South Korean warships sank a North Korean torpedo boat after a 
10-minute exchange of gunfire in contested waters of the Yellow 
Sea. ``Our patrol boats fired 35mm guns and hit one'' of three 
torpedo boats, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. ``There is no 
word on casualties yet.'' Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, spokesman for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the three northern torpedo boats shot 
first. The gunfire happened only minutes before talks began in an 
effort to end the standoff, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.

	JACKSON, Ky. (AP) -- A University of Kentucky medical helicopter  
crashed in eastern Kentucky late Monday, and a clinic spokeswoman 
said all four people aboard were killed. The victims included two 
pilots, a flight nurse and a paramedic, said Mary Margaret 
Colliver, a spokeswoman for the UK Hospital who cited information 
from state police. There were no patients aboard, she said. A state 
police dispatcher confirmed deaths aboard the helicopter but said 
he did not have details. Jackson is about 70 miles southeast of 
Lexington.

	Panel Urges Nuclear Security Changes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An influential intelligence advisory panel  
told President Clinton Monday that his proposed security 
improvements for the Energy Department and nuclear labs fall short 
of what is needed to protect against nuclear thefts. The panel, 
asked by the president three months ago to closely examine security 
problems at the Energy Department, strongly recommended that 
nuclear programs be placed under a new agency either within the 
department or altogether independent.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang was  
arraigned Monday on a conspiracy charge as part of a plea bargain 
that was reached after he helped the government's campaign finance 
investigation. He is expected to plead guilty in federal court next 
Monday. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of a year's probation, 
500 hours of community service, a $10,000 fine and a requirement 
that he continue cooperating with the government. Huang was charged 
with conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission by 
helping raise $7,500 in donations and then reimbursing the 
individuals who provided the funds.

Hideki Irabu allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings, 
allowing only a two-run homer to Juan Gonzalez. The Yankees have 
won 16 of the last 20 games against the Rangers, including a 
three-game sweep in last year's playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Seen Key to Aerospace Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- European aerospace firms must  
consolidate to cut costs and compete more effectively with their 
American rivals, top officials from French and German companies 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Aerospatiale Matra, itself the product of a merger, is  
seeking further linkups in Europe and in the United States. 
Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace believes the region has too 
many players and hopes to take a lead role in consolidating them. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies want to restructure Airbus Industrie, the  
four-nation passenger jet consortium and fierce rival of Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not stupid enough to keep a type of organization that  
will slow us down in the war we wage with Boeing,'' said Jean-Luc 
LaGardere, chairman of Aerospatiale's supervisory board, at a news 
conference at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, being held at Le Bourget airfield north of the French  
capital, is the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	In a welcome boost to its business, Airbus said Monday it has  
received an order for 30 A-320 aircraft from Debis AirFinance, a 
Netherlands-based leasing company. Airbus will deliver the first 
aircraft in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger that created Aerospatiale Matra, France's No. 1  
aerospace conglomerate, was formally completed Friday, just hours 
after DaimlerChrysler Aerospace announced a plan to unite with CASA 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging with CASA, DaimlerChrysler will become the dominant  
shareholder in Airbus with a 42 percent stake. Aerospatiale and 
British Aerospace comprise 38 percent and 20 percent of the 
consortium, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagging demand for big civilian jets has exposed the need to  
reorganize Airbus, whose planes are assembled in France from 
components produced by each of the four national companies, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties believe we really should improve the organization  
of Airbus ... to make it more efficient,'' Aerospatiale chairman 
Yves Michot told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler-CASA deal took the European industry by  
surprise. Aerospatiale itself was hoping that the Spanish 
government would select it as a partner for CASA, but Michot tried 
to put a brave face on the merger, saying it won't ``destabilize'' 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace dismissed any negative impact on Airbus of the  
DaimlerChrysler-CASA merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, it's easier to make decisions with three people  
sitting around a table than with four,'' said spokesman Simon 
Raynes. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said there is no chance that it will dominate  
Airbus. The consortium was formed under statutes that require a 
consensus among all of its members, DaimlerChrysler spokesman 
Rainer Ohler said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler supports centralizing Airbus' disparate  
operations within a single, more efficient corporate entity, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurned by CASA, Aerospatiale expects that finding a new partner  
will be easier in Europe than in the United States, where laws 
controlling access to technologies with military applications are 
an obstacle, Michot said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe one day we can actually merge with an American company,  
but we shouldn't do this too hastily,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrylser sees better prospects across the Atlantic.  
Formed by a German-American merger of Chrysler Corp. and 
Daimler-Benz AG, the company has found that ``doors are quite 
open'' in the United States, Ohler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest aviation opportunities lie in the United  
States, and an American acquisition or merger is one of the options 
DaimlerChrysler is evaluating, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cavs No Closer to Naming Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- General manager Jim Paxson narrowed his search  
Monday for the Cleveland Cavaliers' coaching job by at least one -- 
it won't be his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	With just over two weeks remaining until the NBA college draft,  
the Cavs still haven't picked a successor for Mike Fratello, whom 
they fired June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the rumor mill continues churning out possible candidates  
-- Rick Carlisle, Randy Wittman, Dave Cowens, Scott Skiles, Bob Hill 
and Del Harris are among the most frequently mentioned -- Paxson 
didn't say much to narrow the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But one name everyone can forget is John Paxson, the GM's  
brother and a former guard for the Bulls. Even if his big brother 
asked him, which wasn't likely anyway, John Paxson isn't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him in Chicago and someone else seriously talked  
to me for 45 minutes about how he would be perfect,'' he said. 
``Well, John doesn't even want to coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson was in Chicago last week to attend the NBA's pre-draft  
workouts where potential draft picks showcased their skills to 
scouts, coaches, assistant coaches and general managers from around 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson used the time to evaluate both players he might draft and  
coaches he might hire. He sought out other GMs, coaches and players 
to see whom they thought might be a good fit for his young Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who took over the Cavs' GM duties when Fratello was  
fired and former GM Wayne Embry stepped aside, said he has some 
coaching candidates in mind. He's just not ready to reveal his 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's on paper or in my head, there are people that I  
feel like I want to talk to, and I want to start doing that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when he planned on bringing coaches in for formal  
interviews, all Paxson would offer was ``soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers have two first-round picks -- Nos. 8 and 11 overall  
-- in the June 30 draft, but Paxson insisted he wasn't under any 
added pressure to have a coach in place by then. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to make the right decision, not a rash one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk to 100 people and interview them,'' he  
said, ``and I don't think it's a good idea to make it a media 
focus. The focus is to come out of this with the best coach for 
this team going forward. We hope to get it done sooner than later. 
It's more important to pick the right guy, so if it doesn't happen 
before the draft, so be it.''

<HEADLINE> Decathlete Missing, Feared Drowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A decathlete who broke Dan O'Brien's  
school record was missing and feared drowned after his raft 
capsized in turbulent waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dusty Lane, a sophomore at the Community Colleges of Spokane,  
was rafting Sunday with three friends. None of the rafters wore a 
life jacket and the group had been drinking, Spokane County 
sheriff's Sgt. David Fray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane recently accepted an athletics scholarship to Alabama next  
year. He broke the Community Colleges of Spokane's decathlon record 
set by O'Brien, who attended the school and is the world champion 
and world record holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fray said the raft overturned in the Spokane River in Riverside  
State Park. Three of the rafters made it to shore near the Bowl and 
Pitcher, a rough turn in the river favored by kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rescue boats and a helicopter searched for Lane for three  
hours Sunday. The search was called off because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	No searching was planned today, in part because Lane's body  
might be stuck on the river bottom, sheriff's spokesman Deputy 
David Reagan said.

<HEADLINE> St. Paul Firm Sues U.S. Bancorp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A St. Paul law firm is suing U.S. Bancorp  
and First Bank System, days after the state attorney general 
announced a lawsuit against U.S. Bank that alleged it sold 
confidential information to a telemarketer. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Harvey Eckart, who filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S.  
District Court in St. Paul, said Monday he is seeking to have the 
case certified as a class-action lawsuit for customers who were 
affected in U.S. Bank's 17-state service area. The amount of 
damages sought hasn't been determined, Eckart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, Attorney General Mike Hatch  
accused Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank of illegally selling customer 
data to a telemarketing company and pocketing $4 million in 
commissions and fees. The lawsuit also said the telemarketer, 
MemberWorks Inc. of Stamford, Conn., ``slammed'' some bank 
customers, charging them for unauthorized purchases by having U.S. 
Bank deduct money from their accounts and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp, the parent company of U.S. Bank, announced  
Thursday it has discontinued relationships with about 15 
telemarketing companies, saying it was too confusing for customers 
to have the bank affiliated with sales of nonfinancial products. 
</P>
<P>
	Donn Waage, a senior vice president with U.S. Bancorp, said the  
most recent lawsuit was expected. ``We think that, like the 
attorney general's suit, this is also without merit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp became based in Minneapolis in 1997 when First Bank  
System Inc. of Minneapolis acquired Portland, Ore.-based U.S. 
Bancorp.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Aid Group To Dole Out $5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Spiraling medical bills. Mental health  
services. Assistance for rent and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Divvying up the nearly $5 million in donations to meet the needs  
of the survivors of the Columbine High School massacre and victims' 
families is proving a Herculean task. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a large number of victims. They all express different  
thoughts on how they think the money should be utilized and 
distributed,'' said Robin Finegan of the Colorado Organization for 
Victims' Assistance. ``It is in many ways a no-win situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died in the April 20 rampage: the two teen-age  
gunmen, 12 other students and a teacher. Twenty-three others were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, there are more than 30 funds devoted to medical bills,  
memorials, scholarships and community counseling. The school 
district is also receiving donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe more money should be given to teen-age survivors  
with mounting medical bills. Others advocate equal distribution to 
survivors and the families of the dead. And some have proposed all 
of the students who weren't wounded get a share, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope questionnaires handed out to victims' families  
will help provide answers as to how to dole out the donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some families say they cannot afford to wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``Monetary support should not be held hostage when there are  
real-life urgent needs that some of these families face,'' said Sam 
Riddle, a spokesman for the family of slain 18-year-old Isaiah 
Shoels. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, $390,000 has been dispensed, including $5,000 to the  
families of each person killed or injured, $150,000 to support a 
mental health center and $50,000 to the Colorado victims' group. 
</P>
<P>
	But medical bills continue to mount, and some students will  
probably need years of surgery and physical and mental therapy. 
Those without medical insurance are causing the biggest drain. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical bills for Lance Kirklin, a 16-year-old whose jaw was  
shattered by gunfire, have already topped $1 million. He was not 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
	The millions sent to Littleton far surpass the totals of  
donations in other recent school shootings. About $400,000 was sent 
to Jonesboro, Ark., while $450,000 was donated to Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, some fear the chance for abuse is also far higher.  
</P>
<P>
	``We try to be vigilant, but there's always going to be an  
individual who, for whatever reason, takes advantage of a situation 
like this,'' said Kelly Cahill, a spokeswoman for the Mile High 
United Way, which has collected nearly $3.3 million in its Healing 
Fund for Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Rohrbough, whose 15-year-old son Daniel was killed, said  
he wants more accountability from United Way officials on where the 
money goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone should give a dollar to an organization  
that doesn't lay out how it's going to be spent,'' said Rohrbough, 
who was upset by a proposal to give $1,000 to more than 2,000 
uninjured students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, $5 million may sound like a lot, but when you start  
doling out $1,000 checks it goes pretty quickly.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 42 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold 7-4 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up five points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is getting green lights today from the bond market  
and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices are solidly higher, after Fed Vice Chair Alice  
Rivlin reportedly said inflation worries are overblown in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	And the dollar is higher, after the Tokyo government intervened  
today to prop up the U.S currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the markets will likely trade cautiously before hearing  
from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	He's scheduled to begin testimony before Congress at 10 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Business Inventories Up 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inventories at American businesses rose 0.2  
percent in April as sales edged down 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Too big a buildup in inventories can force manufacturers to cut  
production as businesses struggle to reduce the backlog of unsold 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even with the modest April rise, current inventory  
levels are lean in relation to sales as confident American 
consumers continue spending freely. 
</P>
<P>
	April's small decline in business sales, to $809.3 billion,  
followed a big 1.1 percent rise in March, the Commerce Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant there were enough goods on shelves and backlots in  
April to last just 1.36 months at current levels of demand -- a good 
sign that U.S. manufacturers will have work to do in coming months, 
economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The April inventory increase, to a seasonally adjusted $1.1  
trillion, added to a 0.5 percent increase in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesalers' inventories rose 0.2 percent and retailers'  
inventories grew 0.7 percent in April. Manufacturers' stockpiles, 
meanwhile, fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales by retailers rose 0.4 percent while demand from  
wholesalers was unchanged. Manufacturers' sales dropped 0.4 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Livent's Executives Stepping Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The two top executives of Livent Inc. plan to  
step down effective June 25, two weeks before the insolvent theater 
company heads into a bankruptcy sale hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent said Monday that Roy Furman will step down as chief  
executive and David Maisel will resign as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Webster, now executive vice president, will succeed Furman  
as chief executive, Livent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furman will continue as chairman of the company's board of  
directors and Webster will become a director. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes follow Livent's June 1 announcement that it had  
reached a $115-million deal to sell almost all of its assets to SFX 
Entertainment Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. bankruptcy court has set July 7 as the tentative date for  
a hearing to approve the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent filed for bankruptcy protection last November in Canada  
and the United States after the August 1998 discovery of what the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described as a ``pervasive 
eight-year fraudulent accounting scheme by the former senior 
management of Livent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations are denied by former Livent executives Garth  
Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb of Toronto and have not been proven in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a countersuit, Drabinsky has alleged there was an unlawful  
takeover conspiracy involving Furman, Maisel, Webster, Hollywood 
power broker Michael Ovitz and directors Scott Sperling of Thomas 
Lee, a U.S. investment company that owned part of Livent. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster has been responsible for overseeing the internal  
investigation into alleged accounting irregularities and the 
restatement of earnings. He has also overseen the bankruptcy 
process, including marketing of Livent's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster joined Livent last July. Previously he was a partner in  
KPMG Peat Marwick's national U.S. mergers and acquisition practice, 
where he specialized in media and entertainment industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent's ``Fosse'' won the award for best Broadway musical at  
the recent Tony Awards. It also is the producer of ``Ragtime.''

	Korean Ships Exchange Gunfire  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South and North Korean warships  
exchanged gunfire Tuesday in contested waters of the Yellow Sea 
only minutes before talks began in an effort to end the standoff, 
Seoul's Defense Ministry said. Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, spokesman for 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said three North Korean ships shot first 
and their fire was returned by at least some of the eight South 
Korean ships patrolling the area. One North Korean ship was hit, 
with casulties unknown. One South Korean ship was hit by northern 
fire, but no casualties were reported.

whole, Clinton administration officials said. Secretary of State

shooting, burning, and alleged raping. Some citizens in the 
hard-hit city of Djakovica say Serb paramilitary troops went on a 
rampage there Saturday, after the peace deal and two days before 
their withdrawal. Masked fighters burned buildings and raped 
several women, said Binakaj Azgon, who said his daughter was among 
the women taken away. A tally of Djakovica's dead has yet to be 
compiled; a cemetery worker said he buried as many as 200 people 
slain in mass killings of up to 70 at a time.

shots in Washington or will we cross party lines to make our

expected to debate gun control proposals this week, with Democrats 
generally pressing for adoption of provisions the Senate approved 
last month, and the NRA fighting to water them down or eliminate 
them.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man got on a subway train at rush hour this  
morning, died, and his body rode the train for hours before 
passengers notified anyone about it, police said. The man, believed 
to be in his 40s, had no visible signs of a struggle or attack and 
no identification, police said. Police do not know where the man 
boarded the train, but believe he was dead for four to five hours. 
They speculate that no one noticed him because the train was so 
crowded and people in too much of a hurry. ``Do you know how many 
people sleep on the train during morning rush?'' subway rider Mario 
Licari said. ``Unless the guy slumps into me, I just leave him 
alone.''

<HEADLINE> Decathlete Missing, Feared Drowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A college decathlete was missing and  
feared drowned after a raft capsized in the Spokane River. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing athlete was identified as Dusty Lane, a former  
Cashmere resident and top decathlete at the Community Colleges of 
Spokane. Lane, a sophomore, recently accepted a full athletics 
scholarship to the University of Alabama for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently broke the Community Colleges of Spokane's decathlon  
record set by Dan O'Brien, who attended the school and is the 
defending Olympic champion and world record holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, 22, was rafting with three friends Sunday in Riverside  
State Park northwest of Spokane when the raft capsized in the 
Spokane River's turbulent waters, Spokane County sheriff's Sgt. 
David Fray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the rafters made it to shore near the Bowl and Pitcher,  
a rough turn in the river favored by kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rescue boats and a helicopter searched for three hours  
Sunday before the search was called off due to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	No searching was done Monday, in part because of the possibility  
that Lane's body might be stuck on the river bottom, sheriff's 
spokesman Deputy David Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies will use personal watercraft to search the river  
Tuesday, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the rafters had been wearing life jackets, and the group  
had been drinking before the accident, Fray said.

<HEADLINE> New US Open Challenges Presented  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Playing alone as shadows fell across the  
fairways at Pinehurst No. 2, two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els 
hit a 2-iron off the first tee and started to walk away when he 
asked the USGA an important question. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many balls can we hit into the green?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Augusta National, players can hit as many as they like in  
preparation for the 99th U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	And just like the Masters, they'll need them.  
</P>
<P>
	From just about every tee box and every fairway, Pinehurst No. 2  
does not look like a typical U.S. Open. The fairways don't resemble 
a narrow country lane. The rough is only 3 inches deep, not nearly 
as daunting as U.S. Opens past. 
</P>
<P>
	But the signature on the course built by famed Scottish  
architect Donald Ross is the contoured, humpback greens and the 
shaved collection areas that figure to make this U.S. Open unlike 
any other. 
</P>
<P>
	Any approach not struck perfectly, or not aimed at the right  
spot on the green, could catch the slopes around the edge and roll 
as many as 30 yards away from the hole. And that's where the fun 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Barron stood in a hollow to the left of the 12th hole on  
Monday and hit five chips shots with mixed success. Then he tried 
for more loft with the sand wedge. Three holes later, he putted up 
another slope, then dropped another ball and putted with his 
3-wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart used nine clubs around one green, from mid-irons  
all the way to his putter. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hoch chipped with a 4-iron, ``which I hardly ever do.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, a U.S. Open hardly ever looks like this.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different kind of Open than what I've normally  
experienced,'' Justin Leonard said. ``We'll have to hit shots we 
haven't had to hit in the last four of five Opens. You just have to 
make a decision. The guys who make the right decision a majority of 
the time will be at an advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have two more practice rounds to get in starting today  
before the 99th U.S. Open begins on Thursday. A score of even-par 
has won two of the past four years, and no one was willing to 
venture a guess on a winning score this early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered thunderstorms are in the forecast each afternoon  
through Thursday, which could make the greens a little soft -- and 
the rough a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was for the Bermuda rough to be cut at 4 inches. But  
the USGA staff came out to Pinehurst No. 2 last week, threw some 
balls in the rough and decided 3 inches would be ample. 
</P>
<P>
	The rough is clearly deeper than the so-called second cut at  
Augusta National, but the punishment might be the same. Spin 
control is everything on greens so demanding, and the best place to 
start is in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this rough, you do have a chance to put the ball on the  
greens,'' Leonard said. ``But more times than not, you're going to 
miss the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoch, for one, isn't convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	He was born in Raleigh and has played Pinehurst No. 2 before.  
The last time the PGA Tour stopped in these woods was the 1992 Tour 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a much better course than I remember,'' Hoch said. ``But  
I don't think the course is hard enough. They need to do something 
before Thursday to make it more U.S. Open-ish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoch doesn't believe the rough is severe, certainly not in the  
same neighborhood as Oakland Hills or Congressional. The greens are 
not as rock-hard, although a stiff breeze on Monday made them 
firmer than the day before. The USGA doesn't plan to shrink the 
fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing left is the greens, and they're expecting  
rain,'' Hoch said. ``It doesn't add up to U.S. Open style. But they 
probably know what they're doing a lot more than I do.''

<HEADLINE> Novotna Will Play Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Jana Novotna on Monday said she's recovered  
enough from a painful ankle sprain to defend her Wimbledon singles 
title next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to just be prepared ... to struggle and to fight,''  
Novotna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Czech star won't defend her Eastbourne  
championship this week to avoid re-injuring the right ankle she 
sprained when she collided with her partner, Natasha Zvereva, in 
the French Open doubles quarterfinals. She said she will play 
doubles at Eastbourne to get grasscourt preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal, ultimately, after my sprain back in Paris, was to be  
able to play at Wimbledon,'' Novotna said in a telephone conference 
call Monday. ``Now my aim is to get better every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna was taken off the court in Paris in a wheelchair after  
she and Zvereva both went to cover the same ball and collided. 
Novotna twisted her ankle when she stepped on Zvereva's foot. She 
said an MRI found a partial tear in one of her ligaments, but that 
the damage wasn't great enough to keep her from Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna didn't play for eight days and underwent 10 to 12 days  
of ``intense therapy'' after the June 2 injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna was seeded fifth for the June 21 tournament in rankings  
that came out Monday. She called the women's tournament a ``very 
open Wimbledon,'' but gave particular praise to French Open 
champion Steffi Graf, who upset top-ranked Martina Hingis in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all pretty much know who has the best shot to win  
Wimbledon this year,'' Novotna said. ``Look at the French Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the injury, and her recent breakup with former doubles  
partner Hingis, hasn't hurt her opinion of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, occasionally it happens that you don't get along anymore  
with your partner,'' Novotna said. But ``all the other benefits 
that you have from playing doubles are just incredible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just helps you to pick up your game. It just gives you an  
extra practice,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna and Zvereva are also playing doubles at Wimbledon.  
</P>
<P>
	Novotna also will defend her title at the A&AMP;P Classic in Mahwah,  
which begins July 12.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Plant Disclosures Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week before a deadline set nearly a decade  
ago, the administration and Congress are still working on how to 
tell the public about potential chemical disasters without handing 
terrorists a new tool. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups said Monday that chemical facilities are  
doing little to reduce dangers to local communities, and that 
withholding this information was a greater threat than the danger 
of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions on the right to know, supported by the chemical  
industry, are ``a thinly veiled effort to prevent public 
accountability,'' Allison LaPlante of U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group told a Capitol Hill news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Clean Air Act requires some 66,000 facilities using or  
making toxic chemicals to give the Environmental Protection Agency 
by June 21, 1999, a Risk Management Plan, including a ``worst-case 
chemical action'' scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	But the EPA -- at the urging of the FBI, the Justice Department  
and members of Congress -- agreed last September that it would be a 
national security risk to put on the Internet worst case scenario 
information that outlines the likely effects of a chemical disaster 
on a local community. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the administration sent to Congress legislation that  
would ensure that local communities, in particular safety 
officials, would have access to the information, but that 
individuals would not be able to get electronic databases on 
chemical plant dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., is still  
trying to work out the details of that bill. Sen. James Inhofe, 
R-Okla., has his own bill pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley, at a recent hearing, said he was trying to strike a  
balance between the people's right to know about risks from 
chemical plants and ensuring that the information provided ``does 
not end up harming the very people that Congress intended to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the environmentalists, including representatives from the  
Sierra Club and the Working Group on Community Right to Know, said 
that with 85 million Americans living within five miles of a 
chemical facility and 250 dying from accidents every year, the real 
dangers from accidents outweigh the potential threat from 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that of 175 chemical facilities they had contacted,  
only two had a measurable goal and timeline for reducing their 
worst-case disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Restricting information under the guise of preventing terrorist  
attacks, said Mike Newman of the Sierra Club, is in reality an 
attempt to ``protect the chemical industry from public scrutiny.'' 
Widespread public access to disaster scenarios would let people 
from one region see how other communities are confronting the 
safety issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accidents are not theoretical,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,  
D-Calif., who is seeking more public disclosure. ``They do happen 
and we have to minimize them.''

<HEADLINE> Guccione Leads Bowling Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Frank Guccione had a pinfall total of 1,910  
and a 238 average to take the lead after the first round of 
qualifying in the the PBA National Bowling Stadium Open at the 
National Bowling Stadium on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Guccione, of Thornton, Colo., posted high games of 279, 266 and  
289 to jump to the early lead. Guccione, a part-timer on the PBA 
Tour, is looking for the first match-play appearance of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Just six pins behind Guccione is reigning PBA rookie of the year  
Chris Barnes. Barnes, who won his first two career PBA titles 
earlier this year, rolled high games of 258, 279 and 258 for 1,904 
pins. 
</P>
<P>
	PBA Hall of Famer Amleto Monacelli is in third. Monacelli, a  
former PBA player of the year who has 18 career titles, began the 
day with a 279 and added high games of 259, 255 and 269 to land on 
the leader board. Monacelli has knocked down 1,895 pins in a quest 
to make his fourth PBA television appearance of the year.

<HEADLINE> Fines Against Abortion Foes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to spare  
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and other anti-abortion 
activists from nearly $600,000 in fines and lawyer fees stemming 
from a campaign to blockade New York City area abortion clinics a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which seven  
individuals and two anti-abortion groups challenged the 
contempt-of-court fines and fee awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``These phenomenally large fines ... are a means of repressing  
civil protest that would have been enthusiastically endorsed by 
Bull Connor and the Jim Crow South,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice  
have ruled that the fines and fees are justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the NOW Legal Defense &AMP; Education Fund urged the  
justices to leave those rulings intact 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Rescue and an affiliated organization and various  
individuals had been enjoined from blocking access to abortion 
clinics in the New York metropolitan area, but over a period of 
several months in 1988 and 1989 defied the injunction and 
participated in blockades at clinics in Dobbs Ferry and Deer Park, 
N.Y., among others. 
</P>
<P>
	For violating the injunction, they were subjected to $350,000 in  
contempt fines and ordered to pay nearly $250,000 in lawyer fees 
incurred by the clinic operators and abortion-rights groups that 
brought them to court. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Terry and the two anti-abortion groups, the  
appeal acted on today was filed in behalf of Robert Pearson, Jesse 
Lee, Joseph Foreman, Michael Mongagle, Jeff White and Thomas 
Herlihy. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion advocates have failed in several Supreme Court  
challenges to a 1994 federal law protecting access to abortion 
clinics. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act bans the use 
of force, threats or blockades to interfere with access to 
reproductive health care, including abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pearson vs. Planned Parenthood, 98-1435.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heads to Europe on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO forces pouring into Kosovo,  
President Clinton will fly to Europe on Tuesday to join allies in 
signing a plan to rebuild war-torn southeast Europe and address 
``the larger imperative of establishing stability throughout the 
Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday that the  
European nations will assume the lion's share of the financial 
burden of rebuilding, since the United States played the dominant 
role in the 78-day military campaign against the forces of Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing late Tuesday, the president will fly overnight to  
Geneva to address the International Labor Organization on 
Wednesday. Clinton will speak in support of an accord to eradicate 
the worst forms of child labor. The measure is expected to be 
adopted by all 174 ILO members later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the president will stop overnight in Paris for talks  
with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin. 
</P>
<P>
	From Paris, Clinton will travel to Cologne, Germany, for the  
annual summit of the world's seven wealthiest nations -- the United 
States, Germany, England, France, Italy, Canada and Japan -- and 
Russia. They will meet Friday through Sunday, discussing 
reconstruction of the Balkans, debt relief for the poorest nations 
and new global finance structures. 
</P>
<P>
	For the summit's first two days, Russia will be represented by  
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin. President Boris Yeltsin will come 
in for the final day of talks Sunday and a private meeting with 
Clinton. National security adviser Sandy Berger said he was not 
sure why Yeltsin was not attending the first two days, speculating, 
``It could be a question of physical stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said it was critical to bring the Balkans into the  
mainstream of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our Europeans allies have recognized, after our  
experience in Kosovo and earlier this decade in Bosnia, that 
isolated programs to assist individual countries in this region 
have been insufficient,'' Albright said. ``And we need to 
coordinate our resources and encourage real integration within the 
Balkans, throughout Europe and across the Atlantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president ``will consult with his counterparts both  
on the immediate challenges there and on the larger imperative of 
establishing stability throughout the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton has said that the West will not help Yugoslavia  
rebuild as long as Milosevic is in power. 
</P>
<P>
	After the summit ends, Clinton will meet Monday with leaders of  
the European Union in Bonn, where discussions on the Balkans will 
continue. Afterward, he will fly to Slovenia for an overnight stay. 
Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia after the 
fall of communism. Slovenia now is a leading candidate to join 
NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Slovenia has made considerable progress politically  
and economically in terms of democracy and openness. Clinton's 
schedule calls for him to return home from Slovenia. However, White 
House aides are exploring a possible stop in Macedonia to visit 
refugees or in Aviano, Italy, to salute American forces that 
carried out both bombing runs and relief efforts in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Down on Good Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as favorable weekend growing weather 
boosted the chances for bumper fall production. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to bail out of the market amid expectations  
that weekend rains and forecasts for milder temperatures this week 
will prove ideal to early crop development. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers this year planted record soybean acreage and large  
tracts of corn, boosting chances of record production. While export 
demand is expected to increase slightly because of a partial 
recovery to the Asian economy, market participants are worried 
about large surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.55 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/2 cents to 
$1.21 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans fell 5 cents to $4.65 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while hog futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .48 cent to 65.50 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .65 cent to 78.60 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
fell .40 cent to 53.55 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.22 
cents to 45.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Decathlete Missing, Feared Drowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A college decathlete was missing and  
feared drowned after a raft capsized in the Spokane River. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing athlete was identified as Dusty Lane, a former  
Cashmere resident and top decathlete at the Community Colleges of 
Spokane. Lane, a sophomore, recently accepted a full athletics 
scholarship to the University of Alabama for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently broke the Community Colleges of Spokane's decathlon  
record set by Dan O'Brien, who attended the school and is the 
defending Olympic champion and world record holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, 22, was rafting with three friends Sunday in Riverside  
State Park northwest of Spokane when the raft capsized in the 
Spokane River's turbulent waters, Spokane County sheriff's Sgt. 
David Fray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the rafters made it to shore near the Bowl and Pitcher,  
a rough turn in the river favored by kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rescue boats and a helicopter searched for three hours  
Sunday before the search was called off due to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	No searching was done Monday, in part because of the possibility  
that Lane's body might be stuck on the river bottom, sheriff's 
spokesman Deputy David Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies will use personal watercraft to search the river  
Tuesday, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the rafters had been wearing life jackets, and the group  
had been drinking before the accident, Fray said.

<HEADLINE> TWA Sweetens Contract Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines and its biggest union have  
reached a tentative contract agreement, avoiding a potentially 
devastating walkout and ending two years of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, if approved by the rank-and-file, would avert a strike  
or wildcat work stoppage that could have crippled -- even destroyed 
-- the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``TWA couldn't afford a strike, and neither could the members of  
the union,'' said Ted Evans, a TWA skycap at Lambert Airport for 24 
years. ``Too many people would have been out of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Sunday in New York, must still be approved  
by TWA's 16,000 members of the International Association of 
Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the proposal were expected to be released Tuesday and  
voting could begin by Wednesday. Union leaders said there would be 
no work stoppages during the monthlong ratification process. 
</P>
<P>
	The union covers a wide range of workers -- baggage handlers,  
flight attendants, ramp workers, ticket agents and mechanics. It 
makes up three-fourths of the airline's total 21,000 workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	William O'Driscoll, president of Machinists District 142 in  
Kansas City, Mo., said the new deal offered ``a significant 
improvement over previous contract offers from TWA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came as something of a surprise considering TWA  
officials had said their offer on May 28 was the ``last, best'' 
proposal workers would get. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Driscoll, TWA chief executive William Compton and other  
negotiators, including former St. Louis Mayor Vince Schoemehl, 
began meeting secretly in New York on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always had an interest in coming up with a package that  
would be endorsed by the Machinists,'' Compton said. ``It is always 
better to get a deal that is endorsed by both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union workers had only last week begun to vote on the previous  
contract offered by TWA, though indications were that they were 
soundly rejecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	Had that contract been rejected, the union was threatening  
walkouts at selected cities over the busy Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton had warned that a strike could doom the airline, which  
has been to bankruptcy court twice in the 1990s and has failed to 
turn an annual profit in 10 years, losing more than $2 billion 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Many employees haven't had a raise in 15 years, and part of the  
reason the company's still around is because workers have given up 
part of their salaries and benefits to help make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA may have been pressed into action by the mere threat of a  
strike. While domestic bookings were relatively steady, TWA 
spokesman Jim Brown said, business travelers were beginning to turn 
to other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business traveler component was weakening rapidly,'' Brown  
said. ``That's really the bread and butter of any major hub. We 
expect that will come back very rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day for Trans World Airlines and its  
employees,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-St. Louis. 
``We all need to understand that TWA as a corporation is important 
to the financial and economic success of the future of St. Louis.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Pledges No Abortion Litmus Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush said Monday he would not require his Supreme Court nominees 
to pass an anti-abortion ``litmus test.'' He pledged to uphold the 
dignity of the presidency, raising his right hand in an 
oath-swearing flourish when questioned about his character. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging news conference on his maiden campaign trip,  
Bush said he swore an oath as a twice-elected Texas governor to 
uphold the state constitution and respect the dignity of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pledge that I have upheld, so help me God,'' Bush  
said, his right hand still raised. He refused to discuss rumors 
about his personal life, dismissing them as part of a ``game in 
Washington'' that he won't play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner said he was opposed to racial quotas  
and preferences and concerned about the Kosovo peace implementation 
plan. He said he was determined not to raise corporate and income 
taxes and eager to work with the Republican-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spoke in Spanish as he challenged his party to adopt a  
softer stance on immigration. ``Our party somehow has gotten the 
imagery that we don't welcome legal immigrants,'' he added in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion is the most divisive issue in Republican politics,  
pitting social conservatives against the more moderate 
establishment wing of the GOP. Bush is trying to straddle the gap 
between the two factions without alienating independent and 
Democratic voters he would need to win the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm hearing right now from the governor is waffling on  
the one issue that can clearly explain compassionate 
conservatism,'' said GOP presidential rival Gary Bauer, referring 
to Bush's political slogan. ``If compassionate conservative means 
anything, it has to mean do anything we can to stop the loss of 1.5 
million unborn children every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats still argue that Bush is too extreme on abortion for  
most voters. ``Republicans try to avoid the issue to get 
nominated,'' Democratic chairman Joe Andrew said Monday. ``They 
never can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he is opposed to abortion and would support a  
constitutional amendment making the procedure illegal -- except in 
cases of rape, incest and when a woman's life is jeopardy. But he 
also says Americans don't support the measure, thus there is no 
need to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told reporters he would nominate Supreme Court judges based  
on three criteria: judicial temperament and ``do the judges share 
my overall philosophy and will the judges strictly interpret the 
Constitution as opposed to using the bench to legislate?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strict interpretation of the Constitution has come to stand --  
for some candidates and voters -- for the philosophy of judges who 
traditionally take a conservative stance on issues, including 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was asked how he interprets the Constitution on abortion,  
and whether he would require his nominees to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no litmus tests, except for whether or not the  
judges strictly interpret the Constitution,'' he said. ``I am not a 
lawyer. My job is to pick judges who are qualified to serve on the 
bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Karen Hughes said afterward that Bush feels it  
is unethical to require a nominee to cement his or her views on any 
potential case -- including those on abortion -- before being 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, GOP rival Pat Buchanan is ``a 'yes' on an  
anti-abortion litmus test,'' according to Buchanan spokesman Bob 
Adams. New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith has pledged ``only to nominate 
pro-life justices for the Supreme Court,'' spokeswoman Karen Hickey 
said. And Steve Forbes said, ``I believe you should appoint 
justices on matter of principle. One of those principles is belief 
in the sanctity of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On affirmative action, his relationship with Congress, taxes and  
character, Bush left more room than he did on the abortion 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and confident, Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Said he opposes quotas and racial preferences but believes  
both the private and public sectors should be encouraged to reach 
out to minorities. He declined to state his position on a 
California law that eliminated affirmative action programs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Promised not to raise corporate or income taxes but did not  
extend the pledge to other taxes. Having supported two tax cuts in 
Texas, Bush said, ``It's a record I'm proud of and a record I plan 
to run on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Expressed concern about a peace plan in Kosovo and urged  
President Clinton to set a date for the withdrawal of U.S. troops 
in the region. Bush declined to say what the deadline should be. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has the support of many of the state's leading GOP  
politicians, including Sen. Judd Gregg and public safety director 
Richard Flynn. He released a list of 250 local leaders Monday, 
after addressing 300 supporters at an early morning outdoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Making character a centerpiece of his campaign, Bush told the  
backers, ``I'm a man of my word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The applause was loudest when he promised, ``I will not use my  
office as a mirror to reflect public opinion. ... I want you to 
know I do not run polls to tell me what to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, the 52-year-old governor said, ``I made  
mistakes 20 or 30 years ago but I've learned from them. 
</P>
<P>
	When a local reporter pressed for specifics, Bush said. ``This  
is a game in Washington. It's called ``Gotcha.' It's a game where 
you float a rumor and make the candidate prove a negative. I'm not 
playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can ask all the questions you want,'' he said calmly.  
``That's my answer.''

<HEADLINE> Novotna Will Play Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Jana Novotna on Monday said she's recovered  
enough from a painful ankle sprain to defend her Wimbledon singles 
title next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to just be prepared ... to struggle and to fight,''  
Novotna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Czech star won't defend her Eastbourne  
championship this week to avoid re-injuring the right ankle she 
sprained when she collided with her partner, Natasha Zvereva, in 
the French Open doubles quarterfinals. She said she will play 
doubles at Eastbourne to get grasscourt preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal, ultimately, after my sprain back in Paris, was to be  
able to play at Wimbledon,'' Novotna said in a telephone conference 
call Monday. ``Now my aim is to get better every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna was taken off the court in Paris in a wheelchair after  
she and Zvereva both went to cover the same ball and collided. 
Novotna twisted her ankle when she stepped on Zvereva's foot. She 
said an MRI found a partial tear in one of her ligaments, but that 
the damage wasn't great enough to keep her from Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna didn't play for eight days and underwent 10 to 12 days  
of ``intense therapy'' after the June 2 injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna was seeded fifth for the June 21 tournament in rankings  
that came out Monday. She called the women's tournament a ``very 
open Wimbledon,'' but gave particular praise to French Open 
champion Steffi Graf, who upset top-ranked Martina Hingis in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all pretty much know who has the best shot to win  
Wimbledon this year,'' Novotna said. ``Look at the French Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the injury, and her recent breakup with former doubles  
partner Hingis, hasn't hurt her opinion of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, occasionally it happens that you don't get along anymore  
with your partner,'' Novotna said. But ``all the other benefits 
that you have from playing doubles are just incredible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just helps you to pick up your game. It just gives you an  
extra practice,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna and Zvereva are also playing doubles at Wimbledon.  
</P>
<P>
	Novotna also will defend her title at the A&AMP;P Classic in Mahwah,  
which begins July 12.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar jumped higher against the yen Monday  
as the Bank of Japan -- in a surprise move -- defended its attempts 
at economic recovery by buying billions of dollars and flooding the 
market with yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's recovery against the yen helped it rise against the  
euro and other major European currencies. The stock market's 
rebound also helped underpin the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.62  
Japanese yen, up from 118.08 late Friday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.0428, down from $1.0535. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold their dollars to the Bank of Japan as it  
intervened in foreign exchange markets during Asian trading after 
the dollar fell below 118 yen. The dollar rose 2 yen higher than 
its Friday New York late afternoon levels and remained there 
through New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for  
international affairs, confirmed the intervention but declined to 
say how much the bank spent. Traders, however, estimated the bank 
spent as much as $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were taken unawares by the intervention because Japanese  
officials hadn't said anything about the yen's volatility when it 
fell rapidly in recent past weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely surprised the market,'' said Jeremy Fand, a  
Boston-based foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston. He said, 
however, the Japanese intervened now because not only are they 
``afraid of a strong yen but they also want a strong dollar because 
of people who invested that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes exporters' products more expensive and less  
competitive. Exporting products is one way Japan is trying to fight 
its way out of its worst recession in 50 years, although government 
spending has been the economy's main stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's efforts are finally working. It reported last  
Thursday that Japan had an unexpectedly strong 1.9 percent growth 
rate during the first three months of the year, the first growth 
after five straight quarters of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara said Japan is determined to prevent the yen from  
strengthening excessively and ruining the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market shouldn't underestimate our firm intention,''  
Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5302 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5141, and 1.4607 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4618. The British pound fell to $1.6069 from $1.6176. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8755 German marks, up from 1.8567; 6.2893 French francs, up from 
6.2267; and 1,855.29 Italian lire, up from 1,838.24.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Profiling Eyes Racial Paradox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The stories are similar: Police pull over a black  
or Hispanic driver who is questioned, perhaps even searched. Though 
no ticket is issued, the driver suspects race was the reason for 
the stop. 
</P>
<P>
	While police in states from North Carolina to California are  
collecting data to see if there's a trend toward such so-called 
racial profiling, the evidence in Illinois is often little more 
than anecdotal. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why some members of the state's black community are  
looking to newly elected Secretary of State Jesse White to find out 
if profiling is a problem in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Because he's black.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care about the political realities. I look at him as a  
brother,'' said David Morris, a black Chicago resident and planning 
director for the city's Commission on Human Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	White holds the key to stacks of driver records that American  
Civil Liberties Union lawyers say could help them prove the 
Illinois State Police unfairly targets black drivers. The lawyers 
are suing for the records, but say they can't afford the documents' 
$160,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the nonprofit Human Relations Foundation of  
Chicago said they hope to sit down with White this summer to 
discuss reducing the cost of the records to a mere $500 -- the price 
that would be regularly charged to another government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for elected officials who happen to be  
minorities to act in ways that help restore credibility,'' said 
Clarence Wood, the foundation's president. 
</P>
<P>
	But White -- a bit taken aback at being singled out -- said  
there's nothing he can do about the cost of the records. He also 
points out that U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning, who upheld the 
$160,000 fee, is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot open up Pandora's box,'' he said. ``If the fees are  
required, I have to collect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be wrong for him to do any special favors for  
the black community, which makes up about 15 percent of the 
Illinois' population. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation isn't new for many nonwhite elected officials,  
said Lenneal Henderson, a University of Baltimore government 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a statewide official, he's got to calculate the political  
consequences of essentially taking a hard line that the African 
American population wants,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said politicians like White also must consider the wishes of  
others who helped get them elected -- from business and union 
interests, to the other voters in a mostly white state. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's practical politics vs. racial loyalty -- and that's a  
tough call,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority politicians who win elections are those who find ways  
to juggle the needs of minority communities as well as their other 
political supporters, said Leonard Steinhorn, an American 
University professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a new generation of black politicians who've learned a  
lesson from history and are learning how to balance,'' Steinhorn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathering evidence on alleged racial profiling in Illinois has  
been tough. Two bills aimed at forcing state and Chicago police to 
record the race of stopped drivers died this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ACLU is scheduled to bring its lawsuit against  
the state police to trial as soon as late summer, with Judge 
Manning presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster their claims, ACLU lawyers have added statistics on  
Hispanic drivers, compiled using a computer program that recognizes 
Hispanic names on state police data from 1990 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU lawyers claim that while Hispanic drivers make up 7.9  
percent of the Illinois population and constitute 2.7 percent of 
personal vehicle trips in Illinois, they represent nearly one-third 
of drivers stopped by state police drug officers. 
</P>
<P>
	State police deny that their drug officers use racial profiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris is skeptical. As the father of two sons -- both college  
students -- who are regularly stopped by police, he said he also 
can't imagine that such practices have never personally affected 
White. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't tell me that this hasn't happened to him or someone  
he knows,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who said he's open to talking about the issue, said he's  
never been stopped because of his race. ``But there is a problem 
out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, White wonders if racial profiling really occurs as  
often as people think it does. It's one reason he's not sure 
handing over the driving records to the ACLU would do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes individuals will give this race bit as an excuse,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Petroleum Signs Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- Phillips Petroleum Co. signed an oil  
production-sharing agreement Monday with the government, the Oman 
News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pact, which covers a 6,960 square-mile area in in  
southwest Oman, Phillips is obliged to invest at least $29 million 
during the first three years of the 10-year concession. 
</P>
<P>
	Oman Oil Minister Mohammed al-Rumhy, who signed the agreement,  
said Phillips is entitled to 40 percent of any discoveries, with 
the remainder going to the Omani government, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second concession in Oman for Phillips, which is  
based in Bartlesville, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is expected to begin drilling next year, ONA said.  
</P>
<P>
	Oman is a not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum  
Exporting Countries. It has a capacity for producing about 800,000 
barrels of oil daily and has several oil-production agreements with 
other major foreign companies.

</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean warships sank a North  
Korean torpedo boat Tuesday in contested waters of the Yellow Sea 
after a 10-minute exchange of gunfire, South Korea's Defense 
Ministry said. ``Our patrol boats fired 35mm guns and hit one'' of 
three torpedo boats, Koo Bon-hak, a Defense Ministry spokesman 
said. ``The North Korean ship later sank. There is no word on 
casualties yet.'' Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, spokesman for the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said the three North Korean torpedo boats shot 
first and their fire was returned by at least some of the eight 
South Korean ships patrolling the area. The gunfire happened only 
minutes before talks began in an effort to end the standoff, 
Seoul's Defense Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Standard Planned for E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the nation's largest computer companies,  
credit card companies and retailers are expected to announce today 
they have agreed on an Internet commerce standard that will make 
online shopping easier and quicker. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard evolves around the concept of an ``electronic  
wallet'' that allows consumers to input their personal data once, 
instead of re-entering the information for every transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.,  
America Online Inc. and IBM Corp. are set to endorse a new 
technical format called electronic-commerce modeling language, or 
ECML, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The common format is also backed by Visa USA Inc., MasterCard  
International Inc. and American Express Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The software firms will use the common language to store a  
consumer's name, address and credit card number in a secure Web 
browser or on a server on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers that agree to use the standard will be able to read  
the stored information and share it with others, eventually 
providing one-click checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Jupiter Communications survey cited by the Times,  
27 percent of potential online buyers reported earlier this year 
that they abandoned their orders because of the many steps it took 
to complete a purchase.

<HEADLINE> Gore Releases Study on Gun Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Saying the National Rifle Association cannot  
be allowed to ``call the shots'' on protective gun laws, Vice 
President Al Gore released a government study today showing that 
people age 18 through 20 commit 24 percent of all gun murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, prepared jointly by the Treasury and Justice  
departments, said this is the case even though that group of 
youthful Americans makes up only 4 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore presented the report's conclusions in remarks prepared for  
delivery before the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Incredibly, while those 18-to-20-year-olds cannot legally buy  
a beer, cannot purchase a bottle of wine, they can walk into any 
gun shop, pawn shop or gun show in America and buy a handgun,'' 
Gore said, according to an advance copy of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 18-year-olds commit 35 percent more gun  
murders than 21-year-olds, double the gun murders by 24-year-olds 
and four times the gun murders by 30-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president urged Congress to resist lobbying by the NRA  
against stricter gun laws and act on a bipartisan basis this week 
to pass what his office called ``commonsense measures to protect 
America''s children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Will we let the NRA call the shots in Washington or will we  
cross party lines to make our children safer?'' Gore asked in his 
prepared remarks. ``Now is the time for every parent, every 
citizen, every elected official, every national leader to take a 
stand, and to stand up and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more delays and no more fuzziness and no more excuses,'' he  
said. ``We need strong action, and strong leadership, today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and the Clinton administration are seeking new laws to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Raise the legal age for the possession of handguns from 18 to  
21. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require child safety locks on guns.  
</P>
<P>
	--Require background checks for people wishing to buy guns at gun  
shows.

<HEADLINE> Rockslide in National Park Kills 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A rockslide sent huge  
boulders tumbling near a popular Yosemite National Park village, 
killing one rock climber and injuring four others 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened campers, who had been enjoying the park's serenity,  
grabbed their children and ran as the slide began on the western 
shoulder of the Glacier Point apron Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hurt were treated at a clinic for bruises and other minor  
injuries, park spokesman Bob Roney said. The body of the 
unidentified person killed had not been recovered as of early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 300 cabins -- about 1,300 guests and employees -- were  
evacuated from Curry Village and allowed to return several hours 
later. Many tourists chose to leave the park rather than spend the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbers were beneath Glacier Point in a mostly undeveloped  
site outside the village at the time of the slide, Yosemite 
spokeswoman Christine Cowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of anyone missing, although rescue efforts  
continued through the night with about 100 searchers. The extent of 
the slide would not be known until first light today, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people with headlamps on looking at boulders  
and looking for any signs of people,'' Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bickford, a front desk clerk at the 628-unit Curry Village  
Lodge, said he ran outside when he heard the slide about 300 yards 
away. He said all he could see was a giant cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing that goes through your mind is that it's  
thunder, but then the sky is blue so you know it's not that,'' he 
said. ``The dust is still out there and now it's dark. Everything's 
covered in a film of white granite dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third major slide in Yosemite in the past three  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, about 500 park employees and visitors were  
evacuated from the same village when rocks fell more than 3,000 
feet from Glacier Point to the Yosemite Valley floor. There were no 
injuries or major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The village, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary, is  
also a popular spot for campers and has an outdoor ice skating 
rink.

<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A rockslide sent huge  
boulders tumbling near a popular Yosemite National Park village, 
killing one rock climber and slightly injuring three other people. 
</P>
<P>
	Frightened campers, who had been enjoying the park's serenity,  
grabbed their children and ran as the slide began on the western 
shoulder of the Glacier Point apron Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hurt were treated at a clinic for bruises and other minor  
injuries, park spokesman Bob Roney said. The body of the man killed 
had not been recovered as of this morning, because of fears the 
area was still unstable. He was identified as Peter J. Terbush, 22, 
a student at Western State College, in Gunnison, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 300 cabins -- about 1,300 guests and employees -- were  
evacuated from Curry Village, an area of cabins and concession 
stands. They were allowed to return several hours later, but many 
tourists chose to leave the park rather than spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbers were beneath Glacier Point in a mostly undeveloped  
site outside the village at the time of the slide, Yosemite 
spokeswoman Christine Cowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden we heard this huge, thunderous sound,'' said  
Steve Hartman, a CBS reporter who had been eating dinner in Curry 
Village with his family. ``Out from the woods a man wearing a 
mountaineering harness came out screaming, 'My buddy's dead, my 
buddy's dead!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbie Kealey, a vacationer from Baltimore, was enjoying the  
sunset from the top of the peak when the face of the mountain gave 
way in front of her. Moments later, she saw people running for 
their lives far below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a huge rumbling sound, like a jet coming close,''  
Kealey said. ``We looked over and we saw a tiny plume of impact 
that rose up like a nuclear blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second, much smaller rockslide sent more boulders down into  
the area early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter crew was trying to determine today where the rocks  
came from and make sure no more were about to fall. After that, 
some 100 searchers planned to go in, recover Terbush's body and 
make sure no other victims were in the area. There were no reports 
of anyone missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bickford, a front desk clerk at the 628-unit Curry Village  
Lodge, said he ran outside when he heard the slide about 300 yards

	``The first thing that goes through your mind is that it's  
thunder, but then the sky is blue so you know it's not that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glacier Point, with an elevation of 7,214 feet, is one of the  
more popular tourist attractions at the park because of its view of 
Yosemite Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, about 500 park employees and visitors were  
evacuated when rocks fell more than 3,000 feet from Glacier Point 
to the Yosemite Valley floor. There were no injuries or major 
damage. In July 1996, a slab of rock more than 300 feet wide came 
off of Glacier Point and tumbled into the Happy Valley area, 
killing one person.

and tolerance to Jerusalem, a city that is to many a symbol of 
religious strife. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a maroon and gold robe, the leader of hundreds of  
thousands of Tibetan Buddhists visited the shrines of Judaism, 
Islam and Christianity -- the Western Wall, the Al Aqsa Mosque and 
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human beings should consider other human beings as fellow  
brothers and sisters,'' he told reporters. ``The differences of 
ideology, systems and nationality are secondary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Dalai Lama brought together leaders of five  
faiths in Jerusalem to emphasize the need for unity among 
theologians. 
</P>
<P>
	His first stop today was the Western Wall, the last remains of  
the Jewish Temple. Escorted by Israeli soldiers and personal guards 
who held a blue umbrella to shield him from the sun, he walked to 
the office of Israel's chief rabbi, Israel Meir Lau. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama put a maroon and white skullcap on his head as he  
and the rabbi talked about religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lau presented the Dalai Lama with a book called ``Practical  
Judaism.'' He then asked the Dalai Lama about a white scarf the 
Buddhist leader gave him several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama took another white scarf from one of his aides  
and handed it to the rabbi. ``The color, the pureness, the 
smoothness ... this symbolizes humility,'' he told the rabbi. ``It 
is long, the symbol that this friendship will remain forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He put the scarf around Lau's neck. ``So I want to give you this  
with my expression, my appreciation of Judaism making contributions 
for the betterment of humanity in the past, present and future,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Wall, the Dalai Lama offered a prayer and then pressed  
another white scarf to one of the large, honey-colored stone 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked up a ramp to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, tourists  
gathered around him to shake his hand and take his picture. He took 
off the skullcap and put on a bright yellow hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama was not greeted by a representative of the  
Islamic Trust, which administers the Muslim holy sites in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Husseini, the leading cleric at Al Aqsa, said the  
Islamic Trust wasn't told of the visit until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama was allowed to tour, but not to offer prayers in  
the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Dalai Lama was greeted  
by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros I. The Dalai 
Lama toured the tomb of Jesus and posed for pictures with Greek 
Orthodox clergymen.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Waiting Period OK'd in Mich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Women will have to wait 24 hours before  
obtaining an abortion under a compromise signed Monday by Gov. John 
Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature passed a law in 1993 requiring a waiting period  
for abortion, but a lawsuit attempting to overturn the law had 
prevented it from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and a coalition of more than 20 abortion clinics  
agreed to a settlement that requires clinics to give women written 
material about abortion at least 24 hours before the procedure is 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The materials discuss the risks and complications of abortion  
and show detailed drawings of the development of a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six long years, and this is getting actual  
information to women. This information doesn't sway people one way 
or the other,'' Department of Community Health spokeswoman Geralyn 
Lasher said. ``This isn't information that Right to Life is putting 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, a doctor who performs an abortion without  
a waiting period can be charged with a misdemeanor unless the 
abortion meets the federal definition of a medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement allows the reading materials to be sent by mail,  
fax, or electronic mail. Abortion clinics wanted that change to 
prevent women from having to travel twice to an abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Margie Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law  
and Policy in New York, said the change ``minimized the harm to 
women's health and protected as much as possible a woman's right to 
have an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler had already signed the law, which will now go into effect  
in 90 days. A federal judge was expected to approve the settlement 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Futures Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures fell sharply Monday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid reports of heavy sales. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybeans advanced, while cocoa  
futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices tumbled as market participants reacted to  
suggested that Tiger Management, a large hedge fund, is dumping its 
positions in the industrial metal. Such a move could signal heavy 
physical selling is on the way, although the company denied it had 
sold any of its positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices have seesawed for months as speculators bet on  
when Russia will resume large-scale shipments of the metal to 
Western manufacturers, particularly Japan. The metal is used 
heavily in automobiles and electronics, but large shipments have 
been absent since December amid economic turmoil in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for September delivery fell $8 to $336.80 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures led the gains, moving higher on reports of heavy  
commercial buying, which may indicate export demand is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were supported by forecasts for hot, dry weather to  
develop later this week in the Plains. That could scorch crops in 
areas where harvesting has been delayed by heavy recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans shrugged off early weakness tied to favorable  
growing weather on the rally in wheat prices. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.63 3/4 a bushel; July corn rose 1  
cent to $2.18 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to $1.23 a bushel; 
July soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures tumbled on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York amid expectations candy manufacturers have secured enough 
supplies to last until the next West African harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures had risen sharply in previous sessions as supplies  
out of Ghana and Ivory Coast, the two largest cocoa growers, 
dwindled. That helped support a market that has been under pressure 
by a world awash in supplies and weaker demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa is used mainly in the manufacture of chocolate.  
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa fell $34 to $1,063 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise Moderately / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen in early  
trading Tuesday on profit-taking, despite warnings by Japanese 
finance officials. Tokyo stocks rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.56 yen in early trading, down 0.10 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
120.62 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 62.37  
points, or 0.36 percent, to 17,251.19 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Monday, the index lost 9.73 points, or 0.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong words from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and  
other officials that they would take action against sudden 
dollar-yen moves briefly sent the U.S. currency back up to its New 
York levels. But it soon edged back down on profit-taking, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most market participants remain reluctant to take new positions  
in the wake of the Bank of Japan's aggressive dollar-buying binge 
in Monday's Asian session, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for  
international affairs, confirmed Monday that the Bank of Japan 
intervened in the currency market to prevent an excessively fast 
strengthening of the yen, which is feared could wreck economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is a threat to the exporters that power Japan's  
economy because it makes their goods more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara declined to say how large the intervention was, but  
traders estimated the central bank spent as much as dlrs 10 billion 
and flooded the market with yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, early buying was led by foreign investors,  
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities. He said that domestic institutional investors remained 
cautious about the direction of the economy and the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower-priced shares in materials manufacturers, such as paper  
and steelmakers, were among the gainers early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average gained  
72.82 points to close at 10,563.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.59 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,382.86. The 
TOPIX gained 0.59 points, negligible in percentage terms, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies Monday, the euro was traded at 125.56 yen,  
down from 126.49 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond dropped to 1.590 percent from 1.635 percent Monday, driving 
its price up to 98.36 from 97.97.

<HEADLINE> Coles To Skip IOC Meeting in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Australian IOC member Phil Coles has  
decided not to attend international Olympic meetings in Seoul this 
week, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was forced to resign Monday from the board of the Sydney  
2000 organizing committee, but escaped expulsion from the 
International Olympic Committee for alleged ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was expected to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday to attend the  
109th IOC session beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC and Australian Olympic officials said Coles decided to  
stay in Sydney to avoid a media frenzy in Seoul that would distract 
from the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board Monday reprimanded Coles for ``serious  
negligence'' in writing notes about his colleagues, some not very 
flattering. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the notes written by Coles and his companion,  
Patricia Rosenbrock, did not in themselves ``constitute an 
offense,'' but that Coles was negligent in allowing them to become 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The board barred Coles from serving on IOC commissions for two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Coles received a severe warning for his role in the  
Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal.

<HEADLINE> Taxpayer Uncovers Va. Mayor's Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP) -- Charlie Kambarn wanted to find out what  
his town leaders did during an official trip to Florida, so he 
spent $1,300 of his own money following the paper trail. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of what he found, the mayor was suspended, the town  
manager resigned and the police chief was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, it turned out, had skipped most of a hurricane  
conference in Florida and run up big bar and restaurant tabs at 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought in their wildest dreams I would get this far,''  
said Kambarn, whose Freedom of Information Act request documented 
the men's spending spree of about $3,000. ``It will be a long time 
before anyone eats and drinks big on the town of Chincoteague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials went to Orlando for the conference in March but  
later acknowledged playing hooky. Mayor Harry S. Thornton, Town 
Manager T. Stewart Baker and Police Chief Willis Dize drove a 
rental car six hours south to Key West to visit a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about their side trip spread when they returned to  
Chincoteague, a town of 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Kambarn, who runs a boat dealership and real estate  
business, decided to get to the bottom of things. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Kambarn filed a request to make public the officials'  
expense account reports. Town officials charged Kambarn $1,300 for 
photocopies. The Town Council has since voted to refund the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation's credit card receipts included a $2,075 hotel  
bill from Orlando, including $365 for ``lobby bar/pool service''; 
$320 for one dinner; $420 for a rental car that traveled 831 miles 
in six days; and $54.31 for a lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe in Key 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after news of the spending spread, Baker resigned, the Town  
Council fired Dize and a judge suspended Thornton pending further 
review of the case. Lawyers for Thornton and Baker declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dize's attorney, Rick Matthews, said the police chief was just  
following orders and will sue if necessary to get his job back. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kambarn and others are pushing for a state  
investigation of the island's finances.

<HEADLINE> EU May Delay Ban on Some U.S. Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union will likely delay  
for six months a proposed ban on U.S. beef which it threatened to 
impose because of evidence beef certified as hormone free may 
include growth hormones outlawed in the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Gardner, a spokesman for the EU executive Commission, said  
Monday an EU veterinary committee meeting Tuesday, when the ban is 
due to go into place, will likely agree to postpone the ban until 
Dec. 15. Tests on certified hormone-free beef imports would 
continue however to ensure they are safe, Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``a lot of progress'' had been made in ongoing talks  
between the EU and the United States to try and resolve the 
transatlantic dispute, one of many trade tiffs between the two 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	EU imports of U.S. beef certified as hormone-free amount to an  
estimated 7,000 metric tons a year and are worth an estimated $20 
million-$30 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A ban on hormone-free beef would effectively mean a total EU ban  
on U.S. beef imports because the EU already bans imports of 
hormone-treated beef from the U.S. and all other trade partners. 
That ban, imposed in 1989, is based on fears that hormone-treated 
beef can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is threatening to slap $202 million in tariffs  
on European imports because the EU ignored a World Trade 
Organization order to drop the ban on hormone-treated American beef 
imports by May 13. Canada has threatened sanctions on trade worth 
$51 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU argues it wants to maintain the ban until the end of the  
year, when it expects to complete scientific tests to determine 
whether the hormones are safe. The United States says there is no 
evidence of health risks from the beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, the WTO set up an arbitration panel to assess the  
losses incurred by the United States and Canada because of the EU 
ban on hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel must report back by mid-July. At that point, the  
United States and Canada will be entitled to slap punitive 100 
percent duties against EU products ranging from chocolate to 
mineral water to offset losses incurred by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would double the price of the targeted products and  
make them prohibitively expensive for American consumers. It would 
also spell possible economic ruin for European manufacturers 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 90 percent of the beef produced in the United States and  
Canada uses hormones approved by the regulatory U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to make cattle grow faster and bigger.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Trains Return to Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARDMORE, Okla. (AP) -- Twenty years after the last passenger  
train left Oklahoma, Amtrak rolled back into the state on Monday 
with daily service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see it come back. We've missed it,'' said  
90-year-old Pauline Anderson Foster, one of hundreds of people who 
turned out along the tracks in this town just north of the Texas 
state line to catch a glimpse of the gleaming silver train, called 
the Heartland Flyer. 
</P>
<P>
	State leaders had lobbied for years for the return of train  
service, which was discontinued because of federal budget cuts in 
1979. The result is a collaborative effort between the state and 
Amtrak, with Oklahoma leasing the track, trains and crew and Amtrak 
operating the train. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heartland Flyer will allow travelers from Oklahoma City to  
connect in Fort Worth with trains that serve Chicago, San Antonio, 
Los Angeles, New Orleans and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 people were on hand for train's arrival at the old  
Frisco depot in Ardmore, where Boy Scouts stood with American 
flags, a band played ``Oklahoma!'' and vendors hawked hot dogs and 
hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a first-rate train standing on a track in a  
first-rate city,'' Gov. Frank Keating declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington Northern Santa Fe owns the tracks and uses them to  
deliver coal, grain and other freight. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma is spending $23 million, some of which will go toward  
rail and signal improvements to that the train speed can be 
increased to 90 mph, shortening the 4 1/2-hour trip along the 180-mile 
route. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's venture with Amtrak isn't unique. Eleven other states  
-- California, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North 
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin -- 
have created similar passenger train routes along existing railroad 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak has not made a profit since Congress created it in 1971  
to take over passenger operations of private railroads. Last year, 
however, it topped $1 billion in revenue for the first time, 
propelled by the best ridership in a decade and its best on-time 
performance in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five states are without Amtrak service -- Alaska, Hawaii,  
Maine, Wyoming and South Dakota.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heads to Europe on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO forces pouring into Kosovo,  
President Clinton will fly to Europe on Tuesday to join allies in 
signing a plan to rebuild war-torn southeast Europe and address 
``the larger imperative of establishing stability throughout the 
Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday that the  
European nations will assume the lion's share of the financial 
burden of rebuilding, since the United States played the dominant 
role in the 78-day military campaign against the forces of Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing late Tuesday, the president will fly overnight to  
Geneva to address the International Labor Organization on 
Wednesday. Clinton will speak in support of an accord to eradicate 
the worst forms of child labor. The measure is expected to be 
adopted by all 174 ILO members later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the president will stop overnight in Paris for talks  
with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin. 
</P>
<P>
	From Paris, Clinton will travel to Cologne, Germany, for the  
annual summit of the world's seven wealthiest nations -- the United 
States, Germany, England, France, Italy, Canada and Japan -- and 
Russia. They will meet Friday through Sunday, discussing 
reconstruction of the Balkans, debt relief for the poorest nations 
and new global finance structures. 
</P>
<P>
	For the summit's first two days, Russia will be represented by  
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin. President Boris Yeltsin will come 
in for the final day of talks Sunday and a private meeting with 
Clinton. National security adviser Sandy Berger said he was not 
sure why Yeltsin was not attending the first two days, speculating, 
``It could be a question of physical stamina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said it was critical to bring the Balkans into the  
mainstream of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our Europeans allies have recognized, after our  
experience in Kosovo and earlier this decade in Bosnia, that 
isolated programs to assist individual countries in this region 
have been insufficient,'' Albright said. ``And we need to 
coordinate our resources and encourage real integration within the 
Balkans, throughout Europe and across the Atlantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president ``will consult with his counterparts both  
on the immediate challenges there and on the larger imperative of 
establishing stability throughout the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton has said that the West will not help Yugoslavia  
rebuild as long as Milosevic is in power. 
</P>
<P>
	After the summit ends, Clinton will meet Monday with leaders of  
the European Union in Bonn, where discussions on the Balkans will 
continue. Afterward, he will fly to Slovenia for an overnight stay. 
Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia after the 
fall of communism. Slovenia now is a leading candidate to join 
NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Slovenia has made considerable progress politically  
and economically in terms of democracy and openness. Clinton's 
schedule calls for him to return home from Slovenia. However, White 
House aides are exploring a possible stop in Macedonia to visit 
refugees or in Aviano, Italy, to salute American forces that 
carried out both bombing runs and relief efforts in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> IOC Demotes Delegate After Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Olympic leaders have demoted one of  
their most popular colleagues after giving him one last chance -- 
for a second time -- to save his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, a former Olympic kayaker from Australia known as the  
``Bondi Battler,'' was allowed to remain on the International 
Olympic Committee on Monday while being forced off the organizing 
committee for next year's Summer Games in his hometown of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board also stripped Coles of most of his  
official duties on the international panel and barred him from 
serving on commissions for two years for writing notes about his 
colleagues, some not very flattering. 
</P>
<P>
	In reprimanding Coles for ``serious negligence,'' the board  
hinted that one more infraction would bring his expulsion, familiar 
language in Coles' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, an IOC investigation into the Salt Lake bribery  
scandal found Coles received excessive travel and other perks from 
Utah bidders. It slapped him with a ``most serious of warnings'' 
and said ``such repeated lack of judgment would expose him to 
expulsion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the notes written by Coles and his companion,  
Patricia Rosenbrock, did not in themselves ``constitute an 
offense,'' but that Coles was negligent in allowing them to become 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	They came to light after reportedly winding up with Salt Lake's  
successful 2002 Winter Games bid. Coles and Rosenbrock denied 
giving them to Salt Lake, but the executive board said ``merely to 
read such notes makes it reasonable to believe that the person 
writing them intended them for Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are extremely severe (sanctions), just short of  
expulsion,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said there ``has never been talk of corruption in  
connection with Mr. Coles,'' and there was no suggestion the Salt 
Lake committee paid him for the notes, which detail the likes and 
dislikes of dozens of IOC members and suggest how some might vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Australia for the IOC session, Coles said his  
resignation was forced by Sydney Olympic politics and hoped that 
the ``exhausting and nightmarish experience'' was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC gave Coles an ultimatum -- quit the Sydney organizing  
committee or be forced out -- and officials said Coles' seat on the 
IOC was never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday that a special  
investigation by executive board members Anita DeFrantz, Marc 
Hodler and Keba M'Baye found the dossiers were ``not in keeping 
with the integrity of the IOC'' and warranted expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, which did not identify its sources, said that  
position split the full 11-member board and that two powerful 
members -- vice president Dick Pound of Canada and Kim Un-yong of 
South Korea -- refused to consider an expulsion recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who headed the original IOC investigation of corruption,  
has been a friend of Coles for three decades, while Kim also 
received a ``most serious'' warning in the Salt Lake inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his case has since been closed, Kim has taken pains to  
assure that the IOC general assembly that opens Thursday with him 
as host runs smoothly and focuses on the election of the host city 
for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber denied that the  
three-member panel had originally recommended Coles be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely never mentioned that he should be expelled  
from the IOC,'' he said. ``I can categorically deny that he was 
ever recommended for expulsion from the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the IOC decision was taken by the executive board  
Sunday. He said Coles notified the IOC of his resignation in a 
phone call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Herald, again without identifying its sources, said  
Coles called IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to try to arrange 
a meeting to ``sort something out,'' but that Samaranch promptly 
handed the phone to Carrard, who told Coles the deal was final. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Coles has served on the IOC since 1982. He will  
lose his posts on the marketing and radio and television 
commissions, but he will continue to attend IOC meetings, vote in 
the election of Olympic host cities and attend the Sydney Games as 
an official IOC delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had temporarily stepped aside from Sydney organizing  
committee in February after being implicated in the Salt Lake 
vote-buying case. He was later stripped of his role in organizing 
the Olympic torch relay in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizing committee chief Michael Knight and other Australian  
Olympic officials had demanded that Coles leave the committee 
altogether, claiming the scandal was detracting from the games and 
scaring sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Coles needed to have a ``perfect working  
relationship'' with the Sydney committee and his resignation 
``contributed to an easing of tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper said, ``I  
sincerely hope this closes a very unfortunate chapter. I think Phil 
Coles did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said Coles had ``become a distraction'' for the Sydney  
organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coles said Knight was behind the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quite an exhausting and nightmarish experience and  
there has been an orchestrated move to discredit me and have me 
removed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Continues To Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer support lines were overwhelmed today  
with calls reporting new outbreaks of a software virus that spreads 
not only by e-mail, but through shared files on a network. 
</P>
<P>
	Dashing hopes that Worm.Explore.Zip might be contained more  
quickly than the recent Melissa outbreak, a leading antivirus team 
warned that the new file-destroying bug may be more virulent than 
first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the primary means of infection seemed to be through a  
friendly e-mail that tricks the recipient into opening an attached 
file, uncaging Worm.Explore.Zip. 
</P>
<P>
	But in addition to ruining files stored on an individual  
computer, the virus apparently ``worms'' its way into other 
computers linked to the same network server. 
</P>
<P>
	``Further analysis has shown that, once installed, the program  
may also behave as a worm, and it may be able to propagate itself, 
without any human interaction, to other networked machines,'' the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh said in a statement on its Website. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nervous calls to computer support lines dropped off  
sharply over the weekend, a support technician for the software 
maker Network Associates said this morning's call volume was even 
heavier than on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation was trying to track down the  
author of the virus, but the agency declined to provide any updates 
on the probe over the weekend. It took only days earlier this 
spring for authorities to trace the digital footprints of Melissa 
and the Chernobyl virus that struck in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, first detected in Israel about a week ago, began  
spreading rapidly on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer 
systems at several big corporations including AT&AMP;T, Boeing, General 
Electric and even Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows  
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives in a person's e-mail box as a timely reply  
from an acquaintance, inviting the recipient to open an attached 
file that will unleash a two-pronged attack: It spreads by sending 
a copy of itself to the address of any arriving e-mail and destroys 
files stored on a person's machine, including those created by the 
popular programs Microsoft Word and Excel.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Court's Casino Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion in which the  
Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on broadcast advertising 
for some casinos: 
</P>
<P>
	The operation of (the law) and its attendant regulatory regime  
is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the government 
cannot hope to exonerate it 
</P>
<P>
	... The government is committed to prohibiting accurate product  
information, not commercial enticements of all kinds, and then only 
when conveyed over certain forms of media and for certain types of 
gambling -- indeed, for only certain brands of casino gambling -- and 
despite the fact that messages about the availability of such 
gambling are being conveyed over the airwaves by other speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	...The regulation distinguishes among the indistinct, permitting  
a variety of speech that poses the same risks the government 
purports to fear while banning messages unlikely to cause any harm 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	...The speaker and the audience, not the government, should be  
left to assess the value of accurate and nonmisleading information 
about lawful conduct.

<HEADLINE> New Arena Football Team Picks Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While the city still doesn't have an NFL  
team, it does have the Avengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Wasserman, owner and president of Los Angeles' expansion  
franchise in the Arena Football League, announced the team's name 
at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasserman said he selected Avengers after a list of possible  
nicknames was compiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really stuck out above all,'' he said. ``It was what I was  
looking for, new and unique, and captured all the emotion and 
excitement I thought the team should have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knights was the runner-up choice, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avengers' team colors will be bright red, dark blue, dark  
gold and bright gold, with the Avenger logo on their red helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will begin play next April at the Staples Center, now  
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasserman said he plans to hire a coach and general manager in  
August. The team will be able to sign players Aug. 24, a day after 
the league's championship game. The team will also be stocked by an 
expansion draft scheduled for November.

<HEADLINE> Boeing: $1.38 Trillion on New Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- Boeing expects airlines to invest  
$1.38 trillion on new commercial airplanes during the next 20 years 
with the largest amount -- more than $570 billion -- going for 
intermediate, twin-aisle airplanes, such as the 767 and 777. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-aisle airplanes are a close second, with regional jets,  
747 and larger airplanes accounting for the smallest dollar 
investments, according to the 1999 Boeing Current Market Outlook, 
released today at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	A trend toward more non-stop flights between more cities will  
drive airlines to invest 87 percent of their airplane dollars in 
regional and single-aisle airplanes, such as 717s, 737s and 757s, 
and long-range twin-aisle jets smaller than the 747, said Randy 
Baseler, vice president of marketing for the Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook, considered the leading industry forecast of  
worldwide air travel growth and new-airplane demand, predicts: 
</P>
<P>
	--The world's commercial jetliner fleet will double to 28,425  
airplanes by 2018. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 20,150 airplanes to be delivered over the next two  
decades, nearly three-fourths will be regional and single-aisle 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only 930 of the total deliveries will be in the 747 and larger  
category, and less than 40 percent of these will be 500-plus seat 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseler said the projections are driven by annual worldwide  
travel growth of 4.7 percent, and the anticipated replacement of 
more than 4,300 airplanes in today's fleet of 12,580 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the forecast, Latin America is the fastest-growing  
air-travel market, with traffic projected to increase by 6.9 
percent per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis reduced that region's near-term  
traffic rates, but annual growth of 6.3 percent will more than 
triple the Asia-Pacific region's traffic by 2018, the forecast 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in the largest and most established market, North  
America, is about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseler pointed to the Pacific and Europe-Asia markets as  
offering numerous opportunities for new routes best served by 
intermediate-size, twin-aisle airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the North Atlantic network, U.S. hub cities and  
major European gateways are linked to relatively few destinations 
in Asia,'' Baseler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more liberal bilateral and 'open skies' agreements are  
signed, and 777s and similar airplanes offer increased range, we 
see tremendous opportunities for international market fragmentation 
-- more frequent flights using airplanes smaller than 747s,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls for 4,400 intermediate, twin-aisle airplanes to  
be delivered during the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Ex-U.N. Chief Highlights Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former U.N. Secretary-General Boutros  
Boutros-Ghali tried to highlight Monday some successful instances 
of cooperation with the United States, downplaying in person the 
criticism of Washington that he unleashed in his new memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two areas of cooperation he offered reporters, including  
U.N. operations in Mozambique and El Salvador, are not found in the 
book, ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boutros-Ghali told a news conference sponsored by the Overseas  
Press Club that his editor excised those chapters because they made 
the book too long. 
</P>
<P>
	And the other instances of successful U.S.-U.N. relations that  
he mentioned, including five international conferences and 
peacekeeping missions in Cambodia and Haiti, make up only a small 
part of the 352-page memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall tone of the book, and what is highlighted on the  
bookflap, is that the United States used the United Nations as an 
extension of its own foreign policy and made it a scapegoat for its 
own indecisive policies in Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington campaigned to make Boutros-Ghali the first U.N. chief  
to be denied a second term, despite backing from virtually all 
other U.N. member states. 
</P>
<P>
	At the unveiling ceremony U.N. headquarters, Boutros-Ghali's  
successor, Kofi Annan, praised the Egyptian intellectual for having 
steadied the United Nations during his 1992-96 term, when the world 
around it was suddenly changing with the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the picture of a man with the courage to stick by his  
decisions, and with the fortitude to stand by his convictions,'' 
Annan said before a large gathering in the lobby of the U.N. 
Secretariat building. 
</P>
<P>
	Boutros-Ghali, currently living in Paris as secretary-general of  
the International Organization of the Francophonie, an association 
of 52 countries that promotes the French language, appeared 
genuinely happy to be back, warmly greeting old friends and 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the press club briefing, though, Boutros-Ghali acknowledged  
that he felt he was made a scapegoat for Washington immediately 
after leaving office in 1996. He said he had since realized that 
such risks come with civil service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boutros-Ghali noted that he was at least allowed to live a  
free life. 
</P>
<P>
	``So at least this is the advantage to be living in a real  
democracy, that you can just write a book like this book,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Makes the Difference / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Few seers and probably most Americans failed to  
foresee the productivity surge that has lifted the U.S. economy 
into its current high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, pessimism was widespread in the late 1980s and  
even into the 1990s, and it wasn't uncommon for professors to speak 
of the economy in the past tense, as if its best days were over. 
</P>
<P>
	``An economy that 20 years ago seemed to have seen its better  
days is displaying a remarkable run of economic growth,'' 
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But you needn't go back 20 years, nor even 10, to uncover the  
deep concern about Japanese and German competition, and even that 
from small Asian nations. America was slipping, it was said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty to worry about: budget and trade imbalances,  
unemployment, business failures, a rising percentage of people 
earning below the poverty level, health care problems ... 
</P>
<P>
	Americans lacked confidence. They were pessimistic, so much so  
that Greenspan expressed it to Congress in 1992 as ``a sense that 
there's something foreboding out in the longer term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described it as ``to a large extent a concern about whether  
or not their children and grandchildren will have standards of 
living comparable to their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly thereafter, that generation began its ascent into the  
outer space of material living standards. The ratio of families 
owning homes reached a record high, unemployment a record low. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy's improvement, Greenspan said this week, ``appears  
to have its roots in ongoing advances in technology'' that reduced 
production costs, the one sure way to raise standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower-cost production meant lower prices and more sales. And  
more sales meant more jobs and more earners. And while earners 
spent rather than saved, those lower costs kept inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	What spurred business to invest in high-tech equipment such as  
computers and fiber-optic cable, and to innovate in management and 
marketing? 
</P>
<P>
	Competition. The threat from Europe and Asia, for example. To  
innovate was the only way the United States, a high-wage nation, 
could compete in the new global economy. And that's what it did. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the economy underwent this fundamental change, a new  
factor, opportunity, evolved. Accomplishments created more 
opportunities and became the base for new technological visions. 
</P>
<P>
	While seemingly awed by productivity's accomplishment, which  
wasn't widely understood as recently as two years ago even by those 
with economic microscopes, Greenspan is again worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely,'' he  
told Congress. Earlier he had made clear his view that inflation 
remained a threat and that higher borrowing rates might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are indeed signs of overexuberance, in the stock market  
and in the easy acceptance of the notion that continued gains in 
productivity will be the economy's vaccine against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at its lowest in decades, and the hot economy  
demanding even more workers, cost-reducing technology may not be 
sufficient to offset the use of marginally productive workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Greenspan's job to worry, especially when events and  
opinions become so exuberant that nobody else seems concerned. And 
it has become his policy to publicly air his views before acting. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he won't raise interest rates, and some stock analysts are  
even betting that he will let his warnings alone cool the economy. 
But even if rates do rise, productivity also may continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people really know the course the economy will take in the  
immediate future. Not even Alan Greenspan. And surely not those who 
were showered with benefits after believing the future was bleak.

<HEADLINE> Aviation Bill Threatened With Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration threatened Monday  
to veto legislation that would increase spending for airports and 
other aviation projects and essentially remove such programs from 
federal budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of House debate on the bill, the White House budget  
office issued a statement saying senior advisers would urge 
President Clinton to veto the measure if it reaches his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, written by House Transportation Committee Chairman  
Bud Shuster, R-Pa., would separate the airport and airways trust 
fund from the rest of the federal budget. That means money flowing 
into the fund -- from passenger ticket taxes and other sources -- 
could be used only for aviation taxes and not be counted as part of 
the federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would have the effect of increasing spending for  
aviation projects because currently, some of the trust fund's money 
is used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration objected that the measure would not pay for  
``any of the significant increases in spending it would provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also objected to the trust fund's removal from  
the federal budget. The budget ``presents spending tradeoffs and 
permits more fully informed decisions to be made on allocating the 
nation's resources,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster and his supporters have said aviation taxes should not  
be used for non-aviation purposes. He has said that includes using 
revenue from those taxes to pay for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's proposal is supported by bipartisan members of his  
committee and lawmakers eager for airport projects in their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	It is opposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the  
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee; Rep. John Kasich, 
R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee; Rep. Bill Young, 
R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and by many 
conservatives worried that it will reduce the size of the tax cut 
Republicans want to pass this year.

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Retroactive Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether people suspected of sexually assaulting children can be 
prosecuted under a Texas law enacted after they allegedly committed 
the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear arguments by a man convicted of  
assaulting his stepdaughter. He argues that applying the new law 
retroactively to his case violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott L. Carmell was convicted in a Denton County court in  
January 1997 of multiple counts of indecency with a child, 
aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault against his 
stepdaughter. He was sentenced to life in prison on the aggravated 
sexual assault convictions and 20 years on the other counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The sexual assault allegedly occurred in June 1992, when his  
stepdaughter was 14. Under Texas law at the time, a conviction for 
assaulting someone age 14 or older could not be supported unless 
the alleged victim told a third person about the offense within six 
months. She told her mother of the alleged assault in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepdaughter testified that Carmell had ``married'' her in a  
mock ceremony two days after the first incident. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the law was changed so that no time limit was required  
for a complaint by any alleged victim under age 18. The judge 
relied on the 1993 law during Carmell's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas appeals court upheld Carmell's conviction, rejecting his  
argument that use of the 1993 law violated the Constitution's 
prohibition against retroactive laws. The state court said the new 
law was a rule of procedure that did not increase punishment or 
change the elements of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted review today, Carmell argued on his own  
behalf that the use of the 1993 law ``changed the rules of evidence 
against the accused to require less proof to convict him and ... 
deprived him of an acquittal that he would have otherwise been 
entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the 1993 law did not change the elements of the  
offense, but involved the type of evidence required for a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Carmell vs. Texas, 98-7540.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Tracks Plans Remodeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Saying he wants gritty Pimlico Race Course to  
look more like Churchill Downs, Maryland Jockey Club President 
Joseph DeFrancis unveiled a plan to renovate and upgrade the 
thoroughbred track and its sister facility in Laurel over the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Framed by architects' renderings of cheerful, green-gabled brick  
buildings looking more like Colonial Williamsburg than northwest 
Baltimore, DeFrancis said Monday he wants to make the aging horse 
track more like a Disney theme park, with clean facilities, 
friendly and informed employees and a host of family activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned $35 million facelift -- $18 million for Pimlico and  
$16.8 million for Laurel Park -- is part of a grand $60 million 
upgrade and expansion plan that would bring ``a fundamental change 
in the entertainment experience'' at the tracks, DeFrancis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the money would go toward marketing, expanding  
off-track betting parlors and ongoing capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Assembly required the jockey club to develop the  
plan in order to receive $10 million in state funding for 
thoroughbred racing purses. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was submitted to the General Assembly's Legislative  
Policy Committee, which will review it before passing it on to Gov. 
Parris Glendening for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the jockey club will pay for more than half the  
cost of renovating the parks by expanding off-track betting and 
investing in aggressive marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The jockey club is also considering an increase in the tracks'  
``takeout'' from bets, which would lower payouts to bettors. Tracks 
keep 20 cents of every dollar wagered. One proposal would raise the 
share to 21 or 21 1/2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrancis said he will ask the state to pay for the rest of the  
$60 million renovation, but said taxpayers won't bear the burden. 
The jockey club will ask the state to issue $27.5 million in 
revenue bonds, which are essentially loans from private investors, 
backed by the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes aren't affected and the state runs little risk since it  
requires a payback plan from the borrower.

<HEADLINE> Blood Vessel Caused Dierker Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The condition afflicting Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker  
stems from abnormal connections of arteries with veins in the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as arteriovenous malformation, it affects about 2 percent  
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, these tangled masses of blood vessels can cause  
seizures or bleeding into the brain, either a sudden hemorrhage or 
a slow leak, said Dr. Rafael Tamargo, co-director of Johns Hopkins 
University's division of cerebrovascular neurosurgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment has to be tailored to the precise kind of  
arteriovenous malformation, or AVM, that a patient has -- 
particularly its size and location in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	With surgery, doctors can remove the AVM. They use brain scans  
to pinpoint exactly where it is. All the blood vessels involved in 
the mass must be removed, ``or it will continue to pose a threat,'' 
Tamargo said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said patients who are good candidates for surgery have a very  
high cure rate, about 97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Large AVMs may require a procedure before surgery called  
embolization. Using a catheter, doctors snake inside the blood 
vessels feeding the mass and inject a glue to close part of the 
AVM, so that surgery to remove the mass is easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors also are using ``stereotactic radiosurgery,'' also  
known as a ``gamma knife'' surgery, to focus radiation directly 
onto the AVM and thus destroy it. This radiosurgery is reserved for 
very small AVMs, or those that are in a part of the brain not 
conducive to surgery, Tamargo said.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Move on Medical Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is set to move ahead on protecting  
the privacy of medical records, but after months of talks, major 
disagreement remains over patients' ability to sue for improper 
disclosure of their personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	There is broad agreement over the main point of the legislation,  
which would establish the first federal right to privacy over 
medical records. While many states have privacy laws, freely 
distributing someone's medical records is not against any federal 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions  
Committee is set for Tuesday, but even after months of talks, 
significant differences remain, and the chances for a bipartisan 
agreement seemed slim Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar dispute divides Republicans and Democrats over patient  
rights in dealing with HMOs and other managed care plans, with many 
Democrats wanting to let patients sue their insurance companies if 
care is denied. Most Republicans oppose allowing such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy debate is being driven by an August deadline. If  
Congress does not act by then, a law they passed in 1996 requires 
the Clinton administration to write its own regulations governing 
privacy. Critics of the administration's approach would prefer that 
Congress resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., the committee's chairman, has been  
trying to get broad support for a bill, hoping to avoid the 
partisan fighting that has dominated the HMO debate. His committee 
approved an HMO bill with no Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords has tried to balance Democrats, who want to give  
patients broad privacy rights, and Republicans, who want to be sure 
that businesses are not hampered by an overly strict law. 
</P>
<P>
	He has already twice postponed the committee vote on the privacy  
issue, and there were rumors Monday that it might be postponed 
again if a deal could not be reached on two outstanding issues: the 
right to sue and the privacy rights of minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee spokesman Joe Karpinski said he was still optimistic,  
saying, ``Some people are just pessimists and others have a sunny 
disposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are major hurdles to overcome.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will not support the bill as written, said Jim Manley,  
spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee's top 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	On the right to sue, Jeffords originally included language more  
acceptable to Democrats. But then conservative Republicans balked, 
led by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. So Jeffords tightened the 
provision to cap damages for pain and suffering at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require plaintiffs to prove in court that  
their records were released willfully and intentionally, a high 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are also angry at a provision that would give parents  
the right to see their children's medical records, even if the 
child sought medical attention independently. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states require doctors to give these records to parents.  
Democrats want to let doctors in other states withhold them if they 
see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	There are differences on other issues, but those were not  
serious enough for either side to oppose the bill, Senate aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues of contention, Jeffords' legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states two years to pass stricter privacy laws. After  
that, states could not pre-empt federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enable law enforcement officers to seize medical records  
without the patient's permission if they have a warrant or other 
court action ordering it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give medical researchers access to records without getting  
permission first.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another ``ER'' star is unsatisfied with his love  
life. 
</P>

	Noah Wyle, who plays Dr. John Carter, said he is unhappy about  
the uneven relationship this season between his character and

<HEADLINE> Machines To Help With Gene Sequence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New machines will enable the Department of  
Energy to triple its speed in decoding human genes and should 
enable the agency to reach its goal of sequencing 300 million base 
pairs of DNA by March. 
</P>
<P>
	Elbert Branscomb, director of the department's Joint Genome  
Institute, said that 24 new DNA sequencer machines to be installed 
at its Walnut Creek, Calif., lab will enable the agency to increase 
the number of base pairs processed monthly from about 5 million to 
about 15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The new machines, valued at about $5 million, were made by  
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech of Piscataway, N.J., and are being 
leased by the department. Twelve machines are already operating and 
another dozen are expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department is part of an international public team --  
including the National Institutes of Health and some European labs 
-- that is attempting to sequence, or put into proper order, all of 
the more than 3 billion pairs of DNA molecules that make up the 
human genome. 
</P>
<P>
	Within that genome are all of the 50,000 genes that control  
human physical characteristics. By identifying each of the genes, 
researchers hope to find new ways to treat or prevent many diseases 
and disorders. All of the DNA is contained within 23 pairs of 
chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is targeting human chromosome pairs 5, 16 and 19.  
These chromosomes contain about 300 million base pairs of DNA, 
about 10 percent of the entire genome. The three chromosome pairs 
are known to include genes linked to diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, cancer and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Branscomb said the Energy Department already has sequenced about  
30 million base pairs and that the new machines will enable the 
agency to reach its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate plan, he said, is to establish a ``draft'' of the  
human DNA sequences by next spring. Branscomb said researchers then 
will spend another two to three years refining the data so that the 
location, size and DNA sequence of each gene is known precisely.

<HEADLINE> Banks To End Sales to Telemarketers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big banks are coming under pressure to give up  
a lucrative part of their business, selling customers' personal 
data to telemarketers, as state officials and House lawmakers take 
tough actions aimed at protecting financial privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, one of the nation's largest, said Friday it  
would no longer share any customer information with outside vendors 
-- a move welcomed by federal regulators but criticized by consumer 
groups as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time that banks need to make a decision'' on  
whether their privacy practices are appropriate, John Byrne, senior 
counsel for the American Bankers Association, said Monday. ``We 
would certainly encourage banks to examine their practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several banking industry groups plan to meet next month to come  
up with a coordinated approach to financial privacy proposals now 
before Congress, said Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial 
Services Roundtable. Bartlett, a Republican, is a former U.S. 
representative from Texas and former mayor of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's move came two days after Minnesota's attorney  
general sued U.S. Bancorp, the largest bank based in the state, 
alleging that it illegally sold customer data to a telemarketing 
firm and pocketed $4 million in commissions -- while promising 
customers in writing that their account information would be kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the California state attorney's office announced  
last week that it would investigate the privacy practices of banks 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, which now includes NationsBank Corp., is based  
in Charlotte, N.C., but maintains branch operations in its former 
home state of California. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a surprise move in Congress, the House Commerce Committee  
adopted a measure last Thursday that would allow consumers to stop 
banks, securities firms and other financial service companies from 
sharing their personal data with affiliated or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy measure was attached to sweeping legislation to  
remove Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies. The full House is expected to vote on the 
package in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's move ``shows how much the banks are under  
pressure,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for 
U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ``The tide is starting to 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid mergers of big banks and marriages of other financial  
services companies, public concern about financial privacy has 
grown. Consumer activists such as Ralph Nader have warned that 
privacy risks for Americans have increased as banks, brokerages and 
insurers compile profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and 
health data. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr.,  
who oversees nationally chartered banks, denounced what he called 
abusive sales by some institutions of customers' personal data to 
telemarketing firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law doesn't prohibit banks from selling customers'  
personal data, but prohibits the sharing of information obtained 
from a third party, such as a credit bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks often provide the data -- such as addresses, phone numbers,  
birth dates, Social Security numbers, and checking and credit card 
account information -- to telemarketing firms and other companies in 
exchange for commissions on sales to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the U.S. Bancorp case was the bank's alleged  
practice of sharing both bank customers' information and data from 
credit bureaus with telemarketers. In addition, one telemarketing 
firm allegedly ``slammed'' some U.S. Bancorp customers, charging 
them for unauthorized purchases by deducting money from their 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Bank of America's decision, Julie Williams, chief  
counsel in Hawke's office and his predecessor as comptroller, said, 
``We commend the bank for announcing these changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mierzwinski and Mary Griffin, counsel for Consumers Union,  
maintained that Bank of America's action was insufficient because 
the bank pledged not to share customer data only with those 
companies that sell products and services to the bank's customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new prohibition doesn't cover other outside companies, such  
as those that assemble information databases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still doesn't give consumers control,'' Ms. Griffin said.  
``It's still not stopping the hemorrhaging of information that gets 
out there.''

<HEADLINE> Griffey Still Leads AL Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Ken Griffey Jr. remained the overall  
leader among AL players in voting for next month's All-Star game in 
Boston, Derek Jeter maintained his slight lead over Nomar 
Garciaparra at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle star leads outfielders with 847,412 votes, followed  
by Manny Ramirez (437,075) and Kenny Lofton (383,941) of the 
Cleveland Indians. Another Cleveland player, David Justice, was 
fourth (288,86), followed by Bernie Williams of the New York 
Yankees (247,316). 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was the AL's leading vote-getter in 1991 and 1993 and  
led all players in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Indians maintained leads at their positions: first  
baseman Jim Thome (220,553) and second baseman Roberto Alomar 
(702,016). 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's Cal Ripken, who had the first six-hit game of his  
career Sunday night at Atlanta, leads at third base (309,345) and 
is on track for his 17th consecutive All-Star start. He is hitting 
.367 (40-for-109) since returning to the lineup May 13, raising his 
season average to .328 going into Monday's night games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, the top hitter on the World Series champion New York  
Yankees, leads his Boston rival 247,020 to 232,056 at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez of Texas (523,457) leads at catcher, and Jose  
Canseco of Tampa Bay (447,262), who began the day tied with Griffey 
for the major league lead in home runs at 23, topped designated 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game is scheduled for July 13 at Boston's Fenway  
Park. AL starters will be announced July 5, and NL starters the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
	An update on NL totals will be released Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Wants Prison Hitching Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman has asked a federal  
judge to allow Alabama to again become the only state that 
handcuffs inmates to hitching posts when they refuse to work. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled last year that the way  
the state was using the posts -- leaving inmates in the sun for 
hours without water or restroom breaks -- was unconstitutionally 
cruel. But he allowed the state to try to devise a constitutional 
method. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Haley, Siegelman's prison commissioner, said he believes  
the new policy proposed by the state Department of Corrections is 
constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes videotape monitoring of the posts to make sure  
inmates get hourly water and restroom breaks, and it allows an 
inmate to be unhitched the moment he agrees to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was to hear testimony today from two guards who  
volunteered to spend nearly four hours shackled to a hitching post. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmate attorney Rhonda Brownstein argued during a court hearing  
Monday that except for the videotaping, the Siegelman policy 
differs little from the one used during Gov. Fob James' 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restraining people this way is a form of corporal punishment  
and violates the Constitution,'' Brownstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The posts are chest-high metal bars with metal rings on them  
that are placed outside in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials contend the post is an incentive to work and  
that inmates shackled to it are no more uncomfortable than inmates 
working on the prison farms or picking up trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather conditions, the sunlight conditions, should be  
virtually the same as the work squad,'' said Ralph Hooks Jr., 
warden at Limestone Correctional Center near Capshaw.

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Tops Courier in Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Don't let the gray hair on John McEnroe's  
head fool you, warned Jim Courier. The 40-year-old McEnroe proved 
he can still play a pretty good game of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier learned that lesson the hard way Monday, losing in  
straight sets to McEnroe, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 in the Nike Hall of Fame 
Challenge at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't use Grecian Formula, but he never misses a  
volley,'' said a grinning Courier at the conclusion of the 
grass-court exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe clearly appreciated the compliment. But he said he was  
not sure Courier, 28 years old and ranked 60th in the world, had 
given the match his all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was totally taking it easy on me, but he was  
throwing the old man a bone a little bit,'' said McEnroe, who will 
be inducted into the Hall of Fame July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player could manage a service break in the first set.  
Trailing 6-5, McEnroe forced the tiebreaker by battling to a win in 
the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
	After edging Courier in the tiebreaker, McEnroe held serve in  
the second set and broke Courier's serve in the eighth game, 
winning 6-3.

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Tops Courier in Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Don't let the gray hair on John McEnroe's  
head fool you, warned Jim Courier. The 40-year-old McEnroe proved 
he can still play a pretty good game of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier learned that lesson the hard way Monday, losing in  
straight sets to McEnroe, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 in the Nike Hall of Fame 
Challenge at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't use Grecian Formula, but he never misses a  
volley,'' said a grinning Courier at the conclusion of the 
grass-court exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe clearly appreciated the compliment. But he said he was  
not sure Courier, 28 years old and ranked 60th in the world, had 
given the match his all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was totally taking it easy on me, but he was  
throwing the old man a bone a little bit,'' said McEnroe, who will 
be inducted into the Hall of Fame July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player could manage a service break in the first set.  
Trailing 6-5, McEnroe forced the tiebreaker by battling to a win in 
the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
	After edging Courier in the tiebreaker, McEnroe held serve in  
the second set and broke Courier's serve in the eighth game, 
winning 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Giants Release Wooten, Buckley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants released  
veteran defensive backs Tito Wooten and Curtis Buckley Monday, 
saying they had to make room under the salary cap to sign younger 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Wooten will free up a reported $1.1 million for the  
Giants and give the 27-year-old a chance to court other offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things you have no control over. The Giants had  
to do what was in their best interest,'' Wooten said. ``I view this 
as an opportunity to re-establish myself in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wooten, a fourth-round draft choice in 1994, made 13 starts at  
free safety last season, coming up with 74 tackles and three sacks. 
He played on special teams before moving into the starting lineup 
in 1996. His best season was 1997, when he recorded 90 tackles and 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wooten has been criticized for poor conditioning and  
off-field behavior. His girlfriend committed suicide last year, a 
month after dropping charges against him of simple assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Williams, the Giants' first-round draft choice in 1998,  
will compete for the starting free safety position with Percy 
Ellsworth, who has 12 interceptions in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the moves today because you can see that some things  
are going to happen down the road,'' coach Jim Fassel said. ``These 
are two veterans, and we wanted to give them a chance to catch on 
somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley, 28, joined the Giants last season after being waived by  
San Francisco on Nov. 12. He had five special teams tackles in six 
games with the Giants. He spent his first three NFL seasons in 
Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> N.D. Man Wins 'Think-Off' Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK MILLS, Minn. (AP) -- Mark Friestad said it, the audience  
believed it, and that settled it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old high school social studies teacher from Valley  
City, N.D., won the Great American Think-Off on Saturday with a 
convincing spiel that science is more dangerous than religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to overwhelmingly convince the audience where blind  
faith in science can prove dangerous for people's ability to reason 
for themselves,'' said Jolie Sasseville, who coordinated the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh annual event featured debate between four finalists  
selected from about 500 argumentative essays submitted from around 
the world. The Think-Off audience then selected a winner, who 
receives $500 and a contract from an educational book publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Friestad cited the early 1900s eugenics movement, which  
hypothesized the human gene pool could be improved if weak links 
were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That led to public policy like sterilizing handicapped  
people,'' he said. ``We accepted that because scientists told us it 
was so. And anytime you have to rely on someone else to do your 
thinking for you, that's dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> Qwest Bids Billions for Telecom Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Qwest's bold bid Sunday to acquire U S West Inc.  
and Frontier Corp. lost some of its luster today as investors 
pummeled Qwest's stock, reducing the value of the initial $55 
billion deal to $43 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's unsolicited proposals aim to break up the two companies'  
agreements to be acquired by Global Crossing Inc., and could start 
a bidding war between Qwest and Global Crossing. The two companies 
are fighting to be the first to build a global network of 
high-speed fiber optic cables that will bring consumers and 
businesses a host of video, audio and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance  
telephone company, also offers Internet and data communications 
services to businesses and consumers. The deal would give Qwest a 
piece of the local phone markets in 14 western states with the 
addition of the Denver-based Baby Bell U S West. It would 
strengthen Qwest's long-distance business with the addition of 
Rochester, N.Y.-based Frontier, the No. 5 long-distance company, 
which also has local phone, cellular, paging and Internet 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Even combined, however, the companies would still be less than  
half the size of AT&AMP;T Corp., the country's largest long-distance 
phone and cable company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Qwest's investors reacted negatively to the deal, sending  
the company's stock down 20 percent, or by $9.06 1/4, to $35.81 1/4 a 
share in midday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in Qwest's stock price will significantly dull the  
appeal of the company's plans to print more shares to pay for U S 
West and Frontier. Qwest offered 1.738 shares of its stock, worth 
$62.24 in today's trading, for U S West. For Frontier, Qwest 
offered $20 a share in cash and 1.181 shares of stock, worth 
$42.29, for a total value of $62.29. Both bids will be sweetened 
slightly if both companies agree to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's offer, which originally represented a hefty premium to  
Global Crossing's bid, is now worth less. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, a Bermuda-based company with plans to link the  
world's continents with high-speed fiber optic cables, is offering 
$63 in cash and stock for Frontier and about $63 in stock for U S 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest chairman and chief executive officer,  
sent letters to the heads of U S West and Frontier Sunday, saying, 
``Given the clear superiority of our offer to the proposed Global 
Crossing merger, we would like to meet with you and your advisors 
as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West and Frontier both said they would review the offers and  
declined to comment further. Officials from Global Crossing 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. Companies are hoping that 
the next generation of high-speed Internet technologies will link 
more homes and businesses, providing a wealth of new opportunities 
to sell goods and provide information and entertainment. These 
hopes have prompted telecom and cable companies to make big bets on 
mergers so they can gain the size and market share that will be 
keys to new profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new companies like Qwest and Global Crossing are  
building state-of-the-art fiber optic networks which are the key to 
the future of a communications company, but they don't have the 
customers or revenues yet,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent 
telecom analyst. ``On the other hand, companies like U S West and 
Frontier have the older networks but they have the customers and 
revenue. So it's natural for the two of them to get together,'' 
Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. won a bidding war with cable TV company  
Comcast for MediaOne Group Inc., another cable company. AT&AMP;T, the 
nation's largest long distance company, is gambling that television 
cables will also be the way to carry Internet, voice and data 
traffic in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Other telecom companies such as Qwest and U S West are banking  
on an alternative high-speed Internet technology that uses 
traditional telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest is successful in its takeover quest, the combined  
company would have revenues of $22 billion in 2000 and serve 31 
million customers. Currently, Qwest has just $2.24 billion in 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest estimates the united company could save as much as $11.1  
billion in operating costs and capital investments, and generate up 
to $3.1 billion in sales as it expands local telephone service as 
well as data and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a heady undertaking, and not without risks. Global  
Crossing, or another telephone company, could raise the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We entered this planning to win,'' Nacchio said in an  
interview. ``That will remain unchanged, irrespective of anyone 
else's entering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest's offer is accepted by U S West, the company's chairman  
and chief executive officer, Solomon D. Trujillo, would be invited 
to become the vice chairman of Qwest. Trujillo and three other U S 
West directors would also be asked to join Qwest's board. 
</P>
<P>
	For Frontier, Qwest is offering two seats on its board,  
including one for Joseph P. Clayton, Frontier's chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's stock rose $3.31 1/4, or by 5 percent, to $58/18 3/4 by  
midday on the New York Stock Exchange, where Frontier's shares 
jumped $2.93 3/4, or 5 percent, to $58.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> FX Targets Male Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was five years ago this month when cable's FX  
-- or fX, as it was known then -- signed on. With the slogan 
``Television Made Fresh Daily,'' it specialized in live talk piped 
from its apartment-like studio and it welcomed interaction from its 
viewers. Women viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ``Breakfast Time'' and ``Personal fX'' are long gone. So are  
repeats of ``Hart to Hart'' and ``Eight Is Enough.'' So, for that 
matter, are the gals. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, FX -- all capitals now -- is angling for the young men in  
its 39 million cable homes. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's after something else, something the Fox-owned network  
has yet to nail: a bold, widely recognized identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think FX is wavering in the viewer's mind: What exactly is  
FX?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Peter Liguori talking. He's the president of FX, which  
this summer is introducing a slate of new series aimed at settling 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to brand the network,'' says Liguori, ``and the best  
way to brand it is by creating original programming that supports 
some kind of a position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most notable entry is ``The X Show,'' a weeknight  
talk-and-information hour that is by, for and about guys. It began 
June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	What kind of position does ``The X Show'' support?  
</P>
<P>
	``The mindset commonly held by a younger male audience, 18 to  
34,'' declares Liguori, who, having exited that market segment just 
three birthdays ago, still knows it when he sees it. ``They're 
savvy, cynical, and they want their entertainment in an unabashed 
format.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unabashed is what ``The X Show'' means to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``Half of life is knowing the rules -- and the other half  
involves ointment,'' quipped Mark DeCarlo on the show's opening 
night. DeCarlo, who used to emcee the syndicated game show 
``Studs,'' is one of four regular-guy hosts who keep ``The X Show'' 
focused on the Big Four regular-guy topics: money, games, sex and 
savoir-faire. No time for ointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty straightforward, huh? Even so, the gospel of ``The X  
Show'' -- and FX overall -- could initially be garbled by this week's 
premiere of ``The Man Show'' on Comedy Central (Wednesday at 10:30 
p.m. EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	But there need be no confusion between the two new series. ``X''  
is a talk show devoted to the tricks of the trade of being a guy; 
``Man'' is a guy comedy. ``X'' evokes a rec room, ``Man'' a locker 
room (and sometimes bathroom). ``X'' astutely mirrors guyhood, 
whatever that means, while ``Man'' is a fun-house mirror of 
guy-grotesquerie. Funny, yes, and about as representative of males 
as ``South Park'' (which ``The Man Show'' shrewdly follows) is 
emblematic of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Another difference between the two shows: ``Man'' features  
members of the fairer sex bouncing on trampolines -- and, hey, who 
doesn't like trampolines! But that's not the kind of bounce Liguori 
wanted for FX. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over as president last August, he inherited its  
initial wave of series whose spirit, if not always their execution, 
reflected the network's new sense of itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City Spectacular'' (Friday at 10 p.m. EDT)  
Liguori sums up as ``the anti-variety show, and Penn and Teller are 
the anti-magicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, he calls ``Bobcat'' (Saturday night at 1:30 a.m.)  
``the anti-game show,'' and ``Instant Comedy With the Groundlings'' 
(Sunday night at 1:30 a.m. EDT) ``the anti-comedy show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All three shows have what we like to call -- and I'm going to  
challenge your gag reflex with this turn of phrase -- `antitude,''' 
Liguori says. ``Antitude means: If there's a convention out there, 
we're gonna take it, we're gonna turn it on its ear, we're gonna 
dissect it, and then take it from another angle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Liguori launched the highly antitudinous, and often  
very funny ``Fast-Food Films'' (Sunday at 12 midnight EDT), whose 
half-hour episodes take three well-known feature films and edit 
each into an entirely different cinematic send-up. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 20, FX introduces the animated ``Dick and Paula  
Celebrity Special,'' a wry weekly look at husband-and-wife 
talk-show hosts who interview famous people, living and dead. It 
comes from the producer of Comedy Central's droll ``Dr. Katz: 
Professional Therapist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on July 23, FX debuts weekly ``World Toughman  
Championships.'' Enough said about that. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of all it's ``The X Show'' putting the network's  
testosterone crusade to the test. Success, predicts Liguori, will 
come from that show's unabashed honesty: 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's picking stocks, if it's tipping a stripper, if it's  
talking politics, if it's talking about dating -- just be honest and 
the audience will relate to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no one will mind if they leave the seat up.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> House Passes Bond Opening Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators would be required to  
make price information on corporate bonds as widely available as 
data about stocks and government bonds under a bill the House 
passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such information would make the market more competitive and  
enable investors to shop around for the best prices, said sponsors 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the measure, which passed  
the House 332-1 and advanced to the Senate for further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, bond dealers are not obligated to reveal their  
selling prices, which means they can sell the same bond to 
different people for different prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, cited the case of two investors who bought identical 
bonds at a 6 percent difference -- an amount that he said can amount 
to almost a full year's worth of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for this is that there exists no mechanism to  
provide investors with bond prices, like the ticker that investors 
see every day for stock prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to use  
the authority it has had since 1975 to adopt rules to make the 
pricing system more open, thus increasing competition and improving 
prices for all investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bonds are considered integral to stock market  
performance since it is difficult to make decisions about a 
company's stock without accurate data on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike stocks, the vast majority of bonds are not traded in a  
central market. They are bought and sold over the telephone by a 
relatively small group of dealers that includes major brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1400.

<HEADLINE> ebay Stock Plunges After Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Business was buzzing on Internet auction  
site eBay on Monday, but that didn't prevent investors for pushing 
the company's stock down 18 percent as fallout continued from last 
week's 22-hour outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of EBay dropped $29.87 1/2 to $136 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market, the first trading day since eBay said it would refund 
fees for all active auctions from Thursday and Friday, costing it 
between $3 million to $5 million in second-quarter revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the popular auction house, which has attracted more  
than 3 million users in 50 countries, are now down more than 43 
percent from the $234 high reached in April. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay engineers joined technicians from Sun Microsystems Inc. and  
Oracle Corp. to figure out what went wrong and how to make sure the 
site doesn't crash again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've marshaled virtually every resource in the company to  
make sure we provide a stable system for our users,'' said eBay 
vice president Steve Westly. 
</P>
<P>
	Westly and about 200 other eBay employees and managers spent  
Monday trying to personally call 10,000 eBay users to ``listen to 
their perspective,'' said Westly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had massive data corruption caused by Sun software,''  
said Westly. ``That's all we know for certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site went down late Thursday evening and was not functioning  
again until Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	E-commerce analyst Jill Frankle at International Data Corp. in  
Framingham, Mass., compared eBay's current problems to 
technological struggles AOL, and later ETrade faced, as they were 
overloaded with users. 
</P>
<P>
	``These glitches are characteristic of the growth a lot of the  
Internet companies are experiencing,'' she said. ``These business 
models are based on technology. This shows us what can happen when 
something doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bernstein, a research analyst at Gartner Group in  
Stamford, Conn., said that in the grand scheme of things, eBay's 
recent technical and investor problems are relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fiasco like this that will force a company to really  
fix the problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fixes may come too late for some eBay users.  
</P>
<P>
	Paul Gregg, a computer engineer in Inglewood, Fla., said Monday  
that it's time to check out Yahoo! and Amazon, competing online 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said he was trying to auction a computer for about $5,000  
this weekend, but eBay cut the last 40 minutes off his auction, 
which is usually the most active time. He had to sell it for 
$4,000, and pay eBay a $65 listing fee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things go wrong there, they go really wrong,'' said  
Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed Sibley, of Lewisberg, Penn., who breeds and races  
quarterhorses and sells everything from movie cameras to hand tools 
on eBay, said he believes the company has a sound future, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see the word failure written anywhere near eBay,'' he  
said. ``There are plenty of people making a living off this, for 
crying out loud, and they're not going to go away.''

<HEADLINE> Off DL, Ripken Ripping the Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken woke up Monday morning wondering  
whether the finest performance of his outstanding baseball career 
was merely a figment of his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken set a Baltimore Orioles record by getting six hits in a  
game Sunday night, hitting two homers and a double in a 6-for-6 
effort against the Atlanta Braves. He then boarded a chartered 
flight and arrived home around 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few hours sleep, Ripken opened his eyes and immediately  
had a horrid thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wake up and wonder if it actually did happen or you just  
dreamed it happened. It's nice to know it did happen,'' Ripken said 
Monday afternoon. ``It's a pretty darn good feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record-breaking night was the consummation of a remarkable  
stretch in which he has added 149 points to his batting average 
while moving significantly closer to reaching 400 homers and 3,000 
hits over his 19-year career. He had 391 homers and 2,923 hits 
before the Orioles played Kansas City on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, best known for playing in 2,632 consecutive games, was  
batting .179 on April 20 before being placed on the disabled list 
for the first time in his career with a strained lower back. At the 
time he was also wrestling with feelings related to the death of 
his father, Cal Sr., who succumbed to lung cancer on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, there was a lot of benefit of being on the  
disabled list. It was a good break for me mentally and a necessary 
break physically,'' Ripken said. ``So when I came back, I was armed 
with a little bit better focus, a clearer head. And physically, I 
felt great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you learn the most from some of your not-so-nice  
experiences,'' he said. ``The obstacles that were in the way, I've 
been able to step over them and step around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning from the disabled list on May 13, Ripken hit  
safely in 22 of 26 games, batting .367 over that span to raise his 
batting average from .179 to .328. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference goes far beyond the new stance he broke out last  
month. Ripken valiantly attempted to play with pain in his lower 
back and anguish in his heart, but it was a futile effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire just wasn't there,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said.  
``Now he's having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Terry Crowley, who played under Ripken Sr. and has  
known the younger Ripken for years, realized early in spring 
training that Cal just didn't have his usual zest for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his actions, his personality and I know right away when  
Cal is feeling good. When he's feeling good, he's got a lot of 
energy and is fun to be around,'' Crowley said. ``When he's a 
little quiet, you know something's bothering him. I saw spurts of 
energy from him, but it wasn't a normal spring for Cal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, admittedly, Sunday wasn't a normal night for Ripken. His 13  
total bases tied his career high, the five runs scored set a team 
mark and it was the first time he had as many as five hits in a 
game since May 5, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like the ball was looking bigger than normal and coming  
in a little slower, even though the speed gun said differently,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His recent surge might turn out to be worth millions to him.  
Ripken's contract states that the Orioles must decide by the 
All-Star break whether to exercise his $6.3 million option for next 
season, or pay him $2.5 million with a chance to re-sign him at a 
lesser salary. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Ripken looks like a steal at $6.3 million a year,  
even if he does turn 39 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did last night was sort of a culmination,'' Orioles  
first baseman Will Clark said. ``By no means was it a fluke. He's 
been swinging the bat well for weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana Energy, Sigcorp Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The parents of Indiana Gas Co. and Southern  
Indiana Gas and Electric Co. plan to merge in an exchange of stock 
valued at $1.4 billion to create a company with more than 650,000 
customers in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	If the shareholders of Indiana Energy Inc. and Sigcorp Inc.  
approve the merger announced today, a new holding company will be 
created called Vectren Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The energy industry is converging and successful participants  
will be able to offer a broad array of products and services to 
customers,'' said Niel C. Ellerbrook, president and chief executive 
of Indiana Energy, based in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerbrook will be chairman and CEO of the combined company and  
Andrew Goebel, president of chief operating officer of 
Evansville-based Sigcorp, will hold the same positions with 
Vectren. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination,'' Goebel said, ``will allow us to cross-sell  
a greater array of products and services to our existing and future 
customer base and to make the necessary investment in technology to 
continue delivering first-class customer service in an increasingly 
competitive environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' current chairmen, Indiana Energy's L.A. Ferger  
and Sigcorp's Ronald Reherman, will retire upon completion of the 
merger but join Ellerbrook and Goebel on Vectren's board of 
directors. Each company will appoint six other directors to the 
16-member board. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of each of the companies will contol about 50  
percent of Vectren's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the merger to save them $200  
million over 10 years by eliminating duplicate corporate and 
administrative functions and through greater efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	They expect to eliminate 120 of their combined 1,850 jobs, or  
less than 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Indiana Energy shareholders will exchange  
one share in the current company for one share of Vectren. Sigcorp 
shareholders will receive 1.33 shares in the new company for each 
share of Sigcorp they hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will also have $500 million in debt and  
subsidiary preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be based in Evansville, which also will  
remain home to Southern Indiana Gas and Electric headquarters. 
Indiana Gas operations will remain based in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies already are partners in Energy Systems LLC, a  
two-year-old company providing energy-related contracting services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerbrook said that the 2003, Vectren's goal is to for  
non-regulated operations to contribute 25 percent of earnings and 
for earnings per share to grow on average by 10 percent per year.

<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mike Colangelo, making his major league  
debut, was hurt in a collision in the outfield Sunday in the 
seventh inning of the Anaheim Angels' game against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was taken to UC Irvine Medical Center with a high back  
injury and an injured left wrist, Angels spokesman Tim Mead said. A 
preliminary examination revealed no serious neck injury. Colangelo 
was put in a neck brace and underwent a CT scan, which was 
negative. He will be re-examined Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, playing left, and center fielder Reggie Williams were  
both running full speed for a fly in the gap hit by Steve Finley. 
Williams caught the ball and immediately crashed into Colangelo, 
who lay on the field for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Angels trainers tended to Colangelo, who was placed on an  
immobilizing board for precautionary and taken off the field on a 
medical cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, 22, was just called up from Anaheim's Triple-A  
Edmonton farm team and singled in the first inning. He walked and 
grounded out his next two times up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hitting .362, with 13 runs scored and nine RBIs in 26  
games at Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Man-Made Diamonds Fool Gem Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marilyn Monroe once sang that diamonds are a  
girl's best friend. What would she have called moissanites? 
</P>
<P>
	The lab-created stones can be dead ringers for high-quality  
diamonds, stumping many jewelers' instruments that tell real stones 
from fake. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the gems debuted commercially a year ago, pawnbrokers and  
jewelry dealers across the country have gotten swindled, paying top 
dollar for moissanites they believed were the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn with your own money,'' said Hampy Antonian, owner of  
Ritz Jewelers in Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Antonian paid $1,300 for a stone that weighed less  
than a carat. Moissanites, a carbon crystal like diamonds, usually 
sell for just under one-tenth the cost of their more prestigious 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonian showed the find to other jewelers, one of whom  
suspected the stone might not be a diamond. He then tested it. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I felt like I was dumb,'' said Antonian, who has 15  
years of experience as a jeweler. ``But these are the problems of 
the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moissanites occur in nature -- as green, brown or black  
microscopic deposits. Chemist Henri Moissan discovered them in a 
meteorite in Arizona's Diablo Canyon in 1893. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, Cree Research, a Durham, N.C. company, figured  
out how to make moissanites for industrial use as semi-conductors, 
precision blades and screens for calculators and laptop computers. 
The azure glow in the dashboards of Volkswagen's New Beetles comes 
from the stones. 
</P>
<P>
	The company developed a patented version of moissanites in 1995,  
and they appeared commercially in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jewelers and gemologists say they can tell moissanites  
right away because they have a greenish cast and show regular 
striations that don't resemble normal flaws in a diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moissanites are almost plastic-looking,'' said Dennis Dufau, a  
partner in Estate Jewelry Buyers of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But others not as knowledgeable in gems have had less luck.  
Moissanites have duped pawnbrokers, for one. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my stores got hit for $1,000,'' said Kyle Farson, owner  
of First National Pawn in High Point, N.C. ``The stone that I got 
was about 1.25 carats. It was in an engagement ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mack, who owns First Class Pawn and Jewelry in Las  
Vegas, said well-dressed hockers trying to pass the stones off as 
real diamonds hit several stores in a city at once. They pushed the 
stones across the counter and called them family heirlooms, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play the part, but we do our tests,'' Mack said.  
</P>
<P>
	C3, the Morrisville-based company that is the sole manufacturer  
and marketer of moissanites, says it wants to position the stones 
as gems in their own right, not diamond impostors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has tried to guard against fraud by requiring  
dealers to make clear the stones are man-made, limiting outlets to 
about 130 jewelers nationwide, and requiring them to sell the 
stones in settings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Farson said he has heard of hockers getting caught with bags  
full of loose moissanites. ``The problem is there's no follow-up,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with few dealers, C3 ships about 18,000 carats of  
moissanite a year, said company spokeswoman Jessica Blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue said company officials wanted the stones to hit the market  
in 1997. But they put on the brakes when they realized that because 
moissanites conduct heat like diamonds, they can fool thermal 
probes used to tell the difference between real and fake diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The company developed a device to screen for moissanites and  
contacted the Gemological Institute of America. Some dealers have 
contended that the stones are merely a marketing ploy to sell the 
testers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blue said the company's profits from the sale of the stone  
far exceed the profits from the device: about $3 million in 
revenues from the stones vs. $160,000 for the tester in the first 
quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Armed Man Arrested Near Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- A man who was arrested early today in a  
courthouse parking lot with an assault rifle, ammunition and 
bomb-making materials told police he planned to confront a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind this man intended violence,''  
police Sgt. Paul Laney said. ``The statement he made was that he 
was there to speak with the judge, but he also said he was going to 
shoot up the courthouse and anyone else that got in his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey D. Maasjo, 23, was arrested and faces charges of  
terrorizing and carrying a loaded gun in his vehicle. He remained 
jailed Monday pending a preliminary court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officers approached Maasjo sitting alone in his car at about  
1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents show Maasjo pleaded guilty earlier this month to  
disorderly conduct for pulling a knife on a deputy sheriff, who was 
attempting to arrest him for being absent without leave from the 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Maasjo told police Monday he was upset that the sheriff's  
department refused to return his knife and, ``he said he was going 
to take that up with the judge,'' Laney said.

<HEADLINE> Boy Convicted in Death of Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-age boy who beat and kicked  
a gay man to death for calling him ``beautiful'' was convicted 
Monday of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Donahue, 17, could get life in prison for the slaying of  
Steven Goedereis, a waiter who was beaten beyond recognition in 
1998 outside a convenience store. Donahue kicked him 20 times in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue's lawyer, Joe Atterbury, had argued that the boy was  
motivated by fear of sexual assault, not by hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 29-year-old man advanced on and selected a 16-year-old  
boy,'' Atterbury said. ``When the boy strikes back, the state now 
says that's a hate crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury took just an hour to find Donahue guilty. Sentencing  
was set for Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury also weighed murder charges against Donahue's  
friend Billy Dodge, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's half over,'' said Steven Goedereis, the victim's father.  
``There's no winners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Goedereis was walking home after a party  
when he saw Donahue, who also was walking alone after drinking with 
friends. Goedereis called the boy ``beautiful,'' infuriating 
Donahue, prosecutor Renelda Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy started to walk away but turned around and punched  
Goedereis, demanding money and taking his knapsack, Mack told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue then ran back to the friends he had just left nearby and  
returned with Dodge to find the 118-pound Goedereis. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the defendant had to do was continue walking away,'' Mack  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atterbury claimed the boy was frightened when he went back to  
his friends and said, ``Someone just tried to rape me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goedereis was kicked so severely that the sole of a sneaker was  
imprinted on his forehead. He died two days after the attack.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T: Cable To Allow More Offerings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cable companies are poised to provide all the  
communications offerings consumers desire and should be given free 
rein to do so, AT&AMP;T Corp.'s chief executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Michael Armstrong, who opened the National Cable Television  
Association's annual meeting here, said he is betting his company's 
success on its ability to provide a host of services, including 
super-fast Internet access, phone lines and interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving toward a single information opportunity,''  
Armstrong said. ``Technology, applications and devices are 
converging. Customers are simply going to get more and pay less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has made more than $100 billion in cable purchases over the  
past year, including its acquisitions of Tele-Communications Inc. 
and MediaOne Group. That vaulted it into the position of the 
nation's leading cable company, followed by Time Warner and 
Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	As the convention highlighted technologies that will open the  
Internet to new commerce, information and entertainment services, 
Armstrong argued that federal regulators should not interfere with 
companies that provide access. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors, including local telephone companies and Internet  
services like America Online have argued that cable companies 
should be required to sell them access to cable customers at 
wholesale prices, just as local phone companies must now sell 
access to their customers to long-distance companies.

	``Most people don't get to be called a queen,'' she said. ``I

<HEADLINE> IOC To Open Its General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first time, reporters will be  
allowed to see the International Olympic Committee at work. But 
they still won't be allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a commitment to openness in the wake of its worst  
scandal, the IOC announced Monday that its four-day session in 
Seoul would be carried live to reporters via closed-circuit 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board said it decided to open the meetings on the  
recommendation of its new IOC 2000 reform commission, which was 
created following the Salt Lake City vote-buying case. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said the committee was  
satisfied with open meetings of the world anti-doping conference in 
February and of the reform panel earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings of the ruling executive board will remain behind  
closed doors, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the deliberations of many national parliaments are  
open to the public, while those of government cabinets are normally 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have opposed the idea of opening the sessions  
on grounds that it would inhibit debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 109th IOC session opens Thursday and members will hear  
reports from organizing committees of the 2000 Sydney Games and 
2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. On Saturday, the IOC will select 
the host city for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new system, the assembly will elect a 16-member panel  
that will choose two finalists from the field of six European 
cities. Then the full membership will choose the winner by secret 
ballot.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Team Boasts of Chemistry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- They shout encouragement to each  
other, even when they're on opposing sides during a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	There's never been a report of jealousy or backbiting.  
</P>
<P>
	The veterans look at the newcomers the way professors observe  
prodigies. Thirty-somethings room with youngsters barely into their 
20s. Longtime members of the team pal around with rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the U.S. women's soccer team. It's also, according to  
the members of one of the favorites for the World Cup that begins 
Saturday, a great big happy family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exactly,'' Carla Overbeck said Monday after the Americans'  
first practice session of the final week before they open the 
tournament at Giants Stadium against Denmark. ``This is a unique 
group of people and we know whenever there are new players, it 
boosts the talent of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The younger players have to step up and accept a role, and  
realize that everyone is as important as the next one. It's a true 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a family, because we've watched each other grow up,  
and we're all close. This is the situation that is going to make 
this team get better and possibly win the World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans did just that in 1991 in China, then finished  
third in the 1995 championships. They used the '95 disappointment 
as a catalyst to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, there has been no discord among the women's team  
members. Contrast that with the men's national team, which 
self-destructed during last year's World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's huge,'' coach Tony DiCicco said of the camaraderie.  
``In many ways it's a factor in our success. The challenge of this 
World Cup is very high and the opportunities are equally high. This 
team is so close that hopefully it will factor in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to develop that. We let them know when they join the  
team, they need to make a contribution to the chemistry. We say, 
`You must contribute, or you'll be part of a problem.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	So they contribute. Danielle Fotopoulos set career scoring  
records while at the University of Florida. Then she moved up to 
the national squad, where she is one of many bigtime players -- and, 
for now, filling a supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``The veterans who molded the team let the people coming in know  
they have got to fit into the chemistry they've worked so hard to 
create,'' Fotopoulos said. ``Plus, they make everything fun for us. 
Practice is fun. We hang out together and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be very intimidating coming into any new team,  
especially one with the success rate the U.S. has had. You don't 
know where you will fit in or the personalities on the team. If 
these were not cool people who cared, it could be a nightmare. 
Instead, it's so special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the means used to create team unity is to switch  
roommates throughout training and during trips for games. Most of 
the veterans have roomed with most of the kids on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During practice, DiCicco mixes youth and experience, whether it  
be for 4-on-4 minigames, or for full scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	The players also consult sports psychologist Coleen Hacker, whom  
Kristine Lilly -- the most experienced U.S. player, with 179 
international appearances -- says is ``a source to vent, if we need 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no negative mentality around the team,'' Lilly added.  
``We're taught different ways to get out of it when we are down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that this team often gets down, on the scoreboard or away  
from the arena. But if it does, the chemistry developed in a decade 
of partnership seems to carry the Americans through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess there is a bond there in the female game,'' Lilly  
said. ``We enjoy each other. We've all been in positions where we 
were the new player coming in. It can be difficult to reach out to 
players. But we all do a great job of opening doors.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Monday, with  
the key indexes falling in Tokyo and Seoul but rising in Hong Kong 
and Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 9.73  
points, or 0.06 percent, to finish the day at 17,188.82. On Friday, 
the average finished up 95.93 points, or 0.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices were boosted in morning trading by the lower  
yen and strong foreign buying, but profit-taking forced the market 
to surrender its gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average closed lower for the first time in seven  
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor sentiment has improved significantly since the  
government reported last week that Japan's real GDP rose 1.9 
percent in the January-March quarter, fueling hopes that the 
economy has finally bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar rose sharply against the yen following  
aggressive buying by the Japanese central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 120.66 yen in late afternoon trading,  
up 2.00 yen from its level of 118.66 late Friday in Tokyo, and also 
above its late New York level of 118.08 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, share prices closed sharply lower on renewed concerns  
about a possible rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 26.70 points, or 3.1  
percent, to close at 821.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed generally higher  
for the second consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng rose 14.81 points, or 0.1 percent,  
closing at 13,007.57. On Friday, the index gained 153.55 points, or 
1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the index rose slightly on continued selective  
buying of blue chip stocks following last week's cut in interest 
rates by China. The interest rate cuts helped the prices of 
companies in Hong Kong with business ties on the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover fell because many investors stayed on the sidelines on  
worries of a major slide in U.S. stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average tumbled 130.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to close 
at 10,490.51 on expectations of an interest rate rise this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed higher as political tensions eased over  
the weekend after the ruling Golkar party conceded that it wouldn't 
win the recent election. 
</P>
<P>
	With Golkar conceding defeat, dealers said the chances of a  
peaceful electoral process and smooth transition of power in 
Indonesia looked brighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 1.7 percent,  
or 11.168 points, to 679.449. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Australia for a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on  
speculation that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will announce 
early parliamentary elections this week. The key Composite Index 
rose 10.22 points, or 1.3 percent, to 782.98. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed little changed in light trading. The  
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 5.82 points, or 0.1 
percent, to 7,973.58. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 4.25 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 2,115.86. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher after the central bank  
cut its overnight borrowing and lending rates for the 17th time 
this year. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected 
companies rose 23.41 points, or 1 percent, to 2,391.20. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of  
Thailand index rose 7.61 points, or 1.5 percent, to 514.67. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed after the exchange was shut  
down in the morning because of technical problems. The benchmark 
Straits Times Index fell 8.79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,058.38.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Centennial Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Trial began Monday for two businessmen accused of  
helping to cook the books of the personal computer card 
manufacturer Centennial Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert E. Lockwood, chief executive of Presage Corp., a  
Centennial vendor, and Robert Kuzara, a former Centennial director, 
are charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair helped Wilmington, Mass.-based Centennial devise a  
phony transaction to boost its stock price, prosecutor John Falvey 
said during opening arguments in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	A third defendant, Centennial founder Emanuel Pinez, did not go  
on trial as scheduled. Instead, his case was severed from the other 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Joseph Tauro gave no explanation for the change.  
</P>
<P>
	Falvey said Lockwood and Kuzara helped hatch a scheme in which  
Centennial supposedly sold $2 million worth of inventory and 
accounts receivable to a new company called Information Capture 
Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, Falvey said, the inventory was not worth much, the  
accounts receivable were questionable and the transaction was used 
to create $1 million in fictional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said Pinez gained more than $4.2 million from  
trading in the company's inflated stock and stood to make more from 
option contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Lockwood and Kuzara held large amounts of stock in  
Centennial, Falvey said. It was not immediately clear if the two 
allegedly gained from the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Centennial's former chief financial officer, James M. Murphy,  
has pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges and will testify 
against Lockwood and Kuzara, Falvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former Centennial executive-turned-vendor, Bond D.  
Fletcher, also pleaded guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Lockwood and Kuzara say their clients knew nothing  
about maneuvers to inflate Centennial's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Centennial engaged in ``hundreds of thousands of bogus  
transactions'' that have nothing to do with Kuzara, said his 
lawyer, Richard Egbert. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show he wasn't a knowing participant in the  
scheme to defraud,'' said Albert Cullen, Lockwood's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinez and the others were indicted for allegedly inflating  
Centennial assets by $40 million in 1997. Centennial Technologies 
was a top performer on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996, when 
its stock price increased by 450 percent to trade as high as $55 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	But Centennial's stock was delisted from the exchange in  
February 1997 and its price has hovered between 37 cents and $1.75 
for the past year in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company appears to be recovering from the scandal.  
Centennial reported its fourth consecutive profitable quarter in 
March and annual sales of $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to get the stock relisted, this time on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, said Donald Peck, Centennial's secretary, 
treasurer and general counsel.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Stumbling in Stanley Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres have to figure out a way  
to solve Dallas' defense quickly, or they can forget about the 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off one of the greatest defensive performances in Stanley  
Cup finals history, the Stars have a 2-1 lead in the series and 
clearly the psychological edge as the teams prepare for Game 4 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we went into the last game thinking we would  
hold them to 12 shots,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We 
just wanted to make them have to fight for space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the stifling Stars, a team might know what it feels like  
to play in a phone booth. The 12 shots allowed by the Stars in 
their 2-1 victory on Saturday night matched the finals record set 
in 1988 by the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they hope to match the Oilers in another department: winning  
the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the amount of shots that we give up. We just don't  
want to give up any quality shots,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The areas that the Stars try to guard most intensely: the slot  
and in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so good. The Stars' defense has gotten progressively  
better, allowing the Sabres 24, 21 and 12 shots, respectively. 
Overall, they have outshot the Sabres 97-57 in the first three 
games of the finals while outscoring them 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, the Stars blocked 19 shots in front of goalie Ed  
Belfour -- seven more than he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody just feeds off it,'' Dallas' Darryl Sydor said.  
``Guys would put their faces in front of (the puck) because they 
realize the prize that is at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour used to complain about his teammates blocking shots in  
front of him because he couldn't see the puck. He's not complaining 
too much now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thankful for them. I know they help me.''  
</P>
<P>
	The main question posed to just about everyone in the Sabres'  
locker room on Monday: How do you beat the Dallas defense? 
</P>
<P>
	``They block a lot of shots,'' Curtis Brown said. ``One key that  
we have been working on (is that) we have to make sure our shots 
get through. Sometimes we are taking too much time winding up for 
the big slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that if you just get the puck to the net, good  
things happen. So we are just going to try to work on that and cut 
down the number of blocked shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A thought from Rhett Warrener:  
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we should be doing (is) to be a little more patient.  
You are not going to get four, five goals (against Dallas); maybe 
not even three. We might have to win a game 1-0.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Dallas victory would give the Stars a 3-1 advantage in the  
best-of-7 series, giving them a chance to head back home for a 
possible clinching in Game 5 on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast, said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that we are going to do a better job in the area of  
passing and skating,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, meanwhile, will not be playing at full strength.  
Brett Hull, one of their top scorers, figures to miss tonight's 
game because of a strained groin. 
</P>
<P>
	It has resulted in some shuffling of the Dallas lineup,  
including the possibility of moving Sydor from defense to forward 
on the top line along with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydor would be classified as a big forward because he is over  
a 200-pound player,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``So I think 
from our standpoint he probably would have the biggest impact from 
a physical standpoint. We might be leaning that way right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just what the Sabres need: another defensive forward to get in  
the way of their shots.

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Continues To Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Proving even more virulent than first believed,  
the computer virus Worm.Explore.Zip sprang back from a deceptively 
quiet weekend amid warnings that it uses more than just e-mail 
trickery to spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer support lines were inundated Monday with calls about  
new outbreaks of the file-killing virus, which experts now say was 
also designed to spread within an organization through computer 
network links that enable co-workers to share files on each others' 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	As the epidemic first picked up steam last week, infecting tens  
of thousands of computers at major corporations, the primary mode 
of transmission had seemed to be a friendly e-mail that tricks the 
recipient into opening a contaminated file. 
</P>
<P>
	By eliminating the need for a helping human hand, the  
Worm.Explore.Zip could prove more difficult to irradicate than the 
Melissa and Chernobyl viruses that struck earlier this spring by 
e-mail only. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes on, the programs intruders are using are becoming  
more complex,'' said Mark Zajicek, a member of the 
government-chartered Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the team found during tests that the virus  
would reappear seconds after being removed from a computer -- if 
that machine was linked by a network to another machine that was 
still infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Most major corporations, universities and government agencies  
link thousands of personal computers in networks, helping people 
work together, but also making their machines vulnerable to the 
bug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only takes one opening, one infected computer within a  
company, to rapidly spread within that company,'' said Zajicek. 
``That helps explain what we've been seeing -- that the program 
wasn't spreading from site to site as quickly as it was within a 
site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The additional mode of contamination may also render some of the  
cures posted on the Internet by software companies last week less 
effective, said Zajicek 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the symptoms we've seen in our own test lab, we have  
seen cases where such fixes would not be effective,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nervous calls to computer support lines dropped off  
sharply over the weekend, a support technician for the anti-virus 
software maker Network Associates said Monday's call volume was 
even heavier than on Thursday and Friday, with 30 to 40 callers 
waiting on hold at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation was trying to track down the  
author of the virus, but the agency declined to provide any updates 
on the probe over the weekend. It took only days earlier this 
spring for authorities to trace the digital footprints of Melissa 
and the Chernobyl virus that struck in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip, first detected in Israel about a week ago,  
began spreading rapidly on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer 
systems at many big corporations including AT&AMP;T, Boeing, General 
Electric and even Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the crafty bug's victims even included one maker of  
anti-virus software. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened here to our chief operating officer, who was  
running anti-virus software, practicing safe computing,'' said Dan 
Schrader, vice president of new technology at Trend Micro, noting 
that the executive had forgotten about a single link he'd 
established months ago to share his files with another worker. ``He 
went to open a PowerPoint (slide) presentation and it was empty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows  
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives in a person's e-mail box as a timely reply  
from an acquaintance. It then invites the recipient to open an 
attached file that will unleash a two-pronged attack, sending a 
copy of itself to the address of any arriving e-mail and destroying 
files stored on a person's machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the files destroyed are those created by the writing  
program Microsoft Word, the spreadsheet program Excel and 
PowerPoint, which is used to create graphic presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's new revelation about the way the bug works also fueled  
more debate about what terms to use to describe it. Because of the 
way it replicates, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not fit the 
technical definition of a computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the e-mail mode of contamination, it best would  
classified as a ``Trojan Horse'' -- a name borrowed from an ancient 
battle in which Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden horse to launch 
a surprise attack on the city of Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	But based on the file-sharing method of infection, it would more  
aptly be described as a ``worm.''

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad-De La Hoya Fight Sept. 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They could have been two businessmen holding a  
news conference not far from Wall Street to announce their next 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The business of Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad Jr. is  
boxing, and their venture will be a highly anticipated and rich 
welterweight title match Sept. 18 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show De La Hoya and the whole world I am the best  
welterweight in the world,'' said the 26-year-old Trinidad, dressed 
in a brown striped suit, white shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sept. 18, my fists will do the talking,'' said De La Hoya,  
wearing a dark blue suit, lighter blue shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The outdoor news conference Monday at the South Street Seaport  
was attended by hundreds of fans chanting and waving Puerto Rican 
and Mexican flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad (35-0, 30 knockouts), the IBF champion, was born and  
lives in Puerto Rico. De La Hoya (31-0, 25 knockouts) was born in 
East Los Angeles and lives at Whittier, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father-trainer worked up his son's fans by saying:  
``Tito will knock out Oscar. On Sept. 18, he will look like a dead 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On hearing the latter remark, Trinidad told his father to cool  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Don King, Trinidad's promoter, produced a boxing glove on which  
he said was written: ``I will knock out Oscar. Signed: Tito 
Trinidad Jr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Trinidad said: ``I want to say something right now --  
Sept. 18, by decision or by knockout, I'm going to win the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's only prediction was that he would win.  
</P>
<P>
	The Trinidads spoke in Spanish, then had their remarks  
translated. De La Hoya spoke in Spanish, then in English. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-promotion by King and his arch-rival Bob Arum, De La  
Hoya's promoter, will be a pay-per-view match. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed $15 million, Trinidad is guaranteed  
$10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's news conference touched off a week of hype sessions.  
The fighters are scheduled to be in Chicago on Tuesday; Miami and 
San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday; Houston and Dallas on 
Thursday; Mexico City on Friday and Los Angeles and Las Vegas on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Santa Anita Track Under New Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Lonny T. Powell, president of Turf  
Paradise in Phoenix, was named president and chief executive 
officer of Santa Anita on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford C. Goodrich will resign as executive vice president and  
general manager effective June 30 as part of a move to consolidate 
racetrack management under new owner Frank Stronach. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich has been at Santa Anita since 1980.  
</P>
<P>
	Powell will oversee day-to-day operations beginning in July,  
Santa Anita spokesman Stuart Zanville said. Powell, the son of a 
former jockey, has spent five years at Turf Paradise, which is 
owned by Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell also will serve as a vice president of Ventures, a new  
subsidiary of Magna International Inc., which purchased Santa Anita 
last December. Ventures will manage all of Magna's non-automotive 
assets. Besides racetracks, Ventures will be involved in leisure 
real estate development and development of media, sports and 
wagering activities in North America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have felt the need for some time to move on to other  
ventures and this seems like the appropriate time for me to make 
that transition,'' Goodrich said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Court Axes Ban on Casino Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court opened the door Monday to  
full broadcast advertising of casino gambling, complete with 
pictures of bettors at the tables. The court ruled that a federal 
ban aimed at protecting compulsive gamblers violates free-speech 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The court unanimously struck down the ban on television and  
radio advertising of casino gambling in states where such gambling 
is legal. The ban ``is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies 
that the government cannot hope to exonerate it,'' Justice John 
Paul Stevens wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gaming Association and some legal experts said the  
decision will allow casinos to advertise gambling even in states 
that ban casino gambling. The court's opinion did not say so, but 
it criticized the ban in broad terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presumption is that consumers are better off if left to  
judge the value of speech themselves, rather than to have the 
government judge it for them,'' said Matthew Berry of the Institute 
for Justice. The conservative-libertarian group supported the New 
Orleans-area broadcasters who challenged the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens wrote for the court that the ban ``may not be applied to  
advertisements of private casino gambling that are broadcast by 
radio or television stations located in Louisiana, where such 
gambling is legal.'' More than half the states have legalized 
casino gambling, offered either by private companies or Indian 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in arguing for the ban, had  
emphasized the ``devastating social costs'' caused by and to an 
estimated 3 million compulsive gamblers, and said Congress was 
entitled to address part of the problem by reining in commercial 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevens said, ``The federal policy of discouraging gambling  
in general, and casino gambling in particular, is now decidedly 
equivocal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising of state-run lotteries is legal in states that  
conduct lotteries, and casino gambling run by Indian tribes can be 
advertised everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens also noted that the Federal Communications Commission  
``has permitted broadcasters to tempt viewers with claims of 
'Vegas-style excitement''' and to use the word ``casino'' if the 
word is part of the establishment's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashton Hardy, attorney for the New Orleans broadcasters, said  
casinos could advertise even before Monday's ruling, so long as 
they emphasized non-gambling activities such as shows, meals and 
general ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ruling will allow ads to promote the gambling itself and  
show people at the tables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly what we asked for,'' Hardy said, ``full  
informational advertising which ... provides the public with 
information about a legitimate product or service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said he did not think the ruling allows such advertising  
in states where casino gambling is not legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel E. Troy of the American Advertising Federation said he is  
advising advertisers they would be taking a major risk by 
advertising in non-casino gambling states. But he said the ruling's 
discussion of problems with the federal ban ``invites a challenge 
by, for example, the New York stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states now allow gambling at private casinos: Nevada, New  
Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Colorado and South Dakota. Michigan will join them this fall. At 
least 22 states allow tribal-operated casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing federal law bans broadcast advertising for ``any  
lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' Congress has 
amended the law to allow ads for Indian-run casinos, state 
lotteries and charity gambling. Since 1988, the law primarily has 
targeted privately owned casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino ad ban had been in effect in only some parts of the  
nation because some federal appeals courts ruled it 
unconstitutional while others upheld it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court for two decades has demanded that any  
government limits on truthful and non-misleading commercial speech 
be shown to directly advance some asserted government interest and 
be no more extensive than necessary. If they do not, those limits 
violate the First Amendment's free-speech protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino-advertising ban did not meet that test, the court  
said. The regulation permits ``a variety of speech that poses the 
same risks the government purports to fear,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission first has drawn  
heat by deciding to recommend that states and towns consider a 
moratorium on more casinos, slot machines and lotteries.

<HEADLINE> Gore Slams NRA, House on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Pressing for help in a fight for stricter gun  
laws, Vice President Al Gore told the nation's mayors on Monday 
that he had underestimated the ability of the National Rifle 
Association to ``call the shots in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Will we let the NRA call the shots in Washington or will we  
cross party lines to make our children safer?'' Gore said to more 
than 300 city leaders at the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference 
of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore cast the deciding vote three weeks ago when the Senate  
passed a proposal to require background checks for gun buyers at 
gun shows. He said he thought the measure and others in the Senate 
bill ``would just pick up momentum'' and move toward House passage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an intense lobbying effort by the NRA has helped to  
derail any easy passage of gun safety legislation in the House, for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some in the House are pushing a bill that gives the NRA the  
loopholes it wants instead of giving the country the protection it 
needs,'' Gore said to cheers from the mayors. ``It's time to side 
with our children instead of the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled House is expected to debate gun  
control proposals this week, with Democrats generally pressing for 
adoption of provisions the Senate approved last month, and the NRA 
fighting to water them down or eliminate them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the background checks for all purchases at gun  
shows, the Senate-passed provisions include a requirement that 
safety devices be sold with guns and a ban on importing 
high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning in New Hampshire for the  
Republican presidential nomination, said he favored the Senate 
legislation. Asked about Gore's push for new controls, he replied, 
``We need to enforce the laws already on the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New  
Jersey, has called for an aggressive gun control campaign, 
including ``handgun cards'' -- photo identity cards required of 
anybody carrying a handgun. He also has been considering whether to 
propose a ban on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore released a report by the Justice and Treasury departments  
that found 24 percent of all gun homicides are committed by 18- to 
20-year-olds, a group that is just 4 percent of the population. The 
same age group also led all other age categories in using guns in 
murders and other crimes, including rape, assault and robberies, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said 18-year-olds commit 35 percent more gun  
murders than 21-year-olds, double the gun murders by 24-year olds 
and four times the number of gun murders committed by 30-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid out a broad outline for job creation, an increase in  
educational standards and urban development. His pledge to improve 
schools by providing ``high-quality preschool education'' for all 
American children drew a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong economy, safer communities and better schools are  
just some of the challenges we need to tackle as we move to the 
21st century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Gore was host at a $1,000 per-person  
fund-raiser in a Bourbon Street jazz bar. Gore staffers said the 
event raised more than $250,000, more than twice the amount tallied 
at a similar event for President Clinton four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's often painted as a robotic speaker, Gore broke with  
tradition by strutting into the Storyville Jazz Bar in the city's 
French Quarter district with a musical procession known as a Second 
Line and took a few dance steps to the music. 
</P>
<P>
	The speeches were Gore's last major addresses before he  
officially announces his presidential candidacy Wednesday in his 
hometown of Carthage, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheering their man as a strong advocate for urban America, more  
than 100 mayors announced their support of Gore at the convention 
Sunday. So far, a total of 167 mayors have pledged him their 
support for the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton-Gore team has enjoyed great popularity with the  
mayors' group for giving more attention to the nation's urban 
policy agenda than its Republican predecessors did in the 1980s. 
That support was in evidence after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see him as a champion for the cities,'' said Larry Delgado,  
mayor of Santa Fe, N.M. ``He's been fighting for the funding we 
need.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A pit crew member, critically injured in an  
accident at the Indianapolis 500 on May 30, was released from a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Fried, the chief mechanic for rookie driver Robby McGehee,  
was released Sunday, two weeks after the accident, said Leslie 
Smith, a spokeswoman for Methodist Hospital. 
</P>

	The Mentor, Ohio, crewman was working in McGehee's pit early in  
the race when he was struck from behind by Jimmy Kite's car, which 
was hit by another car whose brakes had failed. Fried landed on his 
face and suffered head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee, who finished fifth and later was named rookie of the  
year, gave Fried his trophy two days after the accident.

<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- This time, it was Magic Johnson's  
turn to cheer at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Spartan and retired NBA great watched from a private  
box at the school's Breslin Center on Saturday as his son, Andre, 
received his diploma from Everett High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson graduated from Everett before going on to Michigan State  
and leading the Spartans to the 1979 NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When Andre's name was read, his father leapt to his feet,  
clapped and shouted. Johnson was also celebrating the recovery of 
his father, Earvin Johnson Sr., from a stroke last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no serious damage. Every day, he's gotten better and  
better,'' Johnson said. ``I thank God and thank all the people for 
their prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre, 18, plans to move to Los Angeles this summer and work at  
his father's company, Magic Johnson Enterprises, which includes 
coffee houses, restaurants and movie theaters. He also plans to 
study business management at Santa Monica Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to turn him into a businessman,'' his father said.

<HEADLINE> Glider Pilot Killed in Nev. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINDEN, Nev. (AP) -- One of the nation's top glider pilots was  
killed when his plane plunged about 100 feet to the ground during 
practice for an upcoming race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clem Bowman died instantly when his Genesis sail plane crashed  
Sunday at Minden-Tahoe Airport shortly after take off, airport 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, of Clermont, Fla., had been competing for more than 10  
years and was the 1997 U.S. glider plane champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman's plane had been towed about 100 feet into the air when  
the horizontal stabilizer, a piece on the tail that control's the 
plane's pitch, fell off, causing the plane to dive, said Rick 
Walters, chairman of the Minden-Tahoe Airport Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration and the Douglas County  
Sheriff's Department are investigating the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The initial guess is that he did not assemble the aircraft  
correctly,'' Walters said, adding that gliders are taken apart 
after every flight for storage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 45 pilots and their crews were at the airport, 10 miles  
south of Carson City, to take part in a practice run ahead of the 
1999 Standard Class Nationals competition. The race is scheduled 
for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very quiet event now,'' Walters said. He said it  
was the first time in 10 years a pilot had died in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters said Bowman was a doctor in his early 50s. He is  
survived by a wife and two children.

<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- National contract talks began Monday  
between the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co., which enjoys 
the best union relations among Detroit's automakers and may again 
set the standard for an economic package for the start of a new 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key issues for the industry this year is a change in  
manufacturing that could rely more heavily on components made by 
lower-paid workers who are not members of the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is it a new contract for a new century, but it's a  
contract that a lot of people in the U.S. and in the world will be 
watching -- not only what we accomplish, but how we do it,'' Jac 
Nasser, Ford's president, told the bargaining teams. ``The how is 
almost as important as where we come out in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health and safety, job security, wages and benefits remain  
perennial major considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW president Stephen P. Yokich and Ford vice chairman Peter J.  
Pestillo, the architects of Ford-UAW relations and longtime 
friends, formally kicked off the talks by shaking hands across the 
50-seat ``main table'' where major issues will be decided in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The handshakes and opening remarks at Ford's world headquarters  
were a triennial ritual that will be repeated Tuesday at 
DaimlerChrysler AG and Wednesday at General Motors Corp. Their 
contracts expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike strike-prone rival GM, Ford has enjoyed peaceful labor  
relations with the UAW for two decades. Ford has not endured a 
nationwide UAW strike in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Come Labor Day, the UAW will choose the lead company with which  
it will work out an economic package that the other automakers will 
be expected to adopt. Ford set the pace for the contracts as lead 
company in 1993 and 1996 and is hoping to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford chief negotiator Robert H. Marcin said the reason was  
simple: It allows the company to negotiate what's best for Ford 
rather than being stuck with what may be best for its domestic 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser told negotiators that ``manufacturing processes'' were a  
major issue for Ford. All three companies have long sought more 
flexibility in the way they can use UAW workers on the assembly 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM executives' public talk of drastically changing the way  
the No. 1 automaker manufactures small cars by adopting ``modular'' 
assembly techniques has angered the UAW. Modular assembly would 
rely more on suppliers to build a car's major parts assemblies, or 
``modules,'' and less on higher-cost UAW workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives have been careful in recent weeks to avoid the  
``M word,'' and Nasser was no exception. But he said the issue of 
manufacturing processes ``really drives how good we are and what 
our customers think about us and our products and the value that we 
can put into the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks by Nasser and chairman William C. Ford Jr. were made  
behind closed doors, but they were inadvertently broadcast into the 
Ford pressroom where reporters were awaiting the handshake 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	At a later news conference, Yokich insisted Nasser had not  
mentioned manufacturing processes. But he maintained his stance 
against modular assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not good for GM, why would I say it's good for Ford?''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and safety issues will be one of the first issues tackled  
at Ford in the wake of the February explosion at its Rouge plant 
near Detroit, said a company executive who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The blast killed six workers. The executive said the 
company was eager to negotiate any contract provisions that could 
prevent another such disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said he discussed the Rouge explosion with negotiators  
Monday and that it would be an issue throughout the talks. He noted 
that there have been 42 work-related deaths in the domestic auto 
industry during the current three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's 42 too many as far as we're concerned,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford negotiators also will be tackling the future of the 23,500  
UAW workers at the company's Visteon parts unit. Ford is expected 
to spin off Visteon in the next year or two, though it says no 
final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations cover between 101,000 and 110,000 Ford workers,  
depending on who's counting. The company issued the smaller number 
Monday; the union used the larger one. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, the 42-year-old great-grandson of founder Henry Ford who  
took over the chairman's seat in January, said he entered these 
talks with a deep sense of history. The company will mark its 100th 
anniversary in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sense that we, in many ways, created the industrial  
revolution,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said his work on the 1982 Ford bargaining team taught him  
much about the importance of trust in his company's relationship 
with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiators presented their Ford counterparts with a  
large banner that read ``Bargaining for Families,'' the theme the 
UAW officials chose for these talks. UAW lead negotiator Ron 
Gettelfinger said the banner would be ``a reminder throughout the 
negotiations of what we're here for.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna Told To Shed Some Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The federal government has told Aetna  
Inc. to shed some of its operations before it approves the 
company's pending $1 billion acquisition of the health care unit of 
Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department told Aetna Friday to divest itself from  
some of its combined health plan operations, a company official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna spokeswoman Joyce Oberdorf would not give any details of  
the demand, but said talks with the Justice Department are expected 
to be wrapped up soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their view was pretty much in line with our expectations,''  
Oberdorf said. ``There weren't any surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Aetna is leaning  
toward accepting the government's conditions, which include 
shedding operations in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups, such as the American Medical Association, have  
argued the acquisition will be bad for consumers and will give 
Aetna too much power over physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Medical Association also opposed the deal, claiming it  
would give Aetna about a 60 percent share of the commercial HMO 
market in Houston and as much as a 50 percent share of the market 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of the Hartford-based company's Aetna U.S.  
Healthcare unit and Prudential HealthCare would provide benefits to 
about 22 million people nationwide. Aetna currently provides health 
care coverage to about 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Oberdorf said Aetna is trying to close its deal with Prudential  
by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal was announced late last year, Aetna chairman and  
chief executive Richard Huber said he expected it to clear the 
Justice Department antitrust review without having to give up any 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Huber has been more receptive to giving up  
some businesses to get approval.

<HEADLINE> DoubleClick To Buy Abacus Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- DoubleClick Inc. and Abacus Direct Corp. today  
announced a $1 billion merger to create a combined online 
advertising and database marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	DoubleClick, a seller of banner advertising on the Internet,  
will use Abacus' database of consumer catalog buying behavior to 
better target ads to specific consumers, the companies said today 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Abacus tracks more than 2 billion consumer catalog transactions  
from 1,100 merchandise catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, DoubleClick can display ads based on the type of Web  
site an Internet user is visiting. By using Abacus' database, 
DoubleClick will be able to display an advertisement suited to that 
consumer's catalog buying habits as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based DoubleClick will issue 1.05 shares of common  
stock for each share of Abacus, based in Broomfield, Colo. The new 
company, which will retain the DoubleClick name, will be 
headquartered in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and approval  
by shareholders of both companies, is expected to be completed in 
the third quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Helsinki Bids for Shared Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finland's highest mountain for alpine  
skiing is a mere 2,370 feet, and it's nowhere near the capital. 
Still, Helsinki is bidding for the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Renowned for its winter sports, Finland has never before had a  
chance to host a Winter Games because it lacks alpine facilities. 
That changed in 1990, when the International Olympic Committee 
decided to allow the games to be shared. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahti, known as a Nordic skiing center, was ready a few years  
ago but failed to find a partner. In 1997, IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch urged the Finns to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	And they did, with one of the most popular partners possible.  
</P>
<P>
	They approached the successful 1994 Olympic host, Lillehammer,  
which agreed to be paired with Helsinki for 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot think of an economically better concept than Norway  
and Finland together,'' said Jari Piirainen, the Helsinki 2006 
project manager. ``Norway has the know-how in the alpine events, 
and we've got it in cross- country skiing and ice hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not building castles in the air. We know there'll be a  
lot of spectators in both countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehammer would stage alpine skiing, snowboarding and the  
sledding events. Lahti, an hour's drive north of Helsinki, would 
have the Nordic skiing, biathlon and freestyle skiing events. 
Curling, ice hockey, figure skating and speedskating would be held 
in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	The distance between Helsinki and Lillehammer is 500 miles, but  
travelers will have to transfer to a train or bus at Oslo's new 
airport, since Lillehammer doesn't have an airport to cater to 
Olympic crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Piirainen said a special fleet of planes and swift handling  
of luggage from charter flights will make it a short trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distance between Helsinki and Lillehammer was our  
logistical challenge, and we have solved it in the way we 
promised,'' Piirainen says. ``Between three hours and three hours 
and fifteen minutes ... to Lillehammer is not that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of the Helsinki 2006 bid is that most venues exist.  
Only an arena for speedskating has to be built, with organizers 
bypassing a chance to use the Viking Ship hall in Hamar, Norway, in 
favor of a new multipurpose building for ice sports here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finns are used to organizing major sports events.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Lahti hosted the World Nordic Skiing  
Championships before 450,000 spectators. In 1997, the Ice Hockey 
World Championships drew over 520,000, mainly to the new Hartwall 
Arena in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki will be responsible for handling the finances,  
including all revenue and expenses, and the wages of the people 
working with the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials, athletes and accredited media will be provided with a  
smart card that acts as a passport, visa and a free-of-charge 
transportation ticket. Fans will be able to benefit from special 
low-rate fares promised by the games' official carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Helsinki 2006 project manager admits that the tightened  
rules for IOC members, imposed in the wake of the Salt Lake bribery 
scandal, hurt the chances of its bid, especially the ban on travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The host city also will be picked in a new way, with a special  
panel reducing the field of six to two finalists and the IOC 
delegates then deciding the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Helsinki concept demanded a new way of thinking by the  
people making decisions, and it would have benefited us if they 
could have seen our arrangement with their own eyes,'' Piirainen 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish IOC member Pirjo Haeggman worked for the Helsinki 2006  
committee until mid-January, when she resigned from both the IOC 
and the local panel. Haeggman was the first of 10 IOC members to 
quit or be expelled for abusing their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``She became a hot subject and did not want to be a burden to  
us. But she then made her own brave decision (to resign),'' 
Piirainen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finns have mostly welcomed the idea of the Olympics, and polls  
have indicated that some two-thirds of the nation approves of 
hosting the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doubt that a country of 5 million can afford the cost, but  
Piirainen points out that most of the money in the $460 million 
budget will come from international TV contracts and sponsorship 
deals, with $360 million already secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sole aim is to win, and to do it now. We don't see this as  
a preliminary round for a future campaign,'' he says. ``We have to 
reach the final, and it doesn't matter against whom. Our main 
opponent is perhaps Sion. Rumors have them as the favorite, but 
we'd like to beat them in the final.''

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Flee Kosovo in Huge Convoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ducking at the sound of gunfire,  
patrolling cautiously to avoid the ire of Serbs, thousands of NATO 
peacekeepers spread out Monday across Kosovo. Some uncovered grim 
evidence of atrocities as they tightened their control of the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces complying with the pullout ordered by NATO to end  
the 78-day air war mixed in with civilians fleeing in columns up to 
500 vehicles long. Some ethnic Albanian homes were set ablaze by 
Serb troops leaving Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiming to bring a measure of stability to the province shattered  
by war and a long history of ethnic hatred, NATO and U.S. forces 
sought to downplay the impasse over about 200 Russian soldiers 
occupying the Pristina airfield where the allies planned to 
establish headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO lead commander Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson insisted the  
airfield wasn't crucial to occupying forces though the White House 
said Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright will meet their Russian counterparts in 
Helsinki, Finland, within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's Serbs fear that the majority ethnic Albanians will take  
bloody revenge on them for years of oppression and for reported 
atrocities. The West, meanwhile, fears that a Russian zone will 
lead to the partition of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees who began streaming out of Kosovo after the NATO  
bombing campaign began March 24 told of Serb slaughter and the 
massacre of innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts could not be independently confirmed at the time  
and one of the peacekeepers' grueling tasks will be to investigate 
what happened. On Monday, they gingerly probed the town cemetery in 
Kacanik, where the stench of decayed flesh hung heavy over 81 
apparently newly dug graves. 
</P>
<P>
	British Capt. Andy Reeds said war crimes investigators would be  
called in to examine the site, 30 miles south of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers continued to pour into the battered Serbian  
province from neighboring Macedonia and Albania, and officials said 
about 15,000 allied troops had entered Kosovo by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deployment of KFOR is on schedule,'' said NATO Secretary  
General Javier Solana. ``The withdrawal of the Serbian forces is 
also on time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A convoy of 1,200 U.S. Marines began crossing just south of  
Kacanik at first light, and U.S. forces took over the area, 
including the site of the graves, from the British troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all a little edgy going in,'' said Cpl. Will Rapier,  
20, of Paintsville, Ky., with the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines. ``We 
just hope to get this thing over so we can all go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the tensions, Monday's troop movements went off without  
a repeat of Sunday's pair of fatal confrontations, when soldiers 
shot a Serb in Pristina and German forces killed one man and 
wounded another after the men fired at them from a car in the city 
of Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Serb citizens poured out of Prizren, Kosovo's  
second-largest city, taunted by ethnic Albanians who erupted into a 
wild victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	German soldiers disarmed several members of the Kosovo  
Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla group, as they tried 
to seize wounded Serb soldiers at the main Prizren hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is supposed to demilitarize under the Kosovo peace  
agreement, but the group boldly set up an office in Pristina on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The private news agency Beta reported Monday that three Serbs  
were killed by men wearing KLA armbands in a suburb of Pristina. 
The Serb-run Media Center said it had a report of five people 
killed in the same suburb but did not have details. 
</P>
<P>
	The center blamed the KLA for the shooting death of a Serb  
employee of Pristina's television station in front of his home 
Monday night in the Taslidze section of the city. The Serb report 
gave no other details of the attack 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview distributed Monday by the rebels' Kosova Press  
agency, senior guerrilla leader Hashim Thaci said the Russians were 
unwelcome in Kosovo and demanded they leave. He warned that the KLA 
``will not guarantee their security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their uninvited entrance may stir more conflict in Kosova that  
we do not want to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaci also claimed that the KLA is not required to demilitarize.  
However, the peace accord calls from the group to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian troops entered the city of Pec, the seat of the Serbian  
Orthodox Church in Kosovo and the scene of some of the grimmest 
accounts of slaughter in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav troops withdrew from the city on Monday after a spree  
of home-burnings and alleged rapes, whooping on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
	Two German journalists were shot dead by unidentified gunman  
Sunday 15 miles south of Pristina. The German newsweekly Stern 
identified them as photographer Volker Kraemer, 56, and reporter 
Gabriel Gruener, 35. The magazine said the team's interpreter was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, an impasse over its strategic airport continued.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia's role in the envisaged 50,000-member peacekeeping force,  
which includes 7,000 Americans, was not clearly defined in the 
peace plan. A contingent of 200 Russian troops arrived unexpectedly 
from Bosnia on Saturday, ahead of NATO troops, and took control of 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said Monday that he did not regard the presence of the  
Russians as important from a military standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in a tussle with them,'' he said. ``They are on the  
airfield. ... It is not important to me at this stage. What is 
important to me is getting this job done on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin spoke for a  
second straight day about continuing differences over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials and those from allied countries have largely  
sought to play down indications of a rivalry with the Russians, who 
demand to control their own sector in northern Kosovo where ethnic 
Serbs -- their longtime allies -- are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment of peacekeepers did not stop Serb forces from  
shelling an Albanian village early Monday at the village of Dobrun, 
an area where the KLA maintains sanctuaries, according to Andrea 
Angeli, spokesman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. There were no reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic toured the ruins of a  
destroyed bridge across the Danube River in Beska, 30 miles 
northwest of the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, and officially 
inaugurated the country's reconstruction effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that peace is here again, we face the task of rebuilding  
the country,'' he was quoted as saying by the state-run Tanjug news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 refugees tried to return Monday, crossing the Yugoslav  
border from Albania before being turned back by German peacekeepers 
and rebels. Thirty or 40 refugees broke away and scampered off over 
the hills into Kosovo, said an OSCE spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials want Kosovo Albanians to remain in refugee camps  
until peacekeepers have restored order and cleared minefields. 
</P>
<P>
	About 860,000 Kosovo Albanians fled the province of 2.1 million  
people during the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Managers Describe Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tom Kelly remembers seeing dark circles under Sparky Anderson's  
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told some people, `Sparky looks terrible,''' the Minnesota  
Twins manager recalled Monday. ``He had black rings under his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since that day, when I wake up in the morning and see black  
rings, that's when I say `timeout' and sit back and reevaluate, 
because that's not healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of game decisions. Late-night meals. Early-morning  
trips. And the pressure to win every day. 
</P>
<P>
	No telling whether any of it contributed to Larry Dierker's  
collapse Sunday. Still, managers throughout the major leagues could 
only wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction was `Yeah, was it something stress- or  
job-related?''' Detroit's Larry Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Tampa Bay's Larry Rothschild: ``Whatever, it was probably  
exacerbated by the stress of the job. I don't doubt that it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managers are not required by major league baseball to take  
annual physicals. Many teams give them, sometimes for insurance 
purposes. Unlike players or umpires, there is no union for 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no association, we have each other,'' Texas' Johnny  
Oates said. ``This is almost like a fraternity. We need each other. 
We are the only ones who understand what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Torre was forced to leave the New York Yankees this year for  
treatment of prostate cancer. Bench coach Don Zimmer filled in, 
hobbling in constant pain from a knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
	John Boles missed a total of 13 games for Florida because of  
back surgery and a sprained neck. In 1996, Tom Lasorda stepped down 
in Los Angeles after having a mild heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs show up in other ways, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony La Russa chews his fingernails to the nub, Jim Leyland  
chain-smoked in the dugout tunnel. Billy Martin was known to drink, 
Buck Showalter slept in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much time to reflect on how you feel physically or  
mentally because there are important decisions to be made 
day-by-day. A lot of time you're the last person you worry about,'' 
Kansas City's Tony Muser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Baltimore's Ray Miller: ``Every once in a while you think,  
`If I dropped dead, no one would know until the afternoon?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout at the Astrodome in the eighth  
inning of Houston's game against San Diego. The 52-year-old manager 
will undergo brain surgery Tuesday to remove a mass of malformed 
blood vessels that caused his seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said doctors told him  
Dierker's prognosis is ``excellent.'' Dierker told Hunsicker he'd 
been having severe headaches in the days prior to his collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that stress is going to affect a manager to  
the point where he's going to lose consciousness. From what I've 
been reading, he had a problem before,'' Montreal's Felipe Alou 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some tough times in 1996 during the offseason, not  
during the season,'' he said. ``It had nothing to do with the game. 
Problems begin any month of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said he took a physical in spring  
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's a good barometer,'' he said. ``Who's  
stressed in spring training? There's nothing going on, it's 
relaxed, the workouts are short, the games don't count, you're 
playing golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most teams insure the contracts of their managers, forcing them  
to take physicals at the time of the signing -- but not necessarily 
repeated until a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The exams often include a general checkup, an EKG, a blood test  
and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer. 
Managers over 50 frequently take treadmill tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, 48, broke a small blood vessel in his eye in November and  
lost part of his vision. Since then, he has a medical evaluation 
every three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody right away wants to relate it to stress,'' San  
Francisco's Dusty Baker said. ``What was the stress that did it to 
Larry?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 68, Cincinnati's Jack McKeon has spent most of his life  
dealing with the daily pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the stress, to be honest with you. I don't really view  
it as stress. Probably because I've been in it so long, I don't 
live or die with every game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most managers try to find a way to relax away from baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Baker likes to fish, Kelly spends time at the race track. Manuel  
swims, Rothschild runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lifestyle is not conducive to end stress,'' Rothschild  
said. ``You end up going to bed late and by the time you wake up 
you're reading the newspaper and you're back into the rut again.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Anounces 737 Jetliner Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. on Monday announced orders and options  
for 45 737 jetliners, deals worth more than $2 billion if all 
options are exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were the first of what is expected to be a  
flurry of deals to be made public at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said Midway Airlines ordered 15 new-generation 737-700s  
and took options for 10 more. The value of the deal was not 
announced, but Boeing lists the price of the 126-seat twinjet 
between $41.5 million-$59 million. At that price the firm orders 
would be worth at least $622.5 million, and all 25 planes would be 
worth $1 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway, whose hub is in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., is an East Coast  
regional carrier. It also will lease two additional 737-700s from 
GE Capital Aviation Services, with the first of those to be 
delivered in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet Airways of India ordered 10 737-800s, worth approximately  
$550 million, with deliveries to begin in 2001 and continue through 
2003. The 162-passenger planes will be used on domestic Indian 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
	CIT Group Inc. announced an agreement to buy 10 737  
next-generation planes, with the right to convert to earlier models 
of the 737, and options to acquire more planes over a four-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the deal was not announced, but would be worth  
about $500 million according to Boeing's price list. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based financial services company will take delivery  
of the new planes over a three-year period starting in the second 
quarter of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In other announcements from the air show, Rolls-Royce said it  
has received orders totaling $275 million to provide jet engines 
for Airbus Industrie A320 and A330 airliners for CIT and two other 
aircraft leasing companies. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Spins in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While top winds from the first tropical storm of  
the season dropped to 50 mph overnight, some strengthening was 
possible today as the storm continues spinning over the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Arlene poses no immediate threat to land, at  
least in the next three days, according to the National Hurricane 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the East Coast is in the future of this storm,  
but Bermuda -- we'll be looking at that. But it's not a big deal 
right now,'' said hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in a weak steering current, so it's not moving much,'' he  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Storm-force winds extended up to 105 miles from the center.  
Arlene was expected to continue moving west today at near 6 mph 
with a gradual turn toward the northwest Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have a higher chance of surviving if it was going  
east,'' said hurricane forecaster Jack Beven. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms in this part of the Atlantic often turn toward the  
northeast and die at sea as they enter cooler waters, which 
discourage development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to start out with something hopefully remaining at  
sea,'' another hurricane forecaster, Richard Pasch, said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Can Order Gov't To Pay Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency that protects workers  
against job discrimination can order other federal agencies to pay 
damages to employees they discriminate against, the Supreme Court 
ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-4 decision said federal law allows the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission to require federal agencies to pay 
compensatory damages, intended to reimburse for harm a worker 
suffered, such as emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the EEOC possesses the legal authority to  
enforce (anti-discrimination law) through an award of compensatory 
damages,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal employees are required to take their discrimination  
complaints to the EEOC before going to federal court in an effort 
to encourage ``quicker, less formal'' resolution of such disputes, 
Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring the EEOC from awarding compensatory damages would  
``force into court matters that the EEOC might otherwise have 
resolved,'' the justice added. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal appeals courts had disagreed over whether the EEOC can  
force federal agencies to pay workers compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves discrimination claims filed under a major  
anti-bias law known as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
In 1991, Congress voted to allow workers who are victims of job 
bias to collect compensatory damages in addition to back pay and 
other remedies previously allowed under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers who file discrimination claims under Title VII  
must complain first to their agency, then go through an EEOC 
administrative proceeding. If they are dissatisfied with the EEOC's 
findings, they can go to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's case, an accountant for the Department of Veterans  
Affairs argued that the EEOC did not have the authority to award 
him compensatory damages. A federal appeals court agreed and gave 
him a chance to seek such damages in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gibson began his VA career in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1988  
and transferred to Hines, Ill., in 1990. He applied for a promotion 
in 1992 but a less-experienced woman was chosen instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson filed a sex-discrimination claim, but the VA found no  
illegal conduct. He appealed to the EEOC, which found that the VA 
had discriminated against him and ordered the VA to give him a 
promotion and back pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA was late in complying with the commission's order, and  
Gibson sued in federal court. His lawsuit sought the back pay and 
promotion that he belatedly received, and also requested 
compensatory damages for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out Gibson's lawsuit, saying the back pay  
and promotion issues were moot and that he should have raised the 
damages claim first in the EEOC proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and said Gibson  
was entitled to a trial on his claim for damages. The EEOC is not 
authorized to make such awards, so Gibson's failure to raise the 
issue before the commission was irrelevant, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong. The justices  
ordered the appeals court to consider other issues raised by Gibson 
in an effort to collect damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,  
Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Kennedy said the 1991 amendment ``does not  
so much as mention the EEOC, much less empower it to award or 
authorize money damages.'' He also said the federal government had 
not waived its sovereign immunity against awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is West vs. Gibson, 98-238.

<HEADLINE> Valentine To Talk With NL President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine expects  
to talk to NL president Len Coleman on Tuesday about his two-game 
suspension for returning to the dugout in disguise after being 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said before the start of a series Monday against the  
Cincinnati Reds that he had not yet spoken to Coleman, who imposed 
the suspension and fined him $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension is on hold while Valentine appeals.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentine declined to talk about donning the disguise Monday,  
other than to say: ``At the time it served the purpose because I 
thought levity was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected by plate umpire Randy Marsh in the 12th  
inning of a game last Wednesday for arguing a catcher's 
interference call on Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager later returned in disguise, wearing eye black on his  
upper lip, sunglasses and a hat. A television camera quickly 
spotted him, although Valentine insisted he stayed a step away from 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	A National League rule stipulates that an ejected manager must  
remain in the clubhouse until the game ends or leave the stadium. 
He also may sit in the stands away from the bullpen.

<HEADLINE> 'Austin Powers' Sequel Has Force / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This time, the Force was no match for the  
mojo. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Austin Powers'' sequel shagged, er, snagged the top box  
office spot, knocking ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' 
into second place. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of Mike Myers' swinging, oversexed man of mystery  
opened with a groovy estimated gross of $54.7 million -- more than 
the 1997 original made in its entire theatrical run. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
	On a huge weekend at North American theaters, the ``Star Wars''  
prequel continued to pack in audiences, bringing in $25.4 million 
Friday through Sunday for a total of nearly $300 million in just 
four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' that far  
exceeded industry expectations, setting or approaching several box 
office records. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring Myers as both the dentally challenged super  
spy and his nemesis Dr. Evil, was the top-opening comedy, beating 
last year's ``The Waterboy,'' which debuted with $39.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also was the top June opener -- beating ``Batman  
Forever'' with $52.7 million in 1995 -- and the No. 2 non-holiday 
weekend opener, behind only ``The Phantom Menace'' with $64.8 
million last month. Figures are not adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seemed to be a hunger for a comedy,'' said New Line  
distribution head Al Shapiro, who also noted that audience 
expectations for the sequel started to build when the original was 
released on video. 
</P>
<P>
	After near-disastrous test screenings befuddled preview  
audiences more than they amused them, ``Austin Powers: 
International Man of Mystery'' opened with a so-so $9.5 million in 
May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The film caught on over the summer and ended up grossing a  
respectable $53.9 million, turning a profit because the budget was 
only about $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the video release that turned Austin Powers into a  
pop cultural phenomenon, becoming the No. 1 seller in 1998 and 
racking up another $44 million. Soon, fans started aping his silly 
phrases -- ``Yeah, baby!'' and ``Oh, behave!'' -- and throwing Austin 
Powers theme parties. 
</P>
<P>
	A sequel was shot with twice the budget, again starring Myers.  
Audience appetites were whetted with a trailer that poked fun at 
the ``Star Wars'' hype. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a summer season slot with no comedy competition and shown  
in a record 3,312 theaters -- more than even last year's 
``Godzilla'' -- the sequel soared, taking audiences on a time-travel 
trip back to the 1960s so Austin could find his stolen mojo: his 
life-giving force. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the staying power of ``The Phantom Menace,'' which  
lost just 23 percent of its audience, and ``Notting Hill,'' with 
just a 25 percent dip, the ``Austin Powers'' sequel helped boost 
box office up 36 percent ahead of the same weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' collected $11.2 million for third place.  
``Instinct'' had $6.8 million for fourth and ``The Mummy'' had $5.1 
million for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $54.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $25.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Notting Hill,'' $11.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Instinct,'' $6.8 million  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Mummy,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Entrapment,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Matrix,'' $2.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $1.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $850,000.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Tea With Mussolini,'' $770,000.

<HEADLINE> S. Baptists To Recruit in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Southern Baptists open their annual  
convention Tuesday, and the agenda includes yet another attempt by 
their leaders to distance the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination from its segregationist past. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention's president, the Rev. Paige Patterson, is  
expected to propose that the denomination diversify and broaden its 
appeal in inner cities by forming multiethnic congregations from 
Boston to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I can do to change things 100 years ago,''  
said the Rev. Phil Roberts of the convention's North American 
Mission Board. ``I do know what I can do now: Take the Gospel and 
reach out and minister to all the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark a dramatic shift for a denomination whose 16  
million members live mostly in the suburbs, small towns and rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination was formed in 1845 by rural whites who insisted  
on their right to own slaves. During the civil rights era, blacks 
were not welcome in most Southern Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the denomination apologized to blacks for 150  
years of tolerating racism. It now has an estimated 2,800 churches 
with mostly black members -- a tiny sliver of the thousands of black 
Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The new outreach plan is less about reconciliation than growth,  
said the Rev. David Key, director of Baptist Studies at Emory 
University's Candler School of Theology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Southern Baptists have not been successful in an urban  
setting,'' he said. ``They want to be more than a white Southern 
rural denomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Southern Baptists are looking forward to more fervor  
than fighting at this year's gathering in the Georgia Dome. They 
are hoping for an end to the battles between conservatives and 
moderates of recent years, and they said they don't expect more 
grand announcements, like the 1997 Disney boycott or the decision 
to target Jews for proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you are going to see in this convention is a return to  
normalcy,'' said the Rev. Timothy George, dean of Beeson Divinity 
School at Sanford University in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson, who helped engineer a conservative resurgence in the  
convention, is expected to be re-elected without opposition, and 
many moderates are sitting this convention out. Attendance is not 
expected to exceed 14,000. It was once as high as 45,519 people, in 
Dallas in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson has long been critical of President Clinton, who is a  
Southern Baptist, and has called on the president's home church to 
discipline him for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	During a radio show Monday, Patterson made similar comments,  
saying the president should be disciplined for calling for the 
observance of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Clinton have addressed criticism from Patterson by  
saying the president disagrees with his church's stands on several 
issues.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- How difficult is it switching positions in  
the middle of the Stanley Cup finals? It appears to be a snap for 
Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars' defenseman expects to see some action at  
forward on the top line with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen in Game 
4 on Tuesday night because of a groin injury to Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen some spot duty (at forward),'' Sydor said. ``I've  
been with these guys before, and I know what my role is. It gives 
me more freedom with the puck, be a little more creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor said his role will be ``to bring energy and physical  
(play) to the line. I'll try to make some room for Mike and Jere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor wasn't sure how much action he would see on the top line,  
but ``right now I'm thinking about being a forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor was asked if he found anything different at Monday's  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, they passed to me,'' said Sydor of his new linemates.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARINE MIDLAND MELTDOWN:* Players in the Stanley Cup finals  
have said the ice couldn't be any worse than it was at Reunion 
Arena in Dallas. They hadn't played in Buffalo yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' Curtis Brown said it was actually worse at Marine  
Midland Arena for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	How bad was it?  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to control the puck was to put in your pocket, it  
was bouncing so much,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRAIGHT TALKER:* Buffalo's Dixon Ward just loves talking to  
the press. His teammates love it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we don't feel like talking, he takes some of the pressure  
off the rest of us,'' Rob Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
	What do the Sabres think about Ward's relationship with  
reporters? 
</P>
<P>
	``Well,'' Ray said with a straight face, ``no one will talk to  
him at home, and we won't talk to him here, so he has to have 
someone to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *INFORMATION, PLEASE:* While the Buffalo Sabres went through  
their morning skate at the Marine Midland Arena on Monday, there 
was a ``spy'' watching them -- Ken Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars coach had a cup of coffee in his hand and was  
standing in the entrance way to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any line changes?'' Hitchcock asked a reporter.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a secret,'' the reporter responded.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TWO FOR ONE:* If the Dallas Stars win the Stanley Cup, it will  
mean two Cups in a short time for Rick Wilson's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Son Landon Wilson, a right wing with Providence of the AHL, just  
won the Calder Cup when the Bruins wrapped their series in five 
games against the Rochester Americans. Rick Wilson, of course, is 
the Stars' assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COMING OF AGE:* Is age a factor as the Stanley Cup finals get  
deeper into the series? That question was posed to Buffalo Sabres 
coach Lindy Ruff, whose team's average age is about three years 
younger than the Dallas Stars and theoretically would have the 
``younger'' legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking that theory earlier, but not any more,'' said  
Ruff, whose Sabres trail the Stars 2-1 in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUFFED UP:* Lindy Ruff was asked if there was a sense of  
impending doom in Buffalo regarding his team, considering that the 
Sabres were not only down 2-1 in the Stanley Cup finals but also 
unable to generate much offense against the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been out on the town,'' Ruff said, then quipped  
after a pause, ``It seems like you guys have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff didn't stop there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I was playing with my two 4-year-olds on their  
bikes. They're OK with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WRIST SHOT:* Ever since Dallas center Mike Modano had his left  
wrist injured in Game 2 of the finals, the Buffalo Sabres have said 
they would make it a target. They went after it in Game 3, to no 
avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of padding on it, they can whack all they  
want,'' Modano said Monday, displaying a heavily padded wrist. ``It 
didn't bother me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WATCHING HIMSELF:* Brett Hull didn't skate in Monday's Dallas  
Stars practice because of his groin injury, but did watch his 
teammates from the bench in a warmup jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the funniest practice I had all year,'' Hull said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP:* Dallas goalie Ed Belfour loves the way  
his teammates block shots in front. He also hates it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating at times,'' Belfour said. ``I'll be yelling  
for them to get out and let me see the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' shot-blocking ability helped them limit the Sabres to  
12 shots in Game 3, tying a Stanley Cup finals record.

<HEADLINE>  Huang Arraigned on Conspiracy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang has  
been arraigned on a conspiracy charge as part of a plea bargain 
reached after he helped the government's campaign finance 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to plead guilty in federal court next Monday.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Man Testifies in Reggie Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man with past drug convictions testified Monday  
he saw Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis snort a ``white, powdery 
substance'' in a restaurant bathroom a year before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald J. Marks, 49, told the jury in the malpractice trial  
stemming from Lewis' death that he witnessed the drug use in the 
bathroom of a Saugus pizza restaurant during a Celtics benefit 
auction in July 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks said he saw Lewis standing with an unidentified man, who  
was holding the substance up to the player's nostril. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sniffing that white, powdery substance'' said Marks, a  
Celtics fan attended the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis died of a cardiac arrhythmia while practicing jump shots  
in July 1993. His widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, sued Dr. Gilbert Mudge 
and two consultants, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated the 
NBA All-Star's heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge said publicly that Lewis suffered from a neurological  
fainting condition, even after a team of top doctors diagnosed him 
with a potentially fatal cardiac problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible cocaine use by Lewis has been a central issue at the  
trial since Mudge testified last week that Lewis confessed to past 
drug use two weeks before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of Mudge's defense argument is that the belated  
admission made an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys on Monday also read the sworn deposition  
testimony of Wayne Lebeaux, a former Celtics ball boy and equipment 
manager, who said he smoked marijuana with Lewis at a Maine 
basketball camp in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Harris-Lewis attacked Marks' credibility and cited  
his criminal history, which includes drug offenses and an alleged 
attack on his wife, who says in court documents that he tried to 
run her over with a car and sprayed Lysol in her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert Harley also suggested that Marks' Celtics season  
tickets were revoked by the team after Marks tried to give packets 
of white powder to the wives or girlfriends of two players. Marks 
denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Lebeaux, plaintiff's attorneys suggested he was bitter  
after being fired by the Celtics in 1997 after more than 15 years 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, now in its seventh week, could be in the hands of the  
jury by Thursday as the defense wraps up its case.

<HEADLINE> School Building Costs Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As school districts struggle to fix or build  
new schools for growing student enrollments, lawmakers are touting 
plans to help ease the burden on taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida wants to use private  
investors to build public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration says its school  
construction proposals were validated by government figures showing 
that states and local districts are spending and borrowing billions 
of dollars more for public school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school  
construction in 1996, the latest year for which data was available, 
according to Census Bureau data released Monday. The districts 
spent $15.9 billion in 1995 and $14.4 billion in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tremendous need as evidenced by these figures,''  
said Julie Green, the Education Department spokeswoman. ``And it's 
a problem in many different communities -- city, suburban or 
rural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One third of America's schools, about 25,000 schools, are in  
need of at least one major repair, according to the General 
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said a Clinton administration plan would address the need  
to fix existing school buildings. The plan would make construction 
and repair of more than 6,000 schools cheaper for states and 
districts by providing federal tax credits to pay the interest on 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's plan, meanwhile, would cut red tape, said the senator's  
spokesman, Chris Hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It decreases the time in which schools can be built,'' Hand  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who oversees tax policy for the  
House, has a similar plan to create more money for school 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide enrollment of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade  
students reached 44.8 million in 1996, up from 44.1 million 
students in 1995 and 43.5 million in 1994, according to the Census 
data, available on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census data also indicate that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Texas, New York, and Florida spent the most among the states.  
Texas spent $2 billion, followed by New York and Florida at $1.6 
billion each. 
</P>
<P>
	--School systems in five states borrowed more than $1 billion  
each for building construction, reconstruction and refinancing: 
Texas, $2.7 billion; Pennsylvania, $2.5 billion; New York, $1.9 
billion; Illinois, $1.5 billion, and Florida, $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Individual state governments contributing the largest  
percentage of education revenues were Hawaii, which, unlike other 
states, has a single, state-run school system, 90 percent; New 
Mexico, 73 percent, and Delaware, Michigan and Washington, 68 
percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	--States spending the highest average amount per pupil were New  
Jersey, $9,208; the District of Columbia, $8,510; and New York, 
$8,374. The average nationwide was $5,656. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of local government finances includes revenues,  
expenditures and debt for public elementary and secondary school 
systems with more than 15,000 students. The figures, which have not 
been adjusted for price and wage changes occurring throughout the 
years, are also not subject to sampling error.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang has  
been arraigned on a conspiracy charge as part of a plea bargain 
reached after he helped the government's campaign finance 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to plead guilty in federal court next Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of a year's probation, 500

<HEADLINE> 'Mrs. Brady' To Be Television Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mrs. Brady is coming to morning television.  
</P>
<P>
	Florence Henderson, the actress who played Carol Brady in the  
1970s situation comedy ``The Brady Bunch,'' will be a co-host of 
``Later Today,'' the NBC News show that's set to premiere this 
fall, an NBC executive who asked not to be identified said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be paired with Jodi Applegate of NBC News and Asha Blake,  
former anchor at KNBC-TV, the network's Los Angeles affiliate, the 
executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson played a widowed mom with three daughters who married  
an architect with three sons on ``The Brady Bunch.'' The comedy ran 
on ABC from 1969-1974 and became something of a camp classic and 
the subject of two 1990s movie spoofs. 
</P>
<P>
	She replayed the role twice in two short-lived series, during  
1977 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson also has a history in morning TV: she was a ``Today  
girl'' in 1959 when Dave Garroway was the host, contributing 
interviews and features to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later Today,'' as the title suggests, is set to follow  
``Today'' in NBC's morning schedule and will be modeled after the 
lighter fare in that show's last hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate is now a host of ``Weekend Today.'' NBC is expected to  
appoint Soledad O'Brien to replace her on that show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News had no comment on the report.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Kevin Costner, in town over the weekend to  
see his alma mater in the College World Series, invited players to 
a screening of his new baseball film. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, who rooted for his Cal State Fullerton Titans and the  
Stanford Cardinal on Saturday, also attended the screening of ``For 
The Love of The Game,'' signing autographs for a long line of 
players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the film, Costner plays an aging pitcher who is throwing a  
perfect game against the New York Yankees. The film is set over the 
course of the game, with flashbacks to a love story and other 
scenes. Former Fullerton coach Augie Garrido, a longtime Costner 
pal, plays the Yankees' manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was fabulous,'' said current Titan coach George  
Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Costner fans, especially women, will appreciate key  
locker room and shower scenes. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Book: Clinton Excuses Irked Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of President Clinton's lawyers hit the  
roof when he heard the president might argue that he was truthful 
when he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
because oral sex did not fit the definition, a new book says. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do this,'' the book quotes lawyer Robert Bennett as  
telling a Clinton adviser. ``It's insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton made that argument anyway, in testimony to  
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr's grand jury. And Clinton's 
assertion that oral sex was not a sexual act helped him escape 
removal from office in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone conversation between Bennett and Clinton adviser Mickey  
Kantor is recounted in ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of 
Watergate,'' by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. The 
Associated Press obtained a copy in advance of Tuesday's release of 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Another passage shows Starr standing firm in his determination  
to send a report to the House full of explicit detail on Clinton's 
relationship with the former intern, despite attempts by some on 
his staff to have him focus on the president's alleged legal 
wrongdoing and go easy on the sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's lengthy narrative ``shows how pathetic Clinton is,  
that he needs therapy, not removal,'' the book quotes Starr lawyer 
Brett Kavanaugh as saying. ``Our job is not to get Clinton out (of 
office). It's just to give information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr is said to have dug in, telling staff members: ``I  
love the narrative!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reconstructing events behind the drawn-out Lewinsky affair,  
Woodward quotes private conversations among leading players that he 
says came from at least one source -- in most cases unidentified. In 
an excerpt published earlier by the Post, Bennett was quoted as 
having warned Clinton bluntly that he should be honest about any 
extramarital affairs. Bennett did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett himself had laid the groundwork for parsing the legal  
meaning of sex when, in representing Clinton in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case, he had objected to a broad definition of 
sexual relations. The judge drew a more limited definition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett told Kantor he had just been throwing the usual  
legal hurdles into a case on behalf of a client and did not think 
any strategy making a distinction between types of sexual acts 
would work. 
</P>
<P>
	``These distinctions are absurd,'' he is quoted as saying.  
``This crap won't fly with anyone. ... It's awful, awful advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went on to testify to the Starr grand jury that he had  
an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but said, ``I did 
not have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be 
defined,'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed, he said he did not consider the type of relations  
the two had to fall within the definition drawn in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	A footnote: Among the acknowledgments, Woodward thanks his  
agent, Robert B. Barnett, who happens to be the law partner of 
David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Tutored on Plastic Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The group of physicians from around the  
world watched intently as Dr. William Magee Jr. detached the lower 
jaw of the 15-year-old girl, pulling it forward before filling in 
the gaps with bone from her skull. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can get the mandible forward, then she can breathe  
properly,'' Magee told his fellow plastic surgeons, who then 
peppered him with questions on technique. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 doctors and 15 anesthesiologists had come to Norfolk from  
22 countries as far as Vietnam, Colombia and Kenya for a two-week 
tutorial that would teach them how to treat children in need of 
facial reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th year of the program, run by the nonprofit humanitarian  
group Operation Smile, ends today with a trip to a local amusement 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they get from this is a sense that they have a  
responsibility to take care of people in their own country and the 
world,'' said Magee, who founded Operation Smile with his wife, 
Kathleen, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Smile also sends doctors abroad to perform free  
surgeries on children with cleft lips and other facial deformities. 
In developing countries, one child in 500 suffers from a facial 
deformity -- almost double the rate in the United States, the group 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. program allows doctors to attended lectures, present  
their own talks and practice surgical techniques on rats and 
cadavers. Begun in 1987 with about 10 doctors, this year's group of 
65 was the largest thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	``You share your ideas of what is working in your country and is  
not working well,'' said Dr. Ernesto Barbosa, a plastic surgeon 
from Colombia. ``You are learning about what people do around the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors also observed Magee perform five operations which  
were too complicated to be undertaken overseas. Among his patients 
were a 20-year-old Kenyan woman with a jaw deformity and a 
5-year-old Moroccan boy with a facial cleft. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hoang Quoc Ky of Vietnam found himself especially interested  
in the craniofacial surgery. His country's hospitals don't have the 
equipment needed to offer it yet, but hopes to by 2005, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see everything here, go back home and look at the budget,''  
Ky said. ``We get equipment step by step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important as imparting practical knowledge, Magee said,  
is to help doctors ``realize they are part of this international 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ostensibly, it's all based around medicine,'' Magee said.  
``But what they get is a lot more.''

<HEADLINE> Corpse Found on NYC Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A subway train picked up and dropped off scores  
of passengers Monday morning before anyone notified officials there 
was a dead body on board, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead man, believed to be in his 40s, was reported shortly  
before noontime. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know where the man boarded the train,  
but believe he was dead for four to five hours. It was not clear 
how long the train had been running that morning. 
</P>
<P>
	They speculate that no one noticed him because the train was so  
crowded and people in too much of a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how many people sleep on the train during morning  
rush?'' subway rider Mario Licari said. ``Unless the guy slumps 
into me, I just leave him alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man was wearing jeans, a polo shirt, black boots and had on  
him 20 cents, a watch and a comb. No identification was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the body had no visible signs of a struggle  
or attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transit Authority did not return a telephone call seeking  
comment. The man died on a train that runs from the southern tip of 
Manhattan to the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was turned over to the medical examiner to determine  
the cause of death.

<HEADLINE> Accused Nazi Leaves US for Lithuania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chicago-area man accused of guarding a  
facility where Jewish men, women and children were executed during 
World War II has left the United States for Lithuania, the Justice 
Department announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincas Valkavickas, 78, agreed to leave rather than face a civil  
trial in immigration court for assisting in the persecution of 
civilians as a member of the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Valkavickas left the United States under an agreement admitting  
that in 1950 he concealed and misrepresented his service with the 
police. The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations 
initiated the case against Valkavickas in immigration court last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Auxiliary police battalions were created by the Nazis in 1941 to  
assist with the German occupation of Lithuania. The Justice 
Department said that in two days in October 1941 in Sviencionys, 
Lithuania, Valkavickas was on duty at a former military 
installation known as the Polygon where 3,700 Jews were executed by 
gunfire.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Discuss Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton talked with Boris Yeltsin  
today to try to clear up the confusion over Russia's role in 
postwar Kosovo after Moscow's surprise decision to send in troops 
without coordinating with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders talked by telephone in a follow-up to an  
hourlong conversation on Sunday. In addition, Vice President Al 
Gore talked with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to talk with Russian 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are concerned Russia's move could undermine  
NATO's effort to take an evenhanded approach to emptying the 
province of Serb troops and securing the return of ethnic Albanian 
refugees to their shattered villages. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Russian forces  
``jumped the gun'' and deployed earlier than expected after Yeltsin 
issued a general deployment order. Lockhart played down the 
incident, saying, ``It's easy to make more of this than you should. 
... This is not a militarily significant event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's plan, based on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's  
agreement to withdraw his military and allow an international force 
into Kosovo as peacekeepers, now must be adjusted to account for 
Russia's deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure that this agreement stands, and it cannot  
stand if there is going to be a posture struck by the Russians that 
they are there to defend the Serb population against the 
Kosovars,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has traditional ties to the Serbs, who are a minority in  
Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians in the province endured months of 
violent expulsions by Serb army troops and special police, 
resulting in hundreds of thousands fleeing into neighboring 
Macedonia and Albania, where they await NATO's signal to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other Clinton administration officials said they  
welcome Russian participation in the peacekeeping force for Kosovo, 
known as KFOR, but they stressed that the Russians must not act 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are part of ... (KFOR), then we can manage whatever  
their affections or affiliations might be with the Serbs,'' Cohen 
said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' He said the administration was 
surprised and disappointed the Russian troops entered Kosovo ahead 
of NATO despite an agreement not to. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other administration officials spoke optimistically of  
resolving the Russia issue. They reported progress on an 
arrangement that would allow the Russian military to play a 
peacekeeping role without undermining NATO control, possibly using 
the Bosnia peacekeeping operation as a model. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Yeltsin, in an hourlong telephone conversation  
Sunday, agreed their generals should work out a role for the first 
200 or so Russian troops that already are in Kosovo while talks 
continue on command arrangements for a larger Russian contingent, 
White House spokesman Mike Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead Russian troops arrived Saturday in the Kosovo capital  
of Pristina ahead of alliance forces. On Sunday, the Russians 
blocked NATO from reinforcing British troops at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said the  
United States was considering giving the Russians ``a zone of 
responsibility'' under NATO command. After a third day of talks 
Sunday, Talbott left for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said U.S. and Russian officials had worked out a ``framework'' for 
agreement that would enable the Russian troops to participate in 
Kosovo. Details were still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Yeltsin planned to talk again today.  
</P>
<P>
	The first of about 400 American paratroopers from the 82nd  
Airborne Division crossed into Kosovo from Macedonia to join the 
peacekeeping operation Sunday, accompanied by tanks and Bradley 
armored vehicles, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marines entered Kosovo this morning, with the U.S. contingent  
eventually totaling 7,000 of the 50,000 NATO peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. forces will patrol a section of southeastern Kosovo. Other  
sections will be under the control of NATO members Germany, Italy, 
France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians had not yet accepted NATO's basic requirement for a  
single command, Cohen said. But he was optimistic an arrangement 
would be made, perhaps similar to the one used by Russia and NATO 
in Bosnia. Russian troops in Bosnia are integrated with NATO forces 
but take orders from a Russian officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore told CBS Radio on Sunday ``it would be a  
mistake to overdramatize'' the Russia problem, but he conceded that 
it was a ``step back'' on Russia's path to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia's going through a period of change right now and as you  
know there are differing voices inside Moscow,'' Gore said. 
``Overall, they're in a pattern that is best described by the old 
cliche, `One step forward, two steps back.' Of course, when they 
take the one step back, that always causes concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO troops moved into Kosovo, Serb forces continued to leave  
under the terms of an agreement reached last week. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that some 
11,000 Serb army and police personnel had left Kosovo -- about 
one-fourth of the estimated 40,000 that were there last week. 
</P>
<P>
	All Serb forces are to be gone by next Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Shootings Prompt Rise in Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Roxane Harcourt has seen firsthand a  
powerful effect of the Columbine school shooting: a bump in the 
number of requests for psychiatric help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to open up 12 more beds in the last six weeks for  
adolescents and children,'' said Harcourt, chief operating officer 
of Charter Indianapolis Health Care System. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has seen a 30 percent increase in patients under 17  
in the past six weeks, Harcourt said. And Charter Indianapolis 
isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health clinics and therapists across the country say  
they've seen a surge of younger patients since the April 20 
shootings as concerned parents and educators seek help for kids 
whom they suspect of emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has seen  
calls to its referral service more than double over the first five 
months of 1999 from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan Behavioral Health, which refers 64 million adults and  
children to mental-health programs nationwide, said its calls in 
May jumped 25 percent over the same month the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that people all across the country are so shaken by  
this incident that they're not taking any chances,'' said Erin 
Somers, a spokeswoman for Magellan, which is based in Columbia, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre in Littleton, in which two students killed 12  
classmates, a teacher and themselves, followed other fatal 
school-related shootings in recent years in Pearl, Miss., West 
Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``People and schools have become more aware that mental illness  
is out there,'' said Mary, whose 12-year-old son threatened another 
student and was diagnosed with manic depression shortly before the 
Littleton shootings. The secretary from Alexandria, Va., asked that 
her full name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, Danny, told a fellow sixth-grader at his school last  
December that he planned to ``get a gun and kill her.'' That got 
Danny suspended for five days. At the time, even though he was 
being treated for depression, no one knew he suffered from bipolar 
disorder, a disease that produces extreme mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now since Littleton, the school is more aware that kids suffer  
from mental illness,'' said Mary. ``If it happened now, they would 
have demanded Danny get a psychological evaluation before coming 
back to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Danny would have been helped sooner, she believes.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gault, a child psychiatrist in the Chicago suburb of  
Northbrook, Ill., said he has received 15 referrals from schools to 
evaluate students over the past seven weeks, compared to the one or 
two he normally receives in the waning weeks of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never had this  
many,'' Gault said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fassler, a child psychiatrist in Burlington, Vt., noted  
that despite heightened concerns, more needs to be done to treat 
mentally ill children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only one child in four receives the help they need,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mr. Whipple, who donned his grocer's apron to  
beseech generations of shoppers to ``Please don't squeeze the 
Charmin,'' is back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is returning to one of its most successful  
advertising campaigns to introduce a new version of its Charmin 
bathroom tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Wilson, 82, who debuted as Mr. Whipple in 1964, will come  
out of retirement for the new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson made the slogan ``Please don't squeeze the Charmin'' a  
household phrase in more than 500 commercials over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 30-second spots feature ``Whipple'' as a mystery man  
with his back to viewers as he talks to golf buddies, poker pals 
and his wife about coming out of retirement. Whipple turns to 
reveal his face and says he needs to go back to work to spread the 
word about the new Charmin.

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Manager Needs Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker will undergo brain surgery Tuesday  
to remove a mass of malformed blood vessels that caused his seizure 
in the Houston Astros dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager spoke with general manager Gerry  
Hunsicker on Monday and said he did not recall anything after the 
second inning of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Larry this morning, and he was coherent and very  
positive and encouraged,'' Hunsicker said. ``He was kind of joking 
around, but he said the last couple of days he had severe headaches 
and that was unusual for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker went into violent convulsions in the eighth inning of  
the game against the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. Players and 
coaches restrained him until medical personnel arrived and took him 
to Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Monday revealed he had an arteriovenous malformation -- a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, they can become 
dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure neural tissue 
or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That blood vessel mass is what triggered Larry's seizure,''  
Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seriousness of Dierker's diagnosis, it's not as bad  
as his players thought. They left the Astrodome Sunday night 
thinking Dierker had a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary to hear that he might have a tumor,'' right  
fielder Derek Bell said. ``You couldn't eat or sleep last night. It 
was great to see that he is okay. Now we can go out and do what he 
trained us to do the last three years, have fun and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante, who will be interim manager, also  
visited Dierker in the hospital and was elated to find his manager 
in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded good and was very optimistic about the surgery,''  
Galante said. ``We even kind of joked some. I told him I didn't 
realize I was so boring that I put him to sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell said the whole team was relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, we heard it was a tumor and that's life and  
death,'' Bagwell said. ``This morning, they said it's not a tumor, 
that it was something that was not an easy operation but they felt 
it had a good success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Craig Biggio said Dierker told him he thought he  
could be back in uniform in two weeks, although Astros personnel 
wouldn't speculate about Dierker's' return. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of shocked us to hear him say that,'' Biggio said.  
``That's good that he's thinking like that but we just want him to 
be healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said he was told by doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5  
-- with 1 the least serious -- Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also told Hunsicker the mass -- about 1 1/2 inches in  
diameter -- was located in a less-critical part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante worked his first game as interim manager Monday night  
against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. Hunsicker does not 
know how long Dierker will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Manager Needs Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker will undergo brain surgery Tuesday  
to remove a mass of malformed blood vessels that caused his seizure 
in the Houston Astros dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager spoke with general manager Gerry  
Hunsicker on Monday and said he did not recall anything after the 
second inning of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Larry this morning, and he was coherent and very  
positive and encouraged,'' Hunsicker said. ``He was kind of joking 
around, but he said the last couple of days he had severe headaches 
and that was unusual for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker went into violent convulsions in the eighth inning of  
the game against the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. Players and 
coaches restrained him until medical personnel arrived and took him 
to Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Monday revealed he had an arteriovenous malformation -- a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, they can become 
dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure neural tissue 
or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That blood vessel mass is what triggered Larry's seizure,''  
Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seriousness of Dierker's diagnosis, it's not as bad  
as his players thought. They left the Astrodome Sunday night 
thinking Dierker had a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary to hear that he might have a tumor,'' right  
fielder Derek Bell said. ``You couldn't eat or sleep last night. It 
was great to see that he is okay. Now we can go out and do what he 
trained us to do the last three years, have fun and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante, who will be interim manager, also  
visited Dierker in the hospital and was elated to find his manager 
in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded good and was very optimistic about the surgery,''  
Galante said. ``We even kind of joked some. I told him I didn't 
realize I was so boring that I put him to sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell said the whole team was relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, we heard it was a tumor and that's life and  
death,'' Bagwell said. ``This morning, they said it's not a tumor, 
that it was something that was not an easy operation but they felt 
it had a good success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Craig Biggio said Dierker told him he thought he  
could be back in uniform in two weeks, although Astros personnel 
wouldn't speculate about Dierker's' return. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of shocked us to hear him say that,'' Biggio said.  
``That's good that he's thinking like that but we just want him to 
be healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said he was told by doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5  
-- with 1 the least serious -- Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also told Hunsicker the mass -- about 1 1/2 inches in  
diameter -- was located in a less-critical part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante worked his first game as interim manager Monday night  
against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. Hunsicker does not 
know how long Dierker will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``All we can do now is take the lead from the doctors that 
his prognosis is excellent, but there's no way we can put a 
timetable on his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker told Hunsicker he was unable to recall Bell's  
sixth-inning grand slam, which put the Astros ahead 4-1.

<HEADLINE> Illinova, Dynegy Agree to $2B Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Midwestern electric utility Illinova Corp.  
and energy marketer Dynegy Inc. are merging in a $2 billion deal 
they say will create a national leader in the rapidly changing 
energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new firm, to be called Dynegy, will create a full-service  
energy company with $7.5 billion in annual revenue, the companies 
said in a joint statement released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boards have unanimously approved the merger plans, which  
must be approved by federal and state regulators and shareholders 
for each company. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be based in Houston, where Dynegy is  
currently based. Illinois Power, an Illinova subsidiary that serves 
about 650,000 electric and natural gas customers in central 
Illinois, will keep its Decatur headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Dynegy shareholders will receive either  
0.69 share in the new company for each Dynegy share or $16.50 in 
cash per Dynegy share. Illinova shareholders will exchange their 
shares on a share-for-share basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, will keep  
his titles in the new company. Charles Bayless, Illinova's 
chairman, president and chief executive, will be a nonexecutive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strategic combination creates tremendous opportunities  
for each company much faster than either could have achieved on a 
stand-alone basis,'' Watson said. ``Energy convergence is rapidly 
sweeping across the nation and is a major driver for energy 
industry competition and consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illinova announced a tentative deal earlier this year to sell  
its troubled Clinton nuclear power plant to AmerGen Energy Co. for 
$20 million -- about $4 billion less than it cost to build. Until 
its restart last month, the plant had been idle for more than two 
years, siphoning millions of dollars from the struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dynegy, with its experienced leadership and proven track  
record of risk management, profitability and growth, is the ideal 
strategic partner for Illinova,'' Bayless said. ``I am confident 
that, together, we will be a leader in the rapidly evolving energy 
marketplace of the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy, known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse until a year ago,  
began in 1985 as a wholesale marketer of natural gas. In the past 
few years, it has become a full-scale energy marketer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy's major shareholders -- Chevron Corp.; BG PLC, parent of  
British Gas; and Nova Chemicals -- have agreed to the merger, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to close by the end of the first quarter  
in 2000.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's exports showed improvement in May for the  
first time this year, rising to $15.53 billion, or 4.2 percent 
higher than the same month a year earlier, official media reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising exports -- reflecting some recovery in regional demand  
-- created a strong trade surplus that lends stability to the 
Chinese currency, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose in May to $13.66 billion, up 21.5 percent from the  
year-earlier total. That left a surplus for the month of $1.87 
billion, nearly double the $960 million surplus registered in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound in exports followed declines in the first four  
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five months of 1999, exports fell 5.3 percent from  
the year-earlier total to $67.55 billion, according to figures 
released by Chinese customs and reported by the Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose 15.3 percent in the January-May period to $60.48  
billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $7.07 billion, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had worried that the narrowing trade gap might pressure  
Beijing into devaluing the yuan to make Chinese products more 
competitive on world markets. Senior Chinese officials have 
repeatedly promised to keep the currency's exchange rate steady in 
1999.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 72.82  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed today as a recovery in the  
bond market pushed blue chips higher, but poor-performing Internet 
shares carried the Nasdaq composite index lower. The Dow Jones 
industrials closed up 72.82 at 10,563.33. The Nasdaq fell 35.62 to 
2,412.26. Several factors helped calm some jittery investors who 
had sold stocks down sharply last week, largely over concerns that 
the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates to prevent the 
economy from overheating. Bonds rose today for the first time in 
two weeks after the Bank of Japan intervened in the global currency 
markets by buying dollars to slow the advance of the yen. In 
another development, Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin said 
inflation worries in the United States are exaggerated.

	Greenspan Cautious on Productivity  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned  
Congress today that the productivity that has played a considerable 
role in keeping inflation low cannot last forever. Private analysts 
interpreted his remarks as a hint of future Fed increases to slow 
the economy. They said Greenspan was likely to make that warning 
more explicitly when he appears before Congress again on Thursday. 
David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New 
York, and other economists noted signs of economic rebound in Japan 
and other countries, and said Greenspan is likely to signal that 
U.S. interest rates will need to be increased to slow the U.S. 
economy.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr. warned  
Congress against hastily enacting legislation to govern the 
fast-changing technology industry, saying that policies rushed into 
place today could become obsolete quickly. Gerstner, speaking at 
the Joint Economic Committee's High Tech Summit, said the rise of 
networks that connect people around the world already has begun to 
transform education, business and government. But he estimated that 
this process is only about one-sixth of the way complete, and that 
more information is needed to develop a model for public policy.

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- National contract talks began today  
between the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co., which enjoys 
the best union relations among Detroit's automakers and may set the 
standard for an economic package for the start of a new century. 
Among the key issues for the industry this year is a change in 
manufacturing that could rely more heavily on components made by 
lower-paid workers who are not members of the UAW. Health and 
safety, job security, wages and benefits remain perennial major 
considerations. The triennial negotiations kicked off with 
ceremonial handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford 
headquarters. Similar ceremonies are set for tomorrow at 
DaimlerChrysler and Wednesday at GM.

development dashed hopes that Worm.Explore.Zip might be contained 
more quickly than the recent Melissa outbreak. Last week, the 
primary means of infection seemed to be through a friendly e-mail 
that tricks the recipient into opening an attached file, uncaging 
Worm.Explore.Zip. But in addition to ruining files stored on an 
individual computer, the virus apparently ``worms'' its way into 
other computers linked to the same network server.

Qwest's stock, reducing the value of the initial $55 billion deal

two companies' agreements to be acquired by Global Crossing Inc., 
and could start a bidding war between Qwest and Global Crossing. 
The two companies are fighting to be the first to build a global 
network of high-speed fiber optic cables that will bring consumers 
and businesses a host of video, audio and Internet services. Qwest 
stock was at 34 1/8, down 10 3/4. U S West was at 58, up 3 1/8. Frontier was

and consolidates its position in Europe, promises to increase 
competition in the British retail sector. ``Retailers over here are 
scared of Wal-Mart,'' said retail analyst Richard Hyman of the 
London firm Verdict. ``It's of a size that's beyond the experience 
of everyone else. Things will never be the same again. Wal-Mart's

<HEADLINE> Intel Set To Face Job-Creation Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) -- In the past decade Intel's billion-dollar  
computer chip plants have transformed this sleepy farm town into a 
silicon forest of high-paying jobs, new subdivisions and rush-hour 
traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, having found out that it's possible to have too much of a  
good thing, the locals are offering Intel a new set of tax breaks 
that contain a unique proviso: Don't create too many jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a $200 million tax-break package expected to be  
approved Tuesday, the county will, in effect, fine Intel $1,000 for 
every manufacturing job created over a cap of 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unprecedented answer to the problem of too much economic  
development, too fast. And it comes at a time when other 
communities are going to extremes to attract big businesses and the 
jobs they bring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not against growth,'' said Washington County spokesman  
Walter Peck. ``We just want them to grow responsibly. We're in the 
catbird seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has 11,000 employees in Washington County, including 4,000  
manufacturing jobs at three chip plants and one mother-board 
factory. Intel's employees constitute the biggest single-company 
work force in the state and are the linchpin of an electronics 
manufacturing industry that has helped give Oregon the nation's 
fastest-growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials in this suburban Portland county say all those  
employees come with a price and taxpayers shouldn't keep footing 
the bill for new roads, schools, water lines and police. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of people in the community concerned about  
the quality of life,'' said Tom Brian, chairman of the Washington 
County Commission. ``They want to preserve wetlands, open spaces, 
not have streets crowded with traffic. Our community is very 
sensitive to rapid growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsboro has seen its population increase from 45,000 to 68,000  
in just the last three years. Already, freeway interchanges are 
choked with encroaching strip malls, and newly paved boulevards 
stand ready for future rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in it once, and I don't want to live it again, with  
the industry, crowds, traffic, higher assessments,'' said Sharon 
Cornish, a Los Angeles transplant who moved north in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The employment ceiling at Intel is part of a state tax break  
known as the Strategic Investment Program, which is designed to 
ease the property tax burden on companies making big investments. 
</P>
<P>
	It lures companies with the promise of an initial $100 million  
cap on the taxable value of a company's investment in plants and 
equipment. That means big savings for Intel, which plans to spend 
$12.5 billion to retool its plants, a procedure it has to go 
through every two or three years just to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the SIP were not approved, what Washington County would see  
is a dwindling Intel manufacturing presence here,'' said Bill 
Mackenzie, spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company. 
``We're not talking about picking up and moving out the next day, 
but a gradual process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the new job clause worries some local officials who say  
it could set a troublesome trend for a county that held 
unemployment to a modest 3.9 percent last year, compared with 6 
percent for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion that employers have to pay a premium for bringing  
in additional employees could set the wrong tone,'' said state Rep. 
Jim Hill of Hillsboro. ``That's where I don't want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel agreed to the 5,000-employee cap partly because it doesn't  
foresee hiring more than 1,000 additional floor workers anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not saying you can't grow. It's just saying if you do,  
you're going to pay this additional fee,'' Mackenzie said. ``They 
would be taxing us over and above what we already would pay in 
terms of local growth, roads and sewers. It simply adds additional 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-growth activists say the county should have driven a harder  
bargain with Intel, which had $6.07 billion in profits in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Each new resident sets the county back roughly $33,000 in  
infrastructure costs, said Andy Kerr, president of Alternatives to

	``When you run the numbers, the taxpayers are still getting  
screwed,'' he said. ``All we're doing is trading nickels. What is 
$1,000 going to do to provide an infrastructure for new workers? 
It's a drop in the bucket.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing: $1.38 Trillion on New Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- Boeing expects airlines to invest  
$1.38 trillion on new commercial airplanes during the next 20 years 
with the largest amount -- more than $570 billion -- going for 
intermediate, twin-aisle airplanes, such as the 767 and 777. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-aisle airplanes are a close second, with regional jets,  
747 and larger airplanes accounting for the smallest dollar 
investments, according to the 1999 Boeing Current Market Outlook, 
released today at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	A trend toward more non-stop flights between more cities will  
drive airlines to invest 87 percent of their airplane dollars in 
regional and single-aisle airplanes, such as 717s, 737s and 757s, 
and long-range twin-aisle jets smaller than the 747, said Randy 
Baseler, vice president of marketing for the Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook, considered the leading industry forecast of  
worldwide air travel growth and new-airplane demand, predicts: 
</P>
<P>
	--The world's commercial jetliner fleet will double to 28,425  
airplanes by 2018. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of the 20,150 airplanes to be delivered over the next two  
decades, nearly three-fourths will be regional and single-aisle 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only 930 of the total deliveries will be in the 747 and larger  
category, and less than 40 percent of these will be 500-plus seat 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseler said the projections are driven by annual worldwide  
travel growth of 4.7 percent, and the anticipated replacement of 
more than 4,300 airplanes in today's fleet of 12,580 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the forecast, Latin America is the fastest-growing  
air-travel market, with traffic projected to increase by 6.9 
percent per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis reduced that region's near-term  
traffic rates, but annual growth of 6.3 percent will more than 
triple the Asia-Pacific region's traffic by 2018, the forecast 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in the largest and most established market, North  
America, is about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseler pointed to the Pacific and Europe-Asia markets as  
offering numerous opportunities for new routes best served by 
intermediate-size, twin-aisle airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the North Atlantic network, U.S. hub cities and  
major European gateways are linked to relatively few destinations 
in Asia,'' Baseler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more liberal bilateral and 'open skies' agreements are  
signed, and 777s and similar airplanes offer increased range, we 
see tremendous opportunities for international market fragmentation 
-- more frequent flights using airplanes smaller than 747s,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls for 4,400 intermediate, twin-aisle airplanes to  
be delivered during the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T: Cable To Allow More Offerings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cable companies are leading the way in offering  
consumers one place to get Internet, phone and television offerings 
and should not face regulation that would slow that down, AT&AMP;T 
Corp.'s chief executive says. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Michael Armstrong, who on Monday opened the National Cable  
Television Association's annual meeting here, said he is betting 
his company's success on its ability to provide a host of 
communications services, including super-fast Internet access, 
phone lines and interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving toward a single information opportunity,''  
Armstrong said. ``Technology, applications and devices are 
converging. Customers are simply going to get more and pay less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has made more than $100 billion in cable purchases over the  
past year, including its acquisitions of TCI and MediaOne. That 
vaulted it into the position of the nation's leading cable company, 
followed by Time Warner, Comcast and now Charter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	As the convention highlighted the accelerating switch to digital  
services that will speed development of new forms of communication, 
Armstrong argued that federal regulators should not interfere with 
companies that provide such broadband, or Internet, access. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors, including local telephone companies have argued  
cable companies should face some of the same regulations that have 
slowed their quest to provide consumers with a one-stop shopping 
communications experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong suggested companies, including local telephone  
providers and cable providers, should work together on creating new 
services or switching customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leo Hindery, president of AT&AMP;T Consumer Services, said the  
company has no additional plans to acquire another cable service. 
AT&AMP;T still would consider swapping customers to centralize services 
in a given region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Aid Group To Dole Out $5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Figuring out how to spend the nearly $5  
million in donations that poured in after the Columbine High 
massacre is proving tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a large number of victims. They all express different  
thoughts on how they think the money should be utilized and 
distributed,'' said Robin Finegan of the Colorado Organization for 
Victims' Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died in the April 20 rampage: the two teen-age  
gunmen, 12 other students and a teacher. Twenty-three others were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe more money should be given to teen-age survivors  
with mounting medical bills; others advocate equal distribution to 
survivors and the families of the dead. Some have proposed that all 
of the students who weren't wounded get a share, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in many ways a no-win situation,'' Ms. Finegan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope questionnaires handed out to victims' families  
will help provide answers as to how to dole out the donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some families say they cannot afford to wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``Monetary support should not be held hostage when there are  
real-life urgent needs that some of these families face,'' said Sam 
Riddle, a spokesman for the family of slain 18-year-old Isaiah 
Shoels. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, there are more than 30 funds devoted to medical bills,  
victims' memorials, scholarships and community counseling. The 
school district is also receiving donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations raised after the school shooting at Jonesboro, Ark.,  
totaled about $400,000, while about $450,000 was raised after the 
Springfield, Ore., attack. Some warn that with the increase in 
contributions after the Columbine attack comes the possibility of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to be vigilant, but there's always going to be an  
individual who, for whatever reason, takes advantage of a situation 
like this,'' said Kelly Cahill, a spokeswoman for the Mile High 
United Way, which has collected nearly $3.3 million in its Healing 
Fund for Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, $390,000 has been dispensed, including $5,000 to the  
families of each person killed or injured, $150,000 to support a 
mental health center and $50,000 to the Colorado victims' group. 
</P>
<P>
	But medical bills for victims continue to mount, and some  
students will probably have to undergo years of surgery and 
physical and mental therapy. Those without medical insurance are 
causing the biggest drain. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical bills for Lance Kirklin, a 16-year-old whose jaw was  
shattered by gunfire, have already topped $1 million. He was not 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Rohrbough, whose 15-year-old son Daniel was killed, said  
he wants more accountability from United Way officials on exactly 
where the money is going. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone should give a dollar to an organization  
that doesn't lay out how it's going to be spent,'' said Rohrbough, 
who was upset by a proposal to give $1,000 to more than 2,000 
uninjured students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, $5 million may sound like a lot, but when you start  
doling out $1,000 checks it goes pretty quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Co. Dynegy Acquires Illinova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- The chairman of Midwest electric utility  
Illinova Corp. on Monday said Houston-based energy marketer Dynegy 
Inc. $2 billion acquisition of his company is about growth -- not 
cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two companies are an excellent strategic fit with each  
other. The merger creates tremendous opportunities for each company 
much faster than we could have achieved alone,'' chairman Charles 
Bayless said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new firm, to be called Dynegy, will be a ``full-service''  
energy company with about $17 billion in annual revenue, the 
companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boards of directors have unanimously approved the  
acquisition, which still must be approved by federal and state 
regulators and shareholders for each company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be based in Houston. Illinois Power, an  
Illinova subsidiary that serves about 650,000 electric and natural 
gas customers in central Illinois, will keep its Decatur 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to eventually eliminate about 5 percent of  
their combined work force of 6,500, or about 325 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive officer,  
said he expects the job cuts will mostly be accomplished through 
reduced hiring, attrition and options such as early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Dynegy shareholders will receive 0.69 share  
in the new company or $16.50 in cash for each Dynegy share. 
Illinova shareholders will exchange their shares on a 
share-for-share basis. Dynegy will also acquire an unspecified 
amount of Illinova debt in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson will keep his title in the new company. Bayless,  
Illinova's chairman, president and chief executive officer, will be 
a nonexecutive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this merger, I think we continue to distinguish ourselves  
as one of the few players in the business with experience in energy 
marketing and energy trading and power generation,'' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy, known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse until a year ago,  
began in 1985 as a wholesale marketer of natural gas. In the past 
few years, it has become a full-scale energy marketer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy's major shareholders -- Chevron Corp.; BG PLC, parent of  
British Gas; and Nova Chemicals -- have agreed to the merger, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron, which currently owns 29 percent interest in Dynegy,  
said it has elected to take all stock and also plans to invest 
between $200 million and $240 million in the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to close by the end of the first quarter  
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Illinova rose 31 1/4 cents to $25.62 1/2 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Shares of Dynegy fell 43 3/4 cents to $18.25, also on 
the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa May Cut 110 Mangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The German airline Lufthansa will  
phase out 110 managerial positions to offset the high cost of 
airport check-in services in Germany, the daily newspaper Die Welt 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa declined to comment on the report and on the content  
of an internal document that Die Welt cited as its source. The 
document says Lufthansa's check-in costs run 15 percent to 20 
percent higher than rival airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline plans to reduce middle-management management by not  
filling positions vacated by retirees and through transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lufthansa document criticized confusing chain-of-command and  
inefficient procedures, Die Welt said.

<HEADLINE> American Soccer Team Has Chemistry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- No cliques. No petulance. No outright  
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
	Could this really be a U.S. national soccer team?  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly. The American women, who not only are a favorite to  
win the World Cup tournament they open on Saturday against Denmark, 
but they're one big happy family. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1991, when the United States won the initial World Cup,  
into the 1995 tournament in which it placed third, then through the 
gold medal performance at the Atlanta Olympics, the women have been 
the tightest of groups. That fellowship has been a key element in 
the team's overwhelming success, something the men never have 
matched -- on the field or off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an environment to express yourself,'' said Mia Hamm, the  
game's best player and career goal-scoring leader. ``There is never 
a time you feel you are by yourself or alone. It's a powerful 
feeling of camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chemistry is not something you flick on with a switch like a  
light. It has to be nurtured. It's not like, `OK, today is team 
chemistry day.' It's more like, `We're going to set up an 
environment for you and it's what you make of it. We will not force 
it on you. Make of it what you can, or don't.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost to a woman, the players make the most of it. The core of  
the squad that will take the field Saturday at Giants Stadium has 
been together nearly a decade. Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy, 
Kristine Lilly, Tiffeny Milbrett, Joy Fawcett, Tisha Venturini and 
Carla Overbeck all have well over 100 international appearances. 
Brandi Chastain, Briana Scurry and Shannon MacMillan are closing in 
on the century mark. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of experience is a daunting weapon for any team. As  
Brazil defender Elane said of the Americans, ``Their great players 
have been together longer than many women have been playing 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such experience is important only if the lessons learned by the  
veterans are shared with the youngsters. That's where the U.S. 
women excel. Any of the kids on the squad readily will volunteer 
that they were quickly accepted by the older players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The veterans who molded the team let the people coming in know  
they have got to fit into the chemistry they've worked so hard to 
create,'' said Danielle Fotopoulos, the college career goals leader 
at Florida and now a substitute for the national team. ``Plus, they 
make everything fun for us. Practice is fun. We hang out together 
and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be very intimidating coming into any new team,  
especially one with the success rate the U.S. has had. You don't 
know where you will fit in or the personalities on the team. If 
these were not cool people who cared, it could be a nightmare. 
Instead, it's so special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the women alternate roommates when the team travels.  
That means most of the veterans have roomed with most of the 
younger, newer players. 
</P>
<P>
	During practice, coach Tony DiCicco is conscious of putting  
together a mix of youth and experience, whether it be for 4-on-4 
minigames, or for full scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the men's national team, which self-destructed during  
last year's World Cup in France, there never has been a single 
report of discord among the women's team members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess there is a bond there in the female game,'' Lilly  
said. ``We enjoy each other. We've all been in positions where we 
were the new player coming in. It can be difficult to reach out to 
players. But we all do a great job of opening doors.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks and Spurs Have No Bad Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Not a single silver-and-black-clad heckler  
awaited the New York Knicks as they arrived in town Monday for the 
NBA Finals. Not a single harsh word was spoken by the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivalry? Not even close. Enemies? Not at all.  
</P>
<P>
	This NBA Finals, at least for now, is a meeting of cordial  
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't bash anybody. That's not the Spurs. We're nice  
guys,'' San Antonio's Steve Kerr said. ``We love New York. Good 
guys vs. good guys, I think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere of mutual praise and respect lingered for another  
day as both teams continued to prepare for the start of the series 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks arrived in a city smattered with black-and-pink ``Go  
Spurs Go'' signs, and if they looked out the windows of their bus 
from the airport, they would have seen a good percentage of the 
cars with some kind of supportive message to the Spurs hand-painted 
on their windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs fever is a feel-good type of thing, with no discernible  
Knick-bashing souring the mood. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the New York tabloids couldn't help itself from taking a  
few shots at the Spurs, their city and their cheerleaders -- calling 
them 16 big-haired ladies in silver-and-pink Jetsons costumes -- but 
the animosity was far from genuine. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just a fact of these finals: There isn't really that much  
history or bad blood between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I can think of,'' David Robinson said. ``I can't  
remember any fights, no real bad attitudes. But they always played 
us real tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio and New York did not play each other during this  
lockout-shortened season, so this will be the first meeting between 
the teams since March 31, 1998 -- a game the Spurs won by 17 points 
at Madison Square Garden in large part because of injuries to 
Patrick Ewing and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real small then, real small, and they had a real  
tough time handling our inside guys,'' Robinson recalled. ``We got 
pretty much anything we wanted, I remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time the Knicks find themselves in similar straits because  
of the season-ending injury Ewing suffered in the conference finals 
and the uncertain status of whether Larry Johnson will be able to 
play with a sprained knee. Johnson and the team's doctors will make 
a game-time decision Wednesday as to whether he'll play, the Knicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Containing Robinson and Tim Duncan, an already difficult task,  
would be even more burdensome without Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing Duncan and Robinson can do is cause so much foul  
trouble. The depth factor inside is critical for us,'' Knicks coach 
Jeff Van Gundy said after the team practiced in New York before 
flying to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach and the Knicks players again refused to say if they'll  
depart from the common NBA strategy and use single-coverage rather 
than double-teams against Duncan and Robinson in the low post. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, though, they'll have to find some way to limit the  
damage the two big men can inflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take everything away from a great team or great  
players. It's not quite that black and white,'' Van Gundy said. 
``You have to figure out what you're capable of taking away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he expects to see a mix of  
single- and double-coverage. In the past, a few teams have actually 
had success using single coverage, although Popovich was giving no 
clues as to the secrets of stopping his Twin Towers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way I'll tell you that,'' he said. ``I can't remember. Bad  
memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have been following the Knicks for the past decade can  
recall one bad memory when it comes to dealing with the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on Feb. 21, 1990, New York traded second-year guard Rod  
Strickland to the Spurs for Maurice Cheeks, who was at the end of 
his career. Cheeks played only one more season, while Strickland 
has been among the league's assists leaders ever since. In fact, it 
can be argued that the Knicks haven't had a playmaker as talented 
as Strickland ever since they traded him. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all the dealmaking between the teams was so lopsided  
toward the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 8, 1996, New York sent Charles Smith and his  
injury-ravaged knee to San Antonio along with Monty Williams for 
Brad Lohaus and J.R. Reid. It turned out to be a key trade for the 
Knicks since they were able to clear Smith's salary off their 
salary cap, which gave them room to sign free agents Allan Houston 
and Chris Childs the next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's injury ended his career.  
</P>
<P>
	Those fleecings may have created some rivalries among the teams'  
front office personnel, but it has nothing to do with the current 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	There is, however, one interesting subplot among Latrell  
Sprewell of the Knicks and Jerome Kersey of the Spurs. When both 
played for Golden State, they had a fight at practice in which 
Sprewell went after Kersey with a two-by-four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that each round I keep running into old  
teammates,'' said Sprewell, who faced ex-Warriors Tim Hardaway of 
Miami and Chris Mullin of Indiana in the first and third rounds.

<HEADLINE> Mets Annoyed About Shirt Squabble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- First it was the soaked batter's box at Shea  
Stadium. Then it was the white on Jason Isringhausen's glove. On 
Monday night, it was the orange sleeves protruding from Pat 
Mahomes' jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets and the Cincinnati Reds are finding things to  
squabble over. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds manager Jack McKeon objected when Mahomes came in to pitch  
the sixth inning of Cincinnati's 8-4 victory over the Mets on 
Monday night. Unlike his teammates, Mahomes wore a bright orange 
T-shirt that extended out of his jersey sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon called it to the umpires' attention and they made Mahomes  
go into the Mets dugout and strip to the waist, swapping the orange 
shirt for a black one before coming back out to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the umpires, `He's out of uniform, isn't he?' They  
said, `Yeah, he is,''' McKeon said. ``The point is that the guy is 
out of uniform. Did you see anybody else with an orange shirt?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players are required to have identical uniforms, but Mets  
manager Bobby Valentine was annoyed by McKeon making an issue of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous, a waste of time,'' he said. ``That's what he  
(McKeon) does. He likes to do that. It's his style. Whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Valentine's comments were relayed, McKeon responded, ``I  
just play within the rules. If the rule states something, you've 
got to adhere to the rule. It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds were the ones crying foul last June 3 at Shea Stadium,  
when the batter's box was soaked before their game. The umpires 
made the grounds crew pour a drying material on it before the first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after that game whether the Mets deliberately soaked the  
field, Valentine shrugged his shoulders and didn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
	During that game, the Reds also complained about the glove of  
Mets starting pitcher Jason Isringhausen, saying there was white on 
it -- which is against baseball's rules. Valentine took a marker and 
blacked out the white on the glove.

<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Scores at Box Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Austin Powers is absolutely swinging, baby.  
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the James Bond spoof  
sequel starring Mike Myers as the sexually charged man of mystery, 
took in $54.9 million over the weekend, making more in its first 
three days than the original movie did in its entire run. 
</P>
<P>
	That knocked the latest ``Star Wars'' installment out of first  
place and accorded unlikely blockbuster status to a concept that 
started out as an in-joke Myers thought few people would get. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, everywhere you turn, somebody is trying to do his best  
Austin Powers imitation, imposing a bad English accent on his 
buzzwords: ``Oh, behave!'' and ``Yeah, baby! Yeah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stunned, it's almost surreal,'' said Mike Deluca,  
president of production at New Line Cinema, the film's distributor. 
``I think in a weird way the culture caught up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original, ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,''  
tested poorly and opened to a tepid $9.5 million in May 1997. 
People just didn't seem to understand the humor about a '60s spy 
with bad teeth, a bearskin rug of a chest and an infatuation with 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers said the idea was inspired by his late father, a  
Liverpool-born salesman who loved British comedy, from Peter 
Sellers to Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would have had to have grown up in my house to get it,''  
Myers said before the film opened. 
</P>
<P>
	But audiences warmed up to Austin's humor, and the $16  
million-budget film hung on through the summer to gross $53.9 
million and turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it went to video, where it was -- as Austin would say --  
smashing. The tape dominated the 1998 video charts, with $44 
million in sales. It spawned Austin theme parties in colleges and 
homes, and set the groundwork for the sequel, with double the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	New Line also raised expectations with trailers that poked fun  
at the hype around ``The Phantom Menace.'' Featuring Dr. Evil, also 
played by Myers, the ads tell moviegoers that if they see just one 
film this summer, go to ``Star Wars;'' but if they see two films, 
check out ``Austin Powers 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the studio launched a huge -- and risque -- promotional push,  
using carefully selected marketing partners that adopted Myers' 
peculiar brand of double-entendre-laced humor. 
</P>
<P>
	One Virgin Atlantic Airways billboard had Austin beaming, ``Five  
times a day? Yeah, baby!'' to promote the airline's five daily 
flights to London. Or a Heineken commercial had a masseuse admiring 
Austin's Heiney -- his beer, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time it opened, audiences were feeling shagadelic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Meyers is a genius. He's one of the funniest comedians  
I've ever seen,'' said Mike Rosenkrantz, a machinist from 
Chesapeake, Va., who called in sick from work Monday to catch a 
matinee in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	The sequel sends Austin back to 1969 to reclaim his stolen mojo  
-- or libido -- from Dr. Evil. Along the way, Austin falls for the 
sexy female spy Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). 
</P>
<P>
	``Good sequel. It fit right in with the previews,'' said David  
English, 22, a North Carolina State University student, outside a 
theater in Raleigh. ``I enjoyed the last one. I just thought it was 
a great comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film became the top-opening comedy (beating last year's  
``The Waterboy,'' which debuted with $39.4 million); the top June 
opener (beating ``Batman Forever'' with $52.7 million in 1995) and 
the No. 2 non-holiday weekend opener (behind only ``The Phantom 
Menace'' with $64.8 million last month). Numbers are not adjusted 
for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a `Rocky Horror Picture Show' thing on a  
larger scale,'' said director Jay Roach, who saw people lined up 
for ``Austin 2'' dressed as their favorite characters. ``It's 
Mike's spirit of joy and his love of this music and this culture, 
this color and movement. People young and old want to share it with 
him, and that's his genius.''

<HEADLINE> Road Repairs To Slow Summer Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Travelers hitting the road this summer will  
find the going slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread repair work on state and federal highways, combined  
with a record number of drivers expected to take advantage of 
still-low gas prices, threaten to make long-distance treks more 
like rush-hour commuting. 
</P>
<P>
	The red flag from experts: Do not expect to go more than 40  
miles on major roads without encountering the cones and barrels of 
a construction zone, from California's Yosemite National Park to 
Pennsylvania's Amish country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the work is the first fruit of the $203 billion highway  
bill that President Clinton signed into law a year ago Wednesday. 
The funding is a 40 percent increase over the nation's previous 
highway bill, and unlike past years, all states but Massachusetts 
saw a sizable jump in their share of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders gathered on Capitol Hill last week to  
celebrate the first anniversary of the law, which they said would 
create safer roads, ease urban congestion, alleviate suburban 
sprawl and promote mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	The joviality was accompanied by a sober warning: The added  
construction has increased the risk of traffic accidents at 
construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year more than 700 people are killed and 37,000 injured in  
such accidents. One in seven deaths involves a construction worker. 
Many involve motorists who slam into the vehicle in front of them 
when it suddenly slows for a flagman or a police officer directing 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Political leaders asked the public to be vigilant behind the  
wheel during what will be a taxing summer on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it possible that with the 43 percent increase in funding  
there will be a 43 percent increase in construction zone 
accidents?'' asked Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, the top 
Democrat on the House Transportation Committee. ``It need not 
happen, it must not happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also appealed for patience.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., the committee's chairman, added: ``What  
seems like wasted time in traffic now will mean time and lives 
saved in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roadwork itself spreads from sea to shining sea.  
</P>
<P>
	The main entrance into Yosemite is under construction, closing  
it to traffic from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. daily. The speed limit 
there has also been reduced from 35 mph to 25 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. 30 near Lancaster, Pa., a main route into the area's  
popular Amish country, has closed lanes, and backups of as much as 
30 minutes are projected. Interstate 75, a north-south route from 
Michigan to Florida, will have a dozen construction zones, and 
there will be three on I-87 around New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	On I-15 in Salt Lake City, 17 miles of road are being doubled  
from four lanes to eight in preparation for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA, the nation's largest automobile club, recommends that  
drivers plan routes around the construction zones and be ready when 
they encounter them. And the group says drivers should check their 
vehicle's cooling system, since it is more important in traffic 
because an engine doesn't get the benefit of fast-moving air. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers should also check the effectiveness of their air  
conditioning before setting out, since long delays can make a hot 
interior unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA spokesman Mitch Fuqua had one final piece of advice for this  
summer of snarl: slow down for safety's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see an orange barrel, that means there's probably  
somebody behind it doing work,'' Fuqua said.

<HEADLINE> Coles Resigns From Sydney Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Phil Coles escaped expulsion from the  
IOC but was stripped of many official duties and forced to resign 
from the Sydney 2000 organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic leaders reprimanded the Australian for ``serious  
negligence'' in compiling secret memos on his colleagues but ruled 
today that the offense did not warrant expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are extremely severe (sanctions), just short of  
expulsion,'' International Olympic Committee director general 
Francois Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles -- who was already censured in March for his role in the  
Salt Lake City scandal -- had faced the possibility of being kicked 
out of the IOC for further alleged ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The board proposed that Coles be suspended from serving on any  
IOC commission or working group for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 67, a three-time Olympian as a kayaker, has served on the  
IOC since 1982. He will lose his posts on the marketing and radio 
and television commissions. But he will continue to attend IOC 
meetings, vote in the election of Olympic host cities and attend 
the Sydney Games as an official IOC delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it was maintaining the ``most severe warning''  
which Coles received in March for accepting lavish hospitality from 
Salt Lake City bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement announced that Coles had resigned from the board  
of the Sydney organizing committee (SOCOG). Sydney organizers have 
repeatedly pushed for Coles to be ousted from the local panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC gave Coles an ultimatum -- quit the SOCOG post or be  
forced out of it. But Coles' seat on the IOC was never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the IOC decision was taken by the executive board  
Sunday and Coles was given the option to resign from the Sydney 
board. He said Coles notified the IOC of his resignation in a phone 
call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a shabby deal,'' Carrard said. ``He decided to  
resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board said it found no ``sanctionable offense'' in  
the fact that Coles and his partner, Patricia Rosenbrock, had 
written memos on IOC members. Many of the notes contained very 
personal comments on the likes and dislikes of IOC members and 
their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	The memos, prepared for the Sydney bid committee, were  
apparently passed on to Salt Lake bidders -- although Coles and Ms. 
Rosenbrock denied supplying them. 
</P>
<P>
	``By not taking all necessary precautions to avoid the  
disclosure of such notes, Mr. Coles was guilty of serious 
negligence,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carrard said there ``has never been talk of corruption in  
connection with Mr. Coles,'' and that he never profited from his 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The official report on the case suggested Coles would be kicked  
out of the IOC in the event of any further violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had temporarily stepped aside from SOCOG in February after  
being implicated in the Salt Lake vote-buying case. He was later 
stripped of his role in organizing the Olympic torch relay in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	But SOCOG chief Michael Knight and other Australian Olympic  
officials have demanded that Coles leave for good, claiming the 
scandal was detracting from the games and scaring away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Olympic rules, Coles had an automatic seat on the Sydney  
board as one of two IOC members from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Coles needed to have a ``perfect working  
relationship'' with the Sydney committee, and his resignation 
``contributed to an easing of tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper said, ``I  
sincerely hope this closes a very unfortunate chapter. I think Phil 
Coles did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coles charged that ``political pressures'' had forced  
him off the SOCOG board but said he was relieved he will keep his 
IOC position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quite an exhausting and nightmarish experience and  
there has been an orchestrated move to discredit me and have me 
removed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he believed Knight had forced his resignation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I put it on the table to the IOC that I was open for a meeting  
with Michael Knight, which obviously wasn't accepted by him, so I 
resigned,'' Coles said. ``There was never any suggestion that I 
would resign from the SOCOG board to keep my role with the IOC, 
never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was expected to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday to attend the  
IOC general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation was welcomed by SOCOG chief executive Sandy  
Hollway, among those who have urged him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said Coles' departure means ``we have now tied off the  
last significant strand of controversy affecting the Sydney Games. 
I'm very glad the IOC has drawn a line under this sad episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coles case has overshadowed other issues as the IOC meets in  
Seoul for a three-day executive board meeting, followed by a 
four-day session of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the session is Saturday's selection of the  
host city for the 2006 Winter Games. Six European cities are in the 
running.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Wants Prison Hitching Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama on Monday asked a federal judge  
for permission to resume handcuffing inmates to hitching posts in 
the hot sun when they refuse to work. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson approves the request by  
Gov. Don Siegelman, Alabama will again become the only state using 
hitching posts to restrain inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson ruled last year that the way the state was using the  
hitching posts -- leaving inmates in the sun for long hours without 
water or restroom breaks -- was unconstitutionally cruel. But he 
allowed the state to try to devise a constitutional method. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Haley, Siegelman's prison commissioner, said he believes  
the new policy proposed by the state Department of Corrections is 
constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes videotape monitoring of the hitching posts to make  
sure inmates get hourly water and restroom breaks, and it allows an 
inmate to be unhitched and to sit down the moment he agrees to go 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	But inmate attorney Rhonda Brownstein argued during a court  
hearing Monday that except for the videotaping, the Siegelman 
policy differs little from the one used during Gov. Fob James' 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restraining people this way is a form of corporal punishment  
and violates the Constitution,'' Brownstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson told the attorneys in the court hearing that he is  
reluctant to stop the Siegelman administration from trying out the 
new policy for a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court doesn't want to be a super commissioner determining  
what's good policy for the future,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson will hear more testimony about the hitching posts  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lopez Appears Twice at NYC Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her hit album ``On the 6'' is named for a New  
York City subway train, but it was by foot and by car that Jennifer 
Lopez put herself on display for adoring crowds at the Puerto Rican 
Day Parade. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress-singer strolled up Fifth Avenue for about 10 blocks  
of the parade Sunday before she ducked onto a side street to escape 
hordes of clamoring photographers. Fans watching from behind police 
barricades shouted ``Jennifer!'' and cheered as she waved and made 
her hasty exit. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the afternoon, Ms. Lopez returned to the parade -- this  
time in a top-down convertible where she looked a little more 
relaxed. A line of police officers flanked the car to keep 
photographers away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lopez, who starred in the movie ``Selena,'' was born in the  
Bronx. She named her album for the No. 6 subway train, which runs 
from her old neighborhood into Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Bush Accepts Opposition's Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- To measure Gov. George W. Bush's  
campaign advantages now that he's off his own front porch and 
``running hard'' for the White House, check his opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days into his bid for votes in New Hampshire and Iowa,  
he's drawn a Republican debate challenge, a Democratic Party 
operation to rebut him and a GOP opponent's observation that this 
shouldn't be a coronation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that the Democrats are paying attention to me,''  
Bush said Monday on his first New Hampshire swing. ``What I like to 
say is I like to talk about me and I am glad that others are 
talking about me. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must be worried.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats have assigned what politicians call a truth squad  
to track his campaign debut, disputing what he's said and done as a 
``compassionate conservative,'' his chosen label. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Steve Forbes challenged Bush to a series of five  
debates beginning next month, saying they should include all the 
GOP candidates. Debate challenges are standard for a candidate 
trying to catch a front-runner. So was Bush's brushoff. ``It is way 
too early for the debate on debates,'' said Karen Hughes, his press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to have a coronation, we're going to have a  
process here,'' Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP nominee, said in Council 
Bluffs, Iowa, on behalf of his candidate-wife. Elizabeth Dole runs 
second in the preseason polling. 
</P>
<P>
	It is very early in the season for all of this; indeed, for any  
of it. But to get going and to keep going -- with Bush commanding 
the polls and absorbing the campaign donations -- everyone else has 
to find a route past the governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his year-old lead comes with no guarantees. Running first  
and staying there has proven too much for front-running candidates 
before. Indeed, Bush came to New Hampshire in a position unmatched 
in eight campaigns -- since Sen. Edmund S. Muskie arrived as the 
towering Democratic favorite in 1972 and quickly collapsed as a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his Iowa and New Hampshire debuts, Bush was at pains to say  
that he knows he's late, and intends to work hard the rest of the 
way. ``I know how important New Hampshire is,'' he told some 900 
people at a sold-out luncheon of the Federation of Republican Women 
on Monday. ``You're first in the nation and I'm the last candidate 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his late start showed that he keeps campaign  
commitments, as when he promised Texans to do his job with the 
state legislature before he moved to the national stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm a late arriver,'' he said. ``I'm taking my front  
porch campaign to every front porch in this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those will be crowded porches. Bush draws them, and brings them  
with him. Three busloads of reporters and cameras, for example, to 
an overflow turnout at the Bow fire station. Another crowd, an 
advertised 500 supporters and campaign leaders, at a college in 
Goffstown. 
</P>
<P>
	All tightly scheduled, but with time for questions and  
predictable answers from the candidate. He was not out to break new 
ground on the issues -- ample time for detailed programs later, he 
said. Bush said his aim was to present broad themes and big issues 
to tell people what kind of president he would be. He said he'll 
have proposals for income tax cuts and more military spending, that 
he will work for free trade and better schools, that he will 
protect the dignity of the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think ``I've been pretty darn specific,'' he said on WMUR-TV  
in Manchester. But the itemized 10-point plans can come later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a long campaign, and there are a lot of hands to be  
shaken, a lot of speeches to be given,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So he broke little new ground this first trip. He endorsed  
ethanol subsidies in Iowa, where they grow the corn used to 
manufacture the fuel. In New Castle, N.H., he said he would not 
make opposition to abortion a litmus test for Supreme Court 
appointments. Bush is personally opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would not allow whatever he did in his  
admittedly reckless youth -- he won't be more specific -- to be used 
as a test of his candidacy. ``There is a game inn Washington, it is 
called gotcha,'' he said. ``It's the game where they float a rumor 
and make the candidate prove a negative, and I'm not playing the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's leading in the game he is playing. But so far is  
only a beginning.

<HEADLINE> Satan Looks To End Scoring Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Miroslav Satan is a playmaker and  
shot-maker for the Buffalo Sabres, as witness his 40 goals and 66 
points during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars, however, have limited him to one assist in the  
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to get him away from a couple of their matchups and  
tried to get him away from a couple of their defensive pairs,'' 
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said Monday. ``We tried everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have little time to tinker with their top scoring  
machine. They trail the Stars two games to one in the best-of-7 
series with Game 4 in Buffalo on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Buffalo offense is sputtering, with 29 points coming  
from defensemen Jason Woolley and Alexei Zhitnik. The Sabres can 
thank the Dallas defense for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Satan's struggle is most disturbing.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't make the mistakes that would give Satan an  
opportunity,'' Ruff said. ``Every time he steps on the ice he's 
facing three or four of their biggest defensemen. There's no way 
around that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satan's 40 goals led the Sabres during the regular season. He  
missed nine playoff games with a deep ankle bruise sustained in the 
first round but returned to form during the Eastern Conference 
finals against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Satan (pronounced SHUH-tan) appeared rejuvenated on a new line  
with veteran Joe Juneau and speedy Geoff Sanderson, but has failed 
to score in three games in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has only two shots against the Stars. Both came in 26 minutes  
of ice time in Game 3, which was more playing time than any other 
forward in the game received. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Satan has improved with additional playing time,  
and Ruff had him killing penalties and working power plays in Game 
3. The coach even tried different line combinations in an effort to 
get his regular-season star to shine again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The added ice time didn't result in a plus for us,'' Ruff  
said. ``If we're going to win the series, we need our big players 
to do something for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satan feels the heat.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel the pressure and I'll try to respond the best way I  
can,'' he said. ``But right now there's not too much room and the 
whole team is having problems creating anything in their zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres don't blame Satan for a scoring drought that is  
affecting the entire team. ``We're not putting any pressure on him 
to score,'' Sanderson said. ``That's everybody's job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking for this guy to somehow score three goals in  
Game 4,'' Juneau said. ``That's not the way it's going to happen. 
Miro, like everybody else, has to concentrate on playing well in 
our zone and being in the right position at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just going to have to battle through the checking that  
he's getting,'' Sabres center Brian Holzinger said. ``In Game 3 
there wasn't any open ice for any of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satan had two goals and an assist in Buffalo's first-round sweep  
of Ottawa before a shot by Zhitnik sidelined him in Game 3 of that 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not play in the Sabres' victory over Boston in the  
conference semifinals, and tallied one goal and three assists in 
the last three games against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Satan practiced Monday on a line with Curtis Brown and Juneau.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who's dangerous in open ice, so we're going to have  
to get him the puck when he's in open ice,'' Holzinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not on his shoulders,'' Juneau said. ``It's on  
everybody's shoulders. I don't know why it's a subject of 
conversation. He hasn't scored in the finals, but who cares. 
Everybody has to do the job.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Debated Eliminating Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives at America Online Inc. debated  
whether to stop distributing Microsoft's Internet software during 
their secret negotiations last fall to buy rival Netscape 
Communications Corp., according to e-mail disclosed Monday at 
Microsoft's antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chairman Steve Case wondered whether Microsoft might not  
retaliate ``given current antitrust attention'' if AOL switched its 
nearly 17 million subscribers to Netscape's browser, suggesting 
that the software giant might be intimidated into inaction by the 
government's legal case. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL's president and chief operating officer, Robert Pittman,  
argued to Case that Microsoft was ``too strong to throw them out of 
the tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later in another e-mail, Case asked for an analysis of the  
deal's implications, ``including an analysis of what would happen 
if we got really aggressive and swapped out'' Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer for Netscape's Navigator browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents disclosed Monday confirmed that Netscape  
currently is working to create for AOL subscribers a version of its 
browser software under the project name ``Raptor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL ultimately decided to continue distributing Microsoft's Web  
browser under a contract that runs until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden disclosed the e-mails and other  
documents Monday while questioning David Colburn, senior vice 
president of business affairs for AOL. He was called by Microsoft 
as a hostile witness during this final phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Colburn maintained Monday that AOL never seriously considered  
dropping Microsoft's browser. He said Microsoft's offer in exchange 
-- to distribute AOL's software within Windows -- was too important 
to risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Case's job is to make sure the operations people are  
thinking of all the issues,'' said Colburn, who added that AOL 
``never really did an analysis of swapping out one browser for 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson that AOL's purchase of Netscape, finalized earlier this 
year, illustrates there is sufficiently robust competition in the 
high-tech industry such that federal intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wielded its  
influence as the maker of the dominant Windows operating system to 
try to crush Netscape, one of its top software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft believes AOL could resuscitate Netscape's flagging  
popularity by distributing its software to millions. Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates wrote in a December e-mail to his employees 
that AOL will switch browsers ``sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warden called Gates' message ``a very interesting document'' and  
tried to introduce it as evidence, but the judge blocked him. The 
Justice Department's lead lawyer, David Boies, complained that the 
message was sent ``by Gates during the litigation, a self-serving 
statement.'' The Associated Press had obtained a copy of the 
message the day it was sent. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own e-mail last September, Case called AOL's choice of  
browsers a ``big, big issue to figure out'' but noted that if AOL 
distributed Netscape's browser, its share of the software market 
would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My main point is, we shouldn't assume we need or want to  
maintain (Microsoft's) as primary browser,'' Case wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pittman warned Case not to underestimate the company that  
Gates built. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can hurt us if they think they have no other option,''  
said Pittman. ``I think we need to stay in business with them, 
create a need for them to need us.''

<HEADLINE> Coles Resigns From Sydney Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Phil Coles escaped expulsion from the  
IOC but was stripped of many official duties and forced to resign 
from the Sydney 2000 organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic leaders reprimanded the Australian for ``serious  
negligence'' in compiling secret memos on his colleagues but ruled 
today that the offense did not warrant expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are extremely severe (sanctions), just short of  
expulsion,'' International Olympic Committee director general 
Francois Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles -- who was already censured in March for his role in the  
Salt Lake City scandal -- had faced the possibility of being kicked 
out of the IOC for further alleged ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The board proposed that Coles be suspended from serving on any  
IOC commission or working group for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 67, a three-time Olympian as a kayaker, has served on the  
IOC since 1982. He will lose his posts on the marketing and radio 
and television commissions. But he will continue to attend IOC 
meetings, vote in the election of Olympic host cities and attend 
the Sydney Games as an official IOC delegate. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it was maintaining the ``most severe warning''  
which Coles received in March for accepting lavish hospitality from 
Salt Lake City bid officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement announced that Coles had resigned from the board  
of the Sydney organizing committee (SOCOG). Sydney organizers have 
repeatedly pushed for Coles to be ousted from the local panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC gave Coles an ultimatum -- quit the SOCOG post or be  
forced out of it. But Coles' seat on the IOC was never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the IOC decision was taken by the executive board  
Sunday and Coles was given the option to resign from the Sydney 
board. He said Coles notified the IOC of his resignation in a phone 
call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a shabby deal,'' Carrard said. ``He decided to  
resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board said it found no ``sanctionable offense'' in  
the fact that Coles and his partner, Patricia Rosenbrock, had 
written memos on IOC members. Many of the notes contained very 
personal comments on the likes and dislikes of IOC members and 
their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	The memos, prepared for the Sydney bid committee, were  
apparently passed on to Salt Lake bidders -- although Coles and Ms. 
Rosenbrock denied supplying them. 
</P>
<P>
	``By not taking all necessary precautions to avoid the  
disclosure of such notes, Mr. Coles was guilty of serious 
negligence,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carrard said there ``has never been talk of corruption in  
connection with Mr. Coles,'' and that he never profited from his 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The official report on the case suggested Coles would be kicked  
out of the IOC in the event of any further violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had temporarily stepped aside from SOCOG in February after  
being implicated in the Salt Lake vote-buying case. He was later 
stripped of his role in organizing the Olympic torch relay in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	But SOCOG chief Michael Knight and other Australian Olympic  
officials have demanded that Coles leave for good, claiming the 
scandal was detracting from the games and scaring away sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Olympic rules, Coles had an automatic seat on the Sydney  
board as one of two IOC members from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Coles needed to have a ``perfect working  
relationship'' with the Sydney committee, and his resignation 
``contributed to an easing of tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper said, ``I  
sincerely hope this closes a very unfortunate chapter. I think Phil 
Coles did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coles charged that ``political pressures'' had forced  
him off the SOCOG board but said he was relieved he will keep his 
IOC position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quite an exhausting and nightmarish experience and  
there has been an orchestrated move to discredit me and have me 
removed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he believed Knight had forced his resignation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I put it on the table to the IOC that I was open for a meeting  
with Michael Knight, which obviously wasn't accepted by him, so I 
resigned,'' Coles said. ``There was never any suggestion that I 
would resign from the SOCOG board to keep my role with the IOC, 
never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was expected to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday to attend the  
IOC general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation was welcomed by SOCOG chief executive Sandy  
Hollway, among those who have urged him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said Coles' departure means ``we have now tied off the  
last significant strand of controversy affecting the Sydney Games. 
I'm very glad the IOC has drawn a line under this sad episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coles case has overshadowed other issues as the IOC meets in  
Seoul for a three-day executive board meeting, followed by a 
four-day session of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the session is Saturday's selection of the  
host city for the 2006 Winter Games. Six European cities are in the 
running.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Spins in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda as  
Tropical Storm Arlene headed westward today across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene, the first storm of the Atlantic season, saw its top  
sustained winds drop to 50 mph overnight, with no significant 
change in strength expected through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had said the storm might threaten Bermuda at some  
point, but is expected to curve away into the open ocean before 
reaching the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the (U.S.) East Coast is in the future of this  
storm,'' said National Hurricane Center specialist Miles Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Arlene's center was about 280 miles southeast of  
Bermuda. Storm-force winds extended up to 115 miles from the 
center. Arlene was expected to continue moving west-northwest at 
near 6 mph with a gradual turn toward the northwest tonight and 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms in this part of the Atlantic often eventually turn toward  
the northeast and die at sea as they enter cooler waters, which 
discourage development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to start out with something hopefully remaining at  
sea,'' another hurricane forecaster, Richard Pasch, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State University professor William Gray, who pioneered  
annual hurricane forecasting, is predicting 14 named storms this 
season, the same as last year.

<HEADLINE> Apache Wildfire Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITERIVER, Ariz. (AP) -- A wildfire that charred more than 4,000  
tribal acres has been contained. ``It's time to start the healing 
process,'' said White Mountain Apache Tribal Chairman Dallas 
Massey. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 air and ground crews finally contained the wildfire  
Sunday that destroyed 17 homes and forced 300 people to evacuate 
their homes on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Forest Service spokesman Joe Spehar said the evacuees were  
being allowed to return home and State Route 73 was reopened to 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jane Hull toured the fire site by helicopter Sunday, then  
met with Massey to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind-driven fire, north of Whiteriver and about 130 miles  
northeast of Phoenix, is believed to be man-made and an 
investigation is pending, Spehar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had burned nearly seven square miles of ponderosa pine  
trees and heavy brush, consuming 4,163 acres before it stabilized. 
At one point, the flames stretched more than 400 feet into the air, 
Spehar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody was injured, the fire destroyed at least 17  
homes and 13 additional outdoor structures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Anderson, fire information director for the  
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, said the blaze should be fully 
controlled ``by Wednesday or Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of putting the fire out has reached $750,000 already,  
according to Anderson, who estimated the final loss at around $3 
million including land rehabilitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be a suitable habitat for species of  
wildlife that use mature and older forests,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a 680-acre wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park  
continued to burn along the western and northern flanks, according 
to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was started June 3 by lightning and is being allowed to  
burn itself out.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- It's OK with Spurs center David Robinson if  
the NBA Finals between New York and San Antonio are billed as a 
showdown between the big city and a small town. 
</P>
<P>
	But good versus evil?  
</P>
<P>
	``Who's good?'' Robinson asked reporters Monday. ``There are  
some great guys on that team. I know Charlie Ward and Allan Houston 
and those guys are great guys. I don't know who you're talking 
about, evil. They're probably better than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A devout Christian, Robinson said he's simply looking forward to  
what he expects will be a well-played best-of-7 series beginning 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be good, hard basketball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His friend and teammate, Avery Johnson, who shares Robinson's  
Christian beliefs, added that he doesn't care for the ``choir 
boys'' tag some are giving the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the `choir' part because that's associated with church  
and that's a good thing,'' Johnson said. ``But `choir boy' put 
together, I don't really like that because choir boys tend to have 
this soft personality and I don't think we have anybody on our team 
soft.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER MARIO:* As the Spurs met the media Monday after practice,  
one player lingered around after all his teammates left and 
genuinely seemed to be enjoying himself spinning tales about his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, 35, a New Yorker who grew up five minutes away from  
Madison Square Garden and played junior varsity ball with Chris 
Mullin, didn't break into the NBA until he was 26. Before that, he 
spent time playing in U.S. minor leagues and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm home by myself, I think about playing in Portugal in  
a small farming town that closed at 8 o'clock. It had one street 
light, and you'd wake up in the morning and women were walking cows 
on the side of the road,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After stints with the Lakers, 76ers, Warriors and Trail Blazers,  
Elie won championships with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of guys who call me and say `Yo, you're in your  
third finals, I'm trying to get into one.' And I say I don't 
believe how it's been done. I'm amazed. I've played nine years in 
the league and I've got a chance to win three rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pinch myself sometimes and think I'm one of the  
luckiest guys that have played this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BLACK SOCKS BEGONE:* The Spurs saw what happened to the Indiana  
Pacers against the Knicks, and San Antonio doesn't plan to follow 
the Pacers' playoff practice of wearing black socks to show 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some of those guys look terrible in black socks and  
black sneakers,'' said Spurs forward Malik Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have no superstitions about clothing anyway, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to stay with what's gotten us here, and  
that's tremendous defense and great execution down the stretch -- 
and white socks,'' Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FACTS AND FIGURES:* The Knicks are the first eighth-seeded team  
to make it to the finals. The 1980-81 and 1994-95 Houston Rockets 
made it as sixth seeds, and the 1968-69 Boston Celtics and 1977-78 
Seattle SuperSonics advanced as fourth seeds. ... With a 27-23 
(.540) regular-season record, the Knicks could become the team with 
the second-worst record ever to win a championship. The 1977-78 
Washington Bullets at 44-37 (.537) had the worst record of any team 
to win a title. ... Since the NBA went to a 2-3-2 format 15 years 
ago, no team has ever swept Games 3, 4 and 5. ... Since the 1990 
finals, the home team is 26-25. The home team won three of the six 
games in last year's finals between Utah and Chicago. ... Head 
coaches Gregg Popovich of San Antonio and Jeff Van Gundy of New 
York never played in the NBA. That makes this the first finals 
since 1981 in which at least one of the coaches did not have NBA 
playing experience. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BABIES, BABIES EVERYWHERE:* Allan Houston of the Knicks had an  
eventful weekend. Not only did New York win the Eastern Conference 
finals on Friday, but his wife gave birth to a girl Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was not at the Knicks' practice Sunday because of his  
daughter's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson of the Spurs and his wife, Terri, are expecting  
their first child in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the couple isn't likely to have to worry about a delivery  
during the finals, they are paying close attention to Terri's 
health and travel abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife is just trying her best to figure out what games she's  
going to make,'' Jackson said. ``She's been going to her doctor's 
appointments and stuff like that. Plus, she's from New Jersey. So 
she's planning on being in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AND THEN THEY BECOME KIDS:* Sean Elliott, David Robinson and  
Avery Johnson say having children has helped them keep perspective 
during their journey to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything that's happened in my life  
that's been better for me,'' said Elliott, whose daughter, Jordyn 
May Elliott, turned a year old last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``My little girl is just awesome,'' Elliott said. ``She runs up  
to me and she's smiling or laughing, you can forget about anything 
else that happened during the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After advancing to the NBA Finals by sweeping Portland and  
getting several days off, Johnson kept himself occupied by watching 
his son and daughter play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep my attention,'' he said. ``I was at tennis camp,  
watching them play like Venus Williams and Andre Agassi. So I had a 
good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson may have been a Spurs' star for a decade, but two of  
three his sons are fans of other players. His oldest son likes 
Charles Barkley. His second-oldest son is a big fan of Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my 2-year-old says, `Daddy, me love you. You're my boy.'  
So I got one of them. That's two out of three,'' Robinson said with 
a laugh.

<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Geri Halliwell began her first tour  
Monday as a U.N. Population Fund goodwill ambassador by promoting 
contraceptives in the Philippines, where the dominant Catholic

<HEADLINE> Dierker Has Tests After Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Astros manager Larry Dierker was in the hospital  
undergoing tests today, a day after being felled by a seizure in 
the Houston dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the bottom of the eighth inning of a game  
against the San Diego Padres, shaking violently, and was restrained 
by his shaken players until medical attendants arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager's condition stabilized in an ambulance as he was  
being taken to Methodist Hospital, where he was expected to remain 
for several days undergoing tests. The Astros said they would have 
a report on Dierker at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was determined that Dierker had a grand mal seizure, a  
condition that can be associated with epilepsy. Dierker had a 
milder seizure three years ago in San Diego when he was an Astros 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's seizure came during a game which began with former  
Astros pitcher J.R. Richard throwing out the ceremonial first 
pitch. Richards suffered a stroke and collapsed while working out 
in the Astrodome on July 30, 1980. Richard fell along the 
first-base line, just a few feet from where Dierker collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a terrible year, even with some other coaches going  
down,'' bench coach Matt Galante said. ``But I think these guys 
will bounce back and might even play a little harder. We'll play 
each game one by one for Larry. I hope when he comes back, we'll 
have an even bigger lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galante will fill in for Dierker until he returns.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell was at bat when Dierker collapsed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready to step in, and the umpire said, `Hold  
on,''' Bagwell said. ``I looked around, and everybody was running 
to the dugout. Larry had collapsed. He couldn't talk. He was 
shaking violently. He was shaking the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking. We're all stunned.''  
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 39,773, anticipating a three-game sweep of the  
Padres, was silent as players gathered around the dugout where 
Dierker fell. Some prayed. Jose Lima cried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh and play with him every day, and now I have to pray  
for him,'' Lima said. ``I started crying because I've seen my 
grandmother do the same thing in the Dominican Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was suspended with the Astros ahead 4-1 on Derek Bell's  
grand slam. It will be resumed July 23, when the Padres return to 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres watched with equal horror.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't get him under control, and they had to fight to  
hold him down,'' said Padres pitching coach Dave Smith, a former 
Astro and one of Dierker's golfing buddies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was concerned yesterday that something was not quite right.  
Usually, he's upbeat and laughing but for some reason he was kind 
of quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics in an ambulance rushed to the dugout from center  
field. Dierker's wife, Judy, left the stands and went to the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts to sit and see that happening. Talk about a knot in  
the stomach -- there was an emptiness inside,'' Padres manager Bruce 
Bochy said. ``I talked to him on Friday and he said he was working 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, 52, has been Houston's manager since Oct. 4, 1996, and  
led the Astros to consecutive NL Central titles. He was voted NL 
Manager of the Year last season. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Bell's sixth-inning grand slam off Heath Murray overcame a 
1-0 deficit, his first slam in 3,613 career at-bats. ... Shane 
Reynolds allowed one run -- unearned -- and six hits in eight 
innings, struck out six and walked none. ... San Diego went ahead 
in the third when Damian Jackson reached on shortstop Tim Bogar's 
fielding error and scored on Quilvio Veras' single. ... Gwynn, 
recovered from a strained left calf, played in his second 
consecutive game after coming off the disabled list. He went 
1-for-4 with a fourth-inning double and needs 23 hits to reach 
3,000. ... Galante said no more coaches will be brought in as 
replacements. The Astros expect Cruz to return by June 17. Minor 
league field coordinator Harry Spilman is filling in for McCraw.

<HEADLINE> Doctors See More Diabetes in Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Type 2 diabetes, long thought to be a  
disease that only affected adults, is being diagnosed in 
startlingly high numbers of children, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and  
amputations in the United States and kills 180,000 a year. It also 
can lead to heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallahassee Memorial Hospital's Diabetes Center, which draws  
patients from Florida, Georgia and Alabama, has seen the number of 
type 2 cases among children triple in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It dawned on us this spring that ... four out of five new  
cases were type 2,'' said Larry Deeb, a pediatric endocrinologist 
at the center. ``And we said, `My Lord.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Miami's Diabetes Research Institute is seeing  
the same thing and, along with medical schools at the University of 
Florida and the University of South Florida, is compiling data to 
determine the extent of the problem in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Type 2 diabetes can go undiagnosed for years -- sometimes until  
severe complications, like blindness, show up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 of the nation's 16 million diabetes cases are  
type 2. A much less common form of diabetes, type 1, generally 
strikes children. 
</P>
<P>
	But so ingrained is the perception that type 2 is primarily a  
disease for overweight, middle-aged people, it is frequently called 
adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Type 1 diabetes is easier to diagnose, because children who get  
it usually get sick quickly. But with type 2, as many as a third of 
cases go undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Obesity is an indicator parents should watch for, doctors say.  
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in the incidence of obesity is making its ugly face  
known,'' said Ronald B. Goldberg, a diabetes specialist at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are so much less active than they used to be,''  
Goldberg said, ``and exposed to our western type diets, they're 
putting on weight at alarming rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to federal government statistics the percentage of  
children who are obese has increased from less than 8 percent in 
1976 to 14 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority children are particularly at risk, experts say. Parents  
of black, Hispanic or American Indian children who are overweight 
should particularly be on the lookout for diabetes symptoms, such 
as excessive thirst, Deeb said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Hope To Lock Up Jackson Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Phil Jackson, back from a fishing trip to  
Alaska, has to decide if he's heading to Los Angeles and the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly are offering Jackson a four-year, $24  
million contract to become their coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executive vice present Jerry West and general manager  
Mitch Kupchak spoke with Jackson by telephone Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our first actual contact with him,'' team spokesman  
John Black said. ``The conversation went very well. There is no 
deal done, but we're hopeful that we can get something done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said that Lakers owner Jerry Buss, West and Kupchak ``like  
him very much and we hope to come to an agreement with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement is expected this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson already was scheduled to be in Los Angeles, but stumping  
for a presidential candidate rather than for a job. He was slated 
to be in town Wednesday and Thursday campaigning for Bill Bradley, 
a former NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers indicated recently that Kurt Rambis, who was hired on  
an interim basis after Del Harris was fired 12 games into the 
season, would return as coach. But Buss apparently decided to go 
after Jackson, and the Lakers contacted his agent, Todd Musburger, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, an assistant before replacing Harris, apparently will be  
retained by the Lakers as an assistant or in some other capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won a championship since 1988 and haven't  
made the finals since 1991. They were swept out of the playoffs the 
past two years, this season by San Antonio in the second round 
after losing to Utah in the Western Conference finals in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who won six NBA titles at Chicago with Michael Jordan,  
would be faced with the challenge of helping Shaquille O'Neal 
finally be fitted for his first championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson took last season off, but it was widely believed he  
wanted to eventually return to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, asked recently if he thought Jackson would coach again,  
said, ``I'm pretty sure he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts spoke with  
Jackson about the New York Knicks' coaching job in April, but 
current coach Jeff Van Gundy may have secured his job by guiding 
the Knicks into the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Nets also were believed to be interested in  
Jackson at one time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers seem to have the talent to win a title, with two of  
the game's top players in O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, but often have 
played more like a group of unconnected individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, having dealt successfully with the very distinct  
personalities of Jordan, Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen in 
Chicago, would seem equipped to turn the Lakers into a cohesive 
team.

<HEADLINE> Drunk Driving Penalties Tougher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans behind bars or on  
probation for drunken driving nearly doubled between 1986 and 1997, 
the government reports. 
</P>
<P>
	While the severity of punishment increased, arrests for drunken  
driving dropped during the same period -- from 1.8 million in 1986 
to 1.5 million in 1997 -- said a Justice Department study released 
Sunday. All this occurred as the number of licensed drivers 
increased nearly 15 percent, to 183 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics attributed the  
decline in arrests in part to the aging of motorists, since younger 
drivers are more prone to drink and drive. In 1997, 54 percent of 
licensed drivers were age 40 or older, up from 46 percent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those convicted of driving while intoxicated in 1997, 454,500  
were on probation, 41,100 were in local jails and 17,600 were in 
state prisons. In 1986, 270,000 people were behind bars or on 
probation for DWI. 
</P>
<P>
	One expert said the figures reflect both success in getting  
``social drinkers'' to become more responsible and failure in 
dealing with the hardest-core group of drunken drivers: those who 
have a serious problem with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Without alcohol treatment programs, ``these are just drunk  
drivers waiting to get back on the road,'' said Terry Schiavone, 
president of the National Commission Against Drunk Driving, a 
private group. ``Jail and probation have never cured the drunken 
driving problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six percent of DWI offenders on probation were in alcohol  
treatment programs in 1997, according to the government study. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Schiavone's view that the half-million drivers under  
correctional supervision are ``hard-core'' includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--About half of DWI offenders in local jails reported consuming  
the equivalent of about 12 beers or six glasses of wine in the 
hours leading up to their arrest. About half of those on probation 
said they had been drinking for at least three hours before their 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of DWI offenders on probation said they drank every  
day and two-thirds of them said they had used drugs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of offenders on probation and two-thirds of those  
incarcerated reported previous DWI sentences. Eight percent of 
those on probation reported three or more earlier DWI offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For every 1,000 DWI arrests in 1997, 347 offenders were jailed  
or placed on probation -- up from 151 in 1986, according to the 
study. The punishment rate continues a trend that began in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In its survey based on interviews with the offenders and  
record-gathering, the Justice Department concluded: 
</P>
<P>
	--People convicted of DWI are about five years older, better  
educated and more often white than those convicted of other crimes. 
Men account for over 90 percent of DWI offenders in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	--DWI offenders in local jails were serving sentences of 11  
months on average, while state prisoners had sentences averaging 49 
months.

<HEADLINE> Huang Arraigned on Conspiracy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang was  
arraigned Monday on a conspiracy charge as part of a plea bargain 
that was reached after he helped the government's campaign finance 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to plead guilty in federal court next Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of a year's probation, 500  
hours of community service, a $10,000 fine and a requirement that 
he continue cooperating with the government. Huang's plea agreement 
specifies that he has already participated in 21 interviews with 
prosecutors and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Federal  
Election Commission by helping raise $7,500 in donations and then 
reimbursing the individuals who provided the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang was the top U.S.-based representative for the Lippo Group,  
an Indonesia-based financial conglomerate, before President Clinton 
appointed him in 1994 to a position at the Commerce Department. 
Huang later became a finance vice chairman of the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC returned $3 million in donations it received leading up  
to the 1996 election -- most of it raised by Huang and Clinton's 
friend Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie -- because of concerns the money 
came from improper or foreign sources.

	KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) -- First there was the mountain, then  
the national borders of three countries, and maybe, if Klagenfurt 
wins the bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics, there will be a very 
special ski race. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's alpine events would start in Italy, pass through  
Slovenia and finish in Austria. The mountain is located near 
Arnoldstein, a town near the Austrian-Italian border, which is at 
the heart of this Olympic bid ``without borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the start near the mountain peak, where the borders of the  
three countries meet, the women's downhill event could become the 
symbolic core of the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that it (the Olympics) all takes place around  
one mountain,'' said Piergiorgio Baldassini, the general secretary 
of the Italian bid committee, pointing to the peak where the three 
countries meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohne Grenzen, Senza Confini, Brez Meja -- ``without borders'' in  
German, Italian and Slovenian. In this part of the world, where 
ripping borders apart has been tragically more common, it seems 
like a nice idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt's bid manager, Dieter Kalt, is good at bluffing, but  
he does get twitchy when he hears the names of the favorites -- 
Sion, Switzerland, and Turin, Italy. The Klagenfurt committee 
people know they are the outsiders in a six-way competition for the 
2006 Winter Olympics to be decided in Seoul on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if the IOC members will go with the open-borders  
bid,'' Kalt admitted. ``But in reality, it's all the same whether 
we get the Olympics or not. When we can remind the world that we 
can sit at one table and discuss, we already have the moral 
victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This moral victory is important. As Kalt was quick to point out,  
the fathers of the bid organizers fought each other in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, Klagenfurt may be a unique combination of  
altruism and unbridled luxury. More than 3,000 athletes and 
officials would be accommodated in existing 4-star hotels on the 
lakeside at Velden. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say that 12 of 16 facilities already exist. From the  
transport center in Villach, the average distance to the six 
outdoor venues is 20 miles, while the average distance to the five 
indoor venues in Klagenfurt is 17 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two venues are located more than an hour from the Olympic  
Village -- the ice hockey arena in Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, 
and the bobsled-luge run in Cortina d'Ampezzo, site of the 1956 
Winter Olympics in Italy. Modern highways and a rail network 
already link the sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports have been divided according to local traditions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ski jumping is our national sport,'' said Vojteh Budinek, the  
general secretary of the Slovenian committee. ``We host the finals 
of the World Cup Ski Jumping here and it attracts between 50,000 
and 70,000 fans. We are even discussing making it an annual 
holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpine events would be held at four ski resorts taking in  
all three countries. Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, would play host to 
the men's giant slalom, slalom and combined slalom, while those 
events for women would be held in Tarvisio, Italy. The men' 
downhill, super-giant slalom and combined downhill would be at 
Hermagor-Nassfeld in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1 million is being invested in the downhill course,  
due for completion in 2000. The women's speed events, including the 
downhill, the symbolic heart of the games, would pivot around the 
Arnoldstein Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's ice hockey would be held in Ljubljana. The women's  
competition and the curling events would be staged at the 
Klagenfurt Trade Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A $79.6 million ice center is being built in Klagenfurt for  
figure skating, short track and speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowboarding would be held at the Austrian resort of Bad  
Kleinkirchheim and freestyle skiing at Tarvisio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are the best,'' Olympic downhill hero Franz Klammer  
said. ``Not just because of the sports facilities, but because we 
have a message about a United Europe. All this should be part of 
the Olympic ideal.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign London to 2-year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA, Pa. (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles signed  
linebacker Antonio London on Monday to a two-year contract. Terms 
of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	London, entering his seventh NFL season, played just one game  
last year with the Green Bay Packers before injuring his knee and 
missing the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been a pass rusher in this league and he will fill in  
as such with us. That's what we have in mind with him,'' Eagles 
coach Andy Reid said. ``We'll gradually bring him into the 
picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London played for five seasons with the Detroit Lions and  
enjoyed his best year in 1995 when he had seven sacks in the final 
seven games. The next year, he started 15 games and recorded a 
career-high 70 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	London signed with the Packers prior to the 1998 regular season  
as an unrestricted free agent but lasted just one game before 
tearing his anterior cruciate ligament. He has 142 tackles and 13 
sacks in 76 career games with 19 starts.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Cautious on Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States cannot rely on rising  
productivity to keep inflation under control forever, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday -- a sign to some 
analysts that the Fed may raise interest rates to slow the red-hot 
economy and keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, opening a three-day congressional summit on high  
technology, credited American investment in productivity-enhancing 
equipment, such as microprocessors, satellites and high-speed 
communications lines, for the nation's productivity boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Those productivity gains have fueled America's remarkable  
economic growth and helped keep inflation low, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity -- the amount of output per hour of work -- has been  
growing at an annual rate of around 2 percent since 1995, double 
the annual gains of the previous two decades, Greenspan told the 
congressional Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan cautioned that these productivity gains can't go  
on forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely,'' he  
said. ``While there appears to be considerable expectation in the 
business community, and possibly Wall Street, that the productivity 
acceleration has not yet peaked, experience does advise caution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan didn't say what action, if any, the Federal Reserve  
would take at the end of month on interest rates. But some private 
economists believe his remarks could be setting the stage for the 
Fed to raise interest rates at its next meeting on June 29 and 30. 
Many believe Greenspan will be more blunt about the prospects of a 
rate hike in a Thursday congressional appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's setting up why the Fed will tighten if the consumer price  
index number is bad or disconcerting,'' said Stan Shipley, an 
economist with Merrill Lynch. ``It's clear that they are concerned 
and may want to tighten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley and other economists said the government's report on the  
rate of inflation in May -- scheduled to be released Wednesday -- 
will be a big influence on the Fed's decision-making at the end of 
the month. In April, consumer prices surged 0.7 percent, touching 
off inflation fears. Analysts expect a 0.2 percent rise in consumer 
prices for last month but that may not be enough to quell those 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does not want to be alarmist. But pointing out that  
productivity gains are not assured, implies the possibility of 
higher inflation,'' said Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. economist Sung Won Sohn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chairman Greenspan is putting some cold water on the theory of  
some economists that you can have your cake and eat it too because 
of continuing productivity gains in the future,'' Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity is considered the crucial element for raising  
living standards because it allows employers to pay their workers 
more without triggering inflationary pressures by having to raise 
the cost of products. 
</P>
<P>
	David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New  
York, and other economists said with growing signs of a rebound in 
Japan and other countries that have been in recessions, Greenspan 
is signaling that U.S. interest rates will need to be increased to 
slow the U.S. economy and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Fed changed its policy bias to lean in favor of  
raising interest rates. Financial markets have grown increasingly 
worried that the Fed will soon start raising them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed hasn't raised U.S. interest rates in more than four  
years. Last fall, it enacted three rate reductions in a successful 
effort to keep global economic turmoil from disrupting the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories  
at American businesses rose 0.2 percent in April as sales edged 
down 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Too big a buildup in inventories can force manufacturers to cut  
production as businesses struggle to reduce the backlog of unsold 
goods. However, even with the modest April rise, current inventory 
levels are lean in relation to sales as American consumers continue 
spending freely. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who in 1996 worried that investors' ``irrational  
exuberance'' may have pushed stock prices too high, reminded the 
committee that he has cautioned a number of times about the dangers 
in believing that the world has entered some new economic era 
because of breakthroughs in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``History is strewn with projections of technology that have  
fallen wide of the mark,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Tops Courier in Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Don't let the gray hair on John McEnroe's  
head fool you, warned Jim Courier. The 40-year-old McEnroe proved 
he can still play a pretty good game of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier learned that lesson the hard way Monday, losing in  
straight sets to McEnroe, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 in the Nike Hall of Fame 
Challenge at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't use Grecian Formula, but he never misses a  
volley,'' said a grinning Courier at the conclusion of the 
grass-court exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe clearly appreciated the compliment. But he said he was  
not sure Courier, 28 years old and ranked 60th in the world, had 
given the match his all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was totally taking it easy on me, but he was  
throwing the old man a bone a little bit,'' said McEnroe, who will 
be inducted into the Hall of Fame July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player could manage a service break in the first set.  
Trailing 6-5, McEnroe forced the tiebreaker by battling to a win in 
the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
	After edging Courier in the tiebreaker, McEnroe held serve in  
the second set and broke Courier's serve in the eighth game, 
winning 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Gore Releases Study on Gun Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Saying the National Rifle Association cannot  
be allowed to ``call the shots'' on protective gun laws, Vice 
President Al Gore released a government study today showing that 
people age 18 through 20 commit 24 percent of all gun murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, prepared jointly by the Treasury and Justice  
departments, said this is the case even though that group of 
youthful Americans makes up only 4 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore presented the report's conclusions in remarks prepared for  
delivery before the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Incredibly, while those 18-to-20-year-olds cannot legally buy  
a beer, cannot purchase a bottle of wine, they can walk into any 
gun shop, pawn shop or gun show in America and buy a handgun,'' 
Gore said, according to an advance copy of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 18-year-olds commit 35 percent more gun  
murders than 21-year-olds, double the gun murders by 24-year-olds 
and four times the gun murders by 30-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president urged Congress to resist lobbying by the NRA  
against stricter gun laws and act on a bipartisan basis this week 
to pass what his office called ``commonsense measures to protect 
America''s children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Will we let the NRA call the shots in Washington or will we  
cross party lines to make our children safer?'' Gore asked in his 
prepared remarks. ``Now is the time for every parent, every 
citizen, every elected official, every national leader to take a 
stand, and to stand up and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more delays and no more fuzziness and no more excuses,'' he  
said. ``We need strong action, and strong leadership, today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and the Clinton administration are seeking new laws to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Raise the legal age for the possession of handguns from 18 to  
21. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require child safety locks on guns.  
</P>
<P>
	--Require background checks for people wishing to buy guns at gun  
shows.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Execs Getting Richer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Valley's top executives keep  
getting richer, widening the pay gap between corporate chiefs and 
the people who work for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest paid executive, Intel Corp. chief executive officer  
Craig Barrett, pulled down a staggering $116.8 million in 1998 -- 
the biggest one-year gain in wealth of any top Silicon Valley 
executive in the 14 years that the San Jose Mercury News has been 
tracking executive wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper on Sunday described the fiscal dynamics of the  
Silicon Valley, where companies seeking a competitive edge offer 
huge enticements -- stock, relocation expenses, even home loans -- to 
lure executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 100 executives collected $1.4 billion in compensation.  
Only one woman made that list -- Carolyn Ticknor, the president of 
Hewlett-Packard's laserjet and imaging systems unit. She was 83rd 
with $3.17 million in pay and stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the ranks of highly paid executives, women take home  
far less than men: The most highly compensated woman received less 
than 3 percent of the sum taken home by the best-compensated man. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate pay reflects direct salaries, but those often are  
dwarfed by the paper profits from parlaying stock options. Indeed, 
most of the $442 million in compensation collected by Silicon 
Valley's top 10 executives came from stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is up a dramatic 65 percent from 1997, and up  
fourfold from the $108 million of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation information was based on 1998's proxy  
statements for 772 bosses at 147 of the largest public companies in 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Some familiar figures are not on the top list.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, many top executives of Hewlett-Packard aren't there  
because they forfeited millions of dollars in shares for failing to 
meet performance goals. Nor is Netscape Communications Corp. boss 
Jim Barksdale, who accepted only $1 in cash but owns almost 5 
percent of the company sold to America Online for $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	One columnist covering the executives' compensation was struck  
by the disparity of pay and the value placed on work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my daughter to her speech therapy class. We sat with a  
wonderful career teacher (about $61,000 a year), a woman who has my 
4-year-old daughter pronouncing 'K' sounds at the beginning and in 
the middle of words like 'cookie.' This teacher would need to put 
in 1,915 years to make what Barrett made last year,'' wrote 
columnist Mike Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Barrett was worth $116.8 million last year, surely she was  
worth $232 million. Instead, we brought her roses from our yard,'' 
he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Hope To Find Scorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres' scorers should be well  
rested for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals against the Dallas 
Stars on Tuesday night. After all, they've been on vacation for a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they sneaked into Dallas and won 3-2 in Game 1, the Sabres  
have three goals in two games -- and, as a result, two losses. Their 
offense has been like Randy Johnson's fastball: It's there, but you 
can't see it. 
</P>
<P>
	Memo to Miroslav Satan, Curtis Brown, Michael Peca, Stu Barnes  
and crew: You might want to try scoring a goal or two on Tuesday. 
If not, that trip to Dallas on Thursday for Game 5 might be the 
last of a very, very long season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what they're saying, that if we don't go out and win  
tomorrow, it's probably over,'' Brown said Monday as the Sabres 
plotted ways to combat a Stars defense as oppressive as Dallas' 
heat and just as stifling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars allowed an NHL-low 168 goals during the season. But  
they've elevated the intensity and tenacity of their neutral-zone 
trap, backchecking and shot-blocking to a new level of distracting 
effectiveness in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy is simple. As Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said,  
``When there's a lot of pressure, your hands become like stone and 
it's hard to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' frustration clearly grew as they got off only 12  
shots in their 2-1 loss in Game 3. So much so that coach Lindy Ruff 
is aware how the performance deflated a city still discouraged by 
the ego-deflating disappointment of four Super Bowl losses in four 
seasons by the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big downer,'' Ruff said. ``The whole city was pumped  
up, and it was a bit of a letdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, Dallas actually blocked more shots (19) than Buffalo  
put on Ed Belfour, who might have enjoyed the quietest night of any 
goaltender in recent Stanley Cup history despite facing eight 
Buffalo power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be more aggressive. We know that,'' said Sabres  
goaltender Dominik Hasek, who has yielded only five goals in 
Dallas' two victories. ``It is very difficult to win when you get 
only 12 shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Juneau said of the Sabres' postgame feelings of frustration,  
``It's hard. You're mad. But it's still the first team to win four 
games, and we have to correct what has to be corrected. If we win 
Game 4, everybody will change their minds again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to rekindle his offense, Ruff gave extra shifts in  
Game 3 to Satan, his slumping 40-goal scorer. Satan managed his 
first two shots of the series but still didn't score, and Ruff 
admits to a growing impatience with his big gun. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ruff probably will move Juneau onto the  
Satan-Curtis Brown line to add speed and a goal-scoring touch. He 
also plans to make faster line changes so the Stars' effective No. 
2 line, led by Joe Nieuwendyk, who had both Dallas goals in Game 3, 
faces different defenders on the same shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stressing a lot shorter shifts, so maybe for 15 seconds  
they'll see Curtis Brown, maybe for 30 seconds they'll see Michael 
Peca,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres probably won't see Dallas sharpshooter Brett Hull,  
who had two goals in the first two games before reinjuring his 
groin early in Game 3. Hull says there is a chance he can play, but 
Hitchcock lists him as doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt in anybody's mind that he's  
not a player for tomorrow night,'' Hitchcock said. ``I don't think 
there is enough soreness out of the area yet. You might do a lot 
more further damage if you do put him in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also is no doubt in the Sabres' minds they must attack  
Game 4 with a much different approach than they did Game 4 of the 
Eastern Conference finals a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	They trailed Washington 2-1, yet responded with one of their  
poorest efforts of the season and lost 2-0, and went on to lose the 
series in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group inside our room is still very confident,'' Ruff said  
``I don't see anything to resemble last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Stars also were up 2-1 to Colorado in the Western  
Conference finals several weeks ago, only to lose 3-2. Hitchcock 
hopes they have short memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we made enough physical and mental sacrifices to  
win that game,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think we know the sacrifices 
we have to make if we want to win Game 4.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Hingis Top Wimbledon Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Australian Mark Philippoussis got the  
biggest break as Wimbledon announced its seedings Monday with 
five-time champion Pete Sampras and 1997 champion Martina Hingis 
designated the No. 1s. 
</P>
<P>
	The big-serving Australian, who reached the quarterfinals last  
year at Wimbledon, but is ranked only No. 11 on this week's ATP 
Tour ranking, got the seventh-seed at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	He leapfrogged four clay-court players ranked ahead of him. One  
of those, Chilean Marcelo Rios, withdrew with an injury before the 
seeds were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the June 21-July 4 tournament was set for Tuesday.  
Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that varies from tour ranking in 
settings its seeding due to the special problems of playing on 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sampras, the top six were: Patrick Rafter, Australia;  
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Russia; Andre Agassi, United States; Richard 
Krajicek, Netherlands; Tim Henman, Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 7 Philippoussis was followed by: Todd Martin, United States;  
Greg Rusedski, Britain; Goran Ivanisevic, Croatia; Gustavo Kuerten, 
Brazil; Carlos Moya, Spain; Karol Kucera, Slovakia; Tommy Haas, 
Germany; Nicolas Kiefer, Germany; Felix Mantilla, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuereten, ranked No. 7 by the ATP, got the No. 11 seed at  
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side, seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf  
was seeded No. 2 despite her No. 3 WTA Tour ranking. American 
Lindsay Davenport was seeded No. 3 -- she's No. 2 WTA list. After 
that, the next four seeds followed the WTA ranking: Monica Seles, 
United States; Jana Novotna, Czech Republic; Venus Williams, United 
States; Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's runner-up, Nathalie Tauziat, was given the eighth  
seed -- just ahead of her No. 9 ranking. Mary Pierce of France, who 
lost in the first round a year ago, was dropped to No. 9 despite 
her No. 8 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The next five places followed WTA rankings with American Serena  
Williams seeded No. 10 followed by: Julie Halard-Decugis, France; 
Amanda Coetzer, South Africa; Sandrine Testud, France; Barbara 
Schett, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Amelie Mauresmo, the Australian Open runner-up and  
ranked No. 15 by the WTA, withdrew with an injury before the seed 
meeting. Dominique Van Roost of Belgium and Natasha Zvereva of 
Belarus each moved up a spot from their WTA Tour ranking to claim 
the last two spots.

<HEADLINE> Art Museum Agrees To Return Matisse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Art Museum has agreed to return a  
Henri Matisse painting to the heirs of a French art dealer whose 
collection disappeared into Nazi vaults when he and his family fled 
to New York during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The heirs of Paul Rosenberg, a top Paris art dealer of 19th- and  
20th-century art between World War I and World War II, filed a 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court last year seeking the return of 
``Odalisque'' after learning it was part of the museum's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum officials said an investigation confirmed the Rosenbergs'  
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``By our action today, the Seattle Art Museum is drawing a clear  
ethical line. Since day one, SAM has been committed to doing the 
right thing,'' museum director Mimi Gardner Gates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum received the painting in 1991 in a bequest from  
Seattle-area residents Prentice and Virginia Bloedel, who bought 
the painting in 1954 from the Knoedler &AMP; Co. gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery has said the Rosenbergs have no right to the  
painting, but failed to present evidence that the family claim was 
invalid, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum has filed a lawsuit accusing Knoedler of fraud,  
breach of warranty of title and ``negligent misrepresentation'' 
when it sold the painting to Bloedel. The museum wants Knoedler to 
pay the market value of ``Odalisque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one will say what the 1928 oil painting is worth, though  
Matisses of similar size and quality have in recent years sold for 
around $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was done by the Holocaust Art Restitution Project,  
a Washington, D.C.-based independent research organization that 
provides Holocaust victims with information on the origins and 
ownership of valuable artwork that disappeared or changed hands 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	It indicated that ``Odalisque'' was stolen in 1941 from the  
vault where Rosenberg had stored 162 paintings and then was stored 
at the Jeu de Paume Museum in Paris. The next year, a German art 
dealer based in Paris apparently acquired Odalisque in exchange for 
a French Renaissance painting. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no further proof of its whereabouts until July 1954  
when Knoedler &AMP; Co. acquired it from Paris' Galerie Drouant-David, 
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto  
Workers kicked off the auto industry's triennial contract talks 
with a warning from the UAW's top leader that automakers are 
subjecting workers to too much overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich acknowledged that many UAW  
members have become used to working the kind of overtime that can 
boost their wages well above $70,000 a year. Working overtime 
traditionally was considered prudent in the industry's good times 
to sock away cash for the inevitable layoffs of lean years. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry likes overtime because it is cheaper than hiring  
additional workers and paying them the UAW's generous lifetime 
benefits. Last year the average Ford hourly worker put in 9.4 hours 
of overtime a week. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the industry in an unprecedented era of stability and  
expecting to post record domestic sales this year, Yokich said 
Monday that it's time to reconsider the cost of too much work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be a balance of some overtime and spending time  
with your families,'' Yokich said. ``There's other families that 
need good jobs as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments reflected the union's chosen theme for this year's  
talks: ``Bargaining for Families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and union negotiators met to formally open the 1996 talks  
with handshake ceremonies at Ford headquarters. The ritual was to 
be repeated today at DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. headquarters and at 
General Motors Corp. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key issues for the industry this year are changes in  
manufacturing that would allow lower-paid supplier workers to do 
more subassembly work. Health and safety, job security, wages and 
benefits remain perennial big issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford President Jac Nasser noted the significance of this year's  
talks, which will produce a new contract that will carry the 
industry into the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is it a new contract for a new century, but it's a  
contract that a lot of people in the U.S. and in the world will be 
watching -- not only what we accomplish, but how we do it,'' Nasser 
told the bargaining teams. ``The how is almost as important as 
where we come out in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike strike-prone rival GM, Ford has enjoyed peaceful labor  
relations with the UAW for two decades. Ford has not endured a 
nationwide UAW strike in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Come Labor Day, the UAW will choose the lead company with which  
it will work out an economic package that the other automakers will 
be expected to adopt. Ford set the pace for the contracts as lead 
company in 1993 and 1996 and is hoping to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford chief negotiator Robert H. Marcin said the reason was  
simple: It allows the company to negotiate what's best for Ford 
rather than being stuck with what may be best for its domestic 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser told negotiators that changes in ``manufacturing  
processes'' were key to Ford's growth plans. All three companies 
have long sought and in some cases gained more flexibility in the 
way they can use UAW workers on the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM executives' public talk of drastically changing the way  
the No. 1 automaker manufactures small cars by adopting ``modular'' 
assembly techniques has angered the UAW. Modular assembly would 
rely more on suppliers to build a car's major parts assemblies, or 
``modules,'' and less on higher-cost UAW workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives have been careful in recent weeks to avoid the  
``M word,'' and Nasser was no exception. But he said the issue of 
manufacturing processes ``really drives how good we are and what 
our customers think about us and our products and the value that we 
can put into the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks by Nasser and Chairman William C. Ford Jr. were made  
behind closed doors, but they were inadvertently broadcast into the 
Ford pressroom where reporters were awaiting the handshake 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	At a later news conference, Yokich maintained his stance against  
modular assembly. ``If it's not good for GM, why would I say it's 
good for Ford?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and safety issues will be one of the first issues tackled  
at Ford in the wake of the February explosion at its Rouge plant 
near Detroit, which killed six workers. An executive who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the company was eager to negotiate any 
contract provisions that could prevent another such disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said he discussed the Rouge explosion with negotiators  
Monday and that it would be an issue throughout the talks. He said 
there have been 42 work-related deaths in the domestic auto 
industry during the current three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's 42 too many as far as we're concerned,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford negotiators also will be tackling the future of the 23,500  
UAW workers at the company's Visteon parts unit. Ford is expected 
to spin off Visteon in the next year or two, though it says no 
final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations cover between 101,000 and 110,000 Ford workers,  
depending on who's counting. The company issued the smaller number 
Monday; the union used the larger one.

<HEADLINE>  Mbeki Chosen As S.African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's parliament  
selected Thabo Mbeki as the country's second freely elected 
president today in a ceremony that marked the nation's farewell to 
the era of Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mandela looking on, Mbeki was nominated without opposition  
and then proclaimed president by Constitutional Court chief Arthur 
Chaskalson. Mandela and the legislators broke into thunderous 
applause and chanted ``Mbeki, Mbeki!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Chaskalson swore in the 400 legislators. Dressed in  
saris, colorful headwraps, embroidered tunics, blankets, beadwork 
and business suits, they took the oath in groups of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbeki and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Mandela's former wife, were  
in the first group. 
</P>
<P>
	The ANC won 266 seats in the June 2 election, only the second  
national vote in which all races were allowed to cast ballots since 
the fall of apartheid in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The ANC's margin in the assembly is so great that many members  
laughed when Chaskalson asked if there were any other nominations 
for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional moment, President Mandela walked into the  
chamber at the opening of the afternoon session. The legislators 
stood, clapped rhythmically and broke into a song of praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbeki will be inaugurated in Pretoria on Wednesday, and name his  
Cabinet on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Mbeki paid tribute to the masses who propelled  
the ANC to a second overwhelming mandate. The 1994 election ended 
white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all of us stand tall today, as all of us surely do, it is  
only because we are borne aloft by the firm hands of the ordinary 
people of our country,'' he said, his voice hoarse from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the deep poverty and a racial divide that  
continues to plague South Africa even after apartheid's fall five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbeki, who turns 57 on Friday, has been effectively running the  
country for the past several years as deputy president after a long 
career in the ANC as an organizer, administrator and negotiator 
with the white government.

<HEADLINE> Gore Slams NRA, House on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Pressing for help in a fight for stricter gun  
laws, Vice President Al Gore told the nation's mayors on Monday 
that he had underestimated the ability of the National Rifle 
Association to ``call the shots in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Will we let the NRA call the shots in Washington or will we  
cross party lines to make our children safer?'' Gore said to more 
than 300 city leaders at the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference 
of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore cast the deciding vote three weeks ago when the Senate  
passed a proposal to require background checks for gun buyers at 
gun shows. He said he thought the measure and others in the Senate 
bill ``would just pick up momentum'' and move toward House passage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an intense lobbying effort by the NRA has helped to  
derail any easy passage of gun safety legislation in the House, for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some in the House are pushing a bill that gives the NRA the  
loopholes it wants instead of giving the country the protection it 
needs,'' Gore said to cheers from the mayors. ``It's time to side 
with our children instead of the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled House is expected to debate gun  
control proposals this week, with Democrats generally pressing for 
adoption of provisions the Senate approved last month, and the NRA 
fighting to water them down or eliminate them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the background checks for all purchases at gun  
shows, the Senate-passed provisions include a requirement that 
safety devices be sold with guns and a ban on importing 
high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning in New Hampshire for the  
Republican presidential nomination, said he favored the Senate 
legislation, but with a GOP-backed amendment on gun-show background 
checks that failed. Asked about Gore's push for new controls, he 
replied, ``We need to enforce the laws already on the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New  
Jersey, has called for an aggressive gun control campaign, 
including ``handgun cards'' -- photo identity cards required of 
anybody carrying a handgun. He also has been considering whether to 
propose a ban on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore released a report by the Justice and Treasury departments  
that found 24 percent of all gun homicides are committed by 18- to 
20-year-olds, a group that is just 4 percent of the population. The 
same age group also led all other age categories in using guns in 
murders and other crimes, including rape, assault and robberies, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said 18-year-olds commit 35 percent more gun  
murders than 21-year-olds, double the gun murders by 24-year olds 
and four times the number of gun murders committed by 30-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore laid out a broad outline for job creation, an increase in  
educational standards and urban development. His pledge to improve 
schools by providing ``high-quality preschool education'' for all 
American children drew a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strong economy, safer communities and better schools are  
just some of the challenges we need to tackle as we move to the 
21st century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Gore was host at a $1,000 per-person  
fund-raiser in a Bourbon Street jazz bar. Gore staffers said the 
event raised more than $250,000, more than twice the amount tallied 
at a similar event for President Clinton four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's often painted as a robotic speaker, Gore broke with  
tradition by strutting into the Storyville Jazz Bar in the city's 
French Quarter district with a musical procession known as a Second 
Line and took a few dance steps to the music. 
</P>
<P>
	The speeches were Gore's last major addresses before he  
officially announces his presidential candidacy Wednesday in his 
hometown of Carthage, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheering their man as a strong advocate for urban America, more  
than 100 mayors announced their support of Gore at the convention 
Sunday. So far, a total of 167 mayors have pledged him their 
support for the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton-Gore team has enjoyed great popularity with the  
mayors' group for giving more attention to the nation's urban 
policy agenda than its Republican predecessors did in the 1980s. 
That support was in evidence after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see him as a champion for the cities,'' said Larry Delgado,  
mayor of Santa Fe, N.M. ``He's been fighting for the funding we 
need.''

<HEADLINE> Rice Hopes To Continue Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- It's elimination time in Omaha, and Rice is  
hoping its season doesn't come to an end just days after its first 
College World Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-seeded Owls (59-14) meet second-seeded Alabama  
(52-15) in Tuesday's early game. In the nightcap, second-seeded 
Florida State (54-13) will meet third-seeded Cal State-Fullerton, 
which eliminated Texas A&AMP;M on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being ranked No. 1 nationally in some polls this season,  
the Owls said their lack of high draft picks and recognizable 
standouts in 1999 made them a team that gets no respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hadn't won last night, people would have limited their  
perception of our program,'' coach Wayne Graham said Monday. ``We 
don't have a lot of high draft picks, but we've got an awful lot of 
good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he will start either Marc Gwyn (7-1, 2.99 ERA) or  
Jeff Nichols (15-3, 4.95) against Alabama's potent offense. Graham 
won't decide until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crimson Tide also face elimination after failing to find  
their offense in an 8-1 loss to Miami on Sunday. The defeat ended 
Alabama's 16-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised when we weren't hitting the ball,'' said  
Alabama freshman pitcher Scott Murphy (7-0, 5.61), who gets the 
call against Rice. ``But when you win 16 or 17 games in a row, 
you're probably going to have a flat day eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said Alabama wins with effective hitting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love their hitting concept,'' he said. ``They use the whole  
field. They take good swings. They can foul off pitches with two 
strikes. They don't just pay lip service to the proper way to 
hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said he knows almost nothing about the Owls, who went 0-2  
in their only previous CWS appearance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coaches are still working on getting a scouting report,''  
he said. ``But you just have to go out there with the mindset that 
they're all superstars and try to get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice catcher Zane Curry, 0-for-15 in the postseason before  
hitting a double Sunday night, said his performance typifies his 
team. He said any player can step up with big hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a guy they (opponents) can get a fix  
on,'' Curry said. ``We're just a team of working-class guys that 
have worked really hard to get here.''

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad-De La Hoya Fight Sept. 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They could have been two businessmen holding a  
news conference not far from Wall Street to announce their next 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The business of Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad Jr. is  
boxing, and their venture will be a highly anticipated and rich 
welterweight title match Sept. 18 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show De La Hoya and the whole world I am the best  
welterweight in the world,'' said the 26-year-old Trinidad, dressed 
in a brown striped suit, white shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sept. 18, my fists will do the talking,'' said De La Hoya,  
wearing a dark blue suit, lighter blue shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The outdoor news conference Monday at the South Street Seaport  
was attended by hundreds of fans chanting and waving Puerto Rican 
and Mexican flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad (35-0, 30 knockouts), the IBF champion, was born and  
lives in Puerto Rico. De La Hoya (31-0, 25 knockouts) was born in 
East Los Angeles and lives at Whittier, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's father-trainer worked up his son's fans by saying:  
``Tito will knock out Oscar. On Sept. 18, he will look like a dead 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On hearing the latter remark, Trinidad told his father to cool  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Don King, Trinidad's promoter, produced a boxing glove on which  
he said was written: ``I will knock out Oscar. Signed: Tito 
Trinidad Jr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Trinidad said: ``I want to say something right now --  
Sept. 18, by decision or by knockout, I'm going to win the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's only prediction was that he would win.  
</P>
<P>
	The Trinidads spoke in Spanish, then had their remarks  
translated. De La Hoya spoke in Spanish, then in English. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-promotion by King and his arch-rival Bob Arum, De La  
Hoya's promoter, will be a pay-per-view match. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is guaranteed $15 million, Trinidad is guaranteed  
$10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's news conference touched off a week of hype sessions.  
The fighters are scheduled to be in Chicago on Tuesday; Miami and 
San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday; Houston and Dallas on 
Thursday; Mexico City on Friday and Los Angeles and Las Vegas on 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox' Gordon Placed on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston closer Tom Gordon, who set a major league  
record by converting 54 straight regular-season save chances before 
blowing his past two opportunities, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's strained right elbow also put him on the DL earlier  
this season, from April 18 to May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	After coming off the DL and converting eight consecutive save  
chances, Gordon blew one June 5 against Atlanta and again Friday 
night against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox recalled right-hander Jin Ho Cho from Triple-A  
Pawtucket to take Gordon's spot on the roster. Cho, who was 0-3 
with an 8.20 ERA last year for Boston, was 7-1 with a 3.41 ERA this 
season at Pawtucket.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad-De La Hoya Fight Sept. 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They could have been two businessmen holding a  
news conference not far from Wall Street to announce their next 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The business of Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad Jr. is  
boxing, and their venture will be a highly anticipated and rich 
welterweight title match Sept. 18 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show De La Hoya and the whole world I am the best  
welterweight in the world,'' said the 26-year-old Trinidad, dressed 
in a brown striped suit, white shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sept. 18, my fists will do the talking,'' said De La Hoya,  
wearing a dark blue suit, lighter blue shirt and tie.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Bond Opening Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators would be required to  
make price information on corporate bonds as widely available as 
data about stocks and government bonds under a bill the House 
passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such information would make the market more competitive and  
enable investors to shop around for the best prices, said sponsors 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the measure, which passed  
the House 332-1 and advanced to the Senate for further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, bond dealers are not obligated to reveal their  
selling prices, which means they can sell the same bond to 
different people for different prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, cited the case of two investors who bought identical 
bonds at a 6 percent difference -- an amount that he said can amount 
to almost a full year's worth of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for this is that there exists no mechanism to  
provide investors with bond prices, like the ticker that investors 
see every day for stock prices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to use  
the authority it has had since 1975 to adopt rules to make the 
pricing system more open, thus increasing competition and improving 
prices for all investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bonds are considered integral to stock market  
performance since it is difficult to make decisions about a 
company's stock without accurate data on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike stocks, the vast majority of bonds are not traded in a  
central market. They are bought and sold over the telephone by a 
relatively small group of dealers that includes major brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1400.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ban on Casino Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today unanimously struck  
down the federal government's effort to protect compulsive gamblers 
from the lure of some casinos, ruling that a ban on television and 
radio advertising violates free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad ban had been in effect in only some parts of the nation  
because some federal appeals courts ruled it unconstitutional while 
others upheld it. Today's decision was sparked by an appeal in 
behalf of New Orleans-area broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that the ban ``may  
not be applied to advertisements of private casino gambling that 
are broadcast by radio or television stations located in Louisiana, 
where such gambling is legal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the case was argued in April, several justices wondered  
aloud about the ban's legitimacy and effectiveness when some 240 
casinos owned by Indian tribes in 31 states, 38 state-run lotteries 
and other gambling operations are free to advertise at will. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton administration lawyer Barbara Underwood had  
emphasized the ``devastating social costs'' caused by an estimated 
3 million compulsive gamblers, and said Congress was entitled to 
address part of the problem by reining in commercial speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the justices said the ban must fall in those states in  
which casino gambling is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said the ban ``is so pierced by exemptions and  
inconsistencies that the government cannot hope to exhonerate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the law prohibited broadcasters from carrying ads  
about privately operated commercial casino gambling regardless of 
the location of the broadcast station or the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand,'' Stevens said, ``advertisements for tribal  
casino gambling authorized by state compacts -- whether operated by 
the tribe or by a private party pursuant to a management contract -- 
are subject to no such broadcast ban, even if the broadcaster is 
located in ... a jurisdiction with the strictest of anti-gambling 
policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A long-standing federal law bans broadcast advertising for ``any  
lottery, gift enterprise or similar scheme offering prizes 
dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance.'' But over the 
past 20 years, Congress has amended the law to allow ads for 
casinos on Indian reservations, state-run lotteries or any gambling 
sponsored by nonprofit promoters for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, the law primarily has targeted privately owned  
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court for two decades has demanded that any  
government limits on truthful and non-misleading commercial speech 
be shown to directly advance some asserted government interest and 
be no more extensive than necessary. If they do not, those limits 
violate the First Amendment's free-speech protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino-advertising ban does not sufficiently advance the  
government's stated interest in protecting compulsive gamblers and 
does not do so in the least intrusive way, the court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation permits ``a variety of speech that poses the same  
risks the government purports to fear,'' Stevens wrote for the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	A national advisory commission in April recommended a nationwide  
moratorium on the spread of casinos, lotteries and slot machines to 
give state and local governments time to form their own study 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission's report is  
scheduled to be presented to President Clinton, Congress, American 
Indian tribes and governors Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case decided today is Greater New Orleans Broadcasting  
Association vs. U.S., 98-387.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaigns in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush brought his front-running  
Republican president campaign to New Hampshire today, boasting of 
his political organization in this leadoff primary state and 
promising supporters he would be ``a man of my word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush drew more than 300 supporters to an early morning address  
on the banks of the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to win New Hampshire,'' the Texas governor said. He  
promised a ``hopeful and optimistic'' message that promotes 
education reforms, a stronger military and a reformed Republican 
Party that stresses compassion as well as conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stand the trash-mouthed politics of the past,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush provided few specifics, a point seized upon by his critics.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew crashed Bush's  
speech, pigeonholing reporters to accuse the Texas governor of 
refusing to detail his position on national issues. ``The governor 
from the Alamo state won't take a stand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew dubbed Bush ``Curious George'' because he said the  
governor's positions are so vague. ``Nobody wants Curious George 
with his finger on the button,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew also shadowed Bush's trip to Iowa on Saturday,  
underscoring how seriously the Democratic Party is taking his 
candidacy. No other GOP candidate is getting such attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has the support of the state's leading GOP politician, Sen.  
Judd Gregg. He was announcing the names of more than 180 local 
organizers today, along with the appointment of state public safety 
director Richard Flynn to be chairman of his coordinating 
committee. Flynn is the longest-serving state department head, long 
considered a behind-the-scenes powerbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush apologized to New Hampshire voters for waiting so long for  
his first trip,, saying he promised Texans he would complete the 
state's legislative session before campaigning for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you understand that I'm a man of my word,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush took more than 20 minutes getting to the stage, slowly  
making his way through a crowd of supporters eager to grab his 
hand. Spotting a red-headed baby in the crowd, he shouted, ``I've 
always been a sucker for baby pictures,'' then took the child from 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He kissed the baby in front of a group of photographers, then  
turned on request to pose for more cameras. ``Another kiss 
governor!'' one photographer yelled. Bush eagerly consented, and 
planted another kiss on the baby's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Irma Pierce of Portsmouth, N.H., pulled Bush aside briefly and  
asked him to do something about the rising costs of long-term care. 
`I will,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't satisfied with his answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``But at least it's hopeful,'' she said. ``He needs to be  
formulating some plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor planned to visit an elementary school,  
conduct a news conference and address a women's forum later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush announced Saturday in Iowa that there was ``no turning  
back'' from his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, in which 
he leads in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife, Laura, rested Sunday at the Bush family's  
summer estate on the coast of Maine. With a promise to ``stay out 
of his way,'' former President Bush told reporters his son is 
prepared to follow his footsteps to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will stay out of the issue business in terms of the  
campaign,'' the elder Bush said. ``I had my chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might help raise money if asked by his son. But, he  
said, ``He doesn't need a voice from the past.''

<HEADLINE> Murray Hired as L.A. Kings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Andy Murray, a success at the high school and  
international levels of hockey, added the NHL to his head coaching 
resume Monday when he was hired by the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, 48, replaces Larry Robinson, whose contract wasn't  
renewed in April after the team finished 32-45-5 and failed to 
reach the playoffs for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the team underachieved last season, this is a  
great time to come to Los Angeles,'' Murray said at a news 
conference near the downtown Staples Center, the new arena where 
the Kings will play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray agreed to a three-year contract. Financial terms weren't  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy Murray has a wealth of hockey knowledge. He's coached at  
just about every level you can imagine. He's a very bright 
individual, very intense,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said. 
``He'll demand the utmost of our players, certainly earn their 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray won the job over the other finalist, John Van Boxmeer,  
coach and general manager of the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's only other stints in the NHL were as an assistant with  
the Philadelphia Flyers from 1988-90; the Minnesota North Stars in 
1990-91, when they reached the Stanley Cup final; and the Winnipeg 
Jets from 1992-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that I have worked with players as a head coach at  
the international level will help me in this situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached Canada's national team to a 77-29-14 record and the  
gold medal in the 1997 world championships. Among his players was 
defenseman Rob Blake, the Kings' captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake cited Murray's intensity, discipline and work ethic as  
reasons the coach could succeed without any prior NHL head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands the players,'' Blake said. ``He touched on a  
big thing about respect, demanding a lot out of each player -- as 
much as they can give -- but also having that respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get the most out of this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Murray's most recent job was coaching at Shattuck-St. Mary's in  
Faribault, Minn., a prep school south of Minneapolis. The team went 
70-9-2 and won the Midget Triple A USA Hockey national title. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as an assistant for Canada at the 1996 World Cup  
of Hockey and the world championships, where the team won silver 
medals. He was an assistant for Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Luc Robitaille wasn't concerned the Kings didn't hire  
a high-profile coach. Taylor also interviewed former Buffalo Sabres 
coach Ted Nolan, Montreal assistant Dave King and Detroit assistant 
Dave Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy deserves a chance,'' Robitaille said. ``Everywhere  
he's been going, he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings made the playoffs just once in four years under  
Robinson, who had a 122-161-45 record. Last season, the Kings lost 
25 games by one goal, had one of the league's worst power plays and 
lost 335 man-games to injuries or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lacked intensity and the will to pay the price to win any  
game, especially down the stretch,'' Robitaille said. ``That's what 
a guy like that with his intensity will bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he plans to emphasize improved defense, with clearly  
defined roles for each player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our players when they don't have the puck to know  
exactly what their responsibilities are. There won't be leeway. 
Everybody will have to follow the same guidelines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they have the puck, I want players to bring their  
individual creativity on the ice because that's what the fans come 
to see.''

<HEADLINE>  Murray Hired as L.A. Kings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Andy Murray, a success at the high school and  
international levels of hockey, added the NHL to his head coaching 
resume Monday when he was hired by the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, 48, replaces Larry Robinson, whose contract wasn't  
renewed in April after the team finished 32-45-5 and failed to 
reach the playoffs for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the team underachieved last season, this is a  
great time to come to Los Angeles,'' Murray said at a news 
conference near the downtown Staples Center, the new arena where 
the Kings will play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray agreed to a three-year contract. Financial terms weren't  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy Murray has a wealth of hockey knowledge. He's coached at  
just about every level you can imagine. He's a very bright 
individual, very intense,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said. 
``He'll demand the utmost of our players, certainly earn their 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray won the job over the other finalist, John Van Boxmeer,  
coach and general manager of the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's only other stints in the NHL were as an assistant with  
the Philadelphia Flyers from 1988-90; the Minnesota North Stars in 
1990-91, when they reached the Stanley Cup final; and the Winnipeg 
Jets from 1992-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that I have worked with players as a head coach at  
the international level will help me in this situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached Canada's national team to a 77-29-14 record and the  
gold medal in the 1997 world championships. Among his players was 
defenseman Rob Blake, the Kings' captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake cited Murray's intensity, discipline and work ethic as  
reasons the coach could succeed without any prior NHL head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands the players,'' Blake said. ``He touched on a  
big thing about respect, demanding a lot out of each player -- as 
much as they can give -- but also having that respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get the most out of this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Murray's most recent job was coaching at Shattuck-St. Mary's in  
Faribault, Minn., a prep school south of Minneapolis. The team went 
70-9-2 and won the Midget Triple A USA Hockey national title. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as an assistant for Canada at the 1996 World Cup  
of Hockey and the world championships, where the team won silver 
medals. He was an assistant for Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Luc Robitaille wasn't concerned the Kings didn't hire  
a high-profile coach. Taylor also interviewed former Buffalo Sabres 
coach Ted Nolan, Montreal assistant Dave King and Detroit assistant 
Dave Lewis. 
</P>
<P>

he's been going, he's won.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Halt Md. College Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling  
that lawyers for a Maryland college say will result in ``an 
intrusive investigation of religious speech and practice on its 
campus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, over one dissenting vote, refused to scuttle an  
investigation aimed at determining whether Columbia Union College, 
a Takoma Park, Md., school affiliated with the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church, is ``pervasively sectarian'' and therefore 
ineligible for any direct monetary aid from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ordered such fact-finding last October,  
and today's Supreme Court order rejected the college's ensuing 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1971, Maryland has provided financial aid to private  
colleges in the state, based on the number of each school's 
full-time students. The fund, called the Sellinger Program, 
distributed money to 15 colleges in 1997 -- 12 with no religious 
affiliation and three linked to the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The religiously affiliated schools are not allowed to use the  
money they receive for any religious purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1976 Supreme Court decision upheld the Catholic colleges'  
participation in the program, ruling that the schools were not 
``pervasively sectarian'' and could use money provided by the state 
for purposes having nothing to do with religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Union, a school of about 1,200 students, sought  
Sellinger Program funding in 1990 but the Maryland Commission of 
Higher Education denied the application. The commission concluded 
that the school was pervasively religious and that any grant would 
be used for religious purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission noted that Catholic schools received money but  
said Columbia Union was ``more religious'' -- and that giving it 
public money would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	After unsuccessfully seeking reconsideration of its application,  
Columbia Union sued the commission's members in 1996, and at the 
same time submitted a new application seeking $806,000 in state 
money for use in various academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge threw out the lawsuit, ruling that the  
college is too pervasively religious to receive any state money -- 
even funds earmarked for specific academic programs such as 
mathematics and computer science. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the trial  
judge's ruling, reinstated the school's lawsuit and ordered further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``No court could or should decide whether Columbia Union is  
pervasively sectarian based solely on the evidence in this record, 
which is comprised almost exclusively on the college's written 
literature and policies,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	It ordered the judge to take into account the school's practices  
``to determine whether religious indoctrination pervades the 
institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the college urged the  
justices to call of any such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where a funding program is neutral toward religion ... (and)  
contains safeguards to ensure that program funds are used for 
secular program purposes, the 'pervasively sectarian' inquiry 
pursued below is simply unnecessary,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	It suggested that the 1976 Supreme Court decision relied on by  
the appeals court has been overtaken by more recent church-state 
rulings by the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland Attorney General Joseph Curran urged the court to  
reject the school's appeal, calling it premature. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from today's denial of review.  
``Although the court declines ... (review) today -- perhaps because 
this case comes to us in an interlocutory posture -- the growing 
confusion among the lower courts illustrates that we cannot long 
avoid addressing the important issue that it presents,'' he said in 
a dissenting opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Columbia Union College vs. Clark, 98-1509.

<HEADLINE> Charges Vs. Cycling Chiefs Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LILLE, France (AP) -- A judge on Monday threw out charges against  
the presidents of the French Cycling Federation and the 
Professional Cycling League, who had been among more than a dozen 
people suspected of a role in the Festina cycling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Baal, who heads the French Cycling Federation, later said  
that the problem of drug use in the sport was the fault of everyone 
-- even the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure ``is that of the entire sporting world,'' he told a  
news conference, ``of national and international federations ... It 
is the failure of all states, including the French state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baal and Roger Legeay, suspected of not taking sufficient  
preventive measures against doping by cyclists, had been placed 
under investigation for ``complicity in facilitating, inciting the 
use and administration of illegal substances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Investigating Magistrate Patrick Keil threw out the  
charges for both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven other people, including Italian cyclist Rodolfo Massi of  
the Casino team and French cyclist Richard Virenque, formerly with 
Festina, remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosures that Festina riders had used banned substances  
surfaced three days before last year's Tour de France, and news of 
drug use followed the entire race. Festina was forced to pull out.

<HEADLINE> Is Jackson Ready To Be Reeled In? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Phil Jackson spent the weekend fishing in a remote corner of  
Alaska. In a nice twist of fate, he was the one who returned to 
civilization still wearing the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the line is Lakers owner Jerry Buss. The  
bait, according to published reports, was a contract for four or 
five years at close to $6 million per year. And if the deal is as 
good as agent Todd Musburger and Los Angeles general manager Jerry 
West swear it is, all that's left for Jackson to decide is whether 
he's ready to be reeled in. 
</P>
<P>
	Whichever it is, Jackson owes it to some people to answer soon.  
</P>
<P>
	That way, incumbent LA coach Kurt Rambis would know whether he's  
still in line for a prime parking space when the team moves into 
the new Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, incumbent Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy could lose the  
nervous tic that makes him look over his shoulder every few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	And that way, the Nets can decide whether Don Casey, a good and  
decent career NBA assistant, gets the shot at a head coaching job 
he deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Jackson's options are narrowing all the time. By the  
time he left the Lower 48 to go fishing, his name had been 
mentioned for every job opening except the White House (and a 
friend of his is up for that). It won't continue forever. 
</P>
<P>
	New York may already be moot, since the Knicks' win over the  
Pacers triggered a clause in Van Gundy's contract guaranteeing him 
a one-year extension at $3.5 million. And while the Nets job is 
still Jackson's for the asking, the owners never put a firm offer 
on the table and are already preparing to move on without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as befits a man associated so closely with the triangle  
offense, Jackson has a third option -- campaigning for former Knick 
teammate and current Democratic presidential contender Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Long blessed with touch, Bradley has added tact to his  
repertoire. Asked last Friday at the Knicks game where he'd like to 
see Jackson wind up, he replied, ``Wherever is best for Phil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But right now, even Phil is not sure where that is.  
</P>
<P>
	By sitting out last season, Jackson benefitted from the sporting  
world equivalent of the ``dead-artist syndrome''; that is, his work 
rose in value because there might not be any more to go around. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many other tricks of the trade, the sabbatical was a  
move perfected by Pat Riley. He went from the bench to the 
broadcast booth -- where every dig at a former colleague drove up 
his own asking price -- and once the right situation materialized, 
back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Say this much for Jackson: He did not take time off to advance  
his career. He turned up in Chicago to collect his sixth 
championship ring during a ceremony clumsily shoehorned between 
halves of a regular-season game. But that was pretty much it. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Jackson's sabbatical has been spent in less public  
pursuits -- enjoying family, reading and traveling. Outside of 
speaking engagements, the only time he turns up on the news is 
standing next to Bradley. But that's where the timing gets sticky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign is scheduled to arrive midweek in LA and  
Jackson is supposed to speak at a fund-raising dinner Thursday in 
Beverly Hills. ``I'm sure he'll be doing that as the Laker coach,'' 
a source told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to see the lure of LA. Jackson inherits Shaquille  
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, with a chance to add Scottie Pippen (for 
Glen Rice) and resurrect Dennis Rodman's career again. It's the 
perfect place to prove he contributed more to the Bulls 
championships than the command: ``Get the ball to Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Lakers can only get better. They haven't won a  
championship since 1988, haven't reached the finals since 1991, and 
they've been swept out of the playoffs the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, it's hard to see Buss and Jackson connecting.  
The Lakers owner thinks culture is checking out the art at the 
Bellagio in Las Vegas. And he won't be patient for long; Buss 
balked at paying $6 million a year for Jackson until someone 
explained that credibility might mean fewer empty seats in a new 
arena. And remember: the last time Jackson worked for two guys 
named Jerry (Krause and Reinsdorf), things ended badly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, meanwhile, offer greater stability, just as much money  
and only a little less talent. And the owners, longtime supporters 
of former Sen. Bradley, are more in line with Jackson 
philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if that's really important to Jackson, he might just  
as well stick to politics, which another former Democratic 
presidential hopeful once likened to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be smart enough to know the game,'' former Sen.  
Eugene McCarthy said, ``and stupid enough to think it's 
important.''

<HEADLINE> Hull's Out for Dallas Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- It's taken 10 years for Ken Hitchcock to  
finally square things with Darryl Sydor. And what a time to do it -- 
in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hitchcock was coaching Sydor in Kamloops in the Canadian  
juniors, he turned him from a forward into a defenseman. It looks 
like he will be reversing that now as the Dallas Stars prepare for 
Game 4 of the finals against the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Darryl gives us so much energy that we can play  
him in the middle 20s (in minutes) up and back and he doesn't miss 
a beat,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The position switch was made possible by the loss of Brett Hull,  
who suffered a groin injury in Dallas' 2-1 victory in Game 3 
Saturday night that gave the Stars a two games to one lead in the 
best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock on Sunday said Hull ``is probably doubtful for Game 4.  
He was pretty sore last night. ... I don't think he will be ready. 
I think he is looking at probably Game 5 or Game 6 right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sydor will be looking at a possible opportunity to  
play on the Stars' top line with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will change my game that much,'' said Sydor,  
an offensive-minded defenseman who is sixth on the Dallas scoring 
charts with 11 points. Modano and Lehtinen are the offensive 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock and Sydor go way back. While coaching at Kamloops in  
the Western Hockey League, Hitchcock had been scouting Sydor when 
the player was 13 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came to us as a forward, and he played his first game as a  
16-year-old as a forward,'' Hitchcock recalled. ``I put him on 
defense as a junior player because I felt that he wasn't going to 
be the impact player that some people thought he was as a junior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor has already been used as a forward sparingly in the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the two shifts he took out there, he was trying to  
kill everybody,'' Hitchcock said. ``He likes playing (forward) now 
because he feels he can get even with everybody that has taken runs 
at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility to replace Hull is Tony Hrkac, who has been  
thrown into action of late after being used sparingly in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really impressed with the way Tony played,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``So we have got some good options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull is the second big-name player for Dallas who has suffered  
an injury in the playoffs. Modano had his left wrist injured in 
Game 2 in Dallas, but felt good enough to play Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said his top all-around player was feeling even better  
on Sunday, particularly with the addition of Sydor on his line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we put a defensive player there, then we are aiming  
to turn (Modano) and Lehtinen loose, and (Modano) is pretty excited 
about that,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Modano has been enjoying himself in the playoffs this year  
with five goals and 13 assists in 20 games, the same can't be said 
of the Sabres' Miroslav Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-goal scorer during the season, Satan has only managed three  
goals in nine postseason games -- none in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I do feel the pressure,'' Satan said in response to a  
reporter's question. ``I tried to respond the best way I can, but 
right now they are backchecking hard. There is not too much room; 
not only me, but the whole team has problems to create anything in 
their zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is the key why we had only 12 shots last night  
and why we are not creating a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has no answer for Satan's slump.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we need him. We tried to get him away from a couple  
of matchups; tried to get him away from a couple of their defensive 
pairs. We tried everything, but didn't get a lot out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satan isn't the only one having problems scoring for the Sabres.  
The defense-first Stars have restricted Buffalo to just six goals 
in the first three games while scoring only eight themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is still very positive,'' Sabres captain Mike Peca  
said. ``It is a race to four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disappointing to lose (Saturday) night. We could have  
put ourselves in a good spot. We didn't have our greatest game. 
Obviously at this point of the season this is the greatest 
adversity we have faced, but this team seems to thrive on that.''

	The Bradley campaign is scheduled to arrive midweek in LA and  
Jackson is supposed to speak at a fund-raising dinner Thursday in 
Beverly Hills. ``I'm sure he'll be doing that as the Laker coach,'' 
a source told the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to see the lure of LA. Jackson inherits Shaquille  
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, with a chance to add Scottie Pippen (for 
Glen Rice) and resurrect Dennis Rodman's career again. It's the 
perfect place to prove he contributed more to the Bulls 
championships than the command: ``Get the ball to Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Lakers can only get better. They haven't won a  
championship since 1988, haven't reached the finals since 1991, and 
they've been swept out of the playoffs the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, it's hard to see Buss and Jackson connecting.  
The Lakers owner thinks culture is checking out the art at the 
Bellagio in Las Vegas. And he won't be patient for long; Buss 
balked at paying $6 million a year for Jackson until someone 
explained that credibility might mean fewer empty seats in a new 
arena. And remember: the last time Jackson worked for two guys 
named Jerry (Krause and Reinsdorf), things ended badly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, meanwhile, offer greater stability, just as much money  
and only a little less talent. And the owners, longtime supporters 
of former Sen. Bradley, are more in line with Jackson 
philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if that's really important to Jackson, he might just  
as well stick to politics, which another former Democratic 
presidential hopeful once likened to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be smart enough to know the game,'' former Sen.  
Eugene McCarthy said, ``and stupid enough to think it's 
important.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $76M for Birth Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury ordered the city's hospital agency to pay  
$76 million to a child who allegedly was choked by her umbilical 
cord during birth and suffered severe brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came Friday in a case brought on behalf of  
12-year-old Gaelle Prindilus, who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl requires 24-hour care, needs a wheelchair and is unable  
to read or write because of her botched delivery by unsupervised, 
overworked and inexperienced residents at Harlem Hospital, said her 
lawyer, Thomas Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father works two jobs to pay for her care -- as a kitchen  
worker and a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaelle was born in 1987. During delivery, Moore said, the  
umbilical cord was wrapped tightly around her neck, decreasing her 
oxygen intake. 
</P>
<P>
	When the girl's mother, a Haitian immigrant with limited  
English, arrived at the hospital, a resident failed to do a 
sonogram that would have shown the cord around the baby's neck, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman delivered the baby alone in her room, ``no doctor, no  
nurse, no one,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Pittoni, a lawyer for the agency that oversees the city's  
hospitals, said it will appeal. Gaelle's condition existed in the 
womb and showed up in a CAT scan before delivery, Pittoni said.

<HEADLINE> Angels Rookie Tears Thumb Ligament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels outfielder Mike Colangelo  
will be sidelined at least three weeks after tearing a ligament in 
his left thumb during a collision in his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo's hand was placed in a cast Monday, a day after the  
left fielder ran into center fielder Reggie Williams in a game 
against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was examined by team physician Lewis Yocum and hand  
specialist Norman Zemel. The rookie's injury will be evaluated 
again in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels will make a move to replace Colangelo on the roster  
prior to Tuesday night's game at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was running full speed in the seventh inning when when  
Williams, who made the catch, barreled over him in a violent 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was down for about 15 minutes before being placed on a  
immobilizing board and taken off the field on a medical cart. He 
was taken to UC Irvine for a series of tests because he had pain in 
his upper back, but the tests showed that his spine was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was unhurt and remained in the game, a 3-1, 13-inning  
loss to the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Colangelo had just been called up from Anaheim's  
Triple-A Edmonton farm team and singled in his first big league 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hitting .362, with 13 runs scored and nine RBIs in 26  
games at Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Duval Opens Blisters Before Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- For his first tour of Pinehurst No. 2 on  
Monday, David Duval relied primarily on two pieces of equipment -- a 
putter and a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval decided to wait an extra day to play a full practice round  
for the U.S. Open because of the blisters on his right thumb and 
forefinger, courtesy of second-degree burns from a tea pot handle. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the knife?  
</P>
<P>
	After five holes, he decided it was time to slice open the  
blisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went everywhere,'' Duval said with a grin.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the No. 1 player in the world ranking and already a  
four-time winner this year, believes he'll still be smiling on 
Thursday when he tees off in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about this,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval burned his fingers Friday morning when he tried to pick up  
a tea pot off the gas stove in his new house in Ponte Vedra Beach, 
Fla. He didn't practice over the weekend, arrived at Pinehurst on 
Monday morning and walked the course with a 9-iron, two wedges and 
his putter. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked off the yardage with caddie Mitch Knox and planned to  
chip and putt around the signature humpback greens of Donald Ross. 
But he skipped the chipping after one hole because he could only 
grip the club with three fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Loss, a Seattle doctor and USGA rules official, persuaded  
Duval to slice open the blisters to accelerate the healing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may as well get used to it now,'' Duval said. He plans to  
play a practice round Tuesday with all 14 clubs in the bag -- and 
plenty of tape on his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval did try one full swing on the 11th hole, walking back to  
9-iron range. But he caught it fat and came out of the swing, the 
ball stopped 60 yards short of the green. Duval stared at his 
fingers, shrugged and walked on. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, he caught his share of grief from other players.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was all in good fun,'' he said. ``What can I say? As long  
as I can tee off on Thursday, it'll all be good fun.''

<HEADLINE> Shots Prompt Miss. Concert Stampede </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LENA, Miss. (AP) -- Gunshots rang out near the end of an all-day  
rap concert, provoking a stampede as audience members scrambled for 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
	One man suffered a dislocated shoulder when he was trampled in  
the panicked exodus Sunday night, said Teresa Malone, who owns the 
ambulance service that provided paramedics for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 people were arrested for alcohol possession and driving  
under the influence, said Linda Smith, a Leake County sheriff's 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, headlined by the New Orleans rapper Juvenile, was  
attended by 10,000 people at a drag racing track called Lake 
Slipaway, northeast of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend stampede marked the second time in recent weeks that  
injuries have occurred at the track. On Memorial Day, seven people 
were injured when a stage collapsed under the weight of the crowd 
during a bikini contest.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts on Nuclear Security Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the report by the President's Foreign Intelligence  
Advisory Board on security lapses at the Energy Department and its 
nuclear weapons labs. 

</P>
<P>
	``For the past two decades, the Department of Energy has  
embodied science at its best and security at its worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizational disarray, managerial neglect and a culture of  
arrogance -- both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves -- 
conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The panel found a department saturated with cynicism, an  
arrogant disregard for authority, and a staggering pattern of 
denial. ... Even after President Clinton ...(ordered) fundamental 
changes in security procedures, compliance by department 
bureaucrats was grudging and belated.'' 
</P>
<P>

has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.''

counterintelligence among many DOE and lab managers has ranged from 
halfhearted, grudging accommodation to smug disregard.''

<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps most troubling ... is the evidence that the lab  
bureaucracies, after months at the epicenter of an espionage

resisting reforms.''

<HEADLINE> Thailand Vehicle Sales Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's new vehicle sales jumped  
42.8 percent in May from a year ago, Toyota Motor Co. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The May sales figure of 15,340 units represents a 9.3 percent  
increase over April, Toyota said in a statement, and the car maker 
believes Thailand's car industry is leaving a crippling recession 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota charts total vehicle sales in Thailand, the biggest car  
manufacturing center in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger car sales in May were up 29 percent from a year ago  
and 6.3 percent more than in April. Commercial vehicle sales 
climbed 50.3 percent year-on-year and 10.7 percent from April. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five months of 1999, total vehicle sales were up 10  
percent from the same period in 1998 to 65,609 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai vehicle sales floundered between April and September last  
year, when sales averaged only 10,000 units per month and reached a 
low point of 9,782 in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's economy, as measured by gross domestic product,  
slumped by 8 percent last year but is forecast to grow by 1 percent 
in 1999 as local demand recovers.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took these actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ruled that a federal ban on broadcast advertising of casino  
gambling violates free-speech rights. The unanimous decision in a 
Louisiana case opened the door to full TV and radio advertising of 
such gambling, complete with pictures of bettors at tables. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will decide whether computers and other instructional  
materials paid for with taxpayer money can be used by religious 
schools. The court's decision in a Louisiana case could affect the 
national debate over school vouchers -- financial help from the 
government for families whose children attend religious and other 
private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether people suspected of sexually  
assaulting children can be prosecuted under a Texas law enacted 
after they allegedly committed the crimes. A man convicted of 
assaulting his stepdaughter argues that applying the new law 
retroactively to his case violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled unanimously in a Kentucky case that lawyers sanctioned by  
a federal judge for misconduct cannot appeal the penalty until the 
case is over, even if they no longer represent anyone involved in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to order  
other federal agencies to pay damages to employees they 
discriminate against. The 5-4 ruling said the EEOC can require 
agencies to pay compensatory damages, intended to reimburse for 
harm such as emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned down an appeal by Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry  
and other anti-abortion activists, who challenged nearly $600,000 
in fines and lawyer fees they were ordered to pay following a 
campaign to block New York City-area abortion clinics a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> Illinova, Dynegy Agree to $2B Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Midwestern electric utility Illinova Corp.  
and energy marketer Dynegy Inc. are merging in a $2 billion deal 
they say will create a national leader in the rapidly changing 
energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new firm, to be called Dynegy, will create a full-service  
energy company about $17 billion in annual revenue, the companies 
said in a joint statement released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boards have unanimously approved the merger plans, which  
must be approved by federal and state regulators and shareholders 
for each company. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be based in Houston, where Dynegy is  
currently based. Illinois Power, an Illinova subsidiary that serves 
about 650,000 electric and natural gas customers in central 
Illinois, will keep its Decatur headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Dynegy shareholders will receive either  
0.69 share in the new company for each Dynegy share or $16.50 in 
cash per Dynegy share. Illinova shareholders will exchange their 
shares on a share-for-share basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, will keep  
his titles in the new company. Charles Bayless, Illinova's 
chairman, president and chief executive, will be a nonexecutive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strategic combination creates tremendous opportunities  
for each company much faster than either could have achieved on a 
stand-alone basis,'' Watson said. ``Energy convergence is rapidly 
sweeping across the nation and is a major driver for energy 
industry competition and consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illinova announced a tentative deal earlier this year to sell  
its troubled Clinton nuclear power plant to AmerGen Energy Co. for 
$20 million -- about $4 billion less than it cost to build. Until 
its restart last month, the plant had been idle for more than two 
years, siphoning millions of dollars from the struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dynegy, with its experienced leadership and proven track  
record of risk management, profitability and growth, is the ideal 
strategic partner for Illinova,'' Bayless said. ``I am confident 
that, together, we will be a leader in the rapidly evolving energy 
marketplace of the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy, known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse until a year ago,  
began in 1985 as a wholesale marketer of natural gas. In the past 
few years, it has become a full-scale energy marketer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dynegy's major shareholders -- Chevron Corp.; BG PLC, parent of  
British Gas; and Nova Chemicals -- have agreed to the merger, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to close by the end of the first quarter  
in 2000.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Venezuelan economy declined nearly  
10 percent during the first quarter of 1999, according to news 
reports Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Central Bank official, who was not identified in the reports,  
said the institution would not deny the report. Official 
confirmation of the 9.8 percent figure was expected on Tuesday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contraction was due mostly to a precipitous drop in the  
price of oil, Venezuela's main export product. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil has recovered in the  
past two months -- from a low of $7 last year to about $14 now -- 
improving economic prospects for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the current recession is considered the worst in a  
decade, with hundreds of companies declaring bankruptcy. 
Unemployment is estimated at between 15 percent and 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	According to respected economist Pedro Palma, the chances of a  
recovery this year are small because of an overvalued currency that 
makes it difficult for exporters to compete and the drafting of a 
new constitution that could contribute to investor uncertainty. 
</P>

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian airplane manufacturer Embraer  
saw its shares skyrocket Monday after it announced several billion 
dollars worth of new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Embraer's stock jumped as high as 55 percent to $1.67 before  
closing at $1.35 on news that the company had secured some $4.9 
billion in contacts to sell 200 airplanes to Switzerland's 
Crossair. 
</P>
<P>
	Formerly owned by the government, Embraer was sold in 1994 and  
earned $102 million in 1998, the first profit in its 30-year 
history.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Up; Dow Gains 90.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, responding to a  
rally in long-term bonds as investors' anxiety over interest rates 
lessened. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
90.23 at 10.571.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 6.39 at 1,300.03, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 12.11 at 2,435.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds rose today for the first time in nine sessions after the  
Bank of Japan intervened in the global currency markets by buying 
dollars to slow the advance of the yen. The stronger dollar made 
U.S. Treasury bonds more attractive to overseas investors and 
triggered buying that reduced the yield in the benchmark 30-year 
bond from Friday's 6.16 percent high to 6.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave no hint about the  
Fed's interest rates policy in an appearance before a congressional 
committee today. He noted that technology has changed business 
productivity, but that the gains from technology can't go on 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin helped ease  
concerns that the Fed will increase interest rates at its June 
29-30 policy meeing. Rivlin said inflation worries in the United 
States are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Her remarks gave a lift to some technology shares, which,  
sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, took a pounding Friday. 
IBM, a Dow component, rose 9/16 to 114 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Internet shares were weak, as America Online fell 5 1/4 to 94 1/4  
and Amazon.com slid 7 1/16 to 98 3/4. Online auction company eBay 
tumbled another 18 7/8 to 147 after last week's shutdown of the 
service because of computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers in Dow stocks were American Express, up 2  
5/32 to 119 3/8 7/8 and DuPont, up 2 3/8 to 69 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, the No. 4 U.S. long-distance phone  
company, was down 8 7/8 to 36, after making a bid to buy U S West Inc. 
and Frontier Corp. for $66.4 billion. U S West was up 2 15/16 to 57 
13/16, while Frontier rose 3 1/4 to 58 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Qwest bid were to succeed, it would block a competing  
offer from Global Crossing, which fell 2 1/8 to 48 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 292.95 million 
shares, down slightly from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.18 to 621.68, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was flat at 765.82.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush said today he would not impose an abortion litmus test on 
his Supreme Court nominees and promised to uphold the dignity of 
the office if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide ranging news conference on his maiden trip to this key  
primary state, the GOP front-runner raised his right hand to a 
crowd of 150 reporters and said he swore an oath as Texas' governor 
to uphold the constitution and respect the dignity of the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pledge I have upheld, so help me God,'' Bush said, his  
right hand still raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected governor has said he was ``young and  
irresponsible'' when he was a young man. Now 52, Bush refused to 
say more about the topic today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a game in Washington,'' he told a New Hampshire  
reporter who posed the question. ``It's called ``Gotcha.' It's a 
game where you float a rumor and make the candidate'' respond. 
``I'm not playing that game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On abortion, Bush has said he would nominate judges who strictly  
interpret the U.S. Constitution. He was asked whether he interprets 
the Constitution to allow for abortions and whether he would 
require his judicial nominees to view it the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no litmus tests, except for whether or not the  
judges will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' he said. ``I am 
not a lawyer. My job is to pick judges who are qualified to serve 
on the bench and that will be my criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said later that Bush feels it is unethical to require a  
nominee to cement his or her views on any potential case before 
being nominated. But they said he would appoint conservative judges 
who hold the same general values as he. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he is opposed to abortion and would even support a  
constitutional amendment making the procedure illegal except in 
cases of rape, incest or to protect the woman. But he also says 
Americans don't support the measure so there is no sense in 
pursuing it. 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said he opposes quotas and racial preferences, but said the  
private and public sector should be encourage to reach out to 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Promised not to raise corporate or income taxes, but did not  
extend the pledge to other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expressed concern about the implementation of a peace plan in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pledged to provide more details about his agenda as the  
campaign progressed, saying he will move ``at my own timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor also planned to visit an elementary school  
and speak at a women's forum later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Republican presidential front-runner drew more than  
300 people to an early morning address on the banks of the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew crashed Bush's  
speech, pigeonholing reporters to accuse the Texas governor of 
refusing to detail his position on national issues. ``The governor 
from the Alamo state won't take a stand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew dubbed Bush ``Curious George'' because he said the  
governor's positions are so vague. ``Nobody wants Curious George 
with his finger on the button,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew also shadowed Bush's trip to Iowa on Saturday,  
underscoring how seriously the Democratic Party is taking his 
candidacy. No other GOP candidate is getting such attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has the support of the state's leading GOP politician, Sen.  
Judd Gregg. He was announcing the names of more than 180 local 
organizers today, along with the appointment of state public safety 
director Richard Flynn to be chairman of his coordinating 
committee. Flynn is the longest-serving state department head, long 
considered a behind-the-scenes powerbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush apologized to New Hampshire voters for waiting so long for  
his first trip,, saying he promised Texans he would complete the 
state's legislative session before campaigning for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you understand that I'm a man of my word,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush took more than 20 minutes getting to the stage, slowly  
making his way through a crowd of supporters eager to grab his 
hand. Spotting a redheaded baby in the crowd, he shouted, ``I've 
always been a sucker for baby pictures,'' then took the child from 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He kissed the baby in front of a group of photographers, then  
turned on request to pose for more cameras. ``Another kiss 
governor!'' one photographer yelled. Bush eagerly consented, and 
planted another kiss on the baby's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Irma Pierce of Portsmouth, N.H., pulled Bush aside briefly and  
asked him to do something about the rising costs of long-term care. 
`I will,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't satisfied with his answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``But at least it's hopeful,'' she said. ``He needs to be  
formulating some plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush announced Saturday in Iowa that there was ``no turning  
back'' from his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, in which 
he leads in the polls.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Man Dies, 3 Hurt in Rockslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Campers grabbed their  
children and ran when huge boulders came tumbling down a mountain 
at Yosemite National Park, killing a rock climber and injuring 
three people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a huge rumbling sound, like a jet coming close,''  
said Abbie Kealey, 43, a tourist from Baltimore who was atop 
Glacier Point when the face of the mountain collapsed beneath her 
Sunday. ``We looked over and we saw a tiny plume of impact that 
rose up like a nuclear blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter J. Terbush, a student at Western State College in  
Gunnison, Colo., died from head injuries in the slide. His body was 
recovered from among the fallen boulders Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush, 22, was at the base of a granite face, holding a rope  
that 20-year-old Kerry Pyle was using to ascend an intermediate 
climb that takes about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow climber Joe Kerwin, 21, stood by as Terbush controlled  
the rope. Then the rocks began crashing down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw enormous Volkswagen-sized boulders coming down and I  
just prayed we wouldn't be hit,'' Pyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerwin jumped out of the way of the falling rock, but Terbush  
held tight to the rope. He was still grasping it when the dust 
cleared and his friends found his body, Pyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had run, he probably would have ripped me off the rock  
and killed me,'' Pyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyle, Kerwin, and a third person who tried to help, suffered  
only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The rockslide hit around 7:35 p.m. Sunday, and prompted  
frightened campers to grab their children and flee when the 
boulders broke loose from about 2,500 feet up the west shoulder of 
the Glacier Point apron at the eastern end of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like an enormous clap of thunder, except it wasn't  
thunder,'' said Mike Sherman, 45, of Baton Rouge, La. ``I saw rocks 
falling down ... then it was quiet. Then there was this dust cloud 
and you couldn't see anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Marinda, said, ``It was like a waterfall of  
flesh-colored rocks, a cascade of these rocks and dust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 guests and employees in 300 cabins were evacuated  
from Curry Village and allowed to return several hours after the 
slide. Nobody in the village was hurt, and no structures were 
damaged. Many tourists left the park rather than spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who did stay were shaken awake again at about 5 a.m.  
Monday when a second, much smaller rockslide, lasting about 10 
seconds, sent more boulders down. 
</P>
<P>
	A geologist from the U.S. Geological Survey was expected to  
examine the slide area on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Geologists say the spring cycle of freezes and thaws contributes  
to such slides. Moisture gets into cracks in the rocks and freezes, 
widening the cracks. During the day it melts, then refreezes in the 
now wider fissure, accelerating the cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 10, 1996, a massive slide about half a mile from Sunday  
night's slide killed one tourist and injured seven others. 
</P>
<P>
	The village, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary, is  
a popular spot for campers and hikers.

<HEADLINE>  Murray Hired as L.A. Kings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Andy Murray, a success at the high school and  
international levels of hockey, added the NHL to his head coaching 
resume Monday when he was hired by the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, 48, replaces Larry Robinson, whose contract wasn't  
renewed in April after the team finished 32-45-5 and failed to 
reach the playoffs for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the team underachieved last season, this is a  
great time to come to Los Angeles,'' Murray said at a news 
conference near the downtown Staples Center, the new arena where 
the Kings will play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray agreed to a three-year contract. Financial terms weren't  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy Murray has a wealth of hockey knowledge. He's coached at  
just about every level you can imagine. He's a very bright 
individual, very intense,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said. 
``He'll demand the utmost of our players, certainly earn their 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray won the job over the other finalist, John Van Boxmeer,  
coach and general manager of the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's only other stints in the NHL were as an assistant with  
the Philadelphia Flyers from 1988-90; the Minnesota North Stars in 
1990-91, when they reached the Stanley Cup final; and the Winnipeg 
Jets from 1992-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that I have worked with players as a head coach at  
the international level will help me in this situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached Canada's national team to a 77-29-14 record and the  
gold medal in the 1997 world championships. Among his players was 
defenseman Rob Blake, the Kings' captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake cited Murray's intensity, discipline and work ethic as  
reasons the coach could succeed without any prior NHL head coaching 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands the players,'' Blake said. ``He touched on a  
big thing about respect, demanding a lot out of each player -- as 
much as they can give -- but also having that respect for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get the most out of this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Murray's most recent job was coaching at Shattuck-St. Mary's in  
Faribault, Minn., a prep school south of Minneapolis. The team went 
70-9-2 and won the Midget Triple A USA Hockey national title. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as an assistant for Canada at the 1996 World Cup  
of Hockey and the world championships, where the team won silver 
medals. He was an assistant for Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Luc Robitaille wasn't concerned the Kings didn't hire  
a high-profile coach. Taylor also interviewed former Buffalo Sabres 
coach Ted Nolan, Montreal assistant Dave King and Detroit assistant 
Dave Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy deserves a chance,'' Robitaille said. ``Everywhere  
he's been going, he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings made the playoffs just once in four years under  
Robinson, who had a 122-161-45 record. Last season, the Kings lost 
25 games by one goal, had one of the league's worst power plays and 
lost 335 man-games to injuries or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lacked intensity and the will to pay the price to win any  
game, especially down the stretch,'' Robitaille said. ``That's what 
a guy like that with his intensity will bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he plans to emphasize improved defense, with clearly  
defined roles for each player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our players when they don't have the puck to know  
exactly what their responsibilities are. There won't be leeway. 
Everybody will have to follow the same guidelines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they have the puck, I want players to bring their  
individual creativity on the ice because that's what the fans come 
to see.''

	Left wing Luc Robitaille wasn't concerned the Kings didn't hire  
a high-profile coach. Taylor also interviewed former Buffalo Sabres 
coach Ted Nolan, Montreal assistant Dave King and Detroit assistant 
Dave Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy deserves a chance,'' Robitaille said. ``Everywhere  
he's been going, he's won.''

<P>
	The Kings made the playoffs just once in four years under  
Robinson, who had a 122-161-45 record. Last season, the Kings lost 
25 games by one goal, had one of the league's worst power plays and 
lost 335 man-games to injuries or illness.

<HEADLINE> Don King Wants Holyfield-Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don King says if the Evander Holyfield-Lennox  
Lewis rematch happens, he will be the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, head of Time Warner Sports, has said the  
pay-per-view fight, which is set for Nov. 13, is in jeopardy if 
King does not give Time Warner the right to order the promoter to 
step aside if he is indicted in connection with the first 
Holyfield-Lewis fight. That bout ended in a controversial draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not giving up my rights, I'm not giving up the presumption  
of innocence,'' King said Monday at a news conference for the Oscar 
De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad welterweight tile bout Sept. 18 at Las 
Vegas. That fight will be co-promoted by King and Bob Arum and 
carried on pay-per-view by TVKO. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner Sports operates HBO and its pay-per-view arm, TVKO.  
</P>
<P>
	``An indictment is only an allegation,'' King said. ``If they  
have trouble being associated with me, then they can buy me out or 
I will buy them out,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	A buyout, either way, won't happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said that if King should grant Time Warner the right it  
seeks, it does not necessarily mean it would be exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers thought Lewis clearly won the March 13 fight in  
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``When an unpopular decision came, not a corrupt decision but an  
unpopular decision, I was abandoned like the bubonic plague,'' King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a chance that King could be indicted in connection with  
an investigation that the IBF fixed rankings for a payoff. Abraham 
said Time Warner would not be concerned about such an indictment in 
connection with an Holyfield-Lewis rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, FBI agents raided King's offices at Deerfield Beach,  
Fla., reportedly seeking records involving the IBF. The FBI would 
not confirm that was the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	King was not present.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was in Seth Abraham's office (in New York),'' King said,  
laughing. ``My office was under siege. No woman could go to the 
bathroom without an agent. No man could go to the bathroom without 
an agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said that should the Holyfield-Lewis rematch not take  
place, Lewis, promoted by Panos Eliades of Britain and Main Events, 
could fight the winner of the Michael Grant-Lou Savarese fight, 
possible in Madison Square Garden on Nov. 13. Lewis is scheduled to 
fly to New York Thursday and attend a match Saturday night in The 
Theater at the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight is made,'' King, Holyfield's promoter, said of the  
rematch. ``I got a $10 million site fee (for the match at Mandalay 
Bay in Las Vegas). Both fighters have signed. Holyfield wants the 
fight. I want the fight. The only one holding it up is HBO. If it 
falls through, we'll go on about our business.''

<HEADLINE> Smaller Crop May Mean Bigger Fruit / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- The unseasonably cool spring means fewer  
cherries and a later season, but growers say that might not be such 
a bad thing. It may mean a bigger, firmer fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most cherry growers are pretty optimistic at this point that  
we have a winning season ahead of us,'' said Jim Kelley, a 
Kennewick orchardist and horticulturist for 34 Chief Wenatchee 
growers from Prosser to Basin City. 
</P>
<P>
	The delayed crop means losing part of big Independence Day  
sales, but it also means growers don't have to compete with 
California's own later-than-usual crop for workers and market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvest projections for Washington and Oregon are for about  
70,000 tons of fresh-market cherries, down more than 15,000 tons 
from the earliest estimates because of a cool spring and 
pollination problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of this year's crop was damaged by wind or last summer's  
heat, which can cause growing abnormalities in the subsequent 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a big hit, but we still have plenty of cherries to  
sell,'' said B.J. Thurlby, promotion director for Northwest Cherry 
Growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasco grower Denny Hayden said less fruit means bigger, firmer  
cherries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going have quite a bit better size,'' said Hayden, who  
just returned from California where he checked on harvest that was 
just starting to peak. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw plenty of good fruit, and he likes the timing of the two  
harvests this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just adds to smooth marketing to allow (Californians) to  
move their crop prior to us really getting rolling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also gives growers a chance to find workers, many of whom  
travel to Washington as the California season wanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Washington and Oregon cherry growers picked more than  
85,000 tons -- a record crop and well above the eight-year average 
of 58,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bigger harvests are the product of more land in cherries,  
surpassing 20,000 acres in Washington. Cherries were Washington's 
ninth-most valuable crop in 1997, bringing in more than $128 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are one of the few reliable money makers in a  
generally poor farm economy and are worth more per acre than any 
other state crop, according to the most recent reports from the 
Washington Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the late harvest -- probably starting in the third week of  
June -- isn't all good news. It might not allow shipment of 
Northwest cherries across the nation by July 4, the biggest buying 
time for cherries, Thurlby said. About 60 percent of the crop is 
typically sold in the two weeks leading up to the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	But local cherry lovers won't have to skimp. ``West Coast  
consumers will see plenty of fruit,'' Thurlby said, noting the 
marketing commission has shifted toward late July promotions to 
make sure consumers are looking for cherries later than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the whole intricate picking and marketing machine  
depends on the weather. A week of temperatures in the low 80s is 
what growers want to ripen the hard balls of yellow fruit. And 
orchardists won't even talk about rain, which splits cherries.

<HEADLINE>  Off DL, Ripken Ripping the Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken woke up Monday morning wondering  
whether the finest performance of his outstanding baseball career 
was merely a figment of his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken set a Baltimore Orioles record by getting six hits in a  
game Sunday night, hitting two homers and a double in a 6-for-6 
effort against the Atlanta Braves. He then boarded a chartered 
flight and arrived home around 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few hours sleep, Ripken opened his eyes and immediately  
had a horrid thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wake up and wonder if it actually did happen or you just  
dreamed it happened. It's nice to know it did happen,'' Ripken said 
Monday afternoon. ``It's a pretty darn good feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record-breaking night was the consummation of a remarkable  
stretch in which he has added 149 points to his batting average 
while moving significantly closer to reaching 400 homers and 3,000 
hits over his 19-year career. He had 391 homers and 2,923 hits 
before the Orioles played Kansas City on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, best known for playing in 2,632 consecutive games, was  
batting .179 on April 20 before being placed on the disabled list 
for the first time in his career with a strained lower back. At the 
time he was also wrestling with feelings related to the death of 
his father, Cal Sr., who succumbed to lung cancer on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, there was a lot of benefit of being on the  
disabled list. It was a good break for me mentally and a necessary 
break physically,'' Ripken said. ``So when I came back, I was armed 
with a little bit better focus, a clearer head. And physically, I 
felt great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you learn the most from some of your not-so-nice  
experiences,'' he said. ``The obstacles that were in the way, I've 
been able to step over them and step around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning from the disabled list on May 13, Ripken hit  
safely in 22 of 26 games, batting .367 over that span to raise his 
batting average from .179 to .328. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference goes far beyond the new stance he broke out last  
month. Ripken valiantly attempted to play with pain in his lower 
back and anguish in his heart, but it was a futile effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire just wasn't there,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said.  
``Now he's having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Terry Crowley, who played under Ripken Sr. and has  
known the younger Ripken for years, realized early in spring 
training that Cal just didn't have his usual zest for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his actions, his personality and I know right away when  
Cal is feeling good. When he's feeling good, he's got a lot of 
energy and is fun to be around,'' Crowley said. ``When he's a 
little quiet, you know something's bothering him. I saw spurts of 
energy from him, but it wasn't a normal spring for Cal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, admittedly, Sunday wasn't a normal night for Ripken. His 13  
total bases tied his career high, the five runs scored set a team 
mark and it was the first time he had as many as five hits in a 
game since May 5, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like the ball was looking bigger than normal and coming  
in a little slower, even though the speed gun said differently,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His recent surge might turn out to be worth millions to him.  
Ripken's contract states that the Orioles must decide by the 
All-Star break whether to exercise his $6.3 million option for next 
season, or pay him $2.5 million with a chance to re-sign him at a 
lesser salary. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Ripken looks like a steal at $6.3 million a year,  
even if he does turn 39 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did last night was sort of a culmination,'' Orioles  
first baseman Will Clark said. ``By no means was it a fluke. He's 
been swinging the bat well for weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Session on Israel Settlements Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Israeli peace activists and delegates to a  
U.N. conference urged Israel on Monday to halt construction of 
Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas and adhere to peace 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker after speaker at the opening session of a U.N. meeting  
on Palestinian rights criticized Israeli settlement policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Building of new settlements and the expansion of the existing  
ones have destructive effects on the peace process,'' said Seyed 
el-Misry, Egypt's deputy foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli government, which always has ignored such  
discussions, did not send a delegate to Monday's meeting. ``We 
believe that is politicization of an issue which is basically 
humanitarian,'' said Ayellet Yehiav, a spokeswomen for the Israeli 
Embassy in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials and delegates from member countries also started  
preparations for a meeting next month that could start a process 
for dealing with Jewish settlements under international law. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting, called by the U.N. General Assembly, is to urge  
Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activity in 
Israeli-occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians maintain construction of Jewish settlements in  
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
violate the convention, which deals mainly with wartime actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention bans usurpation of land by an occupying power.  
But Israel, a signatory to it, maintains the territory it captured 
in the 1967 Middle East War is Jewish land. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath, addressing delegates  
Tuesday, said the June 15 conference in Geneva is of ``utmost 
importance'' to the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``A remedy should be found to stop Israel's mutilation and  
colonization of the Palestinian territories,'' Shaath said. ``Peace 
cannot be made while confiscation of the land continues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive  
peace talks since Israeli settlement activity stalled discussions a 
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Bans Sales of Coca Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The government on Monday banned the  
sale of all beverages of the Coca-Cola Co. following more 
hospitalizations of children who got sick after drinking Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Luc Vandenbossche urged Belgians not to drink  
Coca-Cola and such Coca-Cola brands as Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius and 
Bonaqua. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, 40 students were hospitalized in Lochristi in west  
Belgium. Last week, 31 school children became nauseous in the town 
of Bornem after drinking Coca-Cola and were taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbossche said doctors across Belgium have reported cases of  
illness after people drank Coca-Cola products. The nature and cause 
were under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working and continue to work around the clock to  
identify the reasons behind the product complaints,'' said 
Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the incident appears to be isolated to Belgium, where  
those who became ill reported a foul odor on the outside of the 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we have are symptoms of nausea likely induced by  
the off odor. There is not evidence that the cans or the product in 
the cans have caused any ill effects,'' Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tests run by Coca-Cola and an independent lab found  
nothing wrong with other beverages in the same vending machines. 
Additional test results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ban for Coca-Cola came as Belgium was still reeling  
from revelations that cancer-causing dioxin had entered the food 
chain through animal feed in recent months. That led the government 
to ban sales of chicken, pork, beef, eggs and meat products. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbossche said on the Belgian VRT radio network that the  
Coca-Cola ban will ``remain in effect until it becomes clear what 
the origin and nature of the contamination are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Belgian branch of Coca-Cola announced a recall of  
2.5 million bottles of Coca-Cola after the 31 schoolchildren became 
ill after drinking from Coca-Cola bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said some bottles had a quality defect, which can  
lead to symptoms such as headaches, nausea and stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-drink company sent researchers to the school at Bornem  
where students fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has been active in Belgium for 70 years. It has large  
bottling operations in Antwerp and Ghent.

	NATO Troops Find Atrocities  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of NATO forces in Kosovo  
began to uncover evidence of Serb atrocities against ethnic 
Albanians. In the southern town of Kacanik, British soldiers 
counted 81 graves believed to hold bodies of massacre victims. Area 
residents said the graves were recently dug for bodies that 
initially had been dumped in a mass grave. They indicated a large 
pit behind a gasoline station, which was covered with boards. 
British officials said war crimes investigators would be called in 
to examine the site, 30 miles south of Pristina.

	NATO Troops Flood Into Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More than 14,000 NATO troops are now  
in Kosovo as part of the alliance's peacekeeping convoy. More than 
1,200 U.S. Marines are part of the deployment. The Marines took up 
positions in what eventually will be the U.S.-controlled zone of 
the province. The United States will contribute about 7,000 troops 
to NATO's 50,000-strong force. A NATO official says the deployment 
is going ``very smoothly'' and slightly ahead of schedule.

	Unwanted e-Mail Proliferating  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A survey of 13,000 e-mail users found  
that 90 percent of those polled received junk e-mail at least once 
a week, and 50 percent said they got ``spam'' six or more times per 
week. The Gartner Group survey also found that the longer a user 
stays with a particular Internet service provider, the more spam he 
or she is likely to receive. Examples of ``spam'' include 
get-rich-quick schemes, links to pornography, software offers, 
health promotions and investment information. America Online and 
several other leading Internet service providers have become 
leaders in the fight against spam.

	Drunk Driving Penalties Tougher  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans behind bars or on  
probation for drunken driving nearly doubled between 1986 and 1997, 
the government reports. While the severity of punishment increased, 
arrests for drunken driving dropped during the same period -- from 
1.8 million in 1986 to 1.5 million in 1997 -- said a Justice 
Department study released yesterday. The department's Bureau of 
Justice Statistics attributed the decline in arrests in part to the 
aging of motorists, since younger drivers are more prone to drink 
and drive. In 1997, 54 percent of licensed drivers were age 40 or 
older, up from 46 percent in 1986.

	16 Die in Chinese Factory Blaze  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- As fire engulfed an electronics factory in  
south China, managers ordered workers to save property instead of 
rescuing endangered colleagues, and 16 people were killed, a 
Chinese media report said. The fire broke out late Saturday on the 
first floor at the Zhimao Electronics Plant in Shenzhen, an 
industrial city bordering Hong Kong. Twelve women and four men were

	N.D. Man Wins 'Think-Off' Contest  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK MILLS, Minn. (AP) -- A 26-year-old high school social  
studies teacher from Valley City, N.D., won the Great American 
Think-Off on Saturday with a convincing spiel that science is more 
dangerous than religion. The seventh annual event featured debate 
between four finalists selected from about 500 argumentative essays 
submitted from around the world. The Think-Off audience then 
selected a winner, who receives $500 and a contract from an 
educational book publisher. Mark Friestad cited the early 1900s 
eugenics movement, which hypothesized the human gene pool could be 
improved if weak links were removed.

	NBA Mulls Age Limits for Rookies

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NBA commissioner David Stern said he'd like to  
see an age limit for young players coming into the league. Stern 
told The Washington Post in today's editions that with more and 
more young players leaving college early, or skipping it 
altogether, to turn pro, he'd like to work with the players' union 
to impose a minimum age limit. According to the Post, the NBA would 
try to follow the lead of the NFL, which has a rule that requires 
players to have been out of high school for three years before they 
are eligible for the draft.

	NATO Troops Find Atrocities  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- British forces in Kosovo may have  
found evidence of mass killings. The troops, part of NATO's 
peacekeeping convoy in the Yugoslav province, counted 81 graves in 
one city, and say they can smell decomposing flesh. The graves are 
marked with numbers, but no names. Area residents said the graves 
were recently dug for bodies that initially had been dumped in a 
mass grave. They indicated a large pit behind a gasoline station, 
which was covered with boards. Norway is sending eight forensic 
experts to join a 60-member international team gathering evidence 
for the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, the National Bureau

	Court Rejects Ban on Casino Ads

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court unanimously struck down  
today the federal government's effort to protect compulsive 
gamblers from the lure of some casinos, ruling that a ban on 
television and radio advertising violates free-speech rights. 
Several justices wondered aloud about the legitimacy and 
effectiveness of the government's plan when some 240 casinos owned 
by Indian tribes in 31 states, 38 state-run lotteries and other 
gambling operations are free to advertise at will. The government 
argued that compulsive gamblers cause ``devastating social costs.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether computers and other instructional materials paid for with 
taxpayer money can be used by religious schools. The decision, 
expected sometime next year, could affect the constitutional debate 
over school vouchers -- financial help from the government for 
families whose children attend religious and other private schools. 
A New Orleans-based federal appeals court struck down a federal 
program last year by ruling that providing educational materials 
other than textbooks for religiously affiliated elementary and 
secondary schools violates the constitutionally required separation 
of government and religion.

``Please don't squeeze the Charmin'' a household phrase in more

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
today that recent increases in productivity have been a principal 
factor holding down inflation, but he cautioned that the ``growth 
of productivity cannot increase indefinitely'' and said 
``experience advises caution.'' Productivity is considered the 
crucial element in raising living standards because it allows 
employers to pay their workers more without triggering inflationary

<HEADLINE>  Wal-Mart Is Buying Asda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Global retailing leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on  
Monday announced its arrival in Britain with the $10.7 billion 
takeover of Asda Group PLC, the country's third largest supermarket 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which more than doubles the Wal-Mart's international  
sales and consolidates its position in Europe, promises to increase 
competition in the British retail sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retailers over here are scared of Wal-Mart,'' said retail  
analyst Richard Hyman of the London firm Verdict. ``It's of a size 
that's beyond the experience of everyone else. Things will never be 
the same again. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's offer trumps a $9.4 billion deal previously agreed  
upon between Asda and Britain's Kingfisher PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Asda said Monday it has recommended the Wal-Mart bid to  
shareholders. Kingfisher said it would not increase its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Wal-Mart announced that Bob L. Martin, president and  
chief executive of the company's international division, had 
resigned to pursue other business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Martin's tenure, Wal-Mart's international holdings have  
grown from an initial investment in Mexico in 1991 to a division 
that now operates in eight countries with $12.5 billion in sales 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will be replaced by John Menzer, Wal-Mart executive vice  
president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart senior vice president Don Soderquist said discussions  
with Asda only developed in the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time in the past we've held talks, but not about  
an offer,'' Soderquist said. ``The Kingfisher merger created the 
opportunity to look at it and become serious about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Wal-Mart will give Asda the muscle to secure  
better deals from its suppliers, leading to lower prices on the 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hyman said research ``shows that U.K. consumers are after  
more than just price ... Most customers are prepared to pay a 
premium for a higher specification, higher quality offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in the 1950s by the late Sam Walton with the slogan,  
``We sell for less, always,'' Wal-Mart launched its drive into 
Europe last year when it bought the Wertkauf chain of 95 
supermarkets in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Edwards, a retail analyst with Salomon Smith Barney,  
said Wal-Mart had undercut German retailers by 15-20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A consolidation process has started and some companies are in  
merger talks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asda, which grew out of a 1920s farming cooperative, now has 229  
stores and annual sales of $12.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Asda chief executive Allan Leighton said the two companies are a  
good fit ``from a colleague perspective and a customer 
perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we operate is based mainly on ideas we pinched from  
Wal-Mart. So from a colleague point of view this is pretty much the 
perfect deal'', said Leighton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, which had $137.6 billion in revenue in 1998 and  
operates 3,600 stores worldwide, said Asda stores will continue 
trading under their own name. The Asda board will report directly 
to Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.

<HEADLINE> LA's Subway Reaches Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Next stop, Hollywood. Finally.  
</P>
<P>
	With Tinseltown flourish, including a glitzy new station roofed  
with movie reel cans and sporting concrete palm trees, the 4.6-mile 
Hollywood extension of the Metro Rail subway opened over the 
weekend to huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Abandoning buses and cars for the underground rail, an estimated  
200,000 people took free rides on at least a portion of the 
11.1-mile Red Line route, Ed Scannell, a spokesman for the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The premiere of the Hollywood extension marked a major step for  
the much-criticized, over-budget and behind-schedule subway. Until 
Saturday, the Red Line ran just a little over six miles, from 
downtown's Union Station westward. 
</P>
<P>
	Seats filled rapidly and there was standing room only as the  
subway train pulled up at the new station at Hollywood Boulevard 
and Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time on a subway,'' said Marcial San Pedro, a  
retiree riding with his wife, Aida. ``This is my wife's first time 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood and Vine station sported a 1930s movie theme,  
including two vintage film projectors. Four other new stations had 
different designs, ranging from tiles that resembled patchwork 
quilts to natural-looking rock formations to displays of fossils 
unearthed during the subway's excavation. Free entertainment was 
provided at the new stops. 
</P>
<P>
	MTA officials joined the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came out to show my wife and family what I've been working  
on all these months,'' said Alfonso Rodriguez, MTA deputy executive 
officer and project manager of the Hollywood extension. ``I also 
brought my brother and his family because I wanted to see what they 
thought and how the public reacted to our project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said weekday Red Line passenger counts now are  
expected to double. ``Right now we have 39,000 people boarding 
daily,'' he said. ``With this extension, we expect it to go to 
nearly 80,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MTA has added a daily shuttle at the Hollywood and Vine stop  
near the Walk of Fame. Free for anyone with a subway ticket stub, 
the shuttle takes riders farther west on Hollywood Boulevard past 
its landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.6-mile, six-year project, which was supposed to open last  
December, and a smaller addition that was already in service cost 
$1.74 billion, about $288 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Red Line will continue on from Hollywood to  
Universal City, then drop down into the San Fernando Valley. Its 
total length will be 17.4 miles.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Competing With Gore Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Bill Bradley on Monday rejected suggestions  
that a bruising primary campaign against Vice President Al Gore 
could damage Democrats' chances for winning the White House in 
2000, just as primary competition did for Republicans in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed, whether it was in basketball or  
politics, that competition was good -- that you're a better team in 
the finals because you've had competition,'' Bradley, a former NBA 
star, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Democratic primaries will be different from the bitter  
1996 Republican primaries because Bradley is Gore's only 
challenger, the three-term former senator from New Jersey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1996, you had a crowded field of Republicans, and they were  
trying to separate themselves from the field, and a negative 
approach was one of the ways to do that,'' Bradley said, alluding 
to publisher Steve Forbes' blistering attack ads that year on 
front-runner Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ads hurt Dole; he entered the general election campaign  
weakened and lost to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity for substantive debate about the  
issues, about the country's future, that we haven't had in the past 
because of the nature of multiple candidates in the primary,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a week, Bradley declined to rule out  
aggressive advertising. He said he will compare himself with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my hope is we can keep this on a high plane, that we keep  
it focused on what the issues are and what we believe in,'' Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first high-profile visit to California's capital since  
announcing his presidential exploratory committee, Bradley held 
question-and-answer sessions with two groups: first, disabled 
people and their caretakers; second, a racially mixed group of 
young mentors and troubled youths. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley delivered about 15 minutes of remarks to each group and  
invoked personal experiences to establish credibility with them. He 
told the health care workers that when he was growing up his family 
had such an assistant to care for his father, who had calcified 
arthritis of the lower spine. 
</P>
<P>
	After each speech, delivered sitting in a chair with listeners  
gathered around him, Bradley played moderator, probing at the 
failings of the home health care industry and the dangers of youth 
violence. He asked questions occasionally, but mostly listened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to make a change now, or the future's gonna be  
chaotic,'' one young man told Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley didn't make any policy pronouncements, instead  
encouraging each group to continue its work. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third full day of his 10-day California swing, he took  
pains to connect with every individual in every room he entered, 
even shaking hands in a roomful of journalists before his news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearances Monday typified the kind of campaigning he hopes  
to do this summer: intimate gatherings with community groups, with 
news media hovering in the background. ``Bill Bradley for 
President'' placards hung in each room. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is mixing fund raising with public appearances.  
</P>
<P>
	A major event is planned Thursday in Hollywood, spokesman Eric  
Hauser said, adding that he did not know how much money Bradley 
hoped to raise. Several other fund-raising events in California are 
merely ``prospecting'' excursions, setting the stage for later 
donations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Marinovich Reports to Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILLIWACK, British Columbia (AP) -- A day late, quarterback Todd  
Marinovich finally embarked on his pro football comeback with the 
CFL's British Columbia Lions on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time. The coaches are great. They're  
not rushing me through it,'' said Marinovich, given club permission 
to miss the Lions' first day of training camp so he could attend to 
personal matters in southern California. ``That's what's great 
about it, there's not a whole lot of pressure on me to perform 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a No. 19 jersey, Marinovich took snaps and attempted  
passes in what was his first competitive workout in five years. 
Signing a one-year deal with an option with the Lions last week, 
Marinovich is vying for the club's backup quarterback spot behind 
Damon Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted his biggest challenge is becoming familiar with the  
CFL game and its 12 players aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first it is a little overwhelming, but the way training  
camp's set up you go over a few things so there won't be any 
problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich, who turned 30 last month, first gained national  
attention when he led the Southern Cal to the 1990 Rose Bowl title. 
A first-round selection in the 1991 NFL draft, the 6-foot-4, 
220-pound Marinovich played two years with the then-Los Angeles 
Raiders before he was cut in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't dressed for a game since 1992 and has been out of  
football since 1994 when he sustained a knee injury in the first 
week of training camp with the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading  
guilty to a felony charge of cultivating marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, the NFL cleared Marinovich to pursue a comeback. He  
worked out with Chicago, Seattle, New Orleans and Washington, but 
never signed an NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm over it now,'' said Marinovich about not landing a spot on  
an NFL club. ``I was a little baffled looking around the league and 
seeing the talent, but at least now I've got a chance to play 
somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich is one of four quarterbacks in camp after Justin  
Vedder, from the University of California product, was suspended 
for leaving the team before camp opened.

<HEADLINE> Colombians Flee Rebel Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA PISTA, Colombia (AP) -- It had been rebel territory for as  
long as most could remember. Guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia levied taxes, built roads, ran child care 
centers and meted out gun-barrel justice to those accused of 
collaborating with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the murderous debut of right-wing death squads in the vast  
jungle known as Catatumbo transformed the political landscape in 
this corner of northeastern Colombia and sent hundreds of terrified 
residents fleeing into neighboring Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 29, according to human rights workers and villagers,  
about 150 armed men in camouflage fatigues mounted a roadblock on a 
rural highway and forced dozens of vehicles to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Lists in hand, they ordered motorists and bus passengers to show  
identification. Anyone whose name appeared on a list was ordered to 
lie face down on the ground and was shot in the head, the accounts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no compassion with anyone. They murdered in cold  
blood,'' said a 54-year-old man who identified himself only as 
Luis. He said he witnessed the killing of eight people that day and 
escaped by running into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels, landowner-backed paramilitary groups and the army are  
still fighting for control of the Catatumbo River valley, where 
guerrillas have been the de facto government and where the economy 
depends on the cultivation of coca, the raw material for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Venezuela repatriated more than 2,000 Colombians who  
had fled the violence. Most of the refugees were trying to get to 
the Colombian city of Cucuta, but couldn't because the paramilitary 
squads blocked the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing for their lives, Catatumbo residents are still streaming  
into Venezuela by foot and canoe, braving swamps, rugged terrain, 
heat and armed irregulars. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, 600 people, most of them from La Pista, petitioned  
Venezuela for refuge. They were sent back to Colombia over the 
weekend, despite protests from human rights workers worried about 
their safety. Venezuelan officials said the refugees were 
repatriated after reaching a deal with Colombia providing them with 
protection, and that they went back voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The exodus underscores how the effects of Colombia's worsening  
35-year-old civil war have begun to spill into neighboring 
countries, despite renewed efforts to start peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	It also shows how paramilitary squads, created nearly two  
decades ago to fight leftist rebels, are gaining ground in 
Colombia, inflaming the armed conflict in one of the world's most 
violent countries. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows for sure how many have died in the past two weeks,  
but Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel put the number 
of dead civilians at 80. Peasants say there are several mass 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called the situation  
in Catatumbo ``a mini Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruben Zamora, regional commander of the Revolutionary Armed  
Forces, told The Associated Press that his group would ``fight to 
the very end'' so life in Catatumbo can ``return to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Normal'' in these parts means rebel rule.  
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas charge taxes on each pound of harvested coca leaf  
and settle property disputes. When the rebels stage one of their 
periodic bombings of Colombia's main oil pipeline -- sometimes 
spilling thousands of barrels of crude into the Catatumbo River -- 
rebel commanders tell oil company supervisors whom to hire for the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since last month's paramilitary offensive, schools in the  
Catatumbo village of La Pista have been closed. Food is scarce, and 
most people have chosen to flee to safer ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In La Gabarra, the village hit hardest by paramilitary violence,  
hooded men wearing the death squads' trademark armband were seen 
roaming the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	A message spray-painted on a wall and signed by a paramilitary  
group said, ``We have arrived to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The displacement of people will continue because the  
paramilitaries are advancing with the support of the armed 
forces,'' charged Zamora, the rebel commander, who granted an 
interview at a jungle location he requested not be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	As he and five other rebels spoke, a peasant in a canoe carried  
coca leaf down a river and in the distance, entire families trudged 
through the jungle in their quest to reach Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are terrorized,'' Zamora said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers' Sanctions Appeals Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers sanctioned by a federal judge for  
misconduct cannot appeal the penalty until the case is over, even 
if they no longer are involved in the dispute, the Supreme Court 
ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decision said a Kentucky lawyer acted too soon in  
appealing a penalty she was ordered to pay for violating a judge's 
orders during a wrongful-death case. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal can be filed only after the underlying case is over,  
the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To permit an immediate appeal from such a sanctions order  
would undermine the very purposes'' of a federal trial rule, 
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. That rule ``was 
designed to protect courts and opposing parties from delaying or 
harassing tactics'' during pretrial fact-finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, appeals cannot be filed while a case still is  
pending, although there are some exceptions. For example, someone 
who claims legal immunity from a lawsuit is allowed to file a 
pretrial appeal when a judge has denied immunity and ordered the 
case to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals courts had split over whether lawyers could appeal  
sanctions against them while the underlying case was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision upholds a federal appeals court decision that  
dismissed attorney Teresa L. Cunningham's appeal of a $1,494 
penalty she had been ordered to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, of Florence, Ky., filed a wrongful-death lawsuit in  
September 1995 on behalf of Darwin Lee Starcher after his son, 
Casey, committed suicide while in the Hamilton County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes arose during pretrial fact-finding when Cunningham had  
difficulty responding to requests for information by the county's 
lawyers. The county asked the judge to sanction her for failing to 
comply with the judge's orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The county also sought to have Cunningham disqualified from the  
case on grounds she was a potential witness. She had spoken to jail 
officials about Casey Starcher's psychiatric condition a few days 
before his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate judge ruled that Cunningham had violated  
his order on the fact-finding schedule and directed her to pay 
$1,494 in attorneys' fees to the county. The magistrate also 
ordered her removed from the case because she might be a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham appealed the sanction, but the 6th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals ruled she could not appeal until the wrongful-death case 
was resolved. The issues in Cunningham's appeal of the sanctions 
were too closely related to the underlying case, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cunningham's appeal was pending, the wrongful-death case  
went forward with another lawyer. A lower court granted judgment to 
the county, and Starcher's family appealed that ruling to the 6th 
Circuit court. However, Cunningham did not file a new appeal of her 
sanctions based on the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court ruled that Cunningham filed her appeal  
too early. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas noted that a sanctions order is different from a ruling  
that someone is in contempt of court, which is intended to force 
someone to comply with a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Cunningham vs. Hamilton County, 98-727.

<HEADLINE> Popovich in Control in San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- This was supposed to be a good day for the  
San Antonio Spurs. It was December 1996 and David Robinson was 
returning from an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Leave it to Gregg Popovich to kill the mood.  
</P>
<P>
	Popovich, the general manager, fired coach Bob Hill before that  
night's game in Phoenix. He appointed himself coach, and it was 
hardly a popular decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was made with a lot of thought and a lot of counsel and a  
lot of heartache,'' Popovich explained at the time, admitting the 
scenario looked ``quite self-serving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich was never one to let on that he worried what others  
thought of him. The same holds true today. 
</P>
<P>
	As San Antonio heads into the NBA Finals on Wednesday against  
the New York Knicks, Popovich is doing his job in typical 
no-nonsense fashion. Sometimes brash, always disciplined, he is 
leading the Spurs further in the playoffs than they've ever gone 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pop has stayed on us,'' guard Mario Elie said. ``Pop just  
wants us to get better every day, and he's been doing a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Spurs marched into the championship series -- losing  
only one game to Minnesota in the first round then sweeping the Los 
Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers -- demonstrated Popovich's 
workmanlike approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich got his early basketball experience in the military,  
playing at the Air Force Academy. Appropriately, he was team 
captain. While serving a five-year military commitment afterward he 
toured Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as part of the U.S. 
Armed Forces team. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich later was an assistant coach at Air Force before  
becoming head coach at Pomona-Pitzer in Claremont, Calif. He worked 
as an assistant in the NBA under Larry Brown at San Antonio and Don 
Nelson at Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Nelson, now coach and general manager of the Dallas  
Mavericks, Popovich still holds both jobs with the Spurs. He says 
it's a big help to have a strong staff on both the coaching and 
management sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be able to delegate and trust people and let them  
do their jobs. My staff allow me to do that,'' Popovich said. 
``It's run pretty smoothly for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich hints he might not always want both titles.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe over time it's something you wouldn't want to do anymore  
just because no matter what, it does take up a lot of your 
concentration,'' he said. ``So I think in time I might want to get 
rid of that responsibility and enjoy life a little bit more, 
maybe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs chairman Peter Holt has been negotiating an extension on  
Popovich's three-year contract, which ends after next season. 
Popovich is paid $1.1 million this season and $1.2 million next 
season, the San Antonio Express-News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich struggled through a public relations nightmare after  
firing Hill, then led the Spurs to the franchise's worst record 
that season (20-62). He redeemed himself in the summer of 1997 when 
the Spurs won the NBA Draft lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan was the top prize. With the 7-footer from Wake Forest  
on board and Robinson recuperating, the Spurs were on the mend and 
on the way toward winning again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997-98 season, the Spurs went 56-26 and set the league  
record for best turnaround in a season. San Antonio advanced to the 
Western Conference semifinals before getting ousted by Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Popovich added playoff-tested veterans Elie, Steve  
Kerr and Jerome Kersey to the mix. After a 6-8 start and 
speculation that Popovich might be fired, the Spurs went on a tear 
in March and finished the rest of the regular season 31-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the superstars, Pop gets on both of them, Tim and Dave.  
... We accept it and just move on and try to do better,'' Elie 
said. ``Nobody talks back to Pop. He's in charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Popovich has nothing but praise for his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who could take this group to the  
finals,'' he said. ``It's a hell of a group of guys.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Chief Warns on Hasty Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr. warned  
Congress on Monday against hastily enacting legislation to govern 
the fast-changing technology industry, saying that policies rushed 
into place today could become obsolete quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstner, speaking at the Joint Economic Committee's High Tech  
Summit, said the rise of networks that connect people around the 
world already has begun to transform education, business and 
government. But he estimated that this process is only about 
one-sixth of the way complete, and that more information is needed 
to develop a model for public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a grave error to think the Internet and e-business will  
develop under the kind of regulation we applied to the phone system 
back in the days when coal and steel were determinants of a 
nation's greatness,'' Gerstner said. ``This means we have to be 
patient and thoughtful before rushing to enact new legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government does have a role to play, even taking the lead on  
such issues as tax policy, the IBM chief said. In other areas, such 
as electronic commerce, government and industry should work 
together to come up with an approach that balances the interests of 
business and society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Building this kind of market-based environment implies that we  
will allow our respect for free market economies to work wherever 
possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology leaders expressed their support for ways the  
government could assist the industry, particularly on the issue of 
liability for Y2K computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Barrett, Intel's chief executive officer, backed a Senate  
bill that would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K glitches before 
lawsuits can be filed. The legislation would also encourage 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main issue is that we not clog up the courts and tie down  
the industry with frivolous litigation,'' Barrett told the 
committee via a video hookup. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with the help  
of Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher Dodd of 
Connecticut, would limit class action lawsuits and ensure that most 
companies are liable only for the proportion of the damage they 
cause. It would also set punitive damage caps for companies with 50 
or fewer employees.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Rep. Says He Wants 4th Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Five years after support for term limits  
helped him defeat the speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. 
George Nethercutt has had a change of heart: He wants another term. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking more like he was making an apology than an announcement,  
Nethercutt, R-Wash., on Sunday called his promise to serve only 
three terms a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've changed my mind,'' a penitent Nethercutt told reporters  
and a handful of staffers at a hastily called news conference. ``I 
made a mistake when I chose to set a limit on my service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Support for term limits carried Nethercutt to an upset victory  
over Tom Foley, 15-term congressman and then-speaker of the House, 
in 1994. Now, Nethercutt will face stiff opposition from one of the 
groups that helped him win. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Term Limits says it will spend $1  
million in the 2000 campaign to defeat him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't vote for him again,'' said Connie Smith, co-chair  
of Eastern Washington Term Limits and an ardent supporter of 
Nethercutt in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of various term limits laws to hold up in court, and  
the fact that other states do not limit their congressmen, were 
factors in his decision to run again, Nethercutt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he still has a lot to accomplish in Congress, and could  
not say how many more terms he'll need. 
</P>
<P>
	Nethercutt had been waffling for months on his pledge.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only people who don't change their minds are in cemeteries  
and insane asylums,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican leaders have been urging Nethercutt to run, as  
they seek to preserve the GOP majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Nethercutt was easily re-elected twice while vowing to keep his  
pledge to serve only three terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, now U.S. ambassador to Japan, declined to comment on  
Nethercutt's decision to run for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Term Limits says six of 10 House members whose self-imposed  
term limits expire with this Congress are honoring them, including 
Reps. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., and Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho. Two 
other one-time term limit supporters in the House have announced 
they will seek re-election, Marty Meehan, D-Mass., and Scott 
McInnis, R-Colo. The other, Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., is considering 
seeking another term.

<HEADLINE> Unwanted e-Mail Proliferating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Most Internet users are deluged with  
virtual junk mail -- get-rich-quick schemes, links to pornography, 
software offers, health promotions and investment information. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of it is unwanted, according to a survey of users who want  
Internet service providers held responsible for the flood of junk 
mail, known as spam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gartner Group survey of 13,000 e-mail users, released today,  
found that 90 percent of users receive spam at least once a week 
and almost 50 percent get spammed six or more times per week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gartner also found that the longer a user stays with a  
particular Internet service provider, the more spam he or she is 
likely to receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study showed emphatically that e-mail users resent the  
time it takes to delete spam, see it as huge invasion of their 
privacy and are offended by it,'' said Sunil Paul, CEO of Bright 
Light Technologies, who commissioned the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Everett-Church, co-founder of the Coalition Against  
Unsolicited E-mail, said he knew lots of computer users were 
unhappy with the flood of unsolicited e-mails. But he said he 
hadn't realized the extent the problem until he saw the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study is fantastic, it provides us with tangible, hard  
numbers on issues that we suspected for a long time but seemed 
anecdotal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike paper junk mail, spam costs the recipients and service  
providers in the form of online time, bandwidth and disk space. Not 
to mention aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
	Three out of four respondents said their Internet service  
provider should be responsible for banning or regulating the spam, 
while 13.5 percent thought the federal government should do this. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and state legislatures have sought to ban spam, and the  
Federal Trade Commission sues con artists whose spam deceives 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online and several other leading Internet service  
providers have become leaders in the fight against spam. 
</P>
<P>
	Spam experts say AOL alone has drastically reduced the number of  
spammers launching e-mail campaigns from AOL accounts, and 
aggressively pursued legal action against spammers whose conduct 
affects the service.

<HEADLINE> Most Endangered U.S. Sites Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drugstore chains are tearing down historic  
landmarks as they target the reviving centers of small towns for 
new stores, the National Trust for Historic Preservation complained 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping the organization's annual list of the 11 most endangered  
sites in the United States was what the group generically called 
``The Corner of Main and Main-Nationwide.'' Thousands of buildings 
may be involved, said Richard Moe, the trust's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``While promising discussions are under way with CVS and Rite  
Aid, unless executives of all chain drugstores make a commitment to 
adapt their shortsighted strategies, America's Main Streets could 
be turned into cut-rate versions of suburban strip malls,'' the 
trust said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walgreen's alone is planning to double its stores to 6,000 in  
the next 10 years,'' Moe told a news conference. ``They're savvy 
retailers and they look for the busiest spot -- that's often where 
the town's oldest buildings are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moe said the trust is trying to persuade the chains to restore  
old structures instead of destroying them. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen's is in court trying to replace two houses in Rockland,  
Mass., built in 1840 and 1874, with a 15,000-square-foot store and 
parking for 56 cars, Moe said. Both homes are on the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Polzin, a Walgreen's spokesman, said his firm targets  
intersections, not historic buildings. Sometimes the buildings are 
too small for the company's planned megasites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to redo old buildings, but it has to make economic  
sense,'' Polzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walgreen executives had a ``get-to-know-you'' meeting with the  
preservationists in April, but no other meeting has been scheduled, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 other sites on the trust's list include the auditorium of  
Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska, that state's oldest 
school; Traveler's Rest, a campsite of the Lewis and Clark 
expedition in Lolo, Mont., and country estates on River Road in 
Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust says it has helped save 102 sites since it began its  
campaigns in 1988. They include Washington's 180-year-old 
Congressional Cemetery, where Civil War photographer Mathew Brady, 
composer John Philip Sousa and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover are 
buried.

	Wet weather moved into parts of the Northeast and the Plains,  
while the West enjoyed mostly fair and dry conditions Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain and thunderstorms pushed into the Northeast, eastern Ohio  
Valley and Tennessee Valley. Coastal areas of the Northeast were 
cloudy and had scattered rain because of a low pressure system 
spinning off the New Jersey shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers also dampened the lower Mississippi Valley and Texas.  
Heavier thunderstorms were expected in western Texas, where some 
flooding was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong to severe thunderstorms were expected in the eastern  
parts of Wyoming and Colorado, into South Dakota and Nebraska. 
Damaging winds, large hail and heavy rainfall were likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the showers over the northern Rockies, fair and dry  
weather dominated in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest mid-afternoon high in the Lower 48 was recorded in  
Gila Bend, Ariz., where it was 101. The low was 36, in Stanley,

<HEADLINE> Short-Term T-Bill Interest Rates Up / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in roughly 
10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.50 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.620 percent, up from 4.510 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.855 percent, up from 4.760 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 21, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since Aug. 24, 1998, when the rate was 4.940. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.753 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.20 and 5.059 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,754.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.12 
percent last week from 5.08 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Critics Say More NYPD Reform Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the mayor and police commissioner, the  
testimony of four officers against a fellow cop in the torture 
trial of a Haitian immigrant is proof that the ``blue wall of 
silence'' is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty plea by Officer Justin Volpe after the officers'  
damning testimony was ``very encouraging to the image of the police 
department,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, who is white, was accused of brutalizing Abner Louima  
with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn stationhouse. Another 
officer was found guilty of holding down Louima and three other 
officers were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir say things have  
changed mightily since the August 1997 attack. More minorities are 
now officers, they say, and more community outreach efforts are 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics argue changes are slow in coming. They say the rank  
and file -- still more than two-thirds white in a city where almost 
two-thirds of the residents are minorities -- remains under pressure 
to keep the city's crime rate low. 
</P>
<P>
	The dire need for reforms, they say, became evident again in  
February, when four white undercover officers shot and killed 
Amadou Diallo outside his apartment building. A fusillade of 41 
bullets were fired at the unarmed Diallo, who was black, striking 
him 19 times. The officers are set to stand trial in January on 
second-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same NYPD,'' said Karl Franklin, legal director of  
the New York City Police Watch, which monitors police brutality and 
misconduct. ``Their image is tarnished beyond repair unless 
sweeping changes are implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights  
Coalition, said several NYPD changes have been purely cosmetic. A 
civility program put in place two years ago after a rise in 
civilian complaints isn't working, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That image of the police department as a brutal force still  
exists,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ruane, a retired NYPD lieutenant, disagrees. Ruane wrote  
and produced the play ``Behind the Blue Wall,'' in which actors -- 
some of them police officers -- grapple with whether to turn in a 
corrupt colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blue wall has been coming down in the last 15 years at  
least,'' Ruane said. ``The influx of women and minorities into the 
department has helped that. Certainly there's a few bricks laying 
around here and there, but it's pretty much gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Alan Abramson, who represents a witness in the  
Louima case, said the incident showed something else. ``The blue 
wall made Justin Volpe feel secure enough to torment someone in a 
precinct bathroom and brag about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit  
research group, said that the Louima incident was the ``most 
horrific kind of torture'' he could recall in his 30-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event was a policing earthquake that sent shock waves''  
throughout the country, said Williams, who once headed the Newark, 
N.J. force. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to question how such an environment exists inside a  
precinct where officers can conduct themselves in that fashion,'' 
he said. ``Who's accountable? An awful lot of people are waiting to 
see what happens in the rank structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen officers still face department hearings stemming  
from the Louima incident, including the three acquitted in the 
federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state civil rights officials also have launched  
inquiries into the department's ``stop and frisk'' procedures. And 
the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney's Office is looking into whether the 
department has adequately investigated its officers in internal 
disciplinary matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyers criticized Giuliani for not heeding some of the reforms  
called for by a task force the mayor created in the wake of the 
Louima scandal. Among them: a residency requirement for officers, a 
monitor to oversee brutality investigations and the abolishment of 
a rule that lets officers stay silent for two days after a 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir has said repeatedly that the NYPD has either implemented  
most of the task force's recommendations, or was already working on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Giuliani and Safir didn't react defensively to criticism and  
listened more to critics, the department might have a better image, 
Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time when they should be enjoying a great deal of  
public support for the dramatic reduction in crime,'' he said. 
``There's a difference between aggressive and brutal policing, and 
I don't think most officers know the difference.''

<HEADLINE> Qwest's Shares Sink 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The audacious takeover bid by the upstart  
telecommunications company Qwest for U S West Inc. and Frontier 
Corp. suffered a setback Monday at the hands of a skeptical Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	As stock in Qwest Communications International Inc. got  
pummeled, the value of its offer for the two phone companies sank 
25 percent, dimming Qwest's chances for busting the merger 
agreements both U S West and Frontier already have with Global 
Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, Qwest's bid had shrunk to $41.5 billion  
from the $55 billion announced Sunday, leaving it just below the 
$43.9 billion bid by Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing are building worldwide  
fiber-optic cable networks to bring consumers and businesses a host 
of services, including movies, television, radio, e-mail and 
Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's expensive, and both company's need customers. That's  
why they are going after U S West, a Denver based Baby Bell with 
local phone service in 14 states, and Frontier, the nation's No. 5 
long-distance phone company based in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential bidding war between Qwest and Global Crossing  
would pit two rising stars in the telecommunications industry 
against each other: Joseph P. Nacchio, chairman and chief executive 
of Qwest, and Robert Annunziata, chief executive officer of Global 
Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nacchio and Annunziata have staked their reputations on  
building their companies into leadership positions,'' said Jeffrey 
Kagan, an independent telecom analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, apparently are concerned about the price  
Nacchio has offered and the promised benefits of the deal. In 
addition, U S West and Frontier have $11.4 billion in combined debt 
that Qwest would have to carry if it succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock closed down $10.75 at $34.12 1/2 Monday on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's shares, which had dropped 16 percent since it  
made its bid last month, dipped 37 1/2 cents to $50.37 1/2, also on 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bermuda-based Global Crossing is showing no signs of  
backing down. Annunziata claimed his offers are superior and said 
Global Crossing expects to close both deals as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation in the communications industry is a fight for  
survival. Only the companies with the technology, market access, 
distribution and customer base will thrive in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance  
company, won a bidding war against Comcast Corp. for MediaOne, a 
large cable company. And in Europe, upstart Olivetti SpA won a 
fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	With every merger, smaller companies like Qwest, BellSouth Corp.  
and Nextel Inc. feel increased pressure to find a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is going to global scale (with) global players.  
We have to get bigger,'' Nacchio said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest is successful in its takeover quest, the combined  
company would have revenues of $22 billion in 2000 and serve 31 
million customers. Currently, Qwest has just $2.24 billion in 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest estimates the united company could save as much as $11.1  
billion in operating costs and capital investments, and bolster 
combined sales by up to $3.1 billion in sales as it expands local 
telephone service as well as data and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the combined company would be less than half the size of  
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is offering 1.738 shares of its stock, worth $59.30  
Monday, for each share of U S West stock. In contrast, Global 
Crossing is offering $62.97 in stock for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	For Frontier, Qwest is bidding $20 in stock plus 1.181 of its  
shares, worth $40.30, for each Frontier share. Global Crossing is 
offering $63 a share and has structured its deals to protect the 
value of the bids from a decline in its share price. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest said it will sweeten both its offers for U S West and  
Frontier if both companies agree to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of U S West rose $3.12 1/2 Monday to $58 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where Frontier's stock jumped $1.93 3/4 to $57.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches MSN Mobile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. on Monday launched MSN  
Mobile, enabling customers to receive wireless information services 
on their interactive pagers and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and other operators of Internet portal sites,  
including Yahoo! Inc. and America Online Inc., are scrambling to 
offer Internet content on wireless devices, handheld computers and 
television in addition to personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said its latest service, a version of its MSN online  
service, will allow consumers to control what they receive and when 
they receive it, and to tailor content to fit their needs or 
location. For example, instead of receiving national sports 
headlines at a fixed time of day, MSN Mobile users can select a 
specific professional or college team to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, customers can receive customized weather reports for  
more than 500 U.S. cities, rather than a feed of temperatures sent 
to every subscriber regardless of geographic location. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Microsoft invested $600 million in Nextel  
Communications, to provide Nextel's wireless phone customers with 
e-mail and basic Internet content. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Laszlo, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said  
Microsoft was making ``a baby step'' into wireless services. But 
the step is necessary for Microsoft to keep pace with Internet 
rivals and to attract more customers to its Web services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of what MSN is offering now, it's not a terribly  
compelling lineup,'' Laszlo said. ``But it is an early move to give 
MSN some experience'' in wireless, a market that will grow as cell 
phones and hand-held computers continue to become more 
sophisticated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Microsoft said it acquired OmniBrowse Inc., a  
wireless data-services company specializing in applications for 
wireless handheld devices. Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	OmniBrowse makes software that customizes Internet content such  
as news, sports, stock quotes and weather for viewing on 3Com 
Corp.'s Palm line of hand-held computers and other portable 
devices. The operating system for Palm computers is the main rival 
to Microsoft's Windows CE in the hand-held market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming months, Microsoft said MSN Mobile will include  
electronic-mail, address books and calendar features from the MSN 
Hotmail Internet-based e-mail services; news, sports and weather 
from cable news channel MSNBC; and stock updates from MSN 
MoneyCentral personal-finance online service. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is a partner with NBC in MSNBC.  
</P>
<P>
	In April, Yahoo landed a deal with a start-up called Online  
Anywhere to deliver its Internet content to personal digital 
assistants and television-based Internet appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, with its recently acquired Netscape, has been  
working on its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy, which includes plans to 
bring the online service to TVs and portable devices.

<HEADLINE> Banks Face Telemarket Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A speech by a top regulator denouncing banks  
that sell their customers' personal data. A lawsuit by Minnesota's 
attorney general against a big bank. News of a California 
investigation into banks' privacy practices. An unexpected move by 
a U.S. House panel to allow consumers to block data-sharing by 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	All that happened in just a week. The gathering momentum, amid  
growing concern about Americans' privacy, has put big banks under 
pressure to give up a lucrative part of their business: selling 
customers' personal data to telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, one of the nation's largest, said Friday it  
would no longer share any customer information with outside vendors 
-- a move welcomed by federal regulators but criticized by consumer 
groups as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time that banks need to make a decision'' on  
whether their privacy practices are appropriate, John Byrne, senior 
counsel for the American Bankers Association, said Monday. ``We 
would certainly encourage banks to examine their practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several banking industry groups plan to meet next month to come  
up with a coordinated approach to financial privacy proposals now 
before Congress, said Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial 
Services Roundtable. Bartlett, a Republican, is a former U.S. 
representative from Texas and former mayor of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's move came two days after Minnesota's attorney  
general sued U.S. Bancorp, the largest bank based in the state, 
alleging that it illegally sold customer data to a telemarketing 
firm and pocketed $4 million in commissions -- while promising 
customers in writing that their account information would be kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the California state attorney's office announced  
last week that it would investigate the privacy practices of banks 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, which now includes NationsBank Corp., is based  
in Charlotte, N.C., but maintains branch operations in its former 
home state of California. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a surprise move in Congress, the House Commerce Committee  
adopted a measure last Thursday that would allow consumers to stop 
banks, securities firms and other financial service companies from 
sharing their personal data with affiliated or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy measure was attached to sweeping legislation to  
remove Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies. The full House is expected to vote on the 
package in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's move ``shows how much the banks are under  
pressure,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for 
U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ``The tide is starting to 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid mergers of big banks and marriages of other financial  
services companies, public concern about financial privacy has 
grown. Consumer activists such as Ralph Nader have warned that 
privacy risks for Americans have increased as banks, brokerages and 
insurers compile profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and 
health data. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr.,  
who oversees nationally chartered banks, denounced what he called 
abusive sales by some institutions of customers' personal data to 
telemarketing firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law doesn't prohibit banks from selling customers'  
personal data, but prohibits the sharing of information obtained 
from a third party, such as a credit bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks often provide the data -- such as addresses, phone numbers,  
birth dates, Social Security numbers, and checking and credit card 
account information -- to telemarketing firms and other companies in 
exchange for commissions on sales to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the U.S. Bancorp case was the bank's alleged  
practice of sharing both bank customers' information and data from 
credit bureaus with telemarketers. In addition, one telemarketing 
firm allegedly ``slammed'' some U.S. Bancorp customers, charging 
them for unauthorized purchases by deducting money from their 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Bank of America's decision, Julie Williams, chief  
counsel in Hawke's office and his predecessor as comptroller, said, 
``We commend the bank for announcing these changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mierzwinski and Mary Griffin, counsel for Consumers Union,  
maintained that Bank of America's action was insufficient because 
the bank's pledge not to share customer data applied only to those 
companies that sell products and services to the bank's customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new prohibition doesn't cover other outside companies, such  
as those that assemble information databases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still doesn't give consumers control,'' Ms. Griffin said.  
``It's still not stopping the hemorrhaging of information that gets 
out there.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Religious School Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide  
whether computers and other instructional materials paid for with 
taxpayer money can be used by religious schools, a case one expert 
called the most important church-state dispute to reach the court 
in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's parochial-aid decision in a Louisiana case could  
affect the national debate over school vouchers -- financial help 
from the government for families whose children attend religious 
and other private schools. Expected sometime in 2000, the ruling 
also may determine the scope of federal efforts to connect every 
American classroom to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Orleans-based federal appeals court struck down a federal  
program last year by ruling that providing educational materials 
other than textbooks for religiously affiliated elementary and 
secondary schools violates the constitutionally required separation 
of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The same program, which makes federal money available through  
local school districts, was upheld by a San Francisco-based federal 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church  
and State said the 14-year-old Louisiana case ``is likely to be the 
most important church-state lawsuit to come before the Supreme 
Court in over two decades.'' He said it ``forces the court to face 
squarely the question of direct taxpayer aid for religious 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for parents of children in religiously affiliated  
schools in Louisiana said the case ``involves the vital interests 
of American schoolchildren in obtaining access to modern 
technological equipment and materials.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of students nationwide, including over a million  
attending religiously affiliated schools, receive benefits under 
the program,'' those lawyers told the court in the appeal granted 
review Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the federal government provides about 7 percent of the  
money states spend on education. That percentage is significantly 
higher in poorer states. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal program at issue is authorized by the Elementary and  
Secondary Education Act of 1965, which gives public schools money 
for special services and instructional equipment. Public school 
districts are required to share the equipment in a ``secular, 
neutral and nonideological'' way with students enrolled in private 
schools within their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 percent of the students who benefit from the  
program attend public schools, but many of the rest attend 
religiously affiliated schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jefferson Parish, La., 41 of 46 private schools participating  
in the federal program are religiously affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Jefferson Parish taxpayers sued federal, state and local  
officials in 1985. Their lawsuit said the federal program was 
unlawful under the Constitution's First Amendment ban on an 
``establishment of religion.'' Parents of children in religiously 
affiliated schools intervened in the case to defend the program. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge upheld the parochial aid in 1997 but the 5th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court relied heavily on two 1970s Supreme Court  
rulings it said banned provision of any materials other than 
textbooks to parochial schools. But more recent rulings appear to 
have blunted the effect of the court's past parochial-aid 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, the nation's highest court has grown far  
less demanding about church-state separation. In 1997, it ruled 5-4 
that public school teachers can offer remedial help at parochial 
schools. And in 1993, the court -- again 5-4 -- said public school 
districts may provide sign-language interpreters for deaf student 
in parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia  
and Clarence Thomas have led the movement toward greater 
governmental accommodation of religion. Justices John Paul Stevens, 
David H. Souter and President Clinton's two appointees, Justices 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, have resisted that 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy have cast  
crucial ``swing votes'' in recent church-state cases and could end 
up doing so again in the Louisiana case. 
</P>

	As part of a $15 billion education bill, the Clinton  
administration has proposed spending $800 million on a technology 
program. Government lawyers, in urging the court to resolve the 
Louisiana dispute, said the proposal envisions public school 
districts providing computer technology to ``private religious 
schools.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Economy Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Venezuelan economy shrunk by an  
alarming 9.8 percent during the first quarter of 1999, according to 
a news report Monday attributed to the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A Central Bank official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the  
institution would not deny the report in the El Universal 
newspaper. Official confirmation of the 9.8 percent figure was 
expected on Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of official figures, economists had estimated the  
economy contracted by as much as 8 percent in the first four months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The contraction was due mostly to a precipitous drop in the  
price of oil, Venezuela's main export. The oil sector shrunk by 
more than 10 percent between January and March, according to the 
Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil has recovered in the  
past two months -- from a low of $7 last year to about $14 now -- 
improving economic prospects for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the current recession is considered the worst in a  
decade, with hundreds of companies declaring bankruptcy. 
Unemployment is estimated at between 15 percent and 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Respected economist Pedro Palma said the chances of a recovery  
this year are small because of an overvalued currency that makes it 
difficult for exporters to compete and the drafting of a new 
constitution that could contribute to investor uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez has made the idea of a new constitution  
the centerpiece of his governing agenda. Members of a constituent 
assembly formed to rewrite the magna carta will be chosen in 
nationwide elections on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the top  
exporters of oil to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Study: Businesses Fight Urban Sprawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler is building a $1.6 billion  
engine plant near downtown Detroit. Some developers are trying to 
direct growth away from the Everglades. Dozens of businesses in 
York County, Pa., are trying to pump new life into downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, more and more executives are joining the  
fight against sprawl, according to a report being released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, they are worried traffic jams, air pollution and a  
lack of open space -- conditions often created by business in the 
first place -- will rob their companies of the best workers, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If companies want to attract the best and the brightest, they  
pay attention to quality of life issues,'' said Clayton Hering, 
president of a Portland, Ore., real estate services firm and an 
advocate of limiting growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was done by the National Association of Local  
Government Environmental Professionals, which represents 120 local 
governments in 35 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on interviews with more than 50 executives, the study  
profiles 19 ``smart growth'' initiatives by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just emerging,'' said Ken Brown, a co-author of the  
report. ``Business leaders are finding that sprawl threatens their 
competitiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, some executives are backing ballot issues and  
attending planning meetings to promote growth boundaries, build 
mass transit and spend more money on downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, said Brown, most executives still are so focused on  
daily business that they do not think of the problems of sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	The report credits Florida developers Pulte Home Corp. and  
Arvida Co. with trying to draw growth away from the environmentally 
sensitive Everglades and says 45 businesses in York County, Pa., 
are directing investment into old urban cores. 
</P>
<P>
	As well, the Bank of America is spending $350 million to  
revitalize Charlotte, N.C., the Providence Energy Corp. has begun 
trying to manage sprawl in Rhode Island and the largest Silicon 
Valley employers in California are trying to make more affordable 
housing available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regions that do a good job of protecting their quality of life  
will become magnets for new capital and economic growth,'' Tracy 
Grubbs, a director of the Sierra Business Council in Truckee, 
Calif., said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses sometimes find they can save money when they expand  
in urban areas where roads, sewers and the like are already in 
place, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Dayton &AMP; Hudson Corp. did not put a Target store in downtown  
Minneapolis because there was not enough land to support the store 
and parking, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	Urban governments often have too much red tape for business and  
their roads and other services can be in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers also may send mixed messages.  
</P>
<P>
	On one hand they are worried about traffic congestion, air  
pollution and loss of open space, said Roy Rogers of the Arvida Co. 
``On the other hand, they still want their dream house in the 
suburbs, with a big yard and a two-car garage.''

<HEADLINE> California Birthday Party May Be a Bust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLACERVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- It's raining on California's  
sesquicentennial party. 
</P>
<P>
	At a barbecue to celebrate the state's upcoming 150th birthday,  
water beads on purple tablecloths, a misty wind stirs the pine 
trees and no one seems surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very fitting,'' said a soggy Bryan Barr, a member of the  
state sesquicentennial commission. ``All these events and most of 
our efforts have gotten rained on in some way or another. We can 
only hope it eventually stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't yet. Despite the state's appropriation of $2.9 million  
in taxpayer money and pledges of at least $2 million from corporate 
sponsors, California's efforts to celebrate its big birthday have 
been drowned by bad management, politics and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature's budget committee voted June 1 to shut down the  
commission and give its $963,000 budget to local celebrations, a 
powerful suggestion that state government no longer wants to put on 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case in 1994, when Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned a  
2 1/2-year-long celebration of California's Sept. 9, 1850, statehood 
day. He created the sesquicentennial commission to manage it. 
</P>
<P>
	The party started in January 1998 with a festival celebrating  
the 1848 discovery of gold. But it fizzled this year after the main 
event, a race of tall ships from San Francisco to San Diego, was 
axed and efforts to commemorate the '49ers gold rush yielded only a 
handful of small events. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund raising has been a problem from the beginning. Last year,  
the commission was restructured after a legislative task force 
accused it of wasting state funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislature committee finally eliminated the commission from  
the budget after cancellation of the $4.8 million regatta. The full 
Legislature may vote on the budget this week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the barbecue in the Sierra Nevada foothills, news of the  
latest decision was received with nods and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heck with 'em,'' said Ray Nutting, 39, an El Dorado County  
board member and fourth-generation Californian. ``The state needs 
to get out of the way and let people be who they are. The only way 
they are going to be successful is to let local people carry the 
sesquicentennial ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, at a time when organizers have donned pins asking  
``Sesqui-what?'', some wonder if communities will rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Passion for the past is typical of northern Californians  
surrounded by the lore of the gold rush, but less common hundreds 
of miles to the south where fellow Californians are steeped in the 
history of the Spanish and Mexican missions of the 1700s, said Ken 
Owens, a history professor at California State University in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are also hundreds of thousands of people who are too new  
to this state to even care,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Californians would simply rather not look back, said Jorgi  
Boom, a public relations consultant for the Rumsey band of Wintune 
Indians, the Jackson band of Mi-Wuk and eight other tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	California's American Indian population was decimated by the  
gold rush, Boom said. Tens of thousands died of settler-borne 
diseases such as smallpox or were slaughtered or forced into 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of California officials to trumpet the state  
compounds the apathy problem, said David Glassberg, a history 
professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who is 
studying Californians' attitude toward their history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some leaders fear that promoting California may bring a  
backlash of criticism over controversial issues like the rundown 
highways, overcrowded universities, racial issues and the 
environment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the sesquicentennial itself. Some observers wonder if anyone  
is willing to take responsibility for such a troubled event. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Assembly Democrats accused the sesquicentennial  
commission's head, Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, of 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones canceled the tall ships race in February and squandered  
money on a Rose Parade float and performance art, their report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a possible candidate for governor in 2002, called the  
report ``a political hit piece.'' Democratic Gov. Gray Davis 
ignored his pleas for support at a critical time in fund raising, 
he said. Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the committee's 
performance under Jones was ``embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is now looking at the sesquicentennial to see whether  
``lemonade can be made from lemons,'' Bustamante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, tall ships that arrange trips a year in advance  
could not cancel as quickly as California officials, organizers 
said, and six ships from as far away as Indonesia are expected next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Clemente-based Nautical Heritage Society is spending  
$75,000 to make sure some sort of event greets them.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise on Strong Dollar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Monday, recovering from a  
plunge Friday with some help from a rise in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/4 point,  
or $7.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.09 percent from 6.16 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds recovered from much of their losses Friday after the Bank  
of Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets to stem the rise of 
the yen, which helped the dollar rise. A strong dollar often helps 
lift the value of Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up 7/32 point to 15/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.73 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.61 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.04 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 percentage 
point to 4.85 percent. One-year yields were 5.09 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.03 percentage point from late Friday to 4.84 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 119 1/16. The average yield 
to maturity was also unchanged at 5.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy Masters Art of Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jeff Van Gundy got around to telling stories the other day, and  
rather than spinning some tale about one of Pat Riley's speeches or 
his days at Providence with Rick Pitino, he told one about himself 
when he was just out of college. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1985, and his mother had helped him get a $5-an-hour job  
as a teacher's assistant for troubled youngsters at one of the 
elementary schools in her upstate New York district. He went there 
in the morning, then coached a high school team at McQuaid Jesuit 
in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first morning of work, Van Gundy saw a 10-year-old boy  
walk into school with a brick and throw it through the window as he 
yelled ``I hate school!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another child liked to bite himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Survival,'' Van Gundy recalled with a laugh. ``It was a job of  
survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen years later, that job description has remained the  
same. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy has never been as much of a survivor as he was this  
season, when Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts 
addressed a rift in the organization by sparing Van Gundy's job and 
demoting general manager Ernie Grunfeld, who had built the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld's offseason acquisitions of Latrell Sprewell and Marcus  
Camby were widely unpopular when the team was 21-21, in 10th place 
in the conference and in danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The day Checketts chose Van Gundy over Grunfeld, he made it  
clear that the coach, too, was on shaky ground. But with just eight 
games left in the regular season, he figured the team had a better 
chance of salvaging something with Van Gundy than without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, two months later, the Knicks are in the NBA Finals, their  
improbable success is well documented and Van Gundy is being called 
a genius. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a season-ending injury to Patrick Ewing after Game 2 and  
an injury to Larry Johnson early in Game 6, the Knicks beat the 
Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's coaching was a big part of it, not that he would  
ever admit it. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, here's a guy so humble he still drives an aging Honda  
that he proudly knows has 59,900 miles on the odometer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's not a magical run,'' he said. ``If this was a  
normal season, we would have been one of the higher seeded teams 
and we still feel we'd be here. But because of the way this season 
was set up, through no one's fault it appears to be more magical 
than it is. It's not magic, it's good play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy took endless criticism during the season for keeping  
Latrell Sprewell out of the starting lineup and making Marcus Camby 
earn his playing time through hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	The bashing even continued after Game 4 against Indiana when Van  
Gundy, holding a 2-1 lead in the series, changed his starting 
lineup by adding Sprewell and then lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He stuck with the new lineup in Games 5 and 6, winning both.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's the story -- the way they (his players) handled  
adversity and change and really didn't blame,'' Van Gundy said. 
``It's so easy today to point the finger of blame, and there wasn't 
any of that. And I think that's where the resolve built up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became a team that was really, truly focused on the team  
instead of saying you're a team but only really caring about 
individual accomplishments. That's what really gave us the resolve 
in the big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Van Gundy's fourth season as coach of the Knicks and his  
10th year with the organization after starting as an assistant and 
working under Stu Jackson, John MacLeod, Pat Riley and Don Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	He enters the finals with a career playoff coaching record of  
25-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's future with the team remains uncertain, even though  
he has a contract with two years remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, who lied to Van Gundy during the second round when he  
denied meeting with former Bulls coach Phil Jackson in mid-April, 
plans to meet with Van Gundy after the season to talk about the 
past, the future and whether Van Gundy wants to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all for another day,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 72.82 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Monday as a bond market  
rally pushed blue chips higher, but poor-performing Internet shares 
carried the Nasdaq composite index lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 72.82 to 10,563.33 after  
dropping 309 points last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 0.36 to 1,294.00, while the  
technology-dominated Nasdaq fell 49.57 to 2,398.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's rise was its first in five sessions, and came as  
investors, perhaps less worried about interest rates than they were 
last week, picked up economically-sensitive stocks such as General 
Electric, which rose 2 13/32 to 103 3/4, and DuPont, up 2 7/8 to 70 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors were heartened by the first rally in the bond  
market in two weeks. Bonds rose after the Bank of Japan intervened 
in the global currency markets by buying dollars to slow the 
advance of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger dollar in turn made U.S. Treasury bonds more  
attractive to overseas investors and triggered buying that reduced 
the yield in the benchmark 30-year bond from Friday's 6.16 percent 
to 6.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, comments by Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin helped  
ease concerns that the Fed will increase interest rates at its June 
29-30 meeting of its Open Market Committee. Rivlin said inflation 
worries in the United States are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was silent about the Fed's interest  
rate policy during an appearance before Congress. His remarks had 
no effect on trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial markets have been focused on interest rates since  
the Fed warned May 18 it was leaning toward an increase to prevent 
the strong economy from driving up inflation. The stock market was 
rattled by the prospect of higher borrowing costs eroding corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's bond market rally gave a lift to some technology  
and financial services shares, which, sensitive to interest-rate 
fluctuations, had taken a pounding on Friday. IBM rose 1 3/16 to 
115 1/2 and J.P. Morgan rose 5/16 to 126 9/16. Both are Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is simply a low volume bounce off an  
oversold market, with a strong dollar and a good bond market,'' 
said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Internet shares were down sharply, led by America Online,  
down 9 3/8 to 90 1/8, and Amazon.com, off 13 13/16 to 92. Online auction 
company eBay skidded 29 7/8 to 136 after last week's shutdown of the 
service because of computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks are hurting because of their high valuations,  
which makes them more vulnerable should the Fed increase interest 
rates, Pradilla said. Further, eBay's technical problems and 
concerns about AOL's subscriber growth have a domino effect on the 
entire sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet stocks are getting pummeled,'' said Larry Rice, chief  
investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``There's just too much 
supply and the quality of internet offerings has been declining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, the No. 4 U.S. long-distance phone  
company, fell 10 3/4 to 34 1/8 after making a bid to buy U S West Inc. 
and Frontier Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West rose 3 1/8 to 58 and Frontier rose 1 15/16 to 57 3/8.  
</P>
<P>
	If the Qwest bid were to succeed, it would block a competing  
offer from Global Crossing, which closed down 3/8 to 50 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Dow stocks, Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing was up  
3 5/16 to 89 1/4 and Union Carbide rose 2 5/16 to 53 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 4 to  
3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,314 up, 1,706 down and 541 
unchanged. Composite volume totaled 813.16 million shares, down 
from 838.59 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.10 to 619.60, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.13 to 762.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.48 at 431.53  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.06 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was up 0.32 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
down 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.39 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Nuke Security Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to tighten security at the Energy  
Department and its nuclear weapons labs are being resisted by 
mid-level bureaucrats and a ``culture of arrogance'' that has left 
atomic secrets vulnerable to theft for decades, a presidential 
intelligence panel concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The blistering report, which is the result of a 90-day review  
requested by President Clinton, questions whether the 
administration's efforts to beef up counterespionage activities and 
security at the nuclear labs is enough to overcome many years of 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps most troubling ... is the evidence that the lab  
bureaucracies, after months at the epicenter of an espionage 
scandal with serious implications for U.S. foreign policy, are 
still resisting reforms,'' the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board 
said in its 57-page report formally released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, the  
board's chairman, briefed Clinton on the panel's findings Monday 
and told him only a dramatic restructuring of the Energy Department 
would ensure that lax attitudes toward security would change. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to counter attacks from members of Congress who charged  
the administration had not responded swiftly to reports of 
espionage at the weapons labs, Clinton directed his intelligence 
advisory board in March to examine the security problems and come 
up with recommendations to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
	In its scathing report, the panel said the department was  
``incapable of reforming itself'' and that while measures by Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson to improve security were welcomed, there 
was no assurance they ``will gain more than a toehold'' once 
Richardson departs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizational disarray, managerial neglect and a culture of  
arrogance -- both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves -- 
conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the president said his administration had taken  
``unprecedented steps to reduce the vulnerability of our secrets at 
the labs. ... We remain committed to taking the necessary steps to 
safeguard our nation's secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure improved safeguards against the theft of nuclear  
secrets, the panel suggested two alternatives: create a 
semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department with ``a clear 
mission'' to maintain the nuclear weapons program; or, turn 
responsibility for nuclear weapons programs, including the labs, 
over to a new independent agency similar to the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the decision on which way to go should be left to the  
president and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson in an interview late Monday said he remained  
convinced no such dramatic restructuring was needed and that his 
efforts to strengthen counterintelligence programs, centralize 
control over security under a single ``security czar'' and beef up 
computer security at the labs would do the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need accountability and centralization of security,'' said  
Richardson, reiterating that a semi-autonomous nuclear weapons 
agency within the department would simply create another 
``fiefdom'' and be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the strong recommendations by the Rudman panel to  
overhaul the department will give new ammunition to those in 
Congress who want to create a new nuclear security agency -- either 
within or independent of the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard hitting and the recommendation is almost exactly  
what we've been suggesting,'' Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., said of the 
advisory board's report. Kyl is one of three Republican senators 
pressing for creation of a new, more powerful agency within the DOE 
to oversee all nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report acknowledges that inattention to security and the  
lack of concern about espionage date back to the creation of the 
Energy Department in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lapses exploded into the open in March when a scientist  
at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, Wenn Ho Lee, was fired 
for security violations. He had been suspected of providing secrets 
to China about one of America's most sophisticated warheads in the 
1980s, but has never been charged with a crime. Lee has denied any 
espionage, as has the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rudman panel's report criticized the handling of the Lee  
case by the Justice Department, but did not provide any new 
details, noting that the matter now was the subject of an internal 
Justice review. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rudman panel heard from more than 100 witnesses -- all of  
whom were assured their views would be held confidential -- and it 
reviewed thousands of pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	It concluded that over a succession of administrations, dating  
back 20 years or more, an entrenched bureaucracy both at the 
department and in the research labs demonstrated ``an arrogant 
disregard for authority'' and took security and espionage concerns 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ``a staggering pattern of denial'' when it came to  
security and the growing threat of espionage from China and other 
countries, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its findings, the intelligence panel said, were that:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,  
was briefed about the Lee case and lax security at the labs in 
1996, there was not enough evidence at that time to warrant 
presidential action on security. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1995 or sometime later, authorities found an illegal wiretap  
at an unnamed weapons lab. Although an employee confessed to 
installing the tap, he was never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sometime in the 1980s, listening devices ``were discovered in  
weapons-related facilities.'' The panel cited classified documents 
and gave no further details.

<HEADLINE> Steel, Oil, Gas Bailout in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to provide more than $1 billion  
worth of taxpayer-backed loans for domestic steel, oil and gas 
companies faces a fight in the Senate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., is heading an effort  
to prevent the Senate from even debating the legislation. A 
showdown vote is scheduled for Tuesday, in which supporters of 
proposed loans will have to muster 60 votes for the measure to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say they think the vote will be close.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., proposed providing  
$140 million to back $1 billion worth of loans for some small steel 
companies facing competition from low-priced imports. Among the 
qualifying companies would be the Weirton Steel Corp. of Weirton, 
W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd attached the plan to legislation paying for the war with  
Yugoslavia. As House-Senate bargainers hammered out a final version 
of that bill last month, Byrd agreed to drop his provision in 
return for a prompt vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., proposed a similar, $500 million  
loan program for struggling oil and gas companies, at a cost to 
taxpayers of $125 million. The Domenici and Byrd proposals have 
been joined into a single bill, and aides say steel, oil and gas 
company lobbyists have been helping in a behind-the-scenes struggle 
to line up the needed 60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Byrd and Domenici overcome Nickles' challenge, the  
Oklahoman is ready with several amendments aimed at ``improving'' 
the loan programs, said a Nickles aide. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised that chamber  
will vote on the legislation should it survive in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders hoped Monday that the chamber would zip through a  
$21.7 billion measure financing water projects and Energy 
Department programs, but they ran into a problem: absent senators. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual public spanking, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., took to the Senate floor to chide his colleagues. 
Senate aides said 10 to 15 senators would not have been available 
to vote Monday evening, even though Lott had announced in advance 
that votes could occur after 5 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said many senators had returned to Washington ``from all  
the way across the country to be here ready to vote. ... So I am 
very disappointed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., served notice that he  
might offer an amendment to the energy-water bill aimed at helping 
workers with disabilities, such as expanding their eligibility for 
Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the measure has 78 co-sponsors from both parties, it has  
been blocked by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. He opposes the tax 
increase Kennedy has proposed to pay for the measure, which 
includes limiting how some people who owe taxes overseas can reduce 
the U.S. taxes they owe. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy has said he will not offer the legislation if he can get  
assurances the disability bill will be voted on soon. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says a cut in capital gains  
taxes would raise money to help Republicans reduce other taxes, but 
official congressional forecasts say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., told a National Association of Manufacturers  
luncheon Monday that reducing taxes on investors would stimulate 
economic growth and produce a brief upsurge in revenue as people 
sell their investments at the new lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to have tax cuts the first couple of years, we have  
to have capital gains rate cuts,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to official estimates from the Joint Committee on  
Taxation, most proposals to reduce capital gains taxes would result 
in a revenue loss or an increase so small it could accomplish very 
little for other tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, cutting the top capital gains rate from 28 percent  
to 15 percent would produce just $100 million for the government 
the first year, quickly followed by $14.3 billlion in losses over 
five years. And cutting the top rate to 10 percent means a loss of 
$800 million the first year, $50.2 billion over five years.

	``Music can do two things,'' the singer says in the upcoming USA

<HEADLINE> Compaq Offers New Storage Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. today unveiled a high-speed  
backup process for network systems, which officials say will reduce 
the time it takes some companies to protect data from hours to 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The virtual replicator takes a ``snapshot'' of a company's data  
on a Windows NT system, then allows the network to continue 
operating normally while it backs itself up. 
</P>
<P>
	While such processes have been available for large mainframe  
systems, Howard Elias, general manager of the company's storage 
products division, said Compaq has developed the technology for 
systems of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody offers this at a low cost,'' Elias said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Hill, an analyst at the Aberdeen Group, applauded Compaq's  
ongoing effort to advance its storage division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtual disks, storage pools, and snapshots are key  
ingredients that allow customers to move closer to realizing the 
full potential of storage area networks,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues associated with Windows NT storage are expected to grow  
from $6.2 billion in 1998 to $25.7 billion in 2003, according to an 
analysis by Dataquest Inc. Compaq currently holds about half of 
that market. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's $3.1 billion in NT storage revenues last year accounted  
for about 10 percent of revenues for the entire company, best known 
for being the world's largest personal computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashok Kumar, an analyst for Piper Jaffrey Inc., said it's  
important for Compaq to maintain its huge presence in the storage 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look in aggregate for every dollar in hardware  
spending, there's $2 or $3 spent on storage,'' Kumar said, adding 
that continued advancement in storage is vital because ``they've 
got Dell nipping at their heels and can't afford to look back.''

<HEADLINE> Tattooed Barbie Leads to Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Despite a handful of complaints,  
tattooed Barbie will not be grounded. But her friends will be free 
of body art. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said it received about a dozen complaints over tattooed  
Butterfly Art Barbie, a doll introduced last year with a small 
butterfly tattoo on her stomach. The package includes stick-on 
tattoos for young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel, the nation's largest toymaker, has not halted production  
on Butterfly Art Barbie, which is selling well, Mattel Inc. 
spokeswoman Lisa McKendall said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the complaints prompted Mattell to abandon plans to  
include tattoos and nose piercing on this spring's Generation Girl 
dolls, a line of dolls for older girls that includes Generation 
Girl Barbie and her friend Chelsie.

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Manager Needs Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker will undergo brain surgery Tuesday  
to remove a mass of malformed blood vessels that caused his seizure 
in the Houston Astros dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager spoke with general manager Gerry  
Hunsicker on Monday and said he did not recall anything after the 
second inning of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Larry this morning, and he was coherent and very  
positive and encouraged,'' Hunsicker said. ``He was kind of joking 
around, but he said the last couple of days he had severe headaches 
and that was unusual for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker went into violent convulsions in the eighth inning of  
the game against the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. Players and 
coaches restrained him until medical personnel arrived and took him 
to Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Monday revealed he had an arteriovenous malformation -- a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, they can become 
dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure neural tissue 
or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That blood vessel mass is what triggered Larry's seizure,''  
Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seriousness of Dierker's diagnosis, it's not as bad  
as his players thought. They left the Astrodome Sunday night 
thinking Dierker had a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary to hear that he might have a tumor,'' right  
fielder Derek Bell said. ``You couldn't eat or sleep last night. It 
was great to see that he is okay. Now we can go out and do what he 
trained us to do the last three years, have fun and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante, who will be interim manager, also  
visited Dierker in the hospital and was elated to find his manager 
in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded good and was very optimistic about the surgery,''  
Galante said. ``We even kind of joked some. I told him I didn't 
realize I was so boring that I put him to sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell said the whole team was relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, we heard it was a tumor and that's life and  
death,'' Bagwell said. ``This morning, they said it's not a tumor, 
that it was something that was not an easy operation but they felt 
it had a good success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Craig Biggio said Dierker told him he thought he  
could be back in uniform in two weeks, although Astros personnel 
wouldn't speculate about Dierker's' return. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of shocked us to hear him say that,'' Biggio said.  
``That's good that he's thinking like that but we just want him to 
be healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said he was told by doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5  
-- with 1 the least serious -- Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also told Hunsicker the mass -- about 1 1/2 inches in  
diameter -- was located in a less-critical part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante worked his first game as interim manager Monday night  
against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. Hunsicker does not 
know how long Dierker will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``All we can do now is take the lead from the doctors that 
his prognosis is excellent, but there's no way we can put a 
timetable on his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker told Hunsicker he was unable to recall Bell's  
sixth-inning grand slam, which put the Astros ahead 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry said he was sorry he missed the grand slam,'' Hunsicker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 39,773 turned eerily silent when play was stopped as  
it became obvious Dierker was having an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something really bad like this, when things are really bad,  
shows that it's only a baseball game,'' catcher Mitch Meluskey 
said. ``That's real life what Larry Dierker is going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game was suspended and will be resumed July 23 when the  
Padres return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other managers, Joe Torre of the New York Yankees and John  
Boles of the Florida Marlins, have been sidelined because of 
illness this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre missed the start of the season while recovering from  
prostate surgery and Boles missed a total of 13 games following 
back surgery and a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's condition added to Houston's growing list of injured  
and ill players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	First base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of an  
irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected back this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Moises Alou tore a knee ligament when he fell off a  
treadmill in February and will miss most of the season. And third 
baseman Ken Caminiti has been on the disabled list since May 22 
with a strained calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through some tough years, but from an injury and  
illness standpoint, there's never been anything close to all 
this,'' Hunsicker said.

<HEADLINE> Bermuda Issues Tropical Storm Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season  
headed northwest Monday across the north Atlantic, prompting a 
tropical storm watch for Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Arlene had winds of 45 mph, down from 50 mph  
earlier in the day and 60 mph Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm is expected to miss the United States by curving away  
into the open ocean before reaching the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the East Coast is in the future of this storm,''  
hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the storm was on track toward Bermuda, which could feel  
high winds by Tuesday night if the storm does not change course. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Arlene's center was about 255 miles southeast of  
Bermuda. It was moving northwest and was expected to continue in 
that direction at 5 mph.

	Cohen, Albright To Meet Russians  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today  
that the relatively small Russian contingent at the Pristina 
airport won't affect NATO's overall peacekeeping plans in Kosovo. 
Secretary of State Madeline Albright said the Russians understood 
and accepted NATO's insistence on a unified command structure in 
Kosovo. Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen made plans 
today to meet Russian officials to thrash out Moscow's disputed 
peacekeeping role in Kosovo.

	Peackeepers Spread in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of NATO peacekeepers  
spread out today across Kosovo on a mission to secure the province. 
Evidence of atrocities committed by the Serbs was uncovered as the 
peacekeepers moved about Kosovo. Serb forces complying with the 
pullout ordered by NATO to end the 78-day air war mixed in with 
civilians fleeing in columns up to 500 vehicles long. Some ethnic 
Albanian homes were set ablaze by Serb troops leaving Kosovo. 
Officials said about 15,000 allied troops had entered Kosovo at 
this time.

	Bush: No Litmus Test on Abortion  
</P>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- Supreme Court nominees will not have to  
pass any anti-abortion litmus test if he is elected president, 
George W. Bush said today. He also pledged to uphold the dignity of 
the presidency. Bush visited New Hampshire on a campaign swing for 
the GOP nomination. He said he was determined not to raise 
corporate and income taxes and eager to work with the 
Republican-led Congress. The Republican front-runner also said he 
was opposed to racial quotas and preferences and concerned about 
the Kosovo peace implementation plan.

	Steel, Oil, Gas Bailout in Senate

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to provide more than $1 billion  
worth of taxpayer-backed loans for domestic steel, oil and gas 
companies faces a fight in the Senate this week. Senate Majority 
Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., is heading an effort to prevent the 
Senate from even debating the legislation. A showdown vote is 
scheduled for tomorrow, in which supporters of proposed loans will 
have to muster 60 votes for the measure to survive.

	Banks To End Sales to Telemarketers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big banks are coming under pressure to give up  
a lucrative part of their business, selling customers' personal 
data to telemarketers, as state officials and House lawmakers take 
tough actions aimed at protecting financial privacy. Federal law 
doesn't prohibit banks from selling customers' personal data, but 
prohibits the sharing of information obtained from a third party, 
such as a credit bureau. Banks often provide the data -- such as 
addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and 
checking and credit card account information -- to telemarketing 
firms and other companies in exchange for commissions on sales to 
consumers.

	Doctors See More Diabetes in Kids  
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Type 2 diabetes, long thought to be a  
disease that only affected adults, is being diagnosed in 
startlingly high numbers of children, doctors say. Diabetes is the 
leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputations in the 
United States and kills 180,000 a year. It also can lead to heart 
problems. Obesity is an indicator parents should watch for, doctors 
say. ``Children are so much less active than they used to be,'' 
said Ronald B. Goldberg, a diabetes specialist at the University of 
Miami. ``And exposed to our western type diets, they're putting on 
weight at alarming rates.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, as a bond market rally  
pushed blue chips higher and the Dow industrials closed up 72.82 to 
end at 10,563.33. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange 
led advancers 1,683-1,306. The Nasdaq was down 49.58 to 2,398.30.

	Tattooed Barbie Leads to Complaints  
</P>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- The tattooed Barbie won't be forced to  
cover up her body art, but any ink for her friends in the Mattel 
doll line is now strictly prohibited. Mattel said it received about 
a dozen complaints over tattooed Butterfly Art Barbie, a doll 
introduced last year with a small butterfly tattoo on her stomach. 
The complaints prompted Mattel to abandon plans to include tattoos 
and nose piercing on this spring's Generation Girl dolls, a line of 
dolls for older girls that includes Generation Girl Barbie and her 
friend Chelsie.

	Valentine To Talk With NL President  
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine expects  
to talk to NL president Len Coleman tomorrow about his two-game 
suspension for returning to the dugout in disguise after being 
ejected. Valentine was ejected by plate umpire Randy Marsh in the 
12th inning of a game last Wednesday for arguing a catcher's 
interference call on Mike Piazza. Valentine's suspension is on hold 
during his appeal.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Opens Campaign Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has set up a bank  
account and has begun depositing checks sent in by supporters for a 
New York Senate campaign, her top adviser said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of staff  
advising the first lady on her possible Senate race, said he was 
not certain how much money had already come in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really dribs and drabs, an inconsequential little amount  
of money,'' Ickes said, adding that checks didn't begin arriving 
until last week. ``She hasn't done anything in terms of making 
fund-raising calls yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said he expected Mrs. Clinton to begin making such calls  
in early July, shortly after she formally creates her Senate 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of money to raise,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the bankroll needed to be competitive in the race  
for the Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan have ranged from $15 million to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is being eyed on the Republican side by New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, among others. Mrs. Clinton is expected to 
have no real competition for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said he wasn't aware of the technical aspects of creating  
the campaign bank account, but said ``legally you can do that prior 
to actually filing the exploratory committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of an exploratory committee allows a prospective  
candidate to raise and spend money for campaign-like purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said that heading up Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising operation  
would be Terence McAuliffe, President Clinton's chief fund-raiser 
in 1996, and Laura Hartigan, who was McAuliffe's chief deputy then. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabrielle Fialkoff, a New York City-based operative who was in  
charge of raising money for New York City Council Speaker Peter 
Vallone's unsuccessful run for governor, has been hired by Mrs. 
Clinton's camp to concentrate on New York fund raising, Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street tycoon Roger Altman, who was deputy treasury  
secretary during President Clinton's first term, also will be 
heavily involved in fund-raising work for the first lady, Ickes 
said.

<HEADLINE> Online shopping Made Less Tedious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shopaholics just got another reason to succumb  
to the lure of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of credit-card and technology companies said Monday they  
have agreed on a technical standard designed to make online 
shopping far easier by eliminating the tedious process of typing in 
personal data for every Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``electronic commerce modeling language'' is intended to  
allow shoppers to enter their name, billing address, credit-card 
number and other information just once. 
</P>
<P>
	If the standard is adopted by enough online retailers, it could  
remove a major barrier to online shopping. A study by the Web 
research firm Jupiter Communications last February found that 27 
percent of potential buyers gave up rather than entering 
information to make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies have tried without much success so far to lure  
shoppers to so-called electronic wallet systems that enable 
consumers to enter personal information they can automatically take 
with them to multiple Web sites. A main reason is that the 
thousands of online merchants use widely varying codes to complete 
online purchases, instead of a common system that all wallet 
systems can read. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the electronic standard could succeed in part  
because the companies promoting it include a number high-tech and 
financial heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the group are the Internet provider America Online,  
computer makers IBM, Compaq and Sun Microsystems, software maker 
Microsoft Corp. and the charge card companies American Express, 
MasterCard, and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Online retailers are expected to widely adopt the new standard  
at their Web sites, but that will take at least two years, analysts 
said. Banks and retailers haven't yet figured out a system for 
signing up customers to the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the convenience provided by the new standard, some  
consumers may be hesitant to use electronic ``wallets'' because of 
concerns their private information could be gathered for unwanted 
marketing pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some large online stores, such as Amazon.com, may  
be slow to adopt the standard because it gives competitors the same 
easy way to sell goods and services, said Lucas Graves, an industry 
analyst with Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many large retailers already let customers enter purchase  
information just once, but their systems work only for that 
retailer's products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The announcement today is very significant, but only as a  
first step in the long-term evolution of the universal wallet 
standard,'' Graves said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Open Campaign Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is setting up a New  
York bank account to handle the early contributions that supporters 
are sending in for the Senate race she is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of staff who is  
advising Mrs. Clinton on her Senate effort, said Monday he was not 
certain how much money had arrived but that an account would be 
established early this week to take care of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really dribs and drabs, an inconsequential little amount  
of money,'' Ickes said, adding that checks didn't begin arriving 
until last week. ``She hasn't done anything in terms of making 
fund-raising calls yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said he expected Mrs. Clinton to begin those calls in  
early July, shortly after she creates her Senate exploratory 
committee. Terence McAuliffe, President Clinton's chief fund-raiser 
in 1996, will head the first lady's money-raising effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates on the size of the bankroll needed to be competitive  
in next year's Senate race for the seat being vacated by Democrat 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan are in the range of $15 million to $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is being eyed on the Republican side by New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said creation of Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee  
early next month would probably be a low-key affair with no news 
conference. The first lady then will spend ``probably a good part 
of July'' in New York state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of an exploratory committee allows a prospective  
candidate to raise and spend money for campaign-like purposes. If 
Mrs. Clinton decides not to run, any remaining money will still be 
hers to designate for other political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to McAuliffe, Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising team will  
include Laura Hartigan, who was McAuliffe's chief deputy in the 
1996 fund-raising effort for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Gabrielle Fialkoff, a New York City-based operative, has  
been hired by Mrs. Clinton's camp to concentrate on New York fund 
raising, Ickes said. Fialkoff was in charge of raising money for 
New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone's unsuccessful run last 
year for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Altman, who was deputy treasury secretary during Clinton's  
first term, will also be heavily involved in fund-raising work for 
the first lady, Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	One New York political expert said fund raising will be the  
least of Mrs. Clinton's worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clintons have used New York as sort of their own personal  
bank ever since he's been president,'' said Maurice Carroll, head 
of the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. 
``She'll get all the dough she wants.''

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Tops Courier in Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Don't let the gray hair on John McEnroe's  
head fool you, warned Jim Courier. The 40-year-old McEnroe proved 
he can still play a pretty good game of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier learned that lesson the hard way Monday, losing in  
straight sets to McEnroe, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 in the Nike Hall of Fame 
Challenge at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't use Grecian Formula, but he never misses a  
volley,'' said a grinning Courier at the conclusion of the 
grass-court exhibition match. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe clearly appreciated the compliment. But he said he was  
not sure Courier, 28 years old and ranked 60th in the world, had 
given the match his all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was totally taking it easy on me, but he was  
throwing the old man a bone a little bit,'' said McEnroe, who will 
be inducted into the Hall of Fame July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player could manage a service break in the first set.  
Trailing 6-5, McEnroe forced the tiebreaker by battling to a win in 
the 12th game. 
</P>
<P>
	After edging Courier in the tiebreaker, McEnroe held serve in  
the second set and broke Courier's serve in the eighth game, 
winning 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Recalls NBA Rookie Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- He had a storied career with the New  
York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate and now he's 
running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Bradley vividly recalls the humiliation of being a  
rookie NBA guard so inept that fans spit on him and regularly 
insulted him on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, campaigning here for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, held an audience of young people in rapt attention 
Monday with the story of his pathetic rookie year with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1967, and the New York news media had built him up into a  
savior, he told about a dozen listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to be the guy who came in and saved the team,'' he  
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley discovered he was too slow and ``failing  
miserably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It got so bad that the audiences would not only boo me --  
18,000 people booing -- but as I left the court, they would throw 
coins at me, and occasionally they would spit on me,'' he said. 
``And when I walked through the streets of New York, I found that 
they accosted me constantly, they told me that I was no good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough time,'' he told more than a dozen young  
mentors in an anti-violence program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley dug deep to pull out of the slump, recalling the  
inspiration of teachers who instilled a work ethic and a coach who 
had warned him when he was 14: ``Remember, if you're not 
practicing, somebody, somewhere, is practicing. And if you two 
meet, given roughly the same ability, he's going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept working, working, working,'' he said. Bradley went on  
to win two NBA championships with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, facing an uphill fight against Vice President Al Gore  
for the Democratic presidential nomination, laced his speeches with 
basketball metaphors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He rejected suggestions that a bruising primary campaign could  
damage the Democratic Party's chances for winning the White House 
in 2000, just as it did for the GOP in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always believed, whether it was in basketball or  
politics, that competition was good -- that you're a better team in 
the finals because you've had competition,'' the former New Jersey 
senator said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his chances against Gore, who enjoys considerable  
support in California, Bradley pointed to the Knicks' semifinal 
victory over the bigger Indiana Pacers team last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Speed and quickness are more important than bulk,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On his first high-profile visit to California's capital since  
announcing his presidential exploratory committee, Bradley held 
question-and-answer sessions with two groups: first, disabled 
people and their caretakers, and second, a racially mixed group of 
young mentors and troubled youths. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley delivered about 15 minutes of remarks to each group and  
invoked personal experiences to establish credibility with them. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the group of home health care workers that when he was  
growing up his family had such an assistant to care for his father, 
who had calcified arthritis of the lower spine. 
</P>
<P>
	After each speech, delivered sitting in a chair with listeners  
gathered around him, Bradley played moderator, probing at the 
failings of the home health care industry and the dangers of youth 
violence. He asked questions, but mostly listened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to make a change now, or the future's gonna be  
chaotic,'' one young man told Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley didn't make any policy pronouncements, instead  
encouraging each group to continue its work. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of his 10-day California swing, Bradley took  
pains to connect with every individual in every room he entered, 
even shaking hands in a roomful of journalists before his news 
conference.

<HEADLINE> Groups Proliferating in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The common notion of ``Euroskeptics'' in Britain  
is that they are old, white and male. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Carishma Gillani, a 22-year-old Asian Briton studying  
at Oxford University, set up the Campaign Against a Federal Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to show a much more positive and internationalist  
view of Euroskepticism,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group's purpose is ``warning of the dangers of the European  
Union and what it would mean in terms of sovereignty, possibly of 
national identity, and certainly for the economy,'' Gillani says. 
</P>
<P>
	From students like Gillani to retirees in their fourth decade of  
fighting European political integration to multimillionaires 
opposed to changing the monetary system, Britain's anti-Europe 
campaigners are doing business as never before. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal is to prevent Britain from ever joining the euro, the  
common currency launched Jan. 1 by 11 European Union countries, 
including Germany, France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain was one of three EU states that refused to adopt the  
currency in the first wave. Though Prime Minister Tony Blair 
supports eventually joining, he promises Britons a referendum on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	British euro supporters believe the country needs to be part of  
the EU, which represents 20 percent of the world's economic output 
and 18 percent of world trade. And full membership in the EU means 
joining its currency, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the single currency -- represented by more 50 groups  
and counting -- are working feverishly to block that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Some want Britain to pull out of the EU entirely, saying it is  
growing into an undemocratic and unaccountable federal state. Some 
want membership in a restructured EU, but say joining the euro 
would mean taking part in a ``dangerous economic experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bit of a struggle in the lean years,'' says Robin  
Williams, 70, who started campaigning against European integration 
more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams unsuccessfully fought for a ``no'' vote in a 1975  
referendum on membership in the EU's forerunner, the European 
Economic Community, which Britain had joined two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the retired banker works from home as the unpaid secretary  
for the Campaign for an Independent Britain, a group with 3,000 
dues-paying members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democracy Movement, founded last year by multimillionaire  
Paul Sykes, is one of the new generation of anti-EU groups. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a snazzy Internet site, boasts a burgeoning membership of  
30,000 and organizes town hall meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	At one such meeting in Richmond, a wealthy London suburb,  
speaker Bill Jamieson recently drew enthusiastic cries of ``hear, 
hear'' from the 200 people packed into a school gym when he called 
creeping EU federalism a threat to British democracy and bad for 
its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	EU regulations, he complained, amount to restrictions that ``no  
political party in this country would dare to put before you at an 
election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the EU launched a heroic cartoon character called  
``Captain Euro'' to promote its common currency, the Democracy 
Movement produced a counter comic strip. It features a Euro-baddie 
called ``Captain Bureau,'' an aging bureaucrat whose attempts to 
persuade children to love the euro are squashed by ``Skeptic 
Spice,'' modeled on the Spice Girls pop group. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Democracy Movement has the humor, it won't win the  
argument, predicts Bob Worcester, director of the respected MORI 
opinion pollsters.

	Britain's entry into the euro ``a done deal,'' Worcester says,  
and the Euroskeptic campaign is ``the death throes of a dinosaur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls may say most Britons don't like the euro, but Worcester  
predicts they'll be using it within the decade. ``What the British 
public are saying is that 'we might not like it, but it is 
inevitable,''' he says.

	Some people speculate that the sheer number of Euroskeptic  
groups is clouding their message.

<P>
	Mindful of that possibility, Conservative Party lawmaker Michael

brought together dozens of groups last year to agree on common 
platforms.

campaigns most likely to appeal to Britons.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Flying to San Antonio Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Shooting in a dome is different from  
shooting in an arena, which is why the New York Knicks are wasting 
no time getting to the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, shooting in a dome is different. The shooting  
background in domes is different, and that gives them, to me, a 
huge homecourt advantage,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York planned to practice at its suburban facility one more  
time today before boarding a charter flight to San Antonio that 
should arrive in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 of the finals is Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks did not play each other during the regular  
season because of the lockout-shortened schedule, so there will be 
a greater degree of unfamiliarity in this series than there ever 
has been in an NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Familiarity in the Miami series and the Indiana series,  
coaching staff-wise, was easy,'' Van Gundy said. ``This is just 
different. You don't really know a team until you compete against 
them regularly, and particularly until you compete against them in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams think they know, but they're not really going to  
know until a couple games into the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the Knicks should also know how much of a contribution  
Larry Johnson will be able to make. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-captain's sprained right knee was causing him a lot of  
pain Sunday, although he said he'll play in the series -- even if 
it's not in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hate more than sitting out is being on the floor and  
not being 100 percent. Because you know you can make this move or 
guard this guy better, but there's something hampering you,'' 
Johnson said. ``Another thing is I don't want to be out there with 
a big, bulky brace on and not be able to do the things I want to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson can't play in Game 1, the Knicks would be expected to  
use a starting lineup of Chris Dudley at center, Kurt Thomas and 
Latrell Sprewell at forward and Allan Houston and Charlie Ward in 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Marcus Camby and 41-year-old Herb Williams as  
the only big men coming off the bench since the Knicks are also 
missing 7-foot center Patrick Ewing, who was lost for the season 
with a torn Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	That size predicament had Van Gundy and his staff wondering  
whether to double-team Duncan and Robinson when they have the ball, 
as most teams do, or take their chances with single coverage on the 
Twin Towers and tight defense on the other three players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's going to be great to watch,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's going to be a great, great decision for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, meanwhile, are hoping rest doesn't lead to rust after  
their long layoff. They had a day off from practice Sunday as the 
players further enjoyed the downtime they earned by disposing of 
the Portland Trail Blazers in a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, which also swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the  
second round, hasn't lost since the second game of the first round 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams that are inconsistent, or not as good, you can exploit  
because they have weaknesses,'' Van Gundy said of the Spurs. ``But 
this team really has no weaknesses, which is why they've won 10 
playoff games in a row, which is unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive on ``How To Beat The Spurs'' is not a voluminous  
one, which is what Van Gundy learned when he started researching 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked our video coordinator: `Pull up all their losses. I  
want to see the teams that beat them in the last three months.' And 
he gives me this little stack of tapes,'' Van Gundy said. ``Baaaad 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost to Phoenix, Dallas, Sacramento in overtime and  
Minnesota. That's it since April 1,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's the 
stack. Four of 'em.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio swept the two-game season series in 1997-98, but  
those Knicks were nothing like the current squad -- an uptempo, 
athletic mix who were at their best playing at a greyhound pace 
against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tougher in transition against San Antonio  
because those guys run real well,'' said Camby, who provided the 
Knicks with a huge lift off the bench in the Indiana series. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Dudley: ``It definitely will be more difficult without  
Larry. He's been a huge part of our success and he's integral to 
our team, but we'll move forward if he can't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At practice, Van Gundy showed the players a tape of the final  
seven minutes of Game 6 against Indiana and asked them to savor it 
for the rest of their lives -- but only after they forget about it 
for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a special time, that's going to be a special memory,  
but hopefully there are more special memories to come,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bruins Asst. To Be Coyote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Bobby Francis, a Boston Bruins  
assistant, will be the next coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, according 
to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes declined Monday to comment on the reports, but  
confirmed that Phoenix assistant John Tortorella, considered the 
front-runner, would not be offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The team scheduled a news conference Wednesday afternoon to  
introduce the successor to Jim Schoenfeld, fired May 25 after 
failing to get the Coyotes past the first round of the playoffs for 
the second time in as many seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith was vacationing in San Diego and  
could not be reached for comment. Team spokesman Rich Nairn said 
the delay in the coach's introduction was the time it would take to 
get Smith and the new coach together. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic and The Tribune, a newspaper serving  
suburban Phoenix, reported Smith offered Francis a $1.05 million, 
three-year contract over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis worked two seasons with Bruins coach Pat Burns.  
</P>
<P>
	Before that, he had a 65-82-13 record in two seasons as coach of  
Providence of the American Hockey League, the Bruins' top 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	He began coaching as a player-coach with Salt Lake City of the  
International Hockey League in 1986, and began a four-year run as 
coach of the Utah franchise, a Calgary affiliate, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	When Calgary shifted its affiliation to St. John in 1993,  
Francis moved to St. John and remained there until he took over at 
Providence in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told Tortorella earlier Monday that he would not be hired,  
and Tortorella said he was leaving the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to stay in the system,'' Nairn said. ``He wants  
to be a head coach.''

<HEADLINE> Redenbacher Plant To Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALPARAISO, Ind. (AP) -- The Orville Redenbacher factory in the  
city where Redenbacher invented his brand of popcorn will produce 
its last kernel next year, and the announcement has touched a 
nerve. 
</P>
<P>
	ConAgra, the Nebraska company that owns the plant, said last  
month it will consolidate the Valparaiso popcorn bottling and 
microwave popcorn packaging operations with those at other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Valparaiso, about 40 miles southeast of Chicago, will lose 230  
jobs and a part of its identity. An annual popcorn festival has 
been held in the city since 1979, attracting as many as 80,000 
people each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always a loss when you lose good paying jobs, so  
I guess that's the first consideration,'' Valparaiso city planner 
Nancy Pekarek said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beyond that, in this particular case, we have a whole festival  
that revolves around the fact that Orville Redenbacher created his 
popcorn here. So there is that very unique connection between a 
business and the history of the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials say they're still trying to arrange a meeting  
with representatives from ConAgra in hopes of getting the company 
to reconsider.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 51.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today,  
responding to a rally in long-term bonds as investors' anxiety over 
interest rates lessened. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 51.29 at 10.541.80 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 5.42 at 1,299.06, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 1.29 at 2,446.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were closely watching a speech by Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan today for clues about whether Fed policy 
makers will vote to raise interest rates when they meet June 29 and 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost 309 points last week as 30-year Treasury bonds  
suffered their biggest weekly decline more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	But bonds rose today for the first time in nine sessions, after  
Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlen said inflation worries in the 
United States are exaggerated. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 
point as yields fell to 6.11 percent from 6.16 percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers in Dow stocks were Eastman Kodak, up 1 to 71  
11/16 and DuPont, up 1 5/8 at 68 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, the No. 4 U.S. long-distance phone  
company, was down 9 3/4 to 35, after making a bid to buy U S West Inc. 
and Frontier Corp. for $66.4 billion. U S West was up 2 15/16 to 57 
13/16, while Frontier rose 2 7/8 to 58 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Qwest bid were to succeed, it would block a competing  
offer from Global Crossing, which fell 1/4 to 50 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 75.93 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.92 to 621.42, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 3.05 to 768.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.06 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.32 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.39 percent.

	TORONTO (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky cleared another hurdle in making  
the Hockey Hall of Fame ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Hall's board of directors supported an earlier  
decision by the selection committee to waive the standard 
three-year waiting process for potential inductees in Gretzky's 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The inductees will be announced June 23, with the ceremony  
scheduled for Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the selection committee unanimously voted to make  
Gretzky the 10th player to bypass the process. Former Pittsburgh 
Penguins center Mario Lemieux was the last to do that, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky retired at age 38 in April after his New York Rangers  
failed to make the playoffs. He left the game holding 61 league 
records.

	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Grady Lewis, who invented the low-cut  
canvas basketball sneaker, and Fred Zollner, who helped lead the 
pro game into the modern age, have been nominated to the Basketball 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis played with the pre-NBA Basketball Association of America  
champions, the Baltimore Bullets, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, as a salesman for Converse, he experimented by  
cutting the tops off high-cut sneakers for the Harlem 
Globetrotters. The result was his low-cut canvas sneaker in the 
oxford style. 
</P>
<P>
	Zollner owned the Fort Wayne Pistons when they captured National  
Basketball League championships in 1944 and 1945. In 1952, he was 
one of the first to buy an airplane to transport his teams to away 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped found and nurture the early NBA. The league's Western  
Conference trophy is named after Zollner, who died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame named Lewis and Zollner as veteran nominees  
Monday. Other nominees announced earlier are Kevin McHale, Dennis 
Johnson, Jo Jo White, Wayne Embry, Bob McAdoo, John Thompson, 
Maurice Cheeks, Gus Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Chet Walker, Jim 
Phelan, Tex Winter and Morgan Wootten. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Famers will be announced June 21.

	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Civic cheerleaders want to restore Latrobe's  
claim as the birthplace of pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrobe is about 35 miles east of Pittsburgh, which is regarded  
as the place where players first were paid to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrobe boosters said that's a mistake, citing new historical  
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to prove this area was damaged by the NFL removing the  
claim from Latrobe,'' Latrobe resident Tony Novak said. ``We plan 
to file suit in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That birthplace stuff is all over the town's letterhead,  
street signs and everything. And the NFL just took it away based on 
handwritten notes which mysteriously appeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1992, football historians believe the first pro game was  
played Sept. 3, 1895, between the Latrobe YMCA and a team from the 
town of Jeanette. Records indicate that John Brallier, then an 
18-year-old quarterback who became a dentist, was paid $10 and food 
that was said to be cakes. Latrobe won 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a ledger surfaced that listed expenses of the Allegheny  
Athletic Association from a game in Pittsburgh on Nov. 12, 1892, 
including $500 plus $25 in expenses paid to William ``Pudge'' 
Heffelfinger. The Allegheny Club beat the Pittsburgh Athletic Club 
4-0 on a touchdown by Heffelfinger at a time before touchdowns 
counted for six points. 
</P>
<P>
	The old ledgers are considered to be the ``birth certificate of  
professional football,'' said Pete Fierle, a spokesman for the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Allegheny club paid four people in addition to  
Heffelfinger for games in 1892 and 1893, and the Greensburg 
Athletic Association paid Lawson Fiscus to play a game in 1894.

	US To Negotiate Russia's Kosovo Role  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian President Boris  
Yeltsin discussed by telephone today the standoff between Russian 
and NATO troops in Kosovo. They agreed that Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen would meet 
their Russian counterparts in Finland to try to work out an 
arrangement for Russian troops to serve in a NATO-commanded 
peacekeeping operation. A main worry for NATO is that independent 
Russian troops could lead to a split in Kosovo, drawing the 
minority Serb population to a Russian-controlled zone and excluding 
the ethnic Albanians.

	Serbs Withdraw With Fury  
</P>
<P>
	PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After a final spree of burning, shooting  
and alleged rapes, Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo's border 
region with Albania today, whooping and giving parting mock salutes 
to a citizenry devastated by war. Some citizens in the hard-hit 
city of Djakovica say Serb paramilitary troops went on a rampage 
there Saturday, after the peace deal and two days before their

compiled; a cemetery worker said he buried as many as 200 people 
slain in mass killings of up to 70 at a time.

	IBM Chief Warns of Tech Regulation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner Jr. warned  
Congress today against enacting legislation to govern the 
fast-changing technology industry, saying that policies rushed into 
place today could become obsolete tomorrow. Gerstner said the rise 
of global networks already has begun to transform education, 
business and government. But he estimated that this process is only 
about one-sixth complete, adding that more information is needed to 
develop a model for public policy. In areas such as electronic 
commerce, Gerstner said, government and industry should work 
together to come up with an approach that balances the interests of 
business and society.

	Road Repairs To Slow Summer Travel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Widespread repair work on state and federal  
highways, combined with a record number of drivers expected to take 
advantage of still-low gas prices, threaten to make long-distance 
driving trips this summer more like rush-hour commuting. Experts 
warn that drivers shouldn't expect to go more than 40 miles on 
major roads without encountering a construction zone. 
Transportation officials also said the added construction increases 
the risk of traffic accidents.

	India PM Wants Rebels Out of Kashmir  
</P>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India's prime minister today ruled out more  
talks with Pakistan until Islamic rebels withdraw from a disputed 
mountain region of Kashmir. Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tough stance was 
a rebuff to his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, and came the 
same day as India said it had seized more ground in an attempt to 
secure its key northern highway. The road has been under constant 
bombardment from artillery units inside of Pakistan. India blames 
the month-old hostilities on Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of 
sending hundreds of soldiers and mercenaries over the cease-fire 
line that divides the Himalayan territory between the two nations.

	'Jerusalem Syndrome' Hits Pilgrims  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jerusalem Syndrome strikes with little warning:  
After a few days in the holy city, seemingly normal pilgrims 
imagine they are biblical figures, sing psalms at the top of their 
lungs, preach to passers-by or dress up in hotel bedsheets. 
Jerusalem clergymen and officials came together today to discuss 
ways to spot and deal with the mental illness, which one 
psychiatrist says may strike as many as one in 100 pilgrims and 
disrupt Jesus' 2000th birthday celebrations. About 4 million 
Christian pilgrims are expected to visit Israel and the Palestinian 
areas in 2000. The Jerusalem mental health commissioner, Dr. Yair 
Barel, who first diagnosed Jerusalem Syndrome, predicted about 
40,000 millennium pilgrims might suffer from religious delusions.

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Manager Needs Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker will have  
brain surgery to remove a blood vessel mass that caused his seizure 
during a game at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, 52, will be operated on Tuesday at Methodist Hospital,  
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was taken there after he collapsed and shook violently  
during the eighth inning of Sunday's game against the San Diego 
Padres. Tests concluded there was no tumor, Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Larry this morning, and he was coherent and very  
positive and encouraged,'' Hunsicker said. ``He was kind of joking 
around, but he said the last couple of days he had severe headaches 
and that was unusual for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker told Hunsicker he didn't remember anything after the  
second inning of Sunday's game. Dierker didn't even recall Derek 
Bell's sixth-inning grand slam, which put the Astros ahead 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry said he was sorry he missed the grand slam,'' Hunsicker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Hunsicker described the collapse as a grand mal  
seizure, which can be associated with epilepsy. The condition is 
called arteriovenous malformation, a collection of blood vessels 
about 1 1/2 inches in diameter 
</P>
<P>
	This is a condition in which people are born with malformed,  
sometimes tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time they 
can become dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure 
neural tissue or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told Hunsicker the mass was located in a less critical  
part of the brain and could have been there for possibly two years. 
It was unknown what caused it to move when it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said he was told by doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5  
-- with 1 the least serious -- Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's uncertain how long Dierker will be away from the team. Matt  
Galante, Houston's bench coach, was appointed interim manager 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``All we can do now is take the lead from the doctors that 
his prognosis is excellent, but there's no way we can put a 
timetable on his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros owner Drayton McLane said Sunday night that Dierker had a  
milder seizure three years ago in San Diego when he was an Astros 
broadcaster. Hunsicker said Monday that Dierker did not have a 
seizure earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry has no history of seizures,'' Hunsicker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's seizure came during a game that began with former  
Astros pitcher J.R. Richard throwing out the ceremonial first 
pitch. Richard had a career-ending stroke and collapsed while 
working out in the Astrodome on July 30, 1980. Richard fell along 
the first-base line, just a few feet from where Dierker collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell was at bat when Dierker collapsed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready to step in, and the umpire said, `Hold  
on,''' Bagwell said. ``I looked around, and everybody was running 
to the dugout. Larry had collapsed. He couldn't talk. He was 
shaking violently. He was shaking the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking. We're all stunned.''  
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 39,773, anticipating a three-game sweep of the  
Padres, was silent as players gathered around the dugout where 
Dierker fell. Some prayed. Jose Lima cried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh and play with him every day, and now I have to pray  
for him,'' Lima said. ``I started crying because I've seen my 
grandmother do the same thing in the Dominican Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres watched with equal horror.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't get him under control, and they had to fight to  
hold him down,'' said Padres pitching coach Dave Smith, a former 
Astro and one of Dierker's golfing buddies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was concerned (Saturday) that something was not quite right.  
Usually, he's upbeat and laughing but for some reason he was kind 
of quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics in an ambulance rushed to the dugout from center  
field. Dierker's wife, Judy, left the stands and went to the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts to sit and see that happening. Talk about a knot in  
the stomach -- there was an emptiness inside,'' Padres manager Bruce 
Bochy said. ``I talked to him on Friday and he said he was working 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game was suspended with the Astros ahead 4-1. It will be  
resumed July 23 when the Padres return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker has been Houston's manager since Oct. 4, 1996, and led  
the Astros to consecutive NL Central titles. He was voted NL 
Manager of the Year last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has been plagued by health problems this year. First  
base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 for treatment for an 
irregular heart beat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for treatment for prostate cancer. Cruz is expected back 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star outfielder Moises Alou tore his anterior cruciate  
ligament in his left knee when he fell off a treadmill in 
mid-February and will miss most of the season. And third baseman 
Ken Caminiti, a former NL MVP, has been on the disabled list since 
May 22 because of a strained right calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a terrible year, even with some other coaches going  
down,'' Galante said. ``But I think these guys will bounce back and 
might even play a little harder. We'll play each game one by one 
for Larry. I hope when he comes back, we'll have an even bigger 
lead.''

<HEADLINE> IOC To Open Its General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first time, reporters will be  
allowed to see the International Olympic Committee at work. But 
they still won't be allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a commitment to openness in the wake of its worst  
scandal, the IOC announced Monday that its four-day session in 
Seoul would be carried live to reporters via closed-circuit 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board said it decided to open the meetings on the  
recommendation of its new IOC 2000 reform commission, which was 
created following the Salt Lake City vote-buying case. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said the committee was  
satisfied with open meetings of the world anti-doping conference in 
February and of the reform panel earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings of the ruling executive board will remain behind  
closed doors, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the deliberations of many national parliaments are  
open to the public, while those of government cabinets are normally 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have opposed the idea of opening the sessions  
on grounds that it would inhibit debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 109th IOC session opens Thursday and members will hear  
reports from organizing committees of the 2000 Sydney Games and 
2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. On Saturday, the IOC will select 
the host city for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new system, the assembly will elect a 16-member panel  
that will choose two finalists from the field of six European 
cities. Then the full membership will choose the winner by secret 
ballot.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Issues Ethical Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Public distrust of the media and reader  
concerns about fair play and accuracy prompted The Gannett Co. Inc. 
on Monday to announce ethical guidelines for all 73 of its daily 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiled at a management conference for its publishers and  
editors, the news gathering ethics state that newspapers should 
seek and report the truth in a truthful way, serve the public 
interest, exercise fair play, maintain independence and act with 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	The five ethics are accompanied by guidelines that ``forbid  
lying to get a story, misstatements of identity or intent, 
fabrications, plagiarism, misleading alterations of photographs and 
slanting of the news,'' a statement released by Gannett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The principles were first outlined in March at a conference  
attended by 30 Gannett editors, reporters, corporate officials and 
outside experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to write them was prompted in part by a rising  
number of lawsuits challenging news gathering methods, a desire to 
encourage honest investigative reporting and news gathering 
problems last year at several newspapers, including the Cincinnati 
Enquirer, which is owned by Gannett. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter for the Enquirer relied on voice mail messages for  
stories published last May accusing Chiquita Brands International 
Inc. of improper dealings in Central America. The newspaper later 
renounced the articles, fired the reporter and paid Chiquita more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems at the Enquirer were a factor in Gannett's decision to  
develop the ethics, but the problem of newspaper credibility is 
widespread and print reporters generally have received low 
performance marks on recent public opinion surveys, said Phil 
Currie, senior vice president of news. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines urge editors to be skeptical, provide specific  
ways to correct errors and make cautious use of unnamed sources and 
only on important news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett said its newspapers should strive to expose wrongdoing,  
be watchdogs of government and institutions that affect the public, 
treat people with dignity, respect and compassion and maintain an 
arm's length relationship with anyone seeking to influence the 
news.

<HEADLINE> NBA Playoff's TV Ratings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks to the New York Knicks' surprising run to  
the NBA Finals, playoff ratings have slipped just 8 percent on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's postseason average on the network was a 6.5 rating  
and a 16 share for 25 telecasts, compared to a 7.1/19 in 21 games a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Many predicted even lower ratings after Michael Jordan's  
retirement and the NBA lockout, but the network was aided by the 
interest of the New York market in the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest rating of the playoffs, a 10.2/19, came during the  
Knicks' victory over Indiana in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference 
finals. The game got a 18.6/31 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner finished with a 2.9 rating in 36 playoff games, down 9  
percent from 1998. One reason was because it only had one 
third-round game in 1999, Game 1 of the Knicks-Pacers series, which 
grabbed a 6.1. Last year, it showed three third-round contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those 
televisions on at the time.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India pressed ahead today with hand-to-hand  
combat against Islamic guerrilla forces in the disputed mountain 
region of Kashmir with no political resolution to the conflict in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif spoke with his Indian  
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by telephone Sunday to prevent 
South Asia from ``descending into chaos and conflagration'' over 
the Kashmir fighting, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no indication the call moved the two sides closer  
to easing the escalating conflict after talks failed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	India blames the hostilities on Pakistan, accusing it of sending  
hundreds of soldiers and mercenaries over the cease-fire line that 
divides the Himalayan territory between the two nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan denies the charge, saying the guerrillas who seized  
mountain positions inside India's territory in early May are 
indigenous ``freedom fighters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Indian ground forces troops captured the summit of  
Tololing Peak, the first of the three peaks looming high over the 
abandoned town of Dras and its important military base. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers found the bodies of 14 infiltrators on Tololing Peak,  
said an officer who returned from the mountain after the fighting. 
He said that the victims were all Pakistani soldiers and that they 
had enough ammunition to last a year. In New Delhi, the army 
spokesman said 17 Indian soldiers were killed in the two days of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	After another night of massive bombardments and close-quarters  
fighting with flame-throwers, Indian troops today closed in on the 
peak of a second mountain overlooking India's northern highway, 
field commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian commandos also were dropped onto the strategic Marpola  
Heights west of Dras looking over the guerrillas' supply route, 
front-line officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan, and has been the cause  
of two wars between the rival neighbors since they gained 
independence from Britain in 1947. India controls two-thirds of the 
territory, and Pakistan has the remaining third. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh was in Beijing to discuss  
the fighting with his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan. Pakistan's 
foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, briefed Chinese authorities 
Saturday. Beijing, a close ally of Pakistan, asked Islamabad to 
solve the Kashmir dispute through talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks in New Delhi on Saturday between Singh and Aziz left both  
sides trading accusations about who was to blame for the latest 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan, meanwhile, accused India today of using chemical  
weapons, saying it was testing the contents of Indian shells that 
slammed into its Kashmir territory during the weekend. India has 
denied using chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani police said Sunday that Indian troops rained mortar  
shells on border villages in the Samani sector of 
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir over the weekend, killing three people 
and wounding one. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, India said one villager was killed by  
Pakistani shelling in Kasba.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Flying to San Antonio Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Shooting in a dome is different from  
shooting in an arena, which is why the New York Knicks are wasting 
no time getting to the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, shooting in a dome is different. The shooting  
background in domes is different, and that gives them, to me, a 
huge homecourt advantage,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York planned to practice at its suburban facility one more  
time today before boarding a charter flight to San Antonio that 
should arrive in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 of the finals is Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks did not play each other during the regular  
season because of the lockout-shortened schedule, so there will be 
a greater degree of unfamiliarity in this series than there ever 
has been in an NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Familiarity in the Miami series and the Indiana series,  
coaching staff-wise, was easy,'' Van Gundy said. ``This is just 
different. You don't really know a team until you compete against 
them regularly, and particularly until you compete against them in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams think they know, but they're not really going to  
know until a couple games into the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the Knicks should also know how much of a contribution  
Larry Johnson will be able to make. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-captain's sprained right knee was causing him a lot of  
pain Sunday, although he said he'll play in the series -- even if 
it's not in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hate more than sitting out is being on the floor and  
not being 100 percent. Because you know you can make this move or 
guard this guy better, but there's something hampering you,'' 
Johnson said. ``Another thing is I don't want to be out there with 
a big, bulky brace on and not be able to do the things I want to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson can't play in Game 1, the Knicks would be expected to  
use a starting lineup of Chris Dudley at center, Kurt Thomas and 
Latrell Sprewell at forward and Allan Houston and Charlie Ward in 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Marcus Camby and 41-year-old Herb Williams as  
the only big men coming off the bench since the Knicks are also 
missing 7-foot center Patrick Ewing, who was lost for the season 
with a torn Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	That size predicament had Van Gundy and his staff wondering  
whether to double-team Duncan and Robinson when they have the ball, 
as most teams do, or take their chances with single coverage on the 
Twin Towers and tight defense on the other three players. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's going to be great to watch,'' Van Gundy said.  
``It's going to be a great, great decision for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, meanwhile, are hoping rest doesn't lead to rust after  
their long layoff. They had a day off from practice Sunday as the 
players further enjoyed the downtime they earned by disposing of 
the Portland Trail Blazers in a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, which also swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the  
second round, hasn't lost since the second game of the first round 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams that are inconsistent, or not as good, you can exploit  
because they have weaknesses,'' Van Gundy said of the Spurs. ``But 
this team really has no weaknesses, which is why they've won 10 
playoff games in a row, which is unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive on ``How To Beat The Spurs'' is not a voluminous  
one, which is what Van Gundy learned when he started researching 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked our video coordinator: `Pull up all their losses. I  
want to see the teams that beat them in the last three months.' And 
he gives me this little stack of tapes,'' Van Gundy said. ``Baaaad 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost to Phoenix, Dallas, Sacramento in overtime and  
Minnesota. That's it since April 1,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's the 
stack. Four of 'em.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio swept the two-game season series in 1997-98, but  
those Knicks were nothing like the current squad -- an uptempo, 
athletic mix who were at their best playing at a greyhound pace 
against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tougher in transition against San Antonio  
because those guys run real well,'' said Camby, who provided the 
Knicks with a huge lift off the bench in the Indiana series. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Dudley: ``It definitely will be more difficult without  
Larry. He's been a huge part of our success and he's integral to 
our team, but we'll move forward if he can't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At practice, Van Gundy showed the players a tape of the final  
seven minutes of Game 6 against Indiana and asked them to savor it 
for the rest of their lives -- but only after they forget about it 
for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a special time, that's going to be a special memory,  
but hopefully there are more special memories to come,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaigns in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush said today he would not impose an abortion litmus test on 
his Supreme Court nominees and promised to uphold the dignity of 
the office if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide ranging news conference on his maiden trip to this key  
primary state, the GOP front-runner raised his right hand to a 
crowd of 150 reporters and said he swore an oath as Texas' governor 
to uphold the constitution and respect the dignity of the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pledge I have upheld, so help me God,'' Bush said, his  
right hand still raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected governor has said he was ``young and  
irresponsible'' when he was a young man. Now 52, Bush refused to 
say more about the topic today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a game in Washington,'' he told a New Hampshire  
reporter who posed the question. ``It's called ``Gotcha.' It's a 
game where you float a rumor and make the candidate'' respond. 
``I'm not playing that game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On abortion, Bush has said he would nominate judges who strictly  
interpret the U.S. Constitution. He was asked whether he interprets 
the Constitution to allow for abortions and whether he would 
require his judicial nominees to view it the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no litmus tests, except for whether or not the  
judges will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' he said. ``I am 
not a lawyer. My job is to pick judges who are qualified to serve 
on the bench and that will be my criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said later that Bush feels it is unethical to require a  
nominee to cement his or her views on any potential case before 
being nominated. But they said he would appoint conservative judges 
who hold the same general values as he. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he is opposed to abortion and would even support a  
constitutional amendment making the procedure illegal except in 
cases of rape, incest or to protect the woman. But he also says 
Americans don't support the measure so there is no sense in 
pursuing it. 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said he opposes quotas and racial preferences, but said the  
private and public sector should be encourage to reach out to 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Promised not to raise corporate or income taxes, but did not  
extend the pledge to other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expressed concern about the implementation of a peace plan in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pledged to provide more details about his agenda as the  
campaign progressed, saying he will move ``at my own timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor also planned to visit an elementary school  
and speak at a women's forum later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Republican presidential front-runner drew more than  
300 people to an early morning address on the banks of the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew crashed Bush's  
speech, pigeonholing reporters to accuse the Texas governor of 
refusing to detail his position on national issues. ``The governor 
from the Alamo state won't take a stand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew dubbed Bush ``Curious George'' because he said the  
governor's positions are so vague. ``Nobody wants Curious George 
with his finger on the button,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew also shadowed Bush's trip to Iowa on Saturday,  
underscoring how seriously the Democratic Party is taking his 
candidacy. No other GOP candidate is getting such attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has the support of the state's leading GOP politician, Sen.  
Judd Gregg. He was announcing the names of more than 180 local 
organizers today, along with the appointment of state public safety 
director Richard Flynn to be chairman of his coordinating 
committee. Flynn is the longest-serving state department head, long 
considered a behind-the-scenes powerbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush apologized to New Hampshire voters for waiting so long for  
his first trip,, saying he promised Texans he would complete the 
state's legislative session before campaigning for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you understand that I'm a man of my word,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush took more than 20 minutes getting to the stage, slowly  
making his way through a crowd of supporters eager to grab his 
hand. Spotting a redheaded baby in the crowd, he shouted, ``I've 
always been a sucker for baby pictures,'' then took the child from 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He kissed the baby in front of a group of photographers, then  
turned on request to pose for more cameras. ``Another kiss 
governor!'' one photographer yelled. Bush eagerly consented, and 
planted another kiss on the baby's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Irma Pierce of Portsmouth, N.H., pulled Bush aside briefly and  
asked him to do something about the rising costs of long-term care. 
`I will,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't satisfied with his answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``But at least it's hopeful,'' she said. ``He needs to be  
formulating some plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush announced Saturday in Iowa that there was ``no turning  
back'' from his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, in which 
he leads in the polls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Leave for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, leaving tonight for Europe,  
is joining with allies to launch a costly rebuilding plan for 
war-torn Kosovo and other trouble-plagued nations of southeast 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coming months will be a period of return and  
reconstruction,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 
Monday. ``Our goal is a democratic Kosovo, at peace with itself and 
secure from external threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't happen overnight,'' Albright said at a White House  
briefing. ``But as President Clinton consults with his colleagues 
this week, he will do all he can to ensure that the effort is well 
launched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European nations will bear the largest share of the financial  
burden of rebuilding, Albright said, because the United States 
absorbed the heaviest cost of the 78-day bombing campaign against 
Yugoslavia. She said that as of Monday, 13,000 to 15,000 Serb 
forces have pulled out of Kosovo and 14,000 peacekeeping troops 
have begun to deploy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the allies are digging into their pockets to rebuild the  
Balkans, Clinton has ruled out giving any help to Belgrade as long 
as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing tonight, Clinton flies overnight to Geneva to address  
the International Labor Organization on Wednesday, speaking in 
support of a convention to eradicate the worst forms of child 
labor. The measure is expected to be adopted by all 174 ILO members 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the president will stop overnight in Paris for talks  
with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin. 
</P>
<P>
	From Paris, Clinton will travel to Cologne, Germany, for the  
annual summit of the world's seven wealthiest nations -- the United 
States, Germany, England, France, Italy, Canada and Japan -- and 
Russia. They will meet Friday through Sunday, discussing 
reconstruction of the Balkans, debt relief for the poorest nations 
and new global finance structures. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two days of the summit, Russia will be represented  
by Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin. President Boris Yeltsin will 
come for the final day of talks Sunday and a private meeting with 
Clinton. National security adviser Sandy Berger said he was not 
sure why Yeltsin would not attend the first two days. ``It could be 
a question of physical stamina,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Berger played down U.S. unhappiness about the  
surprise deployment of Russian troops to Kosovo, ahead of NATO 
troops. She said she was confident the issue would be resolved, and 
said, ``There has not been long-term damage from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen and Albright were to go to  
Helsinki in a few days to talk with Russian officials about 
Russia's role in peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said it was critical to bring the Balkans into the  
mainstream of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our Europeans allies have recognized, after our  
experience in Kosovo and earlier this decade in Bosnia, that 
isolated programs to assist individual countries in this region 
have been insufficient,'' Albright said. ``And we need to 
coordinate our resources and encourage real integration within the 
Balkans, throughout Europe and across the Atlantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next Monday, Clinton will attend a summit with leaders of the  
European Union in Bonn, where the Balkan discussions will continue. 
He will then fly to Slovenia for an overnight stay. Slovenia, 
Bosnia and Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia after the fall of 
communism. Slovenia now is a leading candidate to join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's schedule calls for him to return home from Slovenia,  
but White House aides are exploring a possible stop in Macedonia to 
visit refugees or in Aviano, Italy, to salute American forces who 
took part in bombing raids and humanitarian missions.

<HEADLINE> New Look at Math, Science Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Math and science software tends to aim at the elementary school  
set. But by the time a student is wrestling with calculus or 
physics on a high school or college level, cutesy animations don't 
quite cover the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	MathSoft Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., has some decidedly un-cutesy  
software in StudyWorks Mathematics and StudyWorks Science, and both 
are worth a look as reinforcement tools. 
</P>
<P>
	The approach is three-step: 1. Understand the concepts. 2. Learn  
to use the concepts to solve problems. 3. Reinforce the concepts 
with more problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is a multimedia component and an on-line  
``Collaboratory'' (a virtual study group), the emphasis is on 
education, not entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's face it, it may be possible to make trigonometry, calculus  
and statistics entertaining, but it's not likely. In addition to 
those subjects, the math software offers algebra I, algebra II, 
geometry and pre-calculus and updated SAT II math preparation 
sections from Princeton Review. 
</P>
<P>
	For someone whose math skills peaked at long division and who  
hailed the arrival of pocket calculators as a godsend, the content 
was pretty tough sledding, but well presented and organized. The 
story problems were interesting and current. 
</P>
<P>
	The science product covers biology, chemistry, physics, earth  
science and statistics and also includes SAT II science preparation 
from Princeton Review. Information on each subject is presented in 
a straightforward manner with hypertext links as appropriate. Both 
packages include puzzles and games featuring the subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Students are unlikely to come to either package for fun, and  
those with a gift for the subjects at hand would probably become 
bored. But for most, they will provide help in a strange land that 
must be crossed to earn a baccalaureate. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements are very modest: at least a 66-megahertz 486  
machine running Windows 3.1 or higher, eight megabytes of memory, 
doublespeed CED-ROM drive, Windows-compatible sound card and 
speakers. Use of the Internet will of course require access. I 
reviewed it on one of IBM's snazzy new Thinkpad portables, about 
which more later. Installation was competent and professional and 
the user interface was easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The software carries a price of $29.95 that is modest for the  
value. It is available at software retailers or directly from 
MathSoft at http://www.mathsoft.com. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hull Doubtful for Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- There's something wrong with Brett Hull's  
groin. There's nothing wrong with his head. Really. 
</P>
<P>
	Says who? Says Hull, who laughed off suggestions Monday that he  
hurt his head on the same play in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals 
against Buffalo on which he reinjured his groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, who hurt the groin twice previously this season, is  
doubtful for Game 4 Tuesday, but could return as early as Game 5 on 
Thursday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's minute to minute,'' Hull said Monday, talking  
to reporters as he worked a crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	As the media fired questions at the eighth-leading scorer in NHL  
playoff history, he responded with a few of his own as he filled in 
the crossword. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Who is Judith Martin's alter ego?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Miss Manners.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``What golfer and former NFL quarterback share the last  
name?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Snead.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``How did the groin feel while skating today?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I don't know, I never skated.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Did you get your bell rung on that play and, if you did,  
have you had any repercussions?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``No, you couldn't hurt this head.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``What do you think about defenseman Darryl Sydor taking your  
spot on the line?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Well, that is about the next best thing to that defensive  
right winger as you can put there, a defenseman, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, of course, was making fun of his own reputation for being  
a scorer, and only a scorer, for most of his career. But he 
apparently wasn't kidding when he suggested he might play Tuesday, 
even if his coach downplayed that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he's doubtful,'' said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock,  
who doesn't want to risk losing Hull for the rest of the series by 
rushing him back. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no doubt Hull is one of the NHL's most quotable and  
colorful players, which creates a curious yet respectable 
relationship with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most coaches, Hitchcock loves Hull's scoring touch -- Hull  
has 586 regular-season goals -- but worries anytime he sees a 
microphone near Hull's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a player like him in the minors, (the Penguins') Rob  
Brown who used to drive me crazy morning, noon and night,'' 
Hitchcock said. ``We are very good friends now, even though he 
plays in the league. We learned a relationship of give and take. 
It's the same thing with Brett Hull. You never know what bomb he'll 
drop on you. He's a very opinionated person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he'll look at me and wink and say, `I just dropped  
a bomb on you.' It's never dull when there are guys like Brett. He 
always has an opinion, and sometimes he'll just throw something up 
against the wall and see what sticks. And we have to go in and 
clean up the mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars can only hope Hull's absence doesn't wreck an offense  
that hasn't been explosive but has been efficient throughout the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brett Hull has a personality in the game that he is like a  
shark out there,'' Hitchcock said. ``He is always lurking and he is 
always finding gaps and holes and he is hard to play against. With 
Hull, you always feel like the game can turn right away because of 
that ability.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Manager Needs Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker will undergo brain surgery Tuesday  
to remove a mass of malformed blood vessels that caused his seizure 
in the Houston Astros dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager spoke with general manager Gerry  
Hunsicker on Monday and said he did not recall anything after the 
second inning of Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Larry this morning, and he was coherent and very  
positive and encouraged,'' Hunsicker said. ``He was kind of joking 
around, but he said the last couple of days he had severe headaches 
and that was unusual for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker went into violent convulsions in the eighth inning of  
the game against the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. Players and 
coaches restrained him until medical personnel arrived and took him 
to Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Monday revealed he had an arteriovenous malformation -- a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, they can become 
dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure neural tissue 
or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That blood vessel mass is what triggered Larry's seizure,''  
Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seriousness of Dierker's diagnosis, it's not as bad  
as his players thought. They left the Astrodome Sunday night 
thinking Dierker had a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary to hear that he might have a tumor,'' right  
fielder Derek Bell said. ``You couldn't eat or sleep last night. It 
was great to see that he is okay. Now we can go out and do what he 
trained us to do the last three years, have fun and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante, who will be interim manager, also  
visited Dierker in the hospital and was elated to find his manager 
in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded good and was very optimistic about the surgery,''  
Galante said. ``We even kind of joked some. I told him I didn't 
realize I was so boring that I put him to sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Bagwell said the whole team was relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, we heard it was a tumor and that's life and  
death,'' Bagwell said. ``This morning, they said it's not a tumor, 
that it was something that was not an easy operation but they felt 
it had a good success rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Craig Biggio said Dierker told him he thought he  
could be back in uniform in two weeks, although Astros personnel 
wouldn't speculate about Dierker's' return. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of shocked us to hear him say that,'' Biggio said.  
``That's good that he's thinking like that but we just want him to 
be healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunsicker said he was told by doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5  
-- with 1 the least serious -- Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also told Hunsicker the mass -- about 1 1/2 inches in  
diameter -- was located in a less-critical part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante worked his first game as interim manager Monday night  
against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. Hunsicker does not 
know how long Dierker will be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, that's the least thing on my mind,'' Hunsicker  
said. ``All we can do now is take the lead from the doctors that 
his prognosis is excellent, but there's no way we can put a 
timetable on his return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker told Hunsicker he was unable to recall Bell's  
sixth-inning grand slam, which put the Astros ahead 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry said he was sorry he missed the grand slam,'' Hunsicker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 39,773 turned eerily silent when play was stopped as  
it became obvious Dierker was having an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something really bad like this, when things are really bad,  
shows that it's only a baseball game,'' catcher Mitch Meluskey 
said. ``That's real life what Larry Dierker is going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game was suspended and will be resumed July 23 when the  
Padres return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other managers, Joe Torre of the New York Yankees and John  
Boles of the Florida Marlins, have been sidelined because of 
illness this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre missed the start of the season while recovering from  
prostate surgery and Boles missed a total of 13 games following 
back surgery and a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's condition added to Houston's growing list of injured  
and ill players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	First base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of an  
irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected back this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Moises Alou tore a knee ligament when he fell off a  
treadmill in February and will miss most of the season. And third 
baseman Ken Caminiti has been on the disabled list since May 22 
with a strained calf.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Retreat on Smog Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON AP) -- Stung by adverse court decisions, the  
Environmental Protection Agency shifted strategy today and 
announced a scaled-back plan to cut smog-causing pollution from 
electric power plants, especially coal burning plants in the Ohio 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner said she remained optimistic  
about the appeal of two recent court decisions that threatened the 
agency's new air quality standards for smog and fine soot and put a 
freeze on regulations to curtail cross-state pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Browner told a news conference that another approach was  
needed as ``insurance'' to guarantee that drifting pollution from 
Midwest power plants into the Northeast is curtailed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said she would pursue actions against power plants in 12  
states based on petitions that had been filed by four Northeast 
states, claiming they were being environmentally harmed by the 
drifting pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the petition process, the EPA will enforce pollution  
controls with the current ozone and soot standards that are not 
under court challenge. The process also would be separate from the 
broader cross-state pollution rules that are currently in 
litigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Browner said she remained optimistic that the court  
rulings will be overcome, she said she believed the agency needed 
to take another approach to protect Northeast states from 
smog-causing chemicals drifting in from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the agency will act on petitions filed by New York,  
Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts to demand that power 
plants in the 12 states reduce emissions of smog-causing nitrogen 
oxide. 
</P>
<P>
	The petitions claimed that coal-burning power plants in Indiana,  
Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia 
were responsible for pollution drifting into the Northeast, making 
it impossible to meet federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency action, responding to the petitions, also will  
require pollution reduction by some plants in Delaware, Maryland, 
New Jersey, New York and North Carolina because of complaints about 
drifting pollution from other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said use of the petition process would curtail emissions  
less than the broader 22-state ozone transport regulation because 
it will cover only 12 states and be based on the less stringent 
ozone and soot rules, and not the tougher ones under court 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``we are not providing as much public health protection,''  
said Browner, the action will ``ensure us we will be able to move 
forward'' in curtailing cross-state pollution into the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	She estimated the scaled-back action would reduce smokestack  
releases of smog-causing chemicals by about 700,000 tons a year, 
compared to 1.1 million tons under the broader 22-state ozone 
transport rule being challenged in court. Plants would have to meet 
the new requirements by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not our preferred path,'' Browner said. But she said  
she had no choice but to pursue the limited petition approach 
because the courts had ``robbed us of the (other) option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of District of Columbia last month threw out the EPA's 
controversial regulation requiring tougher health standards for 
smog-causing ozone and for microscopic soot. The agency immediately 
said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, the same appeals court -- including two of the  
same judges -- ordered the EPA to halt implementation of its 
regulation to require 22 states to take action to reduce 
cross-state air pollution. That action was aimed primarily at 
curtailing emissions from the coal burning power plants in the Ohio 
Valley, whose pollution drifts into the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	While both of those regulatory actions remain in limbo, agency  
action based on the specific state petitions under a separate part 
of the Clean Air Act are not affected by the two appeals court 
rulings, EPA officials said.

<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers  
and the United Auto Workers began today against a background of 
record sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. 
and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial negotiations kicked off with ceremonial handshakes  
over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters. UAW president 
Stephen P. Yokich and Peter J. Pestillo, vice chairman and chief of 
staff at Ford, shook hands first, followed by their chief 
negotiators Ron Gettelfinger and Robert H. Marcin. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiators presented Ford negotiators with a large  
banner with the words ``Bargaining for Families,'' signed by each 
of the UAW negotiators. Gettelfinger said that was the theme the 
UAW-Ford negotiators picked for these negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar ceremonies are set for tomorrow at DaimlerChrysler and  
Wednesday at GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons  
learned from last year's devastating UAW strikes against GM 
decrease the chance for a walkout after this year's contracts 
expire Sept. 14, some industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got tough issues, but nobody wants to put the  
moneymaking on hold to sort it out,'' said labor professor Harley 
Shaiken at the University of California-Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's talks will cover about 407,000 UAW members at  
assembly and parts plants nationwide, down 15,000 from 1996. More 
than half work for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Job security, health-care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers are among the top issues in 
this year's talks, as they were during the last round in 1996. But 
since then, the industry has been through a tumultuous series of 
reorganizations, cost-cutting programs, acquisitions and mergers. 
Each of Detroit's automakers is financially stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to note that for all the changes this is a very  
healthy industry, one that has enjoyed record profits and sales on 
a sustained basis,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said. ``It's a good 
environment for negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though times are good, Detroit executives note that they remain  
under extreme pressure to keep costs down, invest heavily in new 
models and technology, and simplify the way they build and sell 
vehicles. With production capacity worldwide far exceeding demand, 
automakers can no longer simply pass on higher labor costs to 
consumers, as they did for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of their Asian and European competitors, meanwhile, compete  
directly on American soil with a growing number of modern, 
efficient, nonunion plants -- a sore point for Detroit and the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, the union is faced with the same problems  
that have challenged its leaders for the past 20 years: How do they 
slow the steady decline of high-paying assembly jobs as the 
industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers? And as 
suppliers take on a larger role in the design and assembly of cars 
and trucks, how can the union expand its influence? 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW only recently has begun to reverse its membership slide,  
largely by signing up more workers in non-automotive industries. 
More than half of its active membership is still employed by the 
Detroit automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last round of auto talks, the union won a conditional  
guarantee that at least 95 percent of UAW jobs at each plant would 
be maintained during the life of the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of focus this year will be on GM, which abandoned its  
combative stance toward the UAW after last year's strikes cost it 
about $2 billion and some of its U.S. market share. But GM has 
managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans  
to assemble small cars using ``modular'' assembly techniques. GM 
says it needs to make the change because its current small cars 
built in North America don't make money. 
</P>
<P>
	In GM's modular plants, most of the subassembly work would be  
done by lower-cost suppliers who would deliver preassembled parts 
clusters, such as an entire dashboard or interior module, to the 
assembly plant. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich has declared modular assembly a dead issue, but to some  
extent all three automakers have already adopted or are planning to 
use more modular techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the  
42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the big 
parts unit that automaker divested last month. The union is 
expecting that those workers will remain under the next GM 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of parts workers will be an issue at Ford, too, which  
is preparing plans to spin off its Visteon parts unit. At Ford and 
GM, management is likely to seek a lower wage for new hires at the 
parts concerns so they can more effectively compete against 
nonunion suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	At DaimlerChrysler, the company that resulted from last year's  
acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, the UAW 
is seeking stronger assurances that the automaker won't hinder its 
attempt to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and three 
Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though DaimlerChrysler's official position is that it's neutral  
in the organizing drives, executives realize it's a sensitive issue 
that could cause problems in this year's talks. And there is likely 
to be some concern among UAW negotiators about who's calling the 
shots at the Chrysler unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daimler is a company used to dealing with a union and  
negotiation, but it's not going to be the same as Chrysler,'' said 
John Revitte, a labor professor at Michigan State University. ``The 
fact that it's now a German company is going to change things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW, meanwhile, has sent signals that it will consider a  
longer-term contract, most likely a four-year deal. That would make 
the next contract expire in 2003, a year after the union's 
leadership is scheduled to change.

<HEADLINE> McCain Lays Out Education Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful John McCain  
touted an education platform Monday of merit-based pay for 
teachers, a nationwide school voucher program and high-speed 
Internet access for every school. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a three-term senator from Arizona, switched gears to  
domestic policy after spending weeks as the voice for quicker, more 
decisive action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	During a luncheon speech at the National Cable and Television  
Association's cable '99 convention, McCain called the Internet a 
powerful educational tool. But he warned that it also can serve as 
a refuge for alienated children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that the Internet can expose young people to  
subjects that increase their intellectual maturity so that they can 
advance apace with their potential,'' he said. ``The bad news is 
that it can expose children to material that overwhelms their 
emotional maturity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested requiring filtering software for all public school  
and library computers as a way to keep children from potentially 
harmful Internet sites. Critics have said such proposals are 
useless because the software becomes outdated so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also called for a school voucher program that would give  
tax money to middle- and lower-income families to send their 
children to private schools. And he praised charter schools -- 
publicly funded schools that often serve a specialized curriculum 
and operate free from many government mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain promoted merit-based pay for teachers, calling higher  
teacher salaries an ``urgent necessity.'' But he added that 
teachers should be tested for competence periodically and fired if 
they don't meet certain standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people just aren't meant to be teachers, and we should  
help them find another line of work,'' McCain said

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 51.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today,  
responding to a rally in long-term bonds as investors' anxiety over 
interest rates lessened. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 51.29 at 10.541.80 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 5.42 at 1,299.06, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 1.29 at 2,446.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were closely watching a speech by Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan today for clues about whether Fed policy 
makers will vote to raise interest rates when they meet June 29 and 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost 309 points last week as 30-year Treasury bonds  
suffered their biggest weekly decline more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	But bonds rose today for the first time in nine sessions, after  
Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlen said inflation worries in the 
United States are exaggerated. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 
point as yields fell to 6.11 percent from 6.16 percent on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers in Dow stocks were Eastman Kodak, up 1 to 71  
11/16 and DuPont, up 1 5/8 at 68 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, the No. 4 U.S. long-distance phone  
company, was down 9 3/4 to 35, after making a bid to buy U S West Inc. 
and Frontier Corp. for $66.4 billion. U S West was up 2 15/16 to 57 
13/16, while Frontier rose 2 7/8 to 58 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Qwest bid were to succeed, it would block a competing  
offer from Global Crossing, which fell 1/4 to 50 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 75.93 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.92 to 621.42, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 3.05 to 768.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.06 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.32 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.39 percent.
