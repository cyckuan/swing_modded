<HEADLINE> Mugabe Slams False Flamboyant Life Styles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today deplored youths whom he accused of having flamboyant
life styles financed by accumulated debts and crooked ways to
acquire wealth.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at the wedding of his relative who
is also a secretary in his office.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said such flamboyance often destroyed new marriages as
some couples imitated such lives.
</P>
<P>
He advised the couple: ''do not copy some destructive elements
in society who like to show off by changing cars everyday.
</P>
<P>
''You see these people with one Mercedes Benz today, tomorrow
they have another and then a Pajero but behind it all theirs are
unserviced debts and a lot of cheating. Do not envy them.''
</P>
<P>
He said the newly married couple should be content with the
little they have, work hard and accumulate substance gradually
and honestly.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Control Flea Market Trading: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The government is considering
steps to control illegal trade in second-hand clothing which
threatens the viability of Zimbabwe's textile industry now
recovering from a five-year recession, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira made the
remarks at a ceremony which sealed a joint venture between
Zimbabwe spinners and weavers and Germany's Daun and Cie in
Glendale near the capital Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said local textile companies were now responding to the
dictates of the market and becoming more efficient, leading to
increases in the sector's exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, ''the textile industry has become more
outward looking and has endeavored to become a player on the
global market."
</P>
<P>
" In Zimbabwe we have witnessed firms becoming leaner and more
efficient and exports in the sector have grown to 621 million
Zimbabwe Dollars (50 million U.S. Dollars) with most destined for
the European Union,'' Shamuyarira noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that increasing illegal trade in cheap
second-hand clothes was a serious threat to the industry.
</P>
<P>
''While it may help to put cheaper clothing and textile goods
on the market, it does take away jobs from Zimbabwean workers.
The government wants to protect every job available,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Signs African Economic Community Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa signed here
on Friday the treaty establishing the African Economic Community
and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, a
press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release issued by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), South African ambassador to Ethiopia W.
Nhlapo inked the treaty and the charter at the OAU headquarters
here on behalf of his government.
</P>
<P>
The release said, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim
welcomed the signing by South Africa of the two crucial documents
and expressed hope that South Africa would expedite the
ratification of both.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that when the treaty establishing the African
Economic Community was inked by African leaders in Abuja in 1991,
South Africa was then not yet a member of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
So the commitment demonstrated by Pretoria after joining the
African family of nations, is exemplary and commendable, said
Salim.
</P>
<P>
The South African ambassador on his part underscored that his
government attaches great importance to the economic integration
of the continent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: UN Security Council Expansion Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that any decision on expanding the United
Nations Security Council (SC) permanent membership must be
approved by all U.N. member states.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not support any hasty change or choices allowing
two North States (developed states) to join the SC without a
collective approval," he said, in reference to Germany and Japan,
the two countries that have an eye on a permanent membership.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement to reporters following "lengthy"
talks between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Indian Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders discussed the issue of U.N. Security
Council expansion, adding that India and Egypt support the
Non-aligned states' declaration last spring.
</P>
<P>
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) member states meeting in New
Delhi last spring showed their support to equal chance for
developing countries to become a Security Council member.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and India are in agreement that there is no reason for
any hasty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of SC expansion and U.N. reform should take its time
in order to receive collective approval and meet requirements and
demands of the North and the South," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and India are angling for a U.N. Security Council
permanent membership, but these efforts seemed to have met a snub
recently.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, back from his trip to the 52nd U.N. General Assembly
last month, said it might take years for a developing country to
become a permanent member.
</P>
<P>
Gujral also held lengthy consultations with Mubarak on the
situation in the Mideast and south Asia, the NAM, the Third World
interests and means of promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reviewed the trade ties and investments as
well as joint economic cooperation, said Moussa, adding that he
expected a prompt and comprehensive progress would be made in the
Egyptian-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
India and Egypt played a vital role in the founding of the
NAM. A preparatory meeting in Cairo in June 1961 led to its
establishment two months later.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister, who arrived here Friday evening on a
two-day visit, is on an African tour which has so far taken him to
Uganda and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two sides will sign three cooperation
agreements in the fields of tourism, customs and culture. And
preparations are under way to stage an exhibition of Indian
products in Cairo next April.
</P>
<P>
India has so far invested a total of 330 million U.S. dollars
in Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The heavy downpour last night
brought a bright fine day today to Lagos, the commercial hub of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The rain reduced the bad odor that has enveloped the city for
more than a week. But the early morning fresh cool air seems
hardly to take away fears from Joseph Japhet Udo.
</P>
<P>
"It will come back in the afternoon when it becomes hot,"
muttered Joseph.
</P>
<P>
Joseph is one of the newspaper boys who walk along the street
or in queues of vehicles inching their way when traffic is heavy.
</P>
<P>
Like the newspaper boy, Lagosians suddenly find themselves
surrounded by a bad smell, while they are rejoicing over the
come-back of free movement with the inflow of imported fuel after
a hard bite of short supply since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The odor is very irritating, we are worried over what the
aftermath will be," said a Lagos trader, Ogbonna Akanwa, adding
that "we are in dangerous times."
</P>
<P>
Akanwa was among other Lagos residents who were gripped with
fear as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA)
confirmed early this week that the pungent odor, linked to
imported petrol, could cause a "bubonic plague" in the city.
</P>
<P>
"The fuel was capable of causing irritation to the respiratory
tract, which under prolonged exposure, could cause dizziness and
stomach complications," a FEPA statement announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency enjoined the public to avoid staying too long in
the traffic and reschedule their movements to avoid peak traffic
periods as a way to reducing exposure.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to petrol dealers to change their dispensing
attendants every four hours so as to save them from possible
complications arising from the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The FEPA also advised Nigerians to ensure maximum air flow in
their homes by leaving their windows always opened and putting on
fans while going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is so bad for the people," lamented Funso
Ojediran, a teacher in Lagos, who described the "choking odor" as
another life-threatening disease like cholera, typhoid and
malaria.
</P>
<P>
It is really bad for Nigerians who not long ago suffered a
nationwide fuel scarcity which almost forced all business
activities to stop.
</P>
<P>
Lack of regular maintenance caused drastic drop in the
production of the four refineries in Nigeria, Africa's largest
oil producer which exported estimated 2.18 million barrels of
crude oil a day in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official figure is unavailable of how much fuel has been
imported since the head of state General Sani Abacha gave the
order of immediate importation last April.
</P>
<P>
But FEPA Director-General Adegoke Adegoroye said available
data in the possession of his agency indicated that about 33
million liters of the toxic fuel had been imported, with 24
million liters already distributed to 11 of the 36 states across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the states, Lagos and Ogun in the west witness rather
strong impact of the odor due to the high concentration of
vehicles and heavy traffic, coupled with other industrial
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Lagos has about 400,000 motor vehicles and is one of the
industrial center of the country.
</P>
<P>
To allay the fear that has been mounting among the people, the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which oversees the
production and sales of oil has stopped further distribution of
the strange and poisonous fuel imported from an unnamed Western
country.
</P>
<P>
The Pipeline and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a NNPC
subsidiary in charge of marketing oil products, has also received
similar order from the military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Apologizing to Nigerians over the toxic fuel supplied, PPMC
accused some company officials and inspectors of failing to
screen incoming products carefully.
</P>
<P>
The sole national oil products marketer announced on Friday
that the problem had been contained and assured to "continue to
offer the best".
</P>
<P>
FEPA also expressed confidence that the odor would soon be a
thing of the past, saying that the assurance was based on the
detailed scientific analysis of several samples of the product.
</P>
<P>
The crisis seems to be over soon, but Joseph thought
differently.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when I can recover," he said, pointing to a dark
red rash at the left corner of his mouth, which he claimed to be
the result of taking in too much of the waste air.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time," he asserted.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- With 100 beauties parading in
colorful pan-African costumes before thousands of jubilant
viewers in downtown, Kenya's capital Nairobi today began to
celebrate its 100 years of existence as a pioneer city in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The models, led by Emma Too, one of top eastern African
winners in recent "Face of Africa" pageant, passed the heart of
the city elegantly and leisurely one after another, accompanied
by hundreds of drummers, acrobats and entertainers.
</P>
<P>
To add color and pomp to the festivity were the country's
famous athletes, choirs and dance troupes. Playing music at the
head of the procession was the administration police band which
was followed by classic and vintage vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Besides the elaborate street festival under the title of "Best
of Africa," the main celebrations also included the unveiling of
a grand plan to beautify and refurbish the city's image, which
calls "For a Cleaner and Greener Nairobi".
</P>
<P>
The ancient one-storey District Commissioner's office, which
was built in 1913 and now one of the oldest buildings in the
capital city, was officially handed over to the National Museum
of Kenya during the celebrations. It will be renovated to be a
national monument, a local source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The city, now home to more than two million people, came into
being in 1897, on the day when the railway line from Mombasa in
the Indian Ocean leading to the inland of Uganda reached the
plains around a large swamp.
</P>
<P>
The swamp, called Nairobi, Maasai language for "land of cold
waters," is today the ground on which the so-called Green City in
the Sun is built.

between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People's Repubic
of China exactly 25 years ago as "an event of historical
significance", and said that further development of the bilateral
relations has "an excellent outlook."
</P>
<P>
In a statement made today to the media, Kinkel described China
as "a partner of greatest importance for Germany".
</P>

Noting that Germany is currently the biggest trade partner of
China in Europe, Kinkel said that Germany has more than 1,500
direct investments in China and an increasing number of German
enterprises are casting their eyes on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"Our economies are complimentary," Kinkel said, adding that the
contacts between Germany and China in fields like science and
technology, education, culture and environmental protection have
also been increasing constantly.
</P>
<P>
"The large number of contacts were and are enormously important
for the mutual understanding," said Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences in social system, history, culture
and values, "the success over the past 25 years has proved that
the further development and deepening of the relations between
Germany and China has an excellent outlook," Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Approves Over 200 Investment Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has approved
207 investment projects worth 368 million U.S. Dollars and at the
same time canceled more than 50 others.
</P>
<P>
Hotel and tourism projects share the bulk of the projects
approved, in an effort to push the development of tourism on the
isles, Zanzibar Investment Promotion Authority (ZIPA) sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 207 approved projects, 113 belong to foreign investors
while 94 belong to local entrepreneurs. Sixteen projects have
been accorded tax exemptions, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The authority has approved 23 agriculture and fisheries
projects worth about 32.3 million US Dollars, 28 commercial and
private projects worth nearly 61.2 million Dollars and 101 hotel
and tourism projects worth some 195.4 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Others are 26 industrial projects (over 25.9 million US
Dollars), 16 tours operation projects (9.1 million Dollars), four
aviation projects (2 million Dollars) and nine marine
transportation projects (42.1 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Zanzibar government and the EADC
company with its headquarters in Cyprus will launch 39 projects
in the scenic Nungwi peninsular in north Unguja region. The
government has 26 percent shares in EADC.
</P>
<P>
The project includes construction of hotels, golf courses, a
university, hospitals, factories and schools to cover only two
percent of the total peninsular area.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring villages would be benefited from the construction
of modern houses, modern farms to be run by the villagers
themselves and the provision of fishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has canceled more than 50 investment
projects for failing to comply with the laid down conditions
which stipulate that an investor should start business within
nine months after project approval.
</P>
<P>
Investors are also required to submit progress report every
three months including accounting records.

AMMAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official today denied the existence of any Israeli intelligence
office in the kingdom, Jordan`s official news agency, Petra,
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe told the press after a regular cabinet meeting that "there
is no specific office named Mossad (Israel`s intelligence
service) in Jordan" and "what happens in the Israeli Embassy in
Jordan is the embassy business."
</P>
<P>
All the staff members of any foreign diplomatic office in the
kingdom had their registration in the Jordanian government and
it could be ensured that there was no Israeli intelligence
office in Jordan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in response to a question
from the press that the Mossad possibly had its office here
bacause two of its agents carried out an assassination attempt
against Khaled Mashaal, a leader of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) on September 25.

Jordan released the two Mossad agents, who were caught by the

Jordan did not want to interfere in the affairs of other

own affairs either, he added.

Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is
one of the only two Arab countries that conceived peace with the

AMMAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official today denied the existence of any Israeli intelligence
office in the kingdom, Jordan`s official news agency, Petra,
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe told the press after a regular cabinet meeting that "there
is no specific office named Mossad (Israel`s intelligence
service) in Jordan" and "what happens in the Israeli Embassy in
Jordan is the embassy business."
</P>
<P>
All the staff members of any foreign diplomatic office in the
kingdom had their registration in the Jordanian government and
it could be ensured that there was no Israeli intelligence
office in Jordan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in response to a question
from the press that the Mossad possibly had its office here
bacause two of its agents carried out an assassination attempt
against Khaled Mashaal, a leader of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) on September 25.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Become Self-reliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to
improve its degree of self-reliance by combating illiteracy,
poverty and diseases, and taping potential of resources.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the resolutions adopted at a two-day symposium
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, attended by over 70 senior government
officials, opposition political party members, academicians,
businessmen and religious leaders, has set a long-term goal for
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Participants reached a consensus on the need to achieve
greater reliance. They observed that Tanzania has adequate
natural resources which have not been effectively exploited.
</P>
<P>
Sectors like mining, tourism and agro-resources can become
major contributors to the rise of national income and the
creation of job opportunities, they noted.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, to effectively take advantage of the
resources, Tanzania must develop its human resources, provide
conducive macro-economic environment and adopt environmentally
friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
The participants called on people to put emphasis on
developing the national language -- Kiswahili, and taking into
consideration the role of youths and women in the development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Within a quarter of century, Tanzania will eradicate abject
poverty, the symposium was told.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Receive 105 M. Dollars UN Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has received 105
million U.S. dollars from the United Nations Compensation
Commission (UNCC) for claimants who suffered losses during the
Iraqi occupation, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the board chairman of Kuwaiti Public
Authority for the Assessment of Compensation (PAAC) of damages
resulted of the Iraqi invasion Khaled Al-Modhaf in a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 105 million U.S. dollars designed to cover
the second batch of categories A and C claims is out of a total
569 million U. S. dollars compensation funds set aside from the
Iraqi oil-for-food formula exports revenues.
</P>
<P>
He added that 224,841 claimants, among them 42,148 Kuwaitis,
would be benefited from the compensation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait received the first batch of compensation money, about
123 million U.S. dollars, from the UNCC for its categories A
and C claimants at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The category A concerns people who left Kuwait during the
seven-month Iraqi occupation while category C concerns personal
damages up to maximum 100,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of category A amounts to 17,149 claims with a
value of around 43 million U.S. dollars while the number of
claims of category C stands at 24,999 with a value of some 62
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sum, which represent 18.5 percent of the total amount for
Kuwaiti A and C claims, would be transferred to the accounts of
every claimant in a matter of few weeks, Al-Modhaf said.
</P>
<P>
The money was obtained following Iraq started selling oil
under the U.N. 1111 resolution, an amended version of the
original 986 resolution, known as the oil-for-food formula,
which allowed it to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil for humanitarian purpose every six months.
</P>
<P>
With this sum, Iraq has provided about 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars to the U.N. compensation fund under the oil-for-food
formula.
</P>
<P>
Al-Modhaf hoped Iraq would continue its compliance with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions topped by 986 in a drive to
secure the payment of compensation of the third batch of
categories A and C which stand at 68,739 claims valued at
170 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the Iraqi oil sales proceeds was paid for
the compensation fund run by the Geneva-based Compensation
Commission which are in turn paid to some Kuwaiti and foreign
claimants.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 men and women from 78 countries are
demanding a total of 3.2 billion dollars in payments stemming
mainly from lost wages and injures.
</P>
<P>
As to the whole compensation demands, Kuwait alone has
filed claims totaling 130 billion U.S. dollars including the
costs of extinguishing oil well fires that had been set by
Iraqi troops before a U.S. led military coalition chased them
out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Corporations from around the world are seeking another 80
billion U.S. dollars in compensation besides the Kuwaiti claims.
</P>
<P>
So far most payments of compensation for the other
categories have been approved by Kuwaiti PAAC except for the
category concerning losses caused by burning oil wells which
were estimated at some 610 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An UN Special Commission unanimously decided last December
to compensate Kuwait for the losses incurred by the burning
of the oil wells.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Drivers Rush for Registration Before Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October (Xinhua) -- Thousands of car drivers rush to
the registry department in Sidon, south Lebanon, every day since
the government proposed between three and ten-fold increase in
registration fees last week.
</P>
<P>
The fee increase in car registration is part of the Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri's 800 million U.S. dollars emergency
fund-raising plan to finance specific development and
refugee-repatriation programs, and improve next year's revenue as
well.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star today quoted one of the queuing motorists in
Sidon as saying that "the waiting game is hard, especially when
you know that if you miss out the test this year, you would have
to pay the fee next year which is more than the average motorists
can afford."
</P>
<P>
While police struggled to cope with the 1.5-kilometer queue,
the head of the motor registration branch in Sidon, said that
his office usually handles about 150 applications daily at this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
"We have had to deal with at least 500 since motorists
started panicking about next year's registry fees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another motorist said, "If I get through, I pay 200,000
Lebanese Pounds (about 130 U.S. dollars). But If I wait, it might
cost me more than 1 million Pounds in car registry fees."
</P>
<P>
"This reminds me of the bad old days when we used to lined up
for fuel at petrol stations during the war," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's proposal, which has evoked much controversy across
the country, has not been approved and is under debate in the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> W. African FMs End Meeting on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- West African foreign ministers
today ended their meeting on Sierra Leone with a communique
issued in the capital Abuja today, saying they welcome the
sanctions enforced by the U.N. Security Council on Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Cote
d'Ivoire have been meeting for the past two days over the
restoration of the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
They are mandated by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to form the committee of five on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The ministers issued the communique after meeting Sierra
Leone's rebel leader Foday Sankoh who has been detained in
Nigeria since March this year, the British Broadcasting
Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was read by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi, said the ministers were glad at the sanctions announced by
United Nations Security Council against the military junta in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But details are yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting with Sankoh is seen by observers as a
positive move toward an early resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The junta has been calling for the inclusion of Sankoh in the
negotiation to settle the crisis since the coup. The demand,
however, was rejected by both ECOWAS and ousted President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was the former leader of ex-rebel group Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) which had fought against successive
governments in Sierra Leone since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the May coup, the junta, led by Major Johnny
Paul Koroma, invited RUF to the capital Freetown from their bases
in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 RUF fighters are reportedly allied with the army
of the junta, while Koroma has appointed Sankoh as his deputy
head of state of Sierra Leone despite his absence.
</P>
<P>
With the meeting between the committee of five and Sankoh,
dialogue with the junta to relinquish power to Kabbah is expected
to be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has also expressed willingness to re-open the talks
which was broken down in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, in July when the
junta announced it will stay on until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers's meeting was also attended by
representatives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
the United Nations as well as an aide of President Kabbah.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Qatar and France will hold
joint naval mock battles off the coast of Qatar, the Qatari
official news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises will be launched soon and it will last
six weeks, the news agency quoted officials from the Qatari
Navy as saying.
</P>
<P>
A group of warships from "Comandos," a French Navy's fleet,
have arrived Doha, capital of Qatar, to join the exercises, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time for "Comandos" to visit Qatar since
its two-month deployment last year in the Gulf island state.
</P>
<P>
The news agency gave no further details about the
Qatari-French manoeuvre, but informed sources here said it would
most likely follow a two-week joint naval exercises currently
held by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC war games, dubbed "Solidarity-5," started last
Saturday. It came after Iran bombed two Iranian rebel bases
inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that Iran's air raids violated the
Western allies' no-fly zone over southern Iraq and it warned
further violations will invite U.S. retaliations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- South African police and
army today cordoned off Richmond, a town 75 kilometers west of
Durban, to prevent new violence, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 people have been killed in the past week after
violence resumed in the Kwazulu-Natal region.
</P>
<P>
Police and the National Defense Force set up road blocks on
all the routes in and out of Richmond to prevent suspicious
people from entering the area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Francois Schreuder said by late today there had
been no reports of gunfire and that the area was quiet.
</P>
<P>
The funerals of four of the victims of last week's attacks
took place today without any incidents and were attended by a
crowd of about 500 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Funerals for the two United Democratic Movement supporters who
were killed last Sunday night will be held this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But Shreuder said the atmosphere in the area remained tense.
</P>
<P>
Armed attacks re-erupted last Saturday after a period of
relative peace in the area, where there had been frequent clashes
between supporters of the African National Congress (ANC) and the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal is the only province governed by the IFP.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of new attacks since last Saturday caused panic
among local residents. Hundreds of people, for fear of home
raids, have left their houses to search for safer places to stay.
</P>
<P>
However, progress has been made in the investigations into the
attacks, SAPA said. Two men were arrested and an R5 rifle and a
7.65-mm-caliber pistol, which may be linked to the incidents,
were recovered.
</P>
<P>
The firearms are to be sent for ballistic tests to establish
whether they match cartridges found at the scenes of last week's
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The arrests and recovery of firearms could lead investigators
closer to who is behind the latest spate of attacks which police
and the army believe is being orchestrated from outside the area,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five people have been killed in the area since May this
year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes US Stance on Iranian Outlawed Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed the latest
stance by the United States to designate the anti-government
Mujahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran (MKO) as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
the U.S. stance on the MKO, which is based inside the Iraqi
territory, is based on fact, Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman urged the United States to "take legal
action against the terrorist group and not to pay lip services
to this end."
</P>
<P>
"We should wait and see whether the U.S. will take legal
action to deal with the group and in general, what is their
reaction to the state-sponsored terrorism of the Zionist
regime," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi voiced Iran's readiness to cooperate with the world
community to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahedeen Khalq Organization was founded in 1965. Its
forces are estimated at 20,000 to 50,000. Iran's Air Force
bombed two MKO bases late last month.
</P>
<P>
The United States Wednesday designated 30 groups as
foreign terrorist organizations, making it illegal to provide
funds for them and denying their representatives U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, those targeted include the anti-Iran
Mujahedeen Khalq Organization.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. bombers staged a
mock strike against targets in a area northwest of Kuwait city
today in a fresh military action to show Washington's stand
alongside with Kuwait against any possible outside threat.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military commander based in the Gulf General Mike
Lashk said the exercise was a clear message to Iraq that
the U.S. was standing on the side of its allies in the
Gulf region in regard of implementing international resolutions
and enforcing the no-fly zones in Iraq, according to Kuwait
News Agency (KUNA) reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military commander indicated that the exercise also
constituted an example of the U.S. military capacity of rapid
intervention to repulse any outside aggression as the B-1
bombers, which carried out the mock strike, can reach any location
in the world within hours.
</P>
<P>
KUNA did not say from where the U.S. bombers took off.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KUNA said another U.S. military commander named
Robert Otri also asserted the U.S. capacity to intervene
militarily in the region without depending on the U.S. aircraft
carriers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed in 1992 a defense accord with the U.S. following
the Gulf War to boost bilateral cooperation in the military
field and hold joint military exercises.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinian-Jordanian Relations Are Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that
the Palestinian-Jordanian relations are brotherly and as good as
always, the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks after his telephone conversation with
Jordanian King Hussein. The two leaders exchanged views on a
wide-range of issues including the Middle East peace process and
the bilateral relations during the conversation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Hussein and himself are of the same opinion
that "our bilateral relations are as good as always and
brotherly" and there was no problem in the relations.
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said that during his Wednesday's close-door
address in Ramallah to the legislative Palestinian Council,
Arafat launched an unprecedented attack on Hussein over his
conduct in the Khaled Mashaal affair and the release of Hamas
founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, accusing Jordan of forming an
alliance with Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) against the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Mashaal, one of the Hamas leaders in Jordan, was attacked last
month in Amman by two Israeli agents. This failed assassination
attempt has forced Israel to release Yassin and some other
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the two Israeli agents as
requested by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
During today's conversation, Arafat also informed Hussein the
recent development of the prepartions for the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks and asked Hussein to help bring the stalled peace
process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli troops and police lifted at the sunset
today the "extra closure" of the Palestinian territories imposed
Friday because of the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, during
which the Jews fast and pray for forgiveness until sundown
today.

<HEADLINE> US Coordinator on Cyprus Arrives in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department's new
coordinator on Cyprus issue Thomas Miller arrived here today on a
shuttle mission for the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival, Miller said that
his Ankara tour aims to continue the Cyprus peace process
following New York and Switzerland talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department official avoided clarifying whether
U.S. Special Envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke would also come to
Ankara as scheduled. And he declined to say whether he came to
Ankara with any specified proposal.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports had said that Holbrooke, accompanied by
Thomas Miller, will pay his first visit to Turkey Sunday since
his appointment to mediate the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia said that Holbrooke might arrive here tonight
without deliberating.
</P>
<P>
Ankara will use the visit of U.S. officials to express its
position and to hear Washington's views over the reconciliation
process on the issue, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained two rival parts, Turkish-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-controlled south, since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island
following an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have made
decades of efforts to reunite the two communities, but no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash held two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct
talks in the United States and Switzerland in July and August,
failing to strike any agreements.
</P>
<P>
At present, both Greece and Turkey station troops on the
small island state in the eastern Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Warns Against Israeli Murder Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian interior minister today
lashed out at Israel's assassination attempt in the country and
vowed this would never be allowed to happen again.
</P>
<P>
Nathir Rashid told the press that the Jordanian government
would not allow anyone to bypass the kingdom's security. Jordan's
national security was uncompromising, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two agents of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad disguised
as Canadian tourists attacked Khaled Mashaal, political leader of
the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, outside his office in Amman
on September 25.
</P>
<P>
However, they were then chased by Mashaal's bodyguards and
finally fell into the hands of Jordanian police. Jordan's King
Hussein secured an antidote from Israel to the poison the Mossad
agents injected into Mashaal, and swapped the two agents for
dozens of Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli assassination attempt was an unacceptable act and
if it was repeated, the other party (Israel) would pay dearly, the
minister warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jordanian government dealt with the incident in the
maximum degree of frankness, firmness and seriousness.
</P>
<P>
Israel was forced to release on October 1 Shiekh Ahmad Yassin,
the ailing Hamas founder who had served eight years of a life
sentence in Israeli prison. He was arrested for ordering
anti-Israel attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yassin established Hamas in 1987 in the Gaza Strip to fight for
the creation of an Islamic state in Palestine including Israel and
the occupied territories. The movement has been opposed to the
Oslo peace process and claimed responsibility for a series of car
bombings as well as the recent suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a major player in the Middle East peace process, signed
peace with Israel in 1994 and is said to be Jewish state's only
friend in the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks UN Chief to Ensure Approval of Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq called on U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to intervene to ensure a prompt approval of
the contracts signed by Iraq with other countries.
</P>
<P>
In a message forwarded by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf to the U.N. chief and released by the Iraq News
Agency today, al-Sahhaf said that there are still 43 contracts
suspended by the U.N. Sanctions Committee on account of the
U.S. "unjustifiable" stand, and 36 other contracts canceled for
the same reason.
</P>
<P>
He said that some contracts submitted by Iraq to the committee
more than eight months ago have not been considered yet, including
a contract for the purchase of spare parts and requisites for the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister called on Kofi Annan to investigate
the reasons for failing to consider the contracts. He complained
that there is one party that determines the fate of the
contracts submitted by Iraq to the U.N. according to its own
political aims.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, he refers to the U.S. as Iraq has repeated accused
the U.S. of obstructing the approval of its contracts with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf appealed to Annan to put an end to this state of
affairs so that the second phase of the oil-for-food deal can be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was under U.N. sanctions following its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. It was allowed to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over a six month period to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods in line with the oil-for-food deal launched
last December. The U.N. renewed another six month period of the
deal on June 4.

PARIS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic heavyweight bronze
medalist Harry van Barneveld failed to reach the pool final of the
men's open at the judo world championships after losting a
disputing bout to Yoshiharu Makishi of Japan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Contest between Van Barneveld and Makishi was set to be a draw,
but the Belgian was penalised for an overly-defensive stance that
ended the bout for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there had also been a dispute when Myong Chang Kang of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was deemed the loser in
his bantamweight bout with Georg Revazishvili of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Myong was bound to score an ippon by throwing his rival to the
mat, but referee judged the move as taking place outside the mat.
</P>
<P>
The decision gave the Georgian the winner of the bout and
throwed the crowd into booing and whistling as the video replay
showed Myong had made a legitimate score.
</P>
<P>
Myong's delegation lodged an angry protest but the referee kept
upon the decision.

Many important philosophic and scientific ideas and theories

laid the foundation of traditional Chinese culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is to conduct its first
national general census after U.N. embargo on Iraq more than 7
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's High General Census Committee headed by Mr Ezzat
Ibrahim, Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command
Council, has completed the final preparations for the census due
to be conducted on October 16 this year, Iraq News Agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
This year's census is distinguished from the former ones by
the fact that it will include -- in addition to population --
property estate with all its kinds, crops, the social status of
Iraqis and the distribution of man power according to age, the
agency added.
</P>
<P>
This year's census will also include all Iraqis, even those
who are residing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Iraq's High General Census Committee has issued a
statement forbidding traffic and travel completely from 4:00
a.m. up to 8:00 p.m. local time on the day of census all over Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Information Technology in Tibetan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China has made a breakthrough in
information technology to use Tibetan, a language difficult to
define for software programmers, and this paves the way for
millions of Tibetan people to enter the information highway.
</P>
<P>
The code for information exchange in Tibetan, a unified version
proposed by Tibetan Autonomous Region, has been considered as an
international standard by the UNICODE.
</P>
<P>
The code will help protect local culture and promote economic
and social progress in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and enable
massive development of Tibetan softwares, a Tibetan official in
charge of the edition of the code said.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan is also the first language of minority Chinese that has
been encoded according to international standards.
</P>
<P>
The code includes all the characters of modern Tibetan and 168
characters of ancient Tibetan frequently used.
</P>
<P>
It is said that nearly 95 percent of the people living in Tibet
Autonomous Region communicate with each other in Tibetan, and
there are still some more Tibetan-speakers in Qinghai, Sichuan,
Gansu and Yunnan Provinces, and South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that there is a great potential to be tapped in
development of Tibetan softwares at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet University has started research work for Tibetan
platforms running under Dos and Windows, which are to be finished
within the coming one or two years.
</P>
<P>
The university has also set up a computer network that works in
Tibetan in its campus.

<HEADLINE> New Complex Law May Impede Ukrainian Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A new value-added law, long
expected by the Ukrainian government to produce 40 percent of
annual state revenue, is so complex that it may cause problems for
enterprises, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Accountants with experience of 15 years can barely understand
some clauses of this law," said Viacheslav Bykovets,
vice-president of the Union of Small-Medium and Privatized
Businesses.
</P>
<P>
The organization is holding training seminars on the new law
for accountants across the country.
</P>
<P>
The diction and grammar of Ukrainian laws, particularly those
on tax and accounting, are so complicated that they are often
misunderstood and thus hamper the influx of badly-needed foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are deeply concerned about these laws.
</P>
<P>
The business community is short of professional accountants.
Some teachers and doctors flood into this profession for a high
pay, which adds to the difficulty of proper implementation of the
complex laws.

BONN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina Hingis
claimed the Filderstadt Open Sunday after she crushed American
Lisa Raymond in straight sets in Filderstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
It was Hingis' second title in the Open after winning her first
WTA tournament in Filderstadt last year.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Hingis took just 66 minutes to beat unseeded Raymond
6-4, 6-2 in the final, reports said reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Hingis broke Raymond in the fifth game of the
first set to go 3-2 up. She was leading 5-4 when Raymond asked for
a three-minute break to receive treatment on her right thigh,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
When she returned, Hingis served for the set, wrapping it up
with a raging smash on set point.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old American, ranked 23rd in the world, dropped her
serve in the third game and found herself 4-0 down only 11 minutes
into the second set.
</P>
<P>
She tried to bow out in style, fighting back to make it 5-2 and
saving three match points before hitting a return long on the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
"This is a special place for me," Hingis was quoted as
saying. "I was looking forward to coming here again and it was
fantastic, just like last year."

<HEADLINE> PNA: Talks Test Israeli Intentions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The current Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations on outstanding issues of the transitional accord will
test Israel's good faith to its earlier commitments, said a senior
advisor to the Palestinian National Authority president.
</P>
<P>
In an interview today with Voice of Arab radio over the phone
from Gaza, Nabil Abu Redinah stressed that the coming ten days
will be decisive for the Palestinian-Israeli peace march.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross is to return
to the region this week to follow up the low-level
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that resumed since October 6.
</P>
<P>
But a planned meeting in Washington on Monday between Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and PLO Executive Committee Secretary
General Mahmoud Abbas was postponed until a later date, Redinah
said.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region last Monday to oversee the talks on
implementing peace agreements signed by Israel's former Labor
government but effectively suspended by the present Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Israel should release Palestinian
prisoners and permit the opening of an airport and a harbor in
Gaza and a passage between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's real commitment to peace was questioned in the
wake of the botched Israeli bid to kill Hamas official Khaled
Mashaal in Amman on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Concluding, he called upon the U.S. to put pressure on the
current Israeli government to honor its commitments to the
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations broke down in March when Israel began building
a new Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem and the crisis
deepened dramatically following a string of suicide bombings in
Jerusalem over the past 10 weeks by the Islamic group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The key issues facing the two sides are Israeli demands for a
harsh Palestinian crackdown on Hamas and other violent groups and
Palestinian insistence that Israel freeze construction of Jewish
housing in disputed areas and carry out promised troop withdrawals
from the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has been asked to back a bid to stop an American
plutonium-laden rocket from passing over southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Cassini space probe, due to be launched from Cape
Canaveral in Florida of the United States tomorrow, has a 32
kilogram plutonium fuel payload to power its seven year journey
to Venus and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
Local media today quoted opponents of Cassini as saying it
posed a threat to millions of lives because if it burns up in the
atmosphere, it could start raining plutonium.
</P>
<P>
The opponents believe Mandela is "their last chance" to stop
the launch.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Cassini campaigner Francis Boyle said Mandela had been
approached to back a petition to the International Court of
Justice in Hague calling for its suspension.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of a head of state or foreign minister is
required for a petition to the court.
</P>
<P>
A senior South African government official confirmed
discussion on the matter.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Gets Conditions for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has received definite answer from neighboring west African
countries for resuming talks aimed at resolving the crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and
Cote d'Ivoire ended a two-day meeting on Saturday in the Nigerian
capital Abuja with three conditions for the resumption.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting requested that
representatives of the illegal regime led by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma must have requisite mandate to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also demanded that the regime must negotiate in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the negotiations should strictly be within the
mandate of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
as stipulated in the Conakry final communique and as endorsed by
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who constitute the ECOWAS Committee of Five on
Sierra Leone, also agreed that the committee chairman, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, should make appropriate arrangements
towards the resumption of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS decision made in Conakry, capital of Guinea, in
June this year set a three-stage strategy -- dialogue, sanctions
and the use of force, aimed at restoring the ousted civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
Talks between ECOWAS and the junta broke down in its second
session in July in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, after Koroma announced
his regime would not hand over until 2001.
</P>
<P>
While ECOWAS were enforcing an economic embargo, the Security
Council last Wednesday ordered a sanction against the country.
</P>
<P>
The council in a resolution endosed the ECOWAS position for
early reinstatement of the legitimate government of Kabbah,
return of peace and security to Sierra Leone and resolution of
the issue of refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting international pressure, the junta has written
several letters indicating willingness to resume negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The letters, according to Ghanaian Foreign Minister Victor
Bgeho, must only dwell on modalities for "bringing the illegal
regime to an end...as we do not even have the mandate to
negotiate their continuous stay".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has in recent times also rebuffed attempts to dialogue
with envoys from Koroma, insisting only to deal with the coupists
on the platform of the community.

<HEADLINE> Gustafsson Wins His First Title in Heineken Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Magnus Gustafsson won
his first title this year on Sunday when he beat German Nicolas
Kiefer in the final of the Heineken Open.
</P>
<P>
The clash between the oldest and youngest title winners this
year took more than two hours before Gustafsson, 30, won 4-6, 6-3,
6-3 over Kiefer, who is ten years younger.
</P>
<P>
The seventh seed Gustafsson, beaten in both finals of the
Beijing Open and San Marino Open, marched back to the service line
to receive serve and proceeded to break the eighth-seeded Kiefer,
who won his first title in Toulouse, France, two weeks ago, four
times in a row.
</P>
<P>
Each took a set to make even before Gustafsson led 3-0 in the
third set, but Kiefer soon leveled by a few good volleys.
</P>
<P>
The German, after that, apparently was not concentrated in the
match and lost soon.

<HEADLINE> Population Conference Being Held In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said today
that China must tackle the population problem for sustainable
growth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 23rd International Union
for the Scientific Study of Population's General Population
Conference today, he said that China has the world's largest
population, and has given prominence to dealing with the
relationship between economic development, population, resources,
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its family planning policy, he pointed out, China
brought its population growth rate down from 26 per 1,000 in 1970
to 10.42 per 1,000 in 1996. Its population would have been 300
million larger if this had not been done, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This has not only eased pressures on China's economic and
social development, but also contributed to world population
control," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China must tackle the difficult job of
providing sufficient food and clothing for the 50 million people
still living in poverty. It must also deal with the improvement of
the population quality, employment, the aging question, poverty in
urban and rural areas, medical and health care, and social
security.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed his appreciation for the IUSSP's efforts in
promoting scientific population studies and international
co-operation and exchanges, as well as getting the UN and
governments to formulate and implement population policies.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 population scientists and Chinese government
officials attended the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> S. African Post Office to Punish Staff Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Numerous post office
staff are facing criminal charges or are in jail after more than
3.7 million Rand (800,000 U.S. dollar) worth of mail and packages
were stolen or defrauded in the last 18 months, the Sunday Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, The Citizen, quoted Post and
Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo as saying at the end of
September that as much as 8.67 million Rand (1.8 million dollar)
worth of mail and packages were stolen or tampered with last
year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest amount -- one million Rand (210,000 U.S. dollars)
-- was stolen by a manager at the Port Edward post office in
Kwazulu-Natal. He is now serving a 10-year jail term, Sunday
Times said.
</P>
<P>
Internal surveillance cameras at Witspos, Johannesburg, the
country's biggest depot, showed workers opening damaged mail,
pocketing letters and discussing whether or not to steal certain
packages.
</P>
<P>
The South African post office says it has dismissed 115
employees in the past six months for theft and most of them will
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Staff have been dismissed for filching as little as 30 Rand
after violating mail or stealing tellers' cash and postal orders.
</P>
<P>
To curb mail violation, a special internal investigation unit
was set up by a former policeman to monitor staff and track mail.
An anti-crime awareness campaign was also initiated with trade
unions.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo admitted that mail violation was a serious problem.
Plans to eradicate violation and theft were launched a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He asked trade unions to cooperate during the crackdown,
saying "They are crucial to the campaign's success because the
postal service is labor intensive. We expect them to take a hard
line against their own members."
</P>
<P>
"If you violate the mail, you go to jail, the unions have
accepted that," noted Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
The shocking extent of mail violation and theft within the
post office was revealed in a documentary screened on television
last Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In the documentary, internal investigators said trade unions
were interfering with efforts to combat crime and had, for
example, insisted on the removal of security personnel from
Witspos.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions were angry about the screening of the documentary
because they felt that they were being blamed.

An UMA official told Xinhua that the fair attracted between
20,000 and 30,000 visitors daily during the fair.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last fair, the infrastructure in the show ground
has been much improved. UMA's new conference building was
completed on the eve of the opening of the fair. Most roads in
the main site of the show ground is covered with tar concrete.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign exhibitors told Xinhua that the fair has been a
success.

<HEADLINE> IBM Looking for Greater Development in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- IBM China's Chairman Henry Chow
says that his company took only five years to do what IBM took 15
or 20 years to do in other countries, but that this is still not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Chow's remarks came in a recent interview with Xinhua, where he
explained that, since IBM established its Chinese branch in
Beijing in 1992, it has done three things: establish a sales
network of 1,500 people, set up a production base in Shenzhen, and
establish a research center in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
IBM views China as one of its most important computer markets
and as "the most fruitful emerging market". IBM has been benefited
from China's stable policies and its rapidly developing economy,
which have given IBM a good environment to develop, Chow said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the improving Sino-US relations will
encourage American business people with investments in China to
put their minds to increasing their connection with China.
</P>
<P>
IBM maintained a 40 percent rise in the production and sales of
PC, software, and hardware in the first six months of 1997, and
had the biggest share of China's PC market.
</P>
<P>
To keep growing, IBM has established three production ventures
in Shenzhen: Great Wall International Company, the biggest PC
manufacturer of China's foreign-funded enterprises; Changke,
producing electronic boards; and the Hailiang Memory Company,
which Chow believes will be the biggest Chinese magnetic head
business pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
IBM established its China Research Center in Beijing in 1995 as
one of seven labs in the world. The center studies Chinese-market
products and brought out the "Chinese Phonetics Distinguishing
System" in August, the product of 26 years of research at IBM's
labs and Chinese wisdom, according to Chow.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for the Chinese Government policy
of encouraging investment in central and western China, and IBM
opened offices in Chengdu, Xi'an and Wuhan last year to get ahead
of competitors, Chow says.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israeli Army Chief's Turkey Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- In a move to boost the
strategic cooperation with Turkey, Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon
Lipkin Shahak is leaving tonight for Ankara on a visit to discuss
furthering military ties.
</P>
<P>
A key topic on the agenda for Shahak's two-day visit is the
controversial Israel-Turkey-U.S. joint naval maneuvers on the
Mediterranean sea scheduled for January next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shahak will discuss reciprocal naval visits,
mutual cooperation in defense industry projects, and an exchange
of fighter pilots, English daily Jerusalem Post today quoted a
Turkish military official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Shahak will lobby Turkey to introduce the
Israeli-made Merkava III tanks to replace the aging M-60s in
service. The two sides will also likely discuss issues such as the
joint production of Israel's Popeye 2 air-to-air missile, and
Israel's possible refit of Turkey's Air Force F-5 fleet.
</P>
<P>
As a main part of the ongoing Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation, Israel is currently engaged in a
650-million-U.S. dollar deal to upgrade 54 Turkish F-4 Phantom
jets.
</P>
<P>
Shahak's visit is another sign of the booming cooperation in
the military field between the two countries, which has aroused
strong criticism and anxiety among Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral military cooperation was initialed in February
last year, when the two countries signed a strategic cooperation
deal in which Turkey allowed Israeli pilots to train in its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, including Israel's arch enemies in the region
Syria, Iran and Iraq, were extremely critical of the military
deal. The Israeli-Turkish deal was believed aimed primarily at
Syria, which is at odds with both Israel and Turkey over
territorial disputes. MORE

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Declares Opening of National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
declared on Sunday the opening of the Eighth National Games, the
last and biggest sports extravaganza of the century held in China.
</P>
<P>
The Games was being held at the moment right after the
successful 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening ceremony were Jiang Zemin, also general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Li Tieying, state
councilor and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central

Committee, was invited by the Chinese Olympic Committee and was
joined by other officials from the international sports
organizations at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR makes its debut in the National Games after China
re-exercised its sovereignty over the land on July 1, sending in a
257-member delegation with 168 athletes to vie for medals in 20
sports.
</P>
<P>
The Games which runs from October 12 to 24, features the
largest number of 46 delegations from 31 provinces, autonomous
regions, municipalities, HKSAR, the People's Liberation Army, and
13 professional associations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,647 athletes will vie for the 319 golds on stake
in 28 sports, with the Chinese martial arts being the lone
non-Olympic discipline in the Games, which attracts some 20,000
participants including coaches, referees, judges and visitors.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, chairman of the Games' Organizing Committee and also
minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, said
the quadrennial games will further promote the nation-wide Fitness
Program, help carry out the Olympic-oriented campaign under the
spirits of the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai and executive chairman of the
Organizing Committee, said the hosts have spared no efforts in the
past four years to ensure the success of the Games as all the
citizens dedicated themselves to serving for the glory.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has spent 5.6 billion yuans (about 700 million U.S.
dollars) in building stadiums and other sports facilities and
refurbishing the existing ones as the games requests 82
competition and training venues.

yachting, women's volleyball, beach volleyball, judo, rhythmic
gymnastics, diving, marathon as well as the team events in

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israeli Army Chief's Turkey Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The burgeoning Israeli-Turkish military cooperation continued
developing in a relatively smooth way even after the access to
power last year by Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare party, which
stepped down in June this year to be replaced by the pro-Western
Motherland Party.
</P>
<P>
The past year witnessed a series of important visits to Israel
by Turkish military heads, including Chief of Staff Hakki
Karadayi in February, which further consolidated the strategic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The latest Arab anger centered on the joint naval maneuvers
scheduled for January. The exercises have already been postponed
twice due to the controversy surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, the military cooperation with Turkey has expanded
its military maneuvering space and strengthened its deterrent
capability against Syria, which is believed as Israel's only
immediate military threat due to the unresolved territorial
dispute over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Through the military cooperation with Turkey, Israel also
benefits economically from Turkey's military modernization
campaign by providing advanced military technologies and services
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) since 1952, has vital interests in promoting
military cooperation with Israel not only for countering Syria,
but also for obtaining Israel's high-tech help in its ambitious
project to modernize its big army.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains the largest standing army of any European
alliance member, but it is poorly equipped and has primarily an
infantry force. It has launched a modernization program aimed at
reducing the 500,000-member force to 350,000 over a 10-year
period and at introducing a new tank and assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to allow Ankara to produce its advanced
Merkava III tanks, and is a key contender with five other
producers, including the U.S., France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Israel has allowed another country
to either purchase or build its heavy battle tank, considered to
be one of the finest and best protected in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey also wants to replace 500,000 assault rifles
and the Israeli-made Falil is on the short list.

Hangzhou, capital of China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
The show of the film will mark the 100th anniversary of the

<HEADLINE> 92 Countries, Organizations Invited to Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has invited 92
countries and organizations to attend the controversial Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference scheduled for November
16 to 18 in the Qatari capital of Doha, a senior Qatari official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The invitations have been sent out since last week, the Qatari
News Agency (QNA) quoted Mohammed Ismail, president of the
organizing committee of the Doha conference as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qatar expects some 2,900 foreign participants for the
conference, among them 800 government delegates, 800 businessmen,
300 representatives of international and regional organizations,
500 journalists, as well as 500 people from the host country, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Doha said that foreign ministers of Middle East,
African and European countries have been invited to attend the
conference which was boycotted by some Arab countries due to an
expected Israeli participation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will send its Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
the meeting while Israel will be represented by Foreign Minister
David Levy, they added.
</P>
<P>
The conference is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the industrialized world. It is the
fourth since it was launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Though Qatar remained firm on hosting the conference as
scheduled, it had to downgrade the meeting from a summit to a
ministerial level, saying the current atmosphere is not
"appropriate" to invite heads of states because of the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authority, the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have announced that they
will boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
Most of other Arab countries has not yet officially voiced
their stands, but observers here said that they would most likely
send delegates at low levels.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Economic Fundamentals Remain Sound: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' macro-economic
fundamentals remain sound despite the recent attacks on Southeast
Asian currencies, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Fidel Ramos, Singson said that the
firm monetary policy, more flexible and market-oriented foreign
exchange policy, stronger fiscal position, stable and healthy
financial system, and the broad structural reforms are the main
ingredients in the country's robust economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserves remain adequate at around 10.9
billion U.S. dollars which will enable the central bank to
intervene in the currency market if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson also said regional currencies have started to stabilize
and even strengthen after more than three months of general
weakness.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Philippine peso appreciated from Thursday's
34.85 pesos to the dollar to 33.90 pesos against the greenback
while other Southeast Asian currencies also stabilized.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors that helped in the appreciation of the peso
was the freedom regained by the central bank to strategically
intervene in the currency market, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's overall performance, Singson said from nearly
zero growth in 1991, it grew by 1.6 percent in 1992 and further on
by 5.3 percent in 1994 to peak at 6.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the period, the uptrend in GNP (gross national
product) growth was largely buoyed by strong performance in
exports and investments. For the first six months of 1997, real
GNP grew by 5.9 percent," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
From a double-digit level of 18.7 percent in 1991, he said,
inflation rate in the country came down to 8.9 percent in 1992 and
has remained at single-digit levels for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
"For the first nine months of 1997, inflation averaged 4.7
percent, even below the 6-7 percent target for the year. Prudent
monetary management, hand in hand with favorable fiscal
performance, enabled the economy to proceed along the path of
non-inflationary growth," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the global slowdown in exports, he said, the
Philippines' exports grew by 18 percent in 1996 and accelerated to
22 percent during the first seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the weaker peso and high interest rates forced the
government on Friday to scale down its GNP growth target for this
year from 7-8 percent to 5.6-6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also lowered its GDP target for 1997 to a range of 5 to 5.5
percent from 5.9 to 6.3 percent because of the lower-than-expected
economic growth in the first semester of this year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Post Office to Punish Staff Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Numerous post office
staff are facing criminal charges or are in jail after more than
3.7 million Rand (800,000 U.S. dollar) worth of mail and packages
were stolen or defrauded in the last 18 months, the Sunday Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, The Citizen, quoted Post and
Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo as saying at the end of
September that as much as 8.67 million Rand (1.8 million dollar)
worth of mail and packages were stolen or tampered with last
year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest amount -- one million Rand (210,000 U.S. dollars)
-- was stolen by a manager at the Port Edward post office in
Kwazulu-Natal. He is now serving a 10-year jail term, Sunday
Times said.
</P>
<P>
Internal surveillance cameras at Witspos, Johannesburg, the
country's biggest depot, showed workers opening damaged mail,
pocketing letters and discussing whether or not to steal certain
packages.
</P>
<P>
The South African post office says it has dismissed 115
employees in the past six months for theft and most of them will
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Staff have been dismissed for filching as little as 30 Rand
after violating mail or stealing tellers' cash and postal orders.
</P>
<P>
To curb mail violation, a special internal investigation unit
was set up by a former policeman to monitor staff and track mail.
An anti-crime awareness campaign was also initiated with trade
unions.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo admitted that mail violation was a serious problem.
Plans to eradicate violation and theft were launched a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He asked trade unions to cooperate during the crackdown,
saying "They are crucial to the campaign's success because the
postal service is labor intensive. We expect them to take a hard
line against their own members."
</P>
<P>
"If you violate the mail, you go to jail, the unions have
accepted that," noted Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
The shocking extent of mail violation and theft within the
post office was revealed in a documentary screened on television
last Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In the documentary, internal investigators said trade unions
were interfering with efforts to combat crime and had, for
example, insisted on the removal of security personnel from
Witspos.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions were angry about the screening of the documentary
because they felt that they were being blamed.

<HEADLINE> Italian Communist Refoundation Party Ready to Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Party of Communist
Refoundation of Italy (PCRI) was prepared to compromise to return
"the same government and the same leadership" to power, PCRI
General Secretary Fausto Bertinotti said here today.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti told reporters that he had discussed with President
Oscar Scalfaro his proposal for a government with a one-year
program.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to compromise, and we are looking for a serious
commitment in a limited amount of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PCRI had sparked a government crisis Thursday as it refused
to support the Prime Minister Romano Prodi government's 1998
budget, which was designed to facilitate Italy's entry into the
single currency by cutting pensions as well as not stimulating new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The party's hard stance on the matter has led to an
announcement of Prodi's resignation Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in the working week to 35 hours, set by law, would
be one way to "encourage" a compromise between the PCRI and the
government, Bertinotti said.
</P>
<P>
Asked with whom the left-wing party would negotiate the
program, the party leader said, "based on the current state of
affairs, the most foreseeable thing is the government in power."
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's possible to verify (the program) with the same
government and the same leadership," Bertinotti said.

<HEADLINE> Romania in NATO-Joining Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Finally Romania had something
to cheer about between now and 1999 when the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is expected to announce which countries will
be in the second wave of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan country is hosting the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA)
annual session and it is the first time in the 42-year NAA history
that the meeting is held in a non-NATO member country.
</P>
<P>
NAA President William Roth said that the convening of the
session in Bucharest demonstrated NAA's commitment to the NATO
open-door policy on enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Every European country that is in a position to contribute to
the alliance's security and responsibilities is a viable candidate
for the NATO membership, Roth said just before the four-day annual
session went underway on Friday.
</P>
<P>
NAA Secretary General Simon Lunn said that Romania was chosen
to host the meeting in recognition of the progress the country has
made so far for joining the 16-nation military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Romania is fully committed to joining the NATO, Ion Ratiu,
member of the Romanian delegation to the NAA session, told
participants at a meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Romania's integration quest is, at present, bigger than before
the NATO Madrid summit," said Ratiu who cited as evidence that
public opinion polls averaged 90 percent of support for the
country's accession to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Romania, which refused to be drawn into the Warsaw Pact, was
the first in central and eastern Europe to sign up the NATO
Partnership for Peace program in 1994. It has long set up NATO
liaison offices in both its foreign and defense ministries.
</P>
<P>
Economic difficulties, however, proved to undo its quest for
accession invitation at the Madrid summit held last July.
</P>
<P>
But since then, Romania was more in a NATO-driven frenzy
reforming its economy.
</P>
<P>
In August, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea announced
shut-downs of 17 loss-making state-owned enterprises that threw
30,000 people out of work at the beginning of what he described as
a Polish-style economic shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
The Ciorbea government has embarked on an extensive program of
privatization and of restructuring the country's heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister promised to cut the budget deficit from 5.7
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 to 4.5 percent
this year though national economy is expected to contract by about
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite annoying its firm supporter in Madrid, Romania has
started negotiations with the American Bell Helicopter Textron
company for a one-billion-U.S.-dollar, 12-year production program
in Romania of 96 helicopter gunships modeled after the U.S. AH-1W
Super Cobra.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu assured NATO policy
makers that his country is worthy of joining the alliance and
would work hard to secure the membership in the next wave of new
admissions.
</P>
<P>
"We have proceeded with reforms and turned Romania into a
pillar of regional stability," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Romania is keeping close track of the happenings in Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, the three invitees to join the
NATO in Madrid, in their process of accession, with an eye on what
works and what not.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians are confident that sooner or later their country
which borders Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Ukraine and the Black
Sea, will be integrated into the transatlantic alliance for
collective defense.
</P>
<P>
Their confidence was a best showcase when Romanian Chief of the
General Staff Constantin Degeratu said at the beginning of the NAA
annual session that without Romania, there will be an "absent
link" in the NATO security system in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Airlift Overstaying Workers in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has approved the dispatch of a Philippine Air Force (PAF) C-130
transport plane to Saudi Arabia to airlift overstaying Filipino
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the Presidential Office said
that President Ramos acted on the recommendation of the Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), which reported that the
Saudi government set October 16 as the deadline for overstaying
foreign workers to leave the kingdom under an amnesty program.
</P>
<P>
OWWA Administrator Wilhelm D. Soriano told the president that
"overstayers have to avail themselves of the amnesty prior to
(October 16). Otherwise, they face stiff sanctions of prison term
and payment of fine."
</P>
<P>
He said 311 Filipino workers from Riyadh and Jeddah have been
issued plane tickets provided by OWWA and the Department of
Foreign Affairs (DFA) for the trip home.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Philippine mission in Saudi Arabia was
"still expecting 3,000 to 4,00 overstaying Filipino workers" to
return to the Philippines "on commercial flights and through the
usual services of PAF C-130 upon the president's directive."
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum for the president, Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingo Siazon said the penalty to be imposed by the Saudi
government on overstaying expatriates who fail to leave the
kingdom by October 16 is six months in prison or a fine of 10,000
Saudi riyals (2,660 U.S. dollars) or both.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the western region of Saudi Arabia alone, the
number of undocumented Filipino workers ranged from a few hundreds
to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
There are 180,000 Filipino workers in the western region
covering Jeddah, while in Riyadh and the eastern province of Saudi
Arabia, there are 420,000 Filipino workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that 20,000 illegal expatriates from various
countries have already left the kingdom to beat the October 16
deadline.

<HEADLINE> UN Special Group Requested for Sanction on S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- West African countries have
called on the United Nations to establish urgently a contact
group in Sierra Leone for the smooth implementation of sanctions
against the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
They also approved the creation of a safe haven to facilitate
the delivery of relief materials to the country, according to a
communique issued by sub-regional foreign ministers on Saturday
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the UN group has become imperative in
view of the appeal made to the international community by the
Security Council to provide technical and logistical support to
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the
discharge of its responsibilities in restoring democracy in
Sierra Leone, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and
Cote d'Ivoire, who form the ECOWAS Committee of Five on Sierra
Leone, held a two-day meeting to assess the situation in the
country in the wake of the Security Council order last Wednesday
to impose oil, weapon and other sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee, following its worries over the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone due to the activities of
the military junta, agreed to open a window for delivery of
relief materials to the victims.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial committee attributed the deteriorating
condition in Sierra Leone to the "intransigence of the illegal
regime, the absence of security and the gross violation of human
rights by the (Johnny Paul) Koroma regime".
</P>
<P>
The committee also directed ECOWAS secretary and peacekeeping
force chief to establish a technical committee to work out
appropriate modalities for the creation of delivery centers and
the setting up of corridors for bringing in relief items.
</P>
<P>
Noting the upsurge in the influx of refugees into neighboring
Guinea and Liberia, which has exerted strain on their fragile
economies, the committee appealed to ECOWAS members, the
international community and relevant U.N. agencies to provide
urgent assistance to them.
</P>
<P>
The committee also noted that certain individuals were
contravening the embargo and sanctions slammed on the illegal
regime by ECOWAS and strongly warned them to desist immediately
from such subversive activities in their own interest.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the junta had continued to attack and harass
ECOWAS peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), the committee called on the
regime to put an immediate end to such activities, otherwise
ECOMOG would defense itself decisively.
</P>
<P>
The warning coincided with a claim by the junta that it had
"succeeded in dislodging" Nigerian-led ECOMOG soldiers and
putting them on the run.
</P>
<P>
The unconfirmed claim, made by a junta spokesman on state
radio on Saturday, said the Sierra Leone troops continued to be
on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
This might make it a more complicated case to resolve the
crisis in Sierra Leone peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Rainy Season Comes Earlier in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- October marks the beginning of
summer here in Mozambique. This October, however, seems to be
much cooler than other years, with people having to put on their
jackets in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Macaringue, head of the National Meteorological
Institute (INM), said a cold wave entered southern Mozambique on
October 9, and has swept to the central region since.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, rainy weather has been reported recently
in the country's southern and central regions affected by the
damp and low-temperatured wind from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments determined that by 8:00 am on
Friday, Maputo, capital of Mozambique, had a rainfall of 14.07
mm, whereas Inhambane, a southern city, had an accumulated 64.9
mm of rain, and Beira in the central region 46.1 mm of rain.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the rainy season has arrived earlier in
the country. According to Daniel, normally rainy season starts
from the second half of October and will last till next March.
The recent rainfall is very favorable to crops in the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that it will continue to rain in the next
few days, especially in the central region, where the damp, cold
air has been swarming to even today. In the southern area, and
Maputo in particular, temperature will climb up to probably 33
degrees centigrade.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Demography of China Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese demographers and social
scientists discussed their recent research findings at a Symposium
on Demography of China here today.
</P>
<P>
The one-day symposium dealt with China's population and
modernization, family planning, urbanization, aging, social
security, marriage and the family, women's health, and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
John Caldwell, chairman of the International Union for the
Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP), said at the opening
ceremony that the union is happy that the symposium was held
before the IUSSP General Population Conference because the great
amount of information provided at the symposium will give union
members a better understanding of the status quo and trends in
population growth in the world's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
IUSSP was founded in 1928 as an international academic
organization of population studies, and the conference is its most
important activity. This is the first time for China to host it.
</P>
<P>
A six-day exhibition on population and family planning in China
also opened today.
</P>
<P>
China has had some success in controlling population growth and
improving public health since the 1970s, with the natural growth
rate of population dropping from 26 per 1,000 then to 10.4 per
1,000 in 1996, and the average number of children per person among
Chinese women falling from 5.81 to around 2.
</P>
<P>
The infant death rate also dropped from 200 per 1,000 before
1949 to 33 per 1,000 in 1996, and the average life-span climbed to
70.8 from 35.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Gets Conditions for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has received definite answer from neighboring west African
countries for resuming talks aimed at resolving the crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and
Cote d'Ivoire ended a two-day meeting on Saturday in the Nigerian
capital Abuja with three conditions for the resumption.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting requested that
representatives of the illegal regime led by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma must have requisite mandate to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also demanded that the regime must negotiate in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the negotiations should strictly be within the
mandate of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
as stipulated in the Conakry final communique and as endorsed by
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who constitute the ECOWAS Committee of Five on
Sierra Leone, also agreed that the committee chairman, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, should make appropriate arrangements
towards the resumption of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS decision made in Conakry, capital of Guinea, in
June this year set a three-stage strategy -- dialogue, sanctions
and the use of force, aimed at restoring the ousted civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
Talks between ECOWAS and the junta broke down in its second
session in July in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, after Koroma announced
his regime would not hand over until 2001.
</P>
<P>
While ECOWAS were enforcing an economic embargo, the Security
Council last Wednesday ordered a sanction against the country.
</P>
<P>
The council in a resolution endosed the ECOWAS position for
early reinstatement of the legitimate government of Kabbah,
return of peace and security to Sierra Leone and resolution of
the issue of refugees and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting international pressure, the junta has written
several letters indicating willingness to resume negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The letters, according to Ghanaian Foreign Minister Victor
Bgeho, must only dwell on modalities for "bringing the illegal
regime to an end...as we do not even have the mandate to
negotiate their continuous stay".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has in recent times also rebuffed attempts to dialogue
with envoys from Koroma, insisting only to deal with the coupists
on the platform of the community.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Cut Trade Deficit by 2B Dollars in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
drawn up a plan to cut trade deficit by two billion U.S. dollars
in three years.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Commerce Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar
while inaugurating the four-day 18th Pakistan Leather Show in the
southern port city of Karachi Saturday, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Dar said efforts would be made to increase production of wheat
and other edibles to reduce the food import bill from the present
two billion dollars to one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A country known as an agricultural country could not afford to
spend two billion dollars on food imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, said the minister, 25 to 30 percent import
substitution will be achieved in engineering sector by locally
manufacturing goods and in this way one billion dollars could be
saved.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked the National Council for Engineering
to prepare a list of engineering goods to be manufactured locally,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Pakistan's total exports during
the first quarter of the current fiscal year starting from July 1,
1997 stood at 2.017 billion dollars, showing a total growth of
only 5.3 percent as against the target of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total imports during the same period stood at 2.653 billion
dollars, indicating a trade deficit of 636 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has set its export target for the
current fiscal year at 9.57 billion dollars and import target at
11.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of the country in 1996-97 fiscal year stood
at 3.3 billion dollars. The government plans to reduce it to 2.33
billion dollars in the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> WPC President Hails the Opening of the 15th Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- In the opening ceremony of the
15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC), Dr. Dirk van der Meer,
president of WPC, delivered a speech to hail the largest ever
congress of the organization that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he said that the theme of the congress,
"Technology and Globalization -- Leading the Petroleum Industry
into the 21st Century," could not get a better expression than
here in the People's Republic of China. "Technology brings the
nations of the world closer together at an ever increasing speed,
assisted by information technology and the ease of travel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Impact of technology transfer on the industry could be traced
back centuries ago. He recalled that reports from the French
missionary Imbert around 1828 on the age-old Chinese methods of
drilling for salt inspired European technologiest to improve their
drilling methods, and in fact 20 years later they used the
improved techniques in Germany to drill for oil.
</P>
<P>
In their search for salt and water European and North American
engineers copied and improved their drilling methods and
equipment, he noted. There is a direct line between Colonel Drake
and the old Chinese drilling experts.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that "in a world that is finding new ways of
cooperation between industry, governments and state-owned
companies, technology spreads rapidly."
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing an increasing impact of technology on the
cost of oil, through a cost reduction in exploration, production
and transportation," he said, adding that the cost reduction not
only makes it possible to open up new frontiers for oil production
but also allows rejuvenation of old fields and the extension of
the productive life of many oil provinces around the world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that technology development and globalization go hand in
hand, he said that "the presentations at this congress, with some
deserved focus on Asia and in particular China, will show the
shrinking interdependent world with its integrated global economy
we live in."
</P>
<P>
"Recognition of the value of cooperation has also led to a
much increased membership of our Permanent Council over the
years," he said. "We had nine members in 1937, the United States
and eight European countries. There were 18 members in 1970. Since
the first of January this year, 47 nations are members of the
Permanent Council representing all the continents. A further seven
countries have sent us formal letters of application."
</P>
<P>
The WPC in this congress alone has four new attendants,
including Republic of Korea, Angola, Kazakhstan and Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he disclosed that additional seven countries were
expected to join the next congress to be held in Calgary, Canada
in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Paper Industry Facing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's paper industry is
now in a dire straits from both operational and financial points
of view as all segments of the ailing sector are locked in a
desperate struggle for survival, the independent United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Unless definitive steps are taken immediately with direct
involvement of the government, the paper industry would suffer an
irrevocable setback with incalculable loss to the national
economy, UNB quoted sources from the sector as saying.
</P>
<P>
The administered prices of paper and pulp are the main reason
behind the poor health of the mills as the authorities never
allowed the mill management to adjust their prices even when the
international rates went up, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources also blamed an "incredibly hostile fiscal
environment" for the mounting losses in the paper sector facing
acute working capital deficiency while the units are reeling under
a huge unsold stockpile, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the import and taxation policies, which are
periodically reviewed in any country to activate indigenous
manufacturing units, have never been reassessed to resuscitate the
local moribund units in the paper sector, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that due to incessant inflow of foreign paper
at dumping price, the mills could not recover full cost of
production by adjustment of selling rate and incurred losses last
year.
</P>
<P>
This year has spelt further disaster for the sector as gas
supply has been snapped since August, leaving it totally dependent
on furnace oil as the source of energy which escalates production
cost, UNB added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Israeli Security Cooperation Freeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel has denied reports
that Jordan froze security cooperation with Israel in protest
against Israeli agents' attack on a Palestinian faction leader in
Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post today quoted an unidentified Israeli
government source as saying Saturday night that the
Isreali-Jordanian security cooperation goes on as usual,
</P>
<P>
It was with the help from Jordan that Isreali troops
successfully intercepted an infiltrator from Jordan Friday,
shooting him dead on the border near the West Bank city of
Jericho, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army has also confirmed that handling the infiltration
incident involved close cooperation with Jordanian forces,
including a meeting of local commanders, a running exchange of
information, and a probe of how the penetration happened.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that Jordan has not submitted an
official request for any change in the status quo insofar as the
Isreali intelligence agency Mossad is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted an unnamed Jordanian official saying last
week that Jordan has frozen security cooperation with Israel and
demanded resignation of the Isreali officials who ordered the
murder attack on Khaled Mashaal, leader of Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) on September 25.
</P>
<P>
In a deal satisfactory to both sides, Israel has released
Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners in exchange for two Mossad
agents caught in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan, one of the two Arab countries having peace
accord with Israel, has vowed its commitment to the 1994 peace
treaty, according to which Israel and Jordan exchange information
about terrorist groups and cooperate in activities against them.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Canadian Ambassador to Israel David
Berger, who was recalled to Canada in protest against the use of
forged Canadian passports in Mossad's attack upon Mashaal, is to
return to Israel early this week after having an Israel's apology,
the Canadian Embassy in Tel Aviv announced today.

Promulgated in March 1994, the Basic Law will become effective
upon the establishment of the MSAR on December 20, 1999 when China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The MBLPA has been taking various forms to make the law known

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Stresses Asia Pacific's Obligation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today stressed that countries in the Asia Pacific
region have a moral obligation to help the poor break out of
poverty and to ensure that their basic needs are met.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the region are struggling with poverty
although the region is one of the most resource-rich in the world,
he said in his message in the souvenir program of the six-day
Regional Steering Committee on Economic Advancement of Rural and
Island Women for the Asia Pacific (RSC-AP) Meeting, which he will
open here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem was particularly acute among rural
women who remained "the poorest of the poor" in many countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have been fortunate to have had close cooperative relations
among countries in this region that allow us to share and consult
one another on a wide range of issues of common concern," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the RSC-AP meeting reflected the high commitment that
the members placed on the economic advancement of rural women in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is one more step towards the noble endeavor. It
is my hope that this meeting will achieve fruitful results which
we can all share together as a common heritage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had addressed the problem of poverty
throughout its five-year economic development plans since the
1960s which had resulted in a decline in the poverty rate from
42.4 percent in 1976 to 9.6 percent last year. Despite these
impressive gains, much work remained to be done, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member RSC-AP, a network of advocators comprising first
ladies, prominent women and wives of heads of government within
the Asia Pacific region, is dedicated to eradicating the
increasing phenomenon of poverty among women in a region which is
noted to have the most number of poor households in the world.
</P>
<P>
The committee is responsible for preparing the regional plans
of action and monitoring the progress of their implementation and
is engaged in other activities including the preparation and
implementation of specific regional and sub-regional activities
such as training for rural women and research on the subject.
</P>
<P>
The RSC-AP members are Australia, China, India, Indonesia,
Iran, Kazakhstan, the Maldives, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Tonga, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Overall satisfaction with
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, has risen to an
unprecedented 89 percent, according to an opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Asian Commercial Research in the two
days following Tung's policy address on Wednesday, showed a
four-to-one approval rating for the address, the South China
Morning Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the ratings for some senior officials of
the SAR government also rose, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about their opinion of the policy address, 80.3 percent
of 479 respondents aged 18-64 expressed overall satisfaction,
17.1 percent said they were not satisfied and 2.6 percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
Tung's overall satisfaction rating of 89 percent shows a

<HEADLINE> Laos to Dismantle Tariff Regime by December 2007 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Laos said today it commits
itself to the December 2007 deadline to dismantle its existing
tariff regime for a new one under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement
(AFTA).
</P>
<P>
Laos together with Myanmar joined the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July when the regional grouping
celebrates its 30th anniversary. Laos senior officials arrived
here today for the ASEAN Economic Ministers conference which is
scheduled for October 16-18.
</P>
<P>
"We have already committed ourselves to it. If we can fulfill
all the obligations -- and, why not -- we can just proceed," said
Somchith Inthamith, Laotian director general for ASEAN economic
cooperation in the Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Laos is submitting, for the ministers conference, the remaining
product lines for tariff reduction under AFTA's program called the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme, the official
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Somchith said that Laos, despite its relatively weaker economic
conditions, has pledged to deliver on intra-ASEAN trade. "We need
all the assistance. We realize we have to develop our economy a
little bit faster compared with other member countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the impact by the region's currency devaluation on Lao's
economy, he said, "The impact is quite bad; 60 percent of our
trade is with Thailand and most of our imports are paid in the
U.S. dollar." Laos's main trading partners are Vietnam and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To Malaysia's proposal for a greater flow of intra-ASEAN trade
as a measure to cope with currency difficulties, Somchith said,
"We are now prepared to have trading with more ASEAN members. And,
I feel this is the best way to solve the problem."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN set 2003 as the deadline to complete cutting import taxes
to an average five percent or less. Laos has four years later than
the original 2003 deadline.
</P>
<P>
However to join ASEAN, both Laos and Myanmar acceded to key
conditions, related to the AFTA program and other economic
cooperation arrangements, including most-favored nation status to
ASEAN members, national treatment for imports from ASEAN, and
maintaining transparency in laws and regulations relating to trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
Other ASEAN members are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> WPC Chairman Hails the Opening of the 15th Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- In the opening ceremony of the
15th World Petroleum Congress (WPC), Dr. Dirk van der Meer,
president of WPC, delivered a speech to hail the largest ever
congress of the organization that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he said that the theme of the congress,
"Technology and Globalization -- Leading the Petroleum Industry
into the 21st Century," could not get a better expression than
here in the People's Republic of China. "Technology brings the
nations of the world closer together at an ever increasing speed,
assisted by information technology and the ease of travel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Impact of technology transfer on the industry could be traced
back centuries ago. He recalled that reports from the French
missionary Imbert around 1828 on the age-old Chinese methods of
drilling for salt inspired European technologiest to improve their
drilling methods, and in fact 20 years later they used the
improved techniques in Germany to drill for oil.
</P>
<P>
In their search for salt and water European and North American
engineers copied and improved their drilling methods and
equipment, he noted. There is a direct line between Colonel Drake
and the old Chinese drilling experts.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that "in a world that is finding new ways of
cooperation between industry, governments and state-owned
companies, technology spreads rapidly."
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing an increasing impact of technology on the
cost of oil, through a cost reduction in exploration, production
and transportation," he said, adding that the cost reduction not
only makes it possible to open up new frontiers for oil production
but also allows rejuvenation of old fields and the extension of
the productive life of many oil provinces around the world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that technology development and globalization go hand in
hand, he said that "the presentations at this congress, with some
deserved focus on Asia and in particular China, will show the
shrinking interdependent world with its integrated global economy
we live in."
</P>
<P>
"Recognition of the value of cooperation has also led to a
much increased membership of our Permanent Council over the
years," he said. "We had nine members in 1937, the United States
and eight European countries. There were 18 members in 1970. Since
the first of January this year, 47 nations are members of the
Permanent Council representing all the continents. A further seven
countries have sent us formal letters of application."
</P>
<P>
The WPC in this congress alone has four new attendants,
including Republic of Korea, Angola, Kazakhstan and Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he disclosed that additional seven countries were
expected to join the next congress to be held in Calgary, Canada
in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Turkey to Withdraw From Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has called for immediate
withdrawal of the Turkish forces from northern Iraq, the Persian
daily Abrar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Making the call in an interview carried on the newspaper,
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Iraq's territorial integrity
must be protected.
</P>
<P>
Tehran makes such a call to Turkey to "stop violating the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country (Iraq)" at
every time the Turkish forces launch such operations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out a threat of Turkish actions in Iraq to the
bordering Iran, saying the incursion has no direct effect on Iran
and is not in violation of Iran's national security.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the Turkish incursion leaves an
impact on the geopolitics and politics of the region.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that Iran closely follows developments in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Describing negotiation as the best way to resolve problems,
the foreign minister called for immediate withdrawal of the
Turkish forces from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 16,000 Turkish troops have been involved in a
three-week-old cross-border operation in northern Iraq to wipe out
bases of rebel Turkish Kurdish rebels. The Kurdish war for
autonomy has claimed 28,000 lives since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Genius Sun Regains Domain in Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A national gold can hardly be
compared with an Olympic title, but diver Sun Shuwei has another
depiction of the thesis.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Sun, winner of the men's 10-meter platform in the 1992
Barcelona Olympic Games at the age of 16, knew he has more for a
big party after the Naitional Games' gold ultimately draped around
his neck on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After ups and downs in the past five years, Sun assured the
Chinese public that platform remains as his domain.
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard for me to win the gold today," he said on the
brink of tears. "I can hardly go to sleep these days as I was
pressed so hard."
</P>
<P>
Sun became the only gold hope for Guangdong in the individual
diving finals after teammate Yu Zhuocheng suffered his surprised
defeat in the boards.
</P>
<P>
From Barcelona to Atlanta, from glory to slump, few people know
an eye injury has been nagging the dimunitive star.
</P>
<P>
Weeks before the Olympic trials, Sun received operations upon
his eyes, and doctors warned against any more diving since it
could only lead to aggravation of the injuries.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the injury dealt the worst blow against the
diving genius as he eventually dropped out of the Chinese team for
Atlanta after being disqualified by young talents Tian Liang and
Xiao Hailiang early last year.
</P>
<P>
"What a shock for him," coach Hu Enyong said of Sun's loss in
the qualification tournament.
</P>
<P>
But Sun was not to give up the sport no matter how tough the
road would be. Over one year after his Waterloo defeat, Sun
backed for a sweet revenge, beating Tian to second and Xiao to
fourth in the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
After his perfect final dive, Sun rushed to his coach for an
emotional hug as tears bathing his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
"I dedicated all my glory to my coach," he said. "He cultimated
me from a rough boy to the top of the Worlds and Olympics."
</P>
<P>
"He soothed me whenever I was down. He sacrificed too much for
me, and has grey hairs already at 30s..." Sun choked before taking
a bottle of water given by coach Hu.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was his 36th birthday, I felt guilty of not
celebrating with my coach. Now, I only hope to dedicate my gold
to him as a late birthday gift," said Sun, a fearless boy on the
10-meter platform, who was then in all tears in front of a crowd
of reporters.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who has been coaching Sun for 11 years, was also full of
emotion and unable to utter a word, with tears glistening in the
eyes.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, Sun, a sophomore majoring in the Chinese Literature
in Zhongshan University, has set his sights on another Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"If I have to say my aim, then it is the Sydney Olympic Games,"
Sun told Xinhua. The Barcelona boy will be 24 then in 2000.
</P>
<P>
With Sun regaining his flair and form, China will revive its
hope for a historical feat by sweeping all four diving golds in
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the Chinese divers won all the titles except the
men's platform, and all was due to the absence of Sun, said then
Chinese diving head coach Xu Yiming.
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake to clear Sun out of Olympic Games, even his
prsence will put much pressure on gold medalist Dimitriy Sautin of
Russia," Xu said of the make-or-mar Olympic trials in China.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has been asked to back a bid to stop an American
plutonium-laden rocket from passing over southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Cassini space probe, due to be launched from Cape
Canaveral in Florida of the United States tomorrow, has a 32
kilogram plutonium fuel payload to power its seven year journey
to Venus and Saturn.
</P>
<P>
Local media today quoted opponents of Cassini as saying it
posed a threat to millions of lives because if it burns up in the
atmosphere, it could start raining plutonium.
</P>
<P>
The opponents believe Mandela is "their last chance" to stop
the launch.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Cassini campaigner Francis Boyle said Mandela had been
approached to back a petition to the International Court of
Justice in Hague calling for its suspension.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of a head of state or foreign minister is
required for a petition to the court.
</P>
<P>
A senior South African government official confirmed
discussion on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Synthetic Fabric Exports Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports of
synthetic fabrics declined by 14 percent in July and 13.7 percent
in August this year from proceeding months, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Exports of synthetic fabrics in July and August 1997 stood at
50 million U.S. dollars and 43 million dollars respectively as
compared to 57 million dollars in June, said the sources.

As the government has announced a drastic cut of up to 50
percent in duty drawbacks from September 20, 1997, there are
apprehensions of a further drop in the exports, said the sources.

The sources said it is necessary that any change in policy
matters particularly involving financial cuts should be allowed to

<HEADLINE> Private Sector to Plays Major Part in Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Private sector is expected to
cover 90 percent of Zambian economy by the end of this year,
according to the country's Finance Minister Ronald Penza.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Mail today quoted Penza as saying that the private
sector is responding favorably to the government policy of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the launch of the Lifetime to Lifetime, a
policy introduced by Professional Insurance Corporation, a
private firm.
</P>
<P>
Penza paid tribute to the Mahtani Group of Companies under
which Professional Insurance Corporation falls, saying the
conglomerate deserved a pat on the back for its wonderful and
invaluable contribution to the development of the country through
its various businesses.
</P>
<P>
The private sector only contributed 20 percent of the economy
and now it is being reversed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the year we expect the private sector to be
contributing something like 90 percent of the economy," Penza
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to the private sector to help the
government bring down levels of poverty, saying even when the
country is endowed with a wealth of resources, it is still one of
the poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to reversing the situation and
organizations such as the Mahtani Group of Companies which have
invested greatly in the country will do well to help reverse the
trend in poverty levels, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion the group's executive chairman Rajah
Mahtani said the step taken by the government to encourage
increased private participation in the country's economy is most
welcome.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Condemns Tribal Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has strongly condemned tribal politics, saying he will
deal firmly with those promoting tribalism in any form.
</P>
<P>
When he opened the East Province MMD (the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy) conference held in Mfuwe of the province
on Saturday, Chiluba said tribalism is a scourge that should not
be allowed to destroy the country and undermine unity and the
national identity.
</P>
<P>
"This country will not go forward if we are preoccupied with
issues of tribe," he was quoted by today's Sunday Times as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is a unitary state in which all citizens enjoy equal
rights of movement, residence and association, Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
The president castigated some party leaders who are reported
to be campaigning on tribal lines.
</P>
<P>
"You in the East Province should be the last people to promote
tribal politics because in the past you benefited in ministerial
appointments, at the time when the province rejected the MMD by
voting for opposition leaders," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
If there was tribalism, he said he would not have appointed
ministers from the province.
</P>
<P>
Tribalism is a cancer that could destroy the unity of the
nation at various levels, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that inter-marriages in Zambia have made nonsense
of tribalism as there are many families of mixed marriages for
whom tribe is no longer a critical factor of their social life.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Kumar
Gujral wound up his two-day visit to Egypt last night after
reaching a number of documents on bilateral cooperation covering
tourism, customs, culture and media.
</P>
<P>
The six documents were signed after a meeting between Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Gujral Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to sign over the coming few months a
number of draft agreements on preventing double taxation,
regulating mercantile navigation and cooperation in scientific
research areas, Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ganzouri asked India to invest in Egypt's
giant projects as a step to bolstering economic cooperation and
increasing the volume of trade, said Sherif.
</P>
<P>
India has so far invested an accumulated amount of 330 million

<HEADLINE> World Bank Praises Bangladesh Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has achieved
commendable progress in adapting to the changing role of the state
in socio-economic development by shifting public resources toward
social sectors and infrastructure development, a World Bank report
said.
</P>
<P>
The share of recurrent budgetary allocations for education,
health, family planning and other social sectors rose steadily
from about 11 percent of the total Annual Development Program
(ADP) in the second half of the 1980s to more than 24 percent in
1997, said the bank in a report released recently.
</P>
<P>
The report, Public Expenditure Review-1997 in Bangladesh, also
observed that the country's increase in the share of the ADP
resources for social sectors appeared better compared to the
situation in other South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that physical infrastructure and rural
development, which are critically important for fostering private
investment and achieving faster economic growth, have also been
receiving an increasing share of the ADP expenditures in
Bangladesh. It rose from about 27 percent in 1990 to around 37
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To be consistent with the policy of reducing the public
sector's role in production activities and promoting private
investment, the government has also been reducing ADP resources
channeled to industry, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It scaled down budgetary allocations for industries from the 10
to 15 percent range in the 1980s to below 2 percent in the 1990s,
the report observed.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the progress achieved so far, the World Bank
pointed out that there still remains ample room for improving
inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral distribution of public
expenditures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Within the priority sectors, it observed, sustained efforts are
needed for improving the quality of public expenditure programs by
selecting and designing them with high social returns.

<HEADLINE> Pest Management in Natural Way Spreads in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Pest management in a natural way
under a donor-aided project to contain the rampant use of harmful
pesticide in farming is gaining momentum in Bangladesh, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) project has already made
progress with farmers' spontaneous involvement through proper
training on crop cultivation without using chemicals, the
Bangladesh Observer said.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, IPM activities started in 1981 on an
experimental basis under the inter-country program (ICP) funded by
the Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
An ICP analysis report showed that Bangladesh farmers are able
to reduce pesticide use by 80 percent and boost rice output by 10
percent, the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
The IPM program was officially launched in Bangladesh in May
1996 after it was found to have helped improve rice cultivation,
the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a five-year project is being carried out by the
Department of Agriculture Extension of this country to train field
workers for IPM activities.

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the speech delivered by Jiang Zemin, president of the People's
Republic of China at the opening ceremony of the 15th World
Petroleum Congress held here today:
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dirk van der Meer, president of the World Petroleum
Congress,
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
Friends:
</P>
<P>
Today we are here celebrating the grand opening of the 15th
World Petroleum Congress, which is a grand event for the
international oil community. On behalf of the Government of the
People's Republic of China, and also in my own name, I would like
to extend my warmest congratulations and welcome to you, our
friends, from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum serves as one of the important energies on which the
advancement of human society must rely. The development of the
petroleum industry in the 20th century is closely inter-related
with the national strategies, global politics and economic growth,
and also brings dramatic changes to the world economy and the
lives of the peoples.
</P>
<P>
Today, it will be the common anticipation and sacred mission of
the world oil community and governments around the world to
maintain the prosperity of the world oil industry and the
sustainable development of the global economy. I believe that
exchanges and cooperation among the countries of the world on the
principle of mutual equality and benefit will bring new vitality
to the development of the world oil industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
China is one of the earliest countries in the world to discover
and also to use hydrocarbon resources with a history of more than
2,000 years by written records. Since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, particularly over the last 20 years,
the national petroleum industry has witnessed outstanding
achievements.
</P>
<P>
As the economy grows in a sustainable, rapid and healthy way,
the demand for crude oil, natural gas and oil products in China
will be increasing with larger consumption. The Chinese Government
and the Chinese people are confident to ensure the stable growth
of the domestic oil and gas production. China will keep on being
committed to the domestic development and further opening to the
outside world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and
give a favorable push to the exchanges and cooperation among the
oil industries of China and the world as a way to develop all
together.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas are non-renewable resources and also the very
valuable wealth of human being. The hydrocarbon resources must be
developed and utilized in a scientific and rational way. The
policy of concurrent development of oil and gas, energy
development with conservation, processing and utilization of oil
and gas with better control of environment will ensure that the
petroleum industry serves better for the economic growth and for
the greatest benefits of the people.

<HEADLINE> British Queen Arriving in India Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua)-- British Queen Elizabeth II is
arriving here this evening for a week-long state visit to India,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
She will be accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of
Edinburgh. Earlier, the queen visited Pakistan to mark the 50th
anniversary of independence of the two former British colonies.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, the queen is expected to call on Indian
President K. R. Narayanan and have separate meetings with
Vice-President Krishna Kant and Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
A wide range of issues of international, regional and mutual
concern are likely to figure during her meetings with Indian
leaders, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the queen will visit Amritsar City in Punjab State
and lay a wreath at Jallianwala Bagh, the place where 379
civilians were massacred and around 1,200 others injured by
British colonial troops in 1919. While there have been demands
from certain quarters including relatives of the victims of the
massacre for a royal apology, Britain has contended that the
queen's laying a wreath at the Jallianwala Bagh should be seen as
a "special gesture."
</P>
<P>
Indo-Pak ties are likely to come under special focus during the
queen's meetings with Indian leaders. The queen asked both India
and Pakistan to continue their recently resumed dialogue process
to end their "historic disagreement" when she was in Islamabad on
October 8.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation will take time, but the efforts must be made. I
am convinced it will be worthwhile for more than 1 billion
inhabitants of the two countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's offer to mediate on the Kashmir issue, first made by
the Labor Party and then renewed by British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook in Pakistan, may crop up during the talks.
</P>
<P>
India has categorically stated that it is against any third
party mediation on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Growth Strategy on China's Onshore Oil Industry (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China has delineated its
onshore oil growth strategy as "stablizing the East, developing
the West, jointly promoting oil and gas production and encouraging
overseas operations."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, president of the China National Petroleum
Corporation, further elaborated the strategies.
</P>
<P>
In his view, "stabilizing the East" is to guarantee that both
the Songliao basin, namely the basin between the Songhua and
Liaohe rivers, and the Bohai Bay, two largest oil-bearing regions,
should remain the annual oil output at 60 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, "developing the West" means that efforts
should be made to develop new oilfields in the western region
whose combined output should reach 50 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "jointly promoting oil and gas production"
can be translated as that gas production is set to hit 50 billion
cubic meters in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Finally, China has decided to obtain oil and gas from overseas
lands through joint development, Zhou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- High Profitability,
preferential and flexible policies in Guangzhou Free Trade Zone
have been drawing an increasing number of Hong Kong investors to
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly of China Daily quoted an official with
the Guangzhou Free Trade Zone (GZFTZ) as saying that the free
trade zone registered 30 new ventures in the first seven months
this year, and 28 of them are Hong Kong invested enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the total investment from Hong Kong in the seven months
rose 60 percent from the same period in 1996, to 22.4 million US
dollars as compared with total capital input of 56.4 million in
the same period.
</P>

the zone secured. Capital input in the past five years totals 842
million US dollars.

Shen said, enterprises specializing in trade, manufacturing and
warehousing have been enjoying a profitability rate of at least 20
percent. Solely foreign funded ventures have been enjoying a rate
as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
He added that the policy flexibility and priority have become
even more obvious since last year when China modified its policies
for foreign investors, as many of the state's preferential
policies are no longer available outside the free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Policies the zone enjoys include the freedom for foreign
investors to establish companies and develop business on their own,
tariff exemption or reduction for imported goods for a company's
own use, guarantee for those companies' capital circulation and
foreign currency income convertibility, and freedom for goods to
flow into the out the zone.

BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands confirmed its

<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic slump has
sent the number of civil lawsuits increasing considerably,
according to a Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
Civil Court Chief Justice Peng Pengniti said on Saturday that
during the first six months of this year a total of 85,366 civil
suits were brought before the court, compared to 70,629 during the
same period of last year, an increase of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to try to negotiate their conflicts to
prevent unnecessary lawsuits reaching the court.
</P>
<P>
He added that judges have always tried to help mediate
conflicts to save both parties the trouble of having to go through
the lengthy court process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said that layoffs, factory closedown, rising
consumer prices, wage cutdown and the depreciation of the baht had
all helped drive up cases of robbery and other crime and suicide.

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Daqing Oil Administration plans
to take oil extraction as the key link, developing a diversified
economy and ensuring an all-around development, reported today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal, the administration has reformed its
internal organizing structure and set up a new management system
and operation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, China's largest oil producer, has stepped into its mid
and late period of growth after more than three decades of
development. To improve its competitiveness on the market, the
oilfield has spared no efforts to develop an "oil economy", which
combines industries, trade and financial businesses.
</P>
<P>
Daqing took the lead in the oil sector to reform the irrational
system, with disadvantages of widened scope of management, a lower
degree of specialized management and an all-inclusive structure.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield has reshuffled its internal structure and focused
on reforming its financial management, which is the center of the
enterprise's management.
</P>
<P>
It has established a settlement center, which is in charge of
unifying management of funds.
</P>
<P>
With the number of bank accounts reduced to 95 this year from
138 in 1996, working funds decreased to 80 million yuan (9.6
million US dollars) from 372 million yuan (44.8 million US
dollars) in 1996.

ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- England qualified for the 1998
soccer World Cup Finals after drawing with Italy 0-0 in a European
Group two qualifier here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1990 that England booked a berth in
soccer's biggest international event.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who finished one point behind England in the
group, now face a two-leg play-off in their last opportunity to go

Campbell in the second half but the Italians managed to dominate
the last 20 minutes without him.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- About 30 armed men dressed in
military uniforms attacked a bus depot in Kataragama, Uva
Province, early Saturday morning, killing one person and setting
19 buses ablaze, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The blazing night drama, which shocked the sacred city and sent
panic waves across the country, was described by Transport
Minister A. H. M. Fowzie as an attempt by anti-government elements
to sabotage transport services.
</P>
<P>
A security guard of the bus depot was killed and two other
people were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The attackers retreated into the nearby jungle after local
police engaged them with a gun battle.
</P>
<P>
A full investigation was under way to find out the identity of
the raiders and their motives. Rumors said the raid might be
conducted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year ethnic war for a separate
state of their own in the north and east of the country.

LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany overwhelmed stubborn
Albania to qualify for the World Cup soccer final on Saturday,
joining Austria and the Netherlands, which also got in.
</P>
<P>
Scotland also assured itself a berth next summer in France and

</P>
<P>
Germany, needing a draw to qualify, finished first in Group

win left Sweden back in third on 21 despite a 1-0 victory over
Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's 2-0 victory in Glasgow gave it the best runners-up

<HEADLINE> Optimistic Forecast for China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists offered an
optimistic forecast on the country's economy, saying that it will
continue to expand at an appropriate pace through next year, with
the service sector gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State
Statistical Bureau's joint report, which was issued Saturday,
explained that China's national economy will continue to register
an appropriately fast-speed and steady growth momentum over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
This will provide still better conditions for the ultimate goal
of the fulfilment of the Ninth-Five Year Plan (1996-2000) and the
long-term objectives for the year 2010, the reporte noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese GDP will remain at roughly the same level in 1997,
with the growth rate remaining at around 9.5 percent. The report
estimates at 1998 growth of 9-10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report projects a less than optimistic outlook for the
agricultural sector this year compared to last year's bumper
harvests.
</P>
<P>
"The value-added growth rate for the manufacturing sector will
slow somewhat, with the rate for the service sector continuing to
rise appropriately.
</P>
<P>
"The gap in growth rates for the light and heavy industrial
sectors will narrow," the report said.

The report projected a less than two percent growth rate for
the retail price index compared to last year, a level much lower
than estimated at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 1998 index growth rate will hit 3.5 percent or
even higher than this year level thanks to the steady increase of
the national economy and reajustment in its economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The commodities prices will further be stabilized, the report
further noted, and market prices have remained roughly stable over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"The retail sales volumes are expected to grow by 11.9 percent
and 11.6 percent respectively for this year and 1998, However, the
growth rate will be lower than in 1996 but not the average level
for the preceding years," according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Aims to Break New Ground at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong aims to break the
new ground as it makes its debut at the coming Eighth National
Games, said Timothy Fok, head of the Hong Kong delegation, here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong was very weak in competitive sports, so our aim is
to break the zero," said Fok, who led the Hong Kong delegation to
arrive here Saturday for their first-ever participation in the
National Games.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hong Kong enjoyed an upper hand in equestrian, but its
racing horses cannot be moved out of the land before retirement,
and its riders have to make do with the horses provided by the
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, it's mainly up to the horses instead
of the riders to decide the results," Fok said.
</P>
<P>
But to the Hong Kong delegates, the Games will serve as a
family union rather than an sports meet.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to experience the `one country, two systems,'" Fok
said. "We're taking part in the National Games, that's one
country; back home, Hong Kong maintains its high-level autonomous
status after its return to the motherland on July 1."
</P>
<P>
While keeping its status as the world's financial and trade
hub, Hong Kong is striving to become an international sports and
culture center.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we hope the mainland spares no efforts to help
Hong Kong improve its levels in competitive sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended that Hong Kong should be put on a par with
other delegations and does not need preferential treatment as did
this time, which allowed Hong Hong to skip the qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
"No more next time! We will fight for the final berths through
our own efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Hong Kong will eventually host
the National Games, which has been staged in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the central government can give us a chance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic, Slovakia to Set up Panel on Property Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic and Slovakia
have agreed to set up a joint panel especially charged with the
responsibility of settling a dispute over property separation
between the countries.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of talks in the Slovak city of Piestany, the
prime ministers of the two countries, Vaclav Klaus and Vladimier
Meciar, agreed that the longstanding property dispute between
their two countries should not pose an obstacle to the improvement
of bilateral relations, according to the Czech media.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic and Slovakia, the two republics making up
the former Czechoslovakia, have disputed on the sharing of
formerly common property after their separation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic demands that Slovakia repay it 24.7 billion
crowns (748 million U.S. dollars) in debts while Slovakia insists
that the Czech Republic return it 4.5 tons of gold seized by the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
After their talks respectively held on Friday and early today,
the two prime ministers agreed that the joint panel to be
established should settle the repayment of debts by the end of
this year and that the issue of gold seizure be settled by banks
of the two countries, the Czech media said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the property dispute should not dominate
future talks between the prime ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Klaus arrived in Slovakia Friday for the talks with Meciar,
which were the first between prime ministers of the two countries
in four years.
</P>
<P>
The Czech media also said Meciar accepted an invitation
extended by Klaus to visit the Czech Republic early next year.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A proposed referendum on the
merger of Trincomalee and Batticaloa in Eastern Province with
Northern Province was indefinitely postponed following a special
cabinet meeting on Saturday, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was presided over by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, ministers discussed the devolution proposals
contained in the draft of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken less than two weeks after the government
decided to hold the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the decision to postpone the referendum until
situation in the two districts is conducive to a fair and free
election came after leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front
and other Tamil parties appealed for a postponement.
</P>
<P>
They argued that a large number of people in the two districts
are either living in refugee camps or outside their districts.
</P>
<P>
No date has been fixed for the plebiscite. On October 2,
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris said the
referendum is likely to be held after the new constitution was
adopted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China will allow overseas
investment to be involved in international container multi-modal
transportation in China, reported today's Business Weekly of China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
This is in accordance with a set of regulations, which were
issued by the ministries of communications and railway and took
effect on October 1, in a bid to create an open and competitive
container multi-modal transport market in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, which are expected to promote the
multi-modal transport in China while protecting the interests of
transport service enterprises, Sino-foreign co-operative
enterprises can enter the Chinese market. However, the Chinese
side of such ventures must be the main shareholder.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also stipulate that overseas enterprises must
apply for the operation license from the ministries of railway and
communications before July 1 if they want to start container
multi-modal transport in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, overseas enterprises, which want to be involved in
international container multi-modal transport, should comply with
the regulations.
</P>
<P>
They must have set up solely overseas funded transport outlets
in China. They must have engaged in international container
transport between Chinese ports or railway stations and foreign
ports or railway stations.
</P>
<P>
Composed of road, water and railway container transport, the
international container multi-modal transport is the most advanced
form of container transport.

<HEADLINE> Brittan's Visit to Boost Sino-EU Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Economic relations between
China and the European Union are expected to be boosted by the
visit of EU Commission' Deputy President Sir Leon Brittan to China
this week, today's Business Weekly of China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with senior Chinese officials. China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Sino-EU economic cooperative
projects and other bilateral trade issues are likely to top his
agenda, an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (Moftec) said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Sino-EU economic links have been expanding
steadily.
</P>
<P>
The EU is China's fourth largest trade partner, with bilateral
trade volume of 39.7 billion US dollars last year. Chinese customs
statistics indicated Sino-EU trade during the first eight months
of this year increased by 5.2 percent from a year ago to 25.31
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU ranks the fifth among China's foreign investors. By the
end of June, EU-funded projects in China amounted to 7,758. This
involved 29.05 billion US dollars in pledged investment and 10.48
billion US dollars in actual input.
</P>
<P>
The EU had also signed 4,977 technology introduction contracts
worth 34.31 billion US dollars with China by the end of June,
according to Moftec statistics.
</P>
<P>
EU governmental loans to China added up to 12.32 billion US
dollars, accounting for 43.4 percent of China's total loans from
foreign governments and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, problems exist despite growing Sino-EU economic
links, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Moftec statistics show that the EU has launched 69 anti-dumping
cases against China, This year has witnessed three EU anti-dumping
investigations against China-produced unbleached cotton cloth,
ferrosilico-manganese and facsimile machines.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister and
Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi met here today with British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, discussing plans for the
two countries to join the euro system.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation, joined by European Monetary Committee
Chairman Nigel Wicks, is expected to submit Britain's convergence
plan for the euro to the Committee of Economics and Finance
Ministers of the European Union (EU) in Luxembourg on October 13.
</P>
<P>
London has not yet decided whether or when to join the single
currency. A top aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair said this week
that the British government had not ruled out the possibility of
joining the monetary union in 1999, while reports said last month
that Britain's entry was likely in 2002 when the euro began
circulating.
</P>
<P>
However, EU's approval for the British convergence plan is said
to be a foregone conclusion as the European Commission described
the plan as "ambitious" but "based on prudent and realistic
assumptions".
</P>
<P>
Britain's plan foresees a deficit-GDP ratio of 1.5 percent in
1997-98 and 0.25 percent in 1998-99, down from 4.25 percent in
1996-97.

<HEADLINE> Policy Favors Investments in China's Central, Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China is weighing preferential
policies to draw more foreign investment in the economically
backward central and western region, thus helping economic growth
in the ethnic minority regions, according to today's Business
Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyan, deputy director of the Foreign Investment
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec), last week said the policies in consideration
include bigger production-sales ratios for foreign-funded
enterprises in the inland than in the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
He also said Moftec and other central governmental authorities
are considering measures to encourage foreign-funded enterprises
in the coastal regions to invest in the inland, but refused to
divulge more details.
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, economic development in China's central
and western regions lags far behind that in the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment, which has played a significant role in
driving the economic take-off of the coastal region, is much less
in the hinterland than in the coastal regions, not to mention that
in the ethnic minority regions, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Moftec statistics indicate during the first half of this year,
actually utilized foreign investment in the inland made up only 11
percent of the national total, 20.72 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the eight provinces and autonomous regions where most ethnic
minorities live, foreign direct investment in the period plunged
58.3 percent from a year ago to 422.83 million US dollars,
compared with the 5.35 percent climb on the national level.
</P>
<P>
The eight provinces and autonomous regions are Tibet, Xinjiang,
Ningxia, Guangxi and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions, and
Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of plentiful natural resources in those
regions also calls for huge investment, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that special agricultural and animal husbandry
projects, such as cashmere production in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, can only be developed in some ethnic minority
regions which have a special climate.
</P>
<P>
Much cheaper labor costs than in the coastal regions are
another cutting edge for the ethnic minority region, the deputy
director said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Police Seizes 2.5 Tons of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Panama's state security
agents seized 2.5 tons of cocaine from a ship registered in Saint
Vincent and detained nine members of the crew, said a police
report published here today.
</P>
<P>
Among those detained are three Panamanians, five Colombians and
a Guyana national, whose names were not revealed for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The ship, according to Drug Prosecutor Rosendo Miranda, had
been followed for many months and she was detained when she was
passing through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Investigations found that the ship "Ursa-Minor" carried dry
cargo from Buena Ventura, Colombia to Zamba Bonita, Panama and
loaded lumber cargo to mislead the port security officials.
</P>
<P>
Afterward she went to Cartagena de Indias before returning to
Panama and traveling through the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Her final destination was presumed to be the port of Punta
Arenas in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 packages, each with 25 kilograms of cocaine,
were found aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
In another coordinated operation in the region of Kuna Yala
this week, the national police and the National Air Service seized
one ton of cocaine packed in 952 packages.

RIO DE JANEIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
has rejected a United States request for air control during the
forthcoming visit to Brazil by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Brazil's Air Defense Integrated Center and Air
Traffic Control said that the U.S. side intended to control the
Brazilian air traffic from Monday night to Wednesday next week,
the dates on which Clinton will use the Brazilian air space in his
three-day visit starting on October 13.
</P>
<P>
Friday, the center rejected the request because it was
considered "exaggerated, absurd, and an undue military
interference."
</P>
<P>
However, as a compromise, U.S. agents will be permitted to
accompany the Brazilian air controllers in their work.
