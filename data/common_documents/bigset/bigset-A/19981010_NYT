`THE RIVER OF GOLD': OVERHETED PASSION, BETRAYAL AND DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mixing the mystical and the literal as it relates its
tale of guilt, lust and betrayal, the Portuguese film ``The River
of Gold'' ends by hurling itself over the rapids of reason into an
overheated, quasi-operatic frenzy of blood and union in death.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion, as one character repeatedly daubs herself in the
blood of her murdered husband and another swims underwater toward
her dead lover, is more suggestive of uncertain control than of a
firmly conceived resolution of the film's portents and passions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Paulo Rocha's seething melodrama is characterized by
sharply etched characters, fine performances and peaceful riverside
settings that lend the film a dreamy quality in sharp contrast with
its relentless atmosphere of impending violence.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, voices are heard singing of a horrible crime,
and the young women who wash their clothes at the bank of the river
sing of passion, murder, blood and cuckoldry.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characters are Antonio (Lima Duarte), the
past-his-prime dredger who takes Carolina (Isabel Ruth), a
middle-aged railroad crossing guard, as his wife at the outset of
the film. Carolina comes with plenty of baggage: a wandering eye,
guilt about a deadly act of vengeance, and her young niece, Melita
(Joana Barcia), whom Antonio saves from drowning. Melita could be
described as nubile, except that she is pregnant by Joao (Filipe
Cochofel), a womanizer who already has a wife.
</P>
<P>
   And when Carolina takes Melita on a train trip to Oporto to see
a doctor, they encounter a Gypsy who calls himself Ze of Gold (Jose
Mario Branco), who is so troubled by what he senses about Melita
that he flees their compartment, though not without leaving behind
a gold necklace from his case of wares.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Ze will arrive to conduct some sinister business in
the town where the other major characters live, to reveal secrets
and to bed women, and the stage will be set for rage and jealousy
and fate to write an overheated end to ``The River of Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The film will be shown at 3 p.m. Saturday at Alice Tully Hall as
part of the 36th New York Film Festival.

GM RUNS THE SHOW TO SPREAD ITS MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ People used to go to auto shows to see new car
models from all companies and then to a particular dealer to
test-drive the one they liked. Now General Motors, eager to regain
market share, is trying a new way to sell cars; it is putting on
its own one-company auto shows, where visitors can take test
drives, to raise the chance that when the customer goes to a
dealer, it will belong to GM.
</P>
<P>
   When the world's largest industrial corporation gets its act
together and takes it on the road, it is a giant road show _ 150
cars and trucks, including 50 different GM brands; a 60,000
square-foot air-conditioned tent; six half-mile test tracks, and
150 people to run the show, with a catering crew that serves a
choice of four free entrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the world's biggest, most aggressive, in-your-face test
program,'' said Phil Guarascio, a GM vice president and general
manager for marketing and advertising. But it was only a road test,
and none of the cars were for sale. There were no dealers here,
only a data base to match shoppers with dealers in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The company first tried the idea, which it calls Auto Show in
Motion, in July at Denver's old airport, Stapleton. Then came here,
to the huge parking lots of the USAir Arena on the Beltway east of
Washington for four days in September; the next stop was Tustin,
Calif., near Los Angeles, for four days ending Sunday. If the
multimillion dollar experiment works, it could be repeated in 50
cities across the country, company executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The company had an 18-stop tour laid out before last summer's
strike; now it plans to re-evaluate after Los Angeles and decide
whether to do more.
</P>
<P>
   A key measure of success will come in November when it resurveys
the people who came to the Denver event. Among a sample interviewed
before the show by GM, 35 percent said they were likely to buy a
General Motors car; after, 85 percent said they were likely to,
according to company officials. The next survey will find out how
many actually did.
</P>
<P>
   And GM, working with Visual Services, a marketing company in
Livonia, Mich., and other marketing consultants, plans to resurvey
them six months after the event and a year after.
</P>
<P>
   The sales targets are what GM calls ``conquest owners,'' people
who own a Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry or other non-General Motors
vehicle that is ripe for replacement. Part of the strategy was to
let people drive GM vehicles and the competitors' vehicles of the
same class, so the company hauled in a Taurus and a Camry, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea was simply to make people excited about GM, so the
company invited tens of thousands of people, through a direct-mail
campaign and displayed everything from the modestly priced compact
Chevrolet Prizm to the full-size sport utility Suburban. There were
even two copies of the EV-1, the electric car, which the company
markets only in Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   People lined up to drive the electrics and all other kinds of
cars, but the longest lines were for Corvette sports cars and Trans
Ams, Pontiac's power version of the Firebird. There were many more
Corvette drivers than potential Corvette buyers, but that was fine
with GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been to a dealer lately, you really appreciate this.
Dealers make you give them your first-born child before they let
you take out a Trans Am,'' said Fred McGrath Jr. of Fort
Washington, Md., who runs a family real estate company and was
visiting the show with his wife and his father.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said he really was in the market for a Trans Am; he
already owns five. The show personnel were more knowledgeable than
the staff at dealerships, he said, where ``80 or 90 percent of
salespeople don't want to sit down and talk to you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McGrath's wife, Cindy Costenbader, was also impressed. ``If you
had fun, you'd think about GM,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other shoppers got to try maneuvers they said would turn a
dealer livid. Barbara Gershberg, a real estate agent from Potomac,
Md., tried out an Oldsmobile Intrigue GL on a track that featured a
curve, marked by orange plastic cones, that was covered with sand.
The idea was to hit the brakes in the middle of the gritty turn and
see how well the anti-lock system performed.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gershberg, who acknowledged that this was her first
time on a test track, kept hitting the brakes too early, 30 feet
before the sand, to avoid the hazard entirely. So her husband told
her to drive the course a second time, and once again she hit the
brakes too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mrs. Gershberg said, ``it's kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   She left with a computer printout comparing the Olds to a Toyota
Camry LE; the Camry itself was available for a comparison drive
around the same course.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of GM's strategy, said Michael Wright, marketing
services manager at Oldsmobile. ``They're very impressed we have
the guts to put ours against theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man shopping at the show, Thomas Schultz of Alexandria,
Va., said he liked the atmosphere and that it gave him a more
favorable impression of GM ``You go to a dealership, and all they
see is dollar signs in your eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Diane saw a shorter-term strategy for the company.
``It's an ingenious way to get rid of the 98's,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AGSENATE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Tuesday approved a $56 billion agricultural spending
bill by a vote of 55-43. The bill, which was vetoed by President
Clinton on Wednesday, would have provided funding for agriculture
and rural development programs and the Food and Drug
Administration. The measure included a Republican plan to send $4.1
billion in emergency aid to farmers suffering from low commodity
prices and severe weather. Supporters said the bill would provide
necessary funding for farmers without negating the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which eliminated crop subsidies. Opponents, including
Clinton, said the bill does not sufficiently address the dire
situation of farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Thursday approved, 96-1, a $70 billion public housing
and veterans benefits spending bill. The bill would allow families
with incomes of up to $40,000 a year to be eligible for public
housing support. Supporters said the bill would expand
opportunities for families to get housing, as well as sufficiently
fund veterans' programs. No senator spoke in opposition. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted 96-2 to impose a three-year
moratorium that would prohibit local governments from taxing the
Internet until a national plan on cyber-taxation can be developed.
Supporters said the moratorium would protect the burgeoning
electronic commerce industry from being squashed under layers of
tax regulations. No members rose in opposition to the bill. A
``yes'' vote favors the Internet tax bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AGHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 2, the House approved a $56 billion agricultural
spending bill by a vote of 333-53. The bill, which was vetoed by
President Clinton on Wednesday, would have provided funding for
agriculture and rural development programs and the Food and Drug
Administration. The measure included a Republican plan to send $4.1
billion in emergency aid to farmers suffering from low commodity
prices and severe weather. Supporters said the bill would provide
necessary funding for farmers without negating the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which eliminated crop subsidies. Opponents, including
Clinton, said the bill does not sufficiently address the dire
situations of farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CIA
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday approved, 337-83, an intelligence
authorization bill for a classified amount. The measure would fund
the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence activities.
It would also name the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., after
former President George Bush, a former CIA director. Supporters
said there is a need for continued intelligence surveillance in the
post-Cold War era, especially considering the significant
downsizing of the military. Opponents said the bill changes the
legal grounds for wire-tapping in a way that violates privacy
rights. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday approved, 290-137, a $13.4 billion measure
that would fund the Treasury Department, the U.S. Postal Service,
the Executive Office of the President and other agencies.
Supporters called the bill a solid measure and a necessary
compromise. Opponents said the measure was weakened by the removal
of four controversial provisions that would have given green cards
to 40,000 Haitian refugees, set standards for federal child care
facilities, required term limits of the top two officials at the
Federal Election Commission and extended federal government
employee's health benefits to cover prescription birth control. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: DEMIMPEACH
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday rejected, 198-236, a Democratic proposal to
end the impeachment inquiry of President Clinton by December 31,
unless Congress voted to extend it. The measure also would have
limited the investigation's scope to the current referral, or any
subsequent referrals, from the independent counsel's office.
Supporters of the proposal said it is in the best interest of the
country to bring a quick resolution to the review and also argued
that the broad Republican proposal could become an unending fishing
expedition. Opponents said seeking out the truth should not be
limited by the time or scope of the investigation. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: IMPEACH
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday approved, 258-176, a resolution to begin an
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton. Thirty-one Democrats and
227 Republicans voted to approve an open-ended investigation.
Supporters of the probe said the president was not above the law
and should be held accountable if he lied under oath in either the
Paula Jones civil deposition or before a grand jury. Democratic
opponents had argued for quick resolution to the probe with a
deadline of December 31. Opponents also said the president's
behavior was immoral, but not impeachable. A ``yes'' vote favors
the inquiry.

THIS WEEK, IN THE ROLE OF THE STARTER . . . FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The New York Jets prepared Friday for life
without running back Curtis Martin, whose thigh injury will
probably sideline him for Sunday's game against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's absence would be critical because quarterback Glenn
Foley is coming back from a rib-cartilage injury after missing two
games. A strong running game, which a healthy Martin could help
deliver, would ease the pressure on any quarterback _ especially
one who has not played in almost a month. Martin has been averaging
almost 130 yards a game in total offense, including consecutive
100-yard rushing performances as the Jets won their last two games
with Vinny Testaverde at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells has said that if Martin is unavailable and
he still needs a featured back, Richie Anderson will fill that
role. Anderson was the Jets' fullback in 1996, running 47 times for
150 yards and catching 44 passes for 385 yards. But he became a
backup last season. This year his situation is even more tenuous,
and he was not even in uniform the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was not asking, and no one told him, whether he
would start in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get caught up in asking if I'm playing or not,'' he
said. ``If you don't get the answer you want, then you get caught
up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Anderson's recent inactivity have anything to do with his
missing a tackle in Week 2, when the Ravens' Jermaine Lewis
returned a punt for a touchdown? ``It may,'' Anderson said. ``What
do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   That was as much of an opinion as he was willing to offer. The
thoughtful former Penn State star said he approaches each week the
same, whether or not he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year you're a starter, and when you're in a backup role
this year, you've got to be a pro,'' said Anderson, who is Penn
State's fourth-leading career scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in preseason this year, when Martin was sidelined with a
hamstring injury, Anderson produced runs of 66 and 83 yards. Over
all, he picked up 149 yards in 25 carries over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells ran practice by committee this week. Anderson saw
action along with the versatile Leon Johnson. But Parcells has said
he wants to limit Johnson to about 35 plays a game _ half of them
on offense _ even though Johnson has produced the longest running
and receiving plays for the Jets this year. He will remain a
stalwart on special teams, returning punts and kickoffs as well as
covering kicks.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells partly saved Johnson for special teams and if Martin
were unavailable, Anderson would be the Jets' big back Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to know the game as much as possible,'' Anderson said.
``I try to be a student.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he feel, though, when he is the backup and in an
uncertain role? ``I don't make anything out of not starting,'' he
said. ``It starts messing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is thinking about another game after Sunday's, though.
He wonders, is it better for Martin to take a week off? ``If this
Sunday is the last week of the season, he plays,'' the coach said.
``But I don't want to set anyone back.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially, he did not have to add, with the Patriots as the
Jets' next opponent. Parcells and Martin reached the Super Bowl
with New England two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   While some of the Rams' players, and even some coaches, were
complaining about his long summertime practices and meetings, coach
DICK VERMEIL called BILL PARCELLS to ask how he did things. ``I
talked to him off and on last year and in the off season and
everything else,'' Vermeil said. ``So that was not out of the
ordinary communication. You sort of need a couple of guys'
shoulders to cry on in the business once in a while.'' Parcells
said their discussions centered on the length of practices and how
often players worked out in full pads. ``I told him his practices
weren't that much different from mine or some other coaches,''
Parcells said. So what Vermeil was doing was no big deal? ``When
you don't win, it's always an issue,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   _ TERRY DAY, the defensive lineman who had knee surgery after an
off-season basketball injury, will began practice next week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets have not played a regular-season game in St. Louis
since 1971, when the Cardinals were there. &QL;

CORNERBACK IS A CONCERN FOR GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Entering the season, Jason Sehorn and
Phillippi Sparks figured to make cornerback a position of strength
for the New York Giants. It is now a position in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn is out for the season, having had knee surgery, and the
Giants said Friday that it was not likely Sparks, who has an
injured shoulder, would play in Sunday night's nationally televised
game against the Atlanta Falcons at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who has not practiced all week, was to have a magnetic
resonance imaging test Friday afternoon on his right shoulder. The
injury, which occurred when Sparks made a tackle during the Giants'
loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday, was originally considered a bruise.
The Giants do not have any serious, long-term concerns about
Sparks' condition, but since he has not improved as rapidly as the
team expected, more tests were ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how serious it is,'' Sparks said. ``It hurts. I
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Gray, who started 58 National Football League games when
he was with the Seattle Seahawks and the Indianapolis Colts, will
start if Sparks cannot play. Conrad Hamilton has been starting in
Sehorn's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Gray immediately assumed a role in the nickel defenses. He had
an interception in the Giants' victory over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before Phillippi got hurt, I viewed myself as a
starter,'' Gray, 27, said Friday. ``I look at it as us having three
starters, four if you count Jeremy Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, another cornerback the Giants signed as a free agent
over the winter, is a former starter for the Chicago Bears. If
Sparks is out Sunday, Lincoln will see time in the nickel packages.
Lincoln has been used sparingly by the Giants, who said they were
disappointed by his performances in the preseason. Lincoln would be
pressed into service in the nickel defense because the rookie
safety Shaun Williams has a hamstring injury and is not expected to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defensive tackle Robert Harris, who has a strained chest
muscle, is listed as doubtful for the game. And safety Sam Garnes,
who has a foot injury, is still limping; he is listed as
questionable. Guard Ron Stone, who has a bruised tailbone, is also
questionable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not all the injury news for the Giants on Friday was bad. The
nickel linebacker Scott Galyon, who missed the last two games
because of a sore Achilles' heel, practiced all week and should
return Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With Galyon back, the Giants can rest Jessie Armstead more often
if Armstead's sprained right ankle bothers him. But Armstead also
had a full week of practice and said his ankle feels better than it
had since he sustained the injury in the season-opening game Sept.
6 against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead and a number of Giants said they were viewing Sunday
night's game as a chance to redeem themselves. ``The last time we
were on national TV, we looked pretty bad,'' said Armstead,
referring to the Giants' 31-7 loss to Dallas in a Monday night game
Sept. 21. ``You want to look good when everybody's watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel said he was concerned his team may have been
distracted by the national television exposure in the game against
the Cowboys. Thirty-two players on the Giants active roster had
never played on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to tell them before this game that we're still
playing, but they've canceled the national television broadcast,''
Fassel said. ``A lot of these guys hadn't played on national
television before, and we didn't play too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be motivated to redeem ourselves for the last
time.''

DEVILS STILL TRYING TO PLUG GAPS

<P>
   The New Jersey Devils begin the future Saturday night by
immediately confronting the past. They will be in Chicago to open
the 1998-99 season against the Chicago Blackhawks, who hope to get
a big year out of Doug Gilmour, a key player for the Devils until
he switched sides in the off-season after getting an $18 million
offer from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour's departure has left the Devils with something of a void
at center. The Devils have also been searching for an adequate
replacement for Scott Niedermayer, their most creative and skillful
defenseman, who is an unsigned restricted free agent. Niedermayer's
absence will be more evident because Lyle Odelein will also be
missing on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Odelein was given permission by the team to remain in Cincinnati
with his 5-month-old daughter, Paulina, who underwent surgery this
week to alleviate a breathing problem caused by extra cartilage in
her epiglottis, a flap that folds back over the opening of the
windpipe during swallowing, thus preventing food from entering the
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin Brodeur practiced Friday after missing work a
day earlier because of a groin problem, it is uncertain whether he
will play. Randy McKay and Vadim Sarifijanov are also nursing groin
problems and are out. Sarifijanov joined Jason Arnott (broken
finger) on injured reserve Friday, when the Devils brought their
opening-day roster to 23 by assigning forward John Madden to
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight of Saturday night's game will come at the opening
faceoff, when the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa drops the first puck.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who finished second to Mark McGwire in baseball's home run
race this season, will be presented with a Blackhawks jersey before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks' game comes at the beginning of what figures to
be a busy off-season for Sosa. Earlier this week he was invited to
speak in front of the Chicago City Council and appeared on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''

THIRD TITLE NOT A CINCH FOR GORDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ To win his second straight Winston Cup
championship and his third in six years, Jeff Gordon doesn't need
to win a race, he just needs to finish fifth or better in each of
the season's final five races.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the time of year, that could be tough for
Gordon, who leads Mark Martin by 174 points in the title chase.
Gordon has never won a race in October or November, averaging a
15th-place finish in those months.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin to pass Gordon, he needs to win a race in which
Gordon has a wreck or a poor finish. Martin needs a race like
Sunday's Winston 500 at Talladega, where avoiding the big accident
is the only strategy.
</P>
<P>
   This year's stretch run figures to be exciting. Gordon, in a
Chevrolet, qualified sixth (194.153 miles per hour) Friday and
Martin, in a Ford, was eighth (194.058).
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader won the pole, driving his Chevy around the
2.66-mile oval at 196.153 mph. Bobby Labonte, in a Pontiac, was
second (195.985) and Dale Jarrett, in a Ford, was third (195.031).
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers _ Gordon, Jeff Burton, Dale Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt
and Jeremy Mayfield _ will be going for the Winston $1 million
bonus on Sunday. In four chances, Gordon has won the bonus twice
(Indianapolis and Darlington). ``We're excited about it,'' Gordon
said. ``If we're up there, we're going for the million dollars.''

CHANG CHONG-JEN, 93, MODEL FOR CHARACTER IN COMIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Chang Chong-Jen, a Chinese painter and sculptor who
inspired the comic-strip artist known as Herge to create Chang, one
of the most loved characters in the renowned Tintin books, died on
Thursday at an artists' retirement home outside Paris. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   For most readers of the classic Tintin adventure ``The Blue
Lotus,'' Chang was a figment of the imagination of the Belgian-born
artist Georges Remi, whose nom de plume was Herge. In the comic
book, published in 1935 but still in print in France and the United
States, Tintin rescues Chang from the swollen Yangtze River and the
two become bosom buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship, however, reflected the friendship between
Herge and the real Chang, who was studying at the Royal Academy of
Fine Arts in Brussels, Belgium, when they met in 1934. They were
introduced by a Belgian priest who felt that Chang could help Herge
prepare Tintin's next adventure in China and forestall the cultural
stereotypes that characterized the earlier ``Tintin in the Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, for Westerners, China represented old mandarins
and women with tiny feet who threw their babies into rivers,''
Chang recalled in 1994. ``I opened Herge's eyes.'' The Chinese
artist's influence was significant. Herge not only avoided many
racial cliches but also created the comic strip in the spirit of
Chinese pen-and-ink drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, before ``The Blue Lotus'' was published, Chang returned
to China where he began an artistic career that would be endlessly
disrupted and even halted by wars and political upheavals, from the
Japanese invasion of China to the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.
Nonetheless, in the mid-1970s he was appointed director of the Fine
Arts Academy of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chang character appeared again briefly in ``Tintin
in Tibet,'' in 1958, it was only in 1981 that Herge traced Chang's
whereabouts and invited him to visit Brussels. By the time Herge
died two years later, Chang's special place in the history of
Tintin had been widely reported in Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, France's culture minister, Jack Lang, invited Chang and
his daughter to settle in France, where the artist was commissioned
to sculpt a bust of President Francois Mitterrand as well as one of
Herge, destined for the Comic Book Museum at Angouleme. He also
made a sculpture of Deng Xiaoping, which was shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Lang, now mayor of Blois, described Chang
as a ``modest, generous and courageous'' man. ``He was for me a
powerful symbol of dignity in face of the difficult challenges
faced by the great Chinese people,'' Lang said.

JOSEPH F. SPEYER, 72, GENETICIST WHO ADVANCED STUDY OF MUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph F. Speyer, a molecular geneticist at the University
of Connecticut whose early work on mutant genes helped build the
foundation for modern molecular genetics and biotechnology, died on
Oct. 2 at his home in Willington, Conn. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, while working at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
on Long Island, Speyer made important discoveries about the
replication and mutation of genes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the process of DNA replication and mutation was not well
understood, said Dr. Arthur Chovnick, a colleague at the University
of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   By studying how genes mutated, Speyer found that an enzyme
called polymerase played a central role in correcting errors and
thus prevented many mutations that occurred during replication of
the DNA strands within the cell.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Speyer's work at New York University was part of
the early effort to unlock the genetic code, Chovnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Speyer was born in Eisenach, Germany, in 1926. In 1939,
his family came under threat from the Nazi government and he fled
to England with his father and brother.
</P>
<P>
   He attended school in Leicester, England, and studied at London
University. After the war, he worked for the U.S. Army and
immigrated to America in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He received his BS in chemistry and PhD in biochemistry from the
University of Utah. Speyer taught at the New York University School
of Medicine from 1957 to 1964, when he became a senior staff
investigator at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 1967, he
joined the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Anne Mattison ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Ruth Piuck; two sons, David, of
White Plains, and Peter, of Salt Lake City; three daughters, Julie
Speyer of Natick, Mass., Katherine Schieffelin of Southborough,
Mass., and Jane Speyer of Lakewood, Ohio; a brother, George, of New
Barnet, Hertfordshire, England; a sister, Hannah Simon of Berlin;
and six grandchildren.

HOKE SIMPSON, 83, FORMER DEAN OF BUSINESS SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoke Simpson, a former associate dean at the Graduate
School of Business at Columbia University, died on Sept. 26 at
United Hospital in Port Chester. Simpson, a resident of Rye, was
83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung disease, said his daughter, Drayton
Jenkins Gerety.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson joined the business school as the director of executive
programs in 1954 and was promoted to associate dean for executive
education in 1967. The executive education program, which is part
of the business school, is a series of one- to four-week non-degree
courses for executives, including those in management, finance,
leadership and marketing. Courses are sometimes custom-designed for
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   When Simpson joined the business school, its executive education
division was just starting. He helped develop a wide range of
business courses, and during his tenure the school had programs in
New York, France, Spain and South America. He retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in
1935 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and
industrial management, Simpson went to work as a salesman for
General Foods Corp. During a 16-year career at General Foods,
except for a six-year stint with the Naval Reserve, Simpson worked
in the marketing, personnel and labor-relations divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Columbia University, Simpson worked for Vick
Chemical Co. as director of personnel and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is survived by his wife, Suzanne, of Rye; his daughter,
of Mamaroneck; two sons, Hoke Jr., of San Diego, and Willis, of
Asheville, N.C.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

RICHARD CYERT, 77, PRESIDENT OF CARNEGIE MELLON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Pa., Okla., Wash.)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard M. Cyert, a management professor and former president of
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, whose half-century at the
university encompassed its growth from a small regional institute
to a national center of higher learning with a global reputation in
computer technology and education research, died on Wednesday night
at his home in Fox Chapel, Pa. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Donald Hale, Carnegie Mellon's vice
president for university relations.
</P>
<P>
   Cyert was born in Winona, Minn., the son of two orphans. He
worked his way through the University of Minnesota as a page in the
library and earned a doctorate at Columbia University under the GI
Bill of Rights, after serving as a Navy officer in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon, then called the
Carnegie Institute of Technology, as an instructor of economics in
1948 and rose to the rank of professor of economics and industrial
administration before being appointed dean of the William Larimer
Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   There, under Cyert's direction, the ``management game'' for
business education was developed and expanded. It is now used as a
model for many other schools; simply put, the game consists of
students simulating the operation of a corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Cyert, who became the sixth president of the 98-year-old
university in 1972, was also a pioneer in computerizing colleges.
In the mid-1980s, he linked all the computers on campus to a single
network, a system that is as common today as it was unheard of 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people refer to this place as `Computer U.,' and Dick
should be credited with that,'' Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyert, who also shored up the university's finances during his
tenure, retired from the president's post in 1990, but served as a
professor emeritus and continued to teach courses until last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, he was the author or co-author of 12 books
and more than 100 articles for professional journals in the fields
of economics, behavioral science, management and statistics. In the
early 1990s, he also headed the Carnegie Bosch Institute, endowed
by the German company Robert Bosch, to study and improve
international management.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a consultant in economics and management science in
Belgium, Germany and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded several honorary doctorates, too, and was elected
a fellow of the Econometric Society, the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and the American Statistical
Association. He received a Ford Foundation research fellowship and
a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   Cyert was also a director and consultant for numerous
businesses. In 1980, he headed Gov. Dick Thornburgh's commission to
review and make recommendations for Pennsylvania's tax laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was active in numerous efforts to revitalize western
Pennsylvania, and, just as he watched Carnegie Mellon grow, he saw
the region's economy evolve from one with a steel and manufacturing
base to one with growing reliance on high technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cyert is survived by his wife, Margaret Shadick Cyert; three
daughters, Lynn Anne Cyert of Tahlequah, Okla., Lucinda Cyert
Steffes of Seattle and Martha Cyert of Palo Alto, Calif.; two
sisters, Constance Conradi of Brainerd, Minn., and Charlotte Wilson
of Ottawa, and three grandsons.

WILLIAM GRIFFITH, 78, EXPERT ON COMMUNISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: GERMANY, Mass., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William E. Griffith, a historian and political scientist who was
an authority on communism, the Cold War and Central and Eastern
Europe, died on Sept. 28 at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston. He was 78 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said Robert Sales of the news office at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which announced
Griffith's death on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith spent 31 years in teaching and other posts at MIT and
was the Ford international professor of political science when he
retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``He foresaw the first thaws in the Cold War while it was at its
height,'' and he realized early on that the Sino-Soviet split was
occurring, said Lucian Pye, a retired MIT political-science
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He often could spot things just as they were beginning to
bud,'' Pye added, and he said that when Zbigniew Brzezinski was
national security adviser in the Carter administration, Brzezinski
had Griffith as a part-time consultant and ``found him very
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, who collaborated with Brzezinski on several books and
commuted to Washington once a week from Cambridge, was called
``Zbig's idea man'' by a White House aide in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Griffith was a very dedicated anti-communist and
understood communism better than most people,'' said Lincoln
Bloomfield, a retired MIT professor of political science who was
director of global issues at the National Security Council in the
Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith wrote in his book ``The Superpowers and Regional
Tensions'' (1982), ``Bolshevik ideology gave to Soviet expansionism
a conviction of legitimacy and of inevitable success and,
paradoxically, the imperative to push history forward faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's writing and editing in his field won applause. He
edited the book ``Central and Eastern Europe: The Opening
Curtain?'' (1989), consisting of chapters by various specialists.
The book was praised by John Whitehead, a former deputy secretary
of state, as ``a major contribution to the analysis of political
and economic developments in this very important part of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other books Griffith wrote included ``Albania and the
Sino-Soviet Rift'' (1963), which Harry Schwartz praised in The New
York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, also an expert on the East Bloc, wrote: ``Almost two
years have passed since Premier Khrushchev first denounced the
communist leaders of Albania as murderers and traitors, but the
leaders of that tiny primitive country continue in power. How this
David and Goliath struggle arose, what forces brought together
Albania and the colossus of China, the result of the quarrel on
other communist nations are all matters admirably discussed in
Griffith's book.''
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to MIT, Griffith was the chief political adviser
at Radio Free Europe in Munich, Germany, when it was still operated
by the CIA from 1950 to 1958.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was born in Remsen, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in
liberal arts in 1940 from Hamilton College, and a master's degree
in 1941 and a doctorate in 1950, both in history from Harvard. He
was an Army officer in France and Germany during World War II and
later was a high military government official in Bavaria, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Ingeborg
Maria Ehrhardt; two daughters, Evelyn and Dorothy, both of Munich;
a son, Oliver, of Paris, and five grandchildren.

COMPANY CEO, ANALYSTS STILL UPBEAT ABOUT COMPANY'S OUTLOOK

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's been a rough couple of weeks for On
Assignment Inc. Shares in the temporary staffing firm have fallen
37.8 percent since Sept. 30., slipping from $37 to $23 at the close
of trading Friday. So why is Chief Executive Officer Tom Buelter
happy? Likely because his competitors have suffered even more, in
some cases losing twice as much of their market capitalization as
Los Angeles-based On Assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find me in the greatest mood -- absolutely no worries,''
Buelter said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are bullish on the company, too. Five rate it a ``buy''
and four recommend holding onto its stock. None has come out with a
``sell'' call on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great company and will, I think, do really well,'' A.G.
Edwards analyst Laura Browder said. Said another analyst, ``They
came out better than most.''
</P>
<P>
   What On Assignment has going for it over a ManPower, Administaff
or Remedy Temp is focus, analysts say. Through three divisions --
Lab Support, Healthcare Financial Staffing and Envirostaff -- the
company places temporary professional workers into jobs in the
sciences, medical, and food and beverage industries.
</P>
<P>
   While other firms place a spectrum of staffers, from
administrative to executive, into any company that comes calling,
On Assignment draws commissions almost entirely from professionals
who, happily, tend to pull far heftier paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   What has hurt On Assignment -- and virtually all other publicly
traded staffing companies -- is concern that despite the best
attempts of Alan Greenspan, the U.S. economy is recession-bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is that while things are first slowing down and
you're going into a recession, it'll be the temporary people who
are laid off first,'' Browder said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing such concern, Little Rock-based Stephens Inc. downgraded
the entire staffing industry Oct. 1, in part explaining the
sell-off in On Assignment stock.
</P>
<P>
   But Buelter said that in the long run, his firm and others in
the sector see increased business in an economic downturn, as
companies reluctant to make permanent hires rely increasingly on
temporary staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncertainty is an advantage in our business,'' Buelter said.
</P>
<P>
   With steady annual growth of 20 to 25 percent in revenues and 35
to 40 percent in earnings (the company made $12.38 million last
year on sales of $107.84 million), Buelter said On Assignment will
overcome the latest depression in its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is one American investor or one stock
today that is better off than in July,'' he said. ``But we have no
debt; we've got $35 million cash in the bank ... I'm not really
worried.''

DISNEY SEQUEL WILL PLAY IN SOME FOREIGN THEATERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co., seeking to squeeze more from
a key property, will release its direct-to-video ``Lion King''
sequel into European and Latin American theaters next spring but
not in its own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simba's Pride,'' a centerpiece of Disney's strategy to produce
low-cost videos based on recognizable characters, will hit store
shelves Oct. 27 in the United States, as planned previously, but
will not make it into domestic theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic thinking is that there's clearly a theatrical
audience in those overseas markets,'' Disney spokeswoman Cheryl
Glenn said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign markets such as Asia also will not see ``Simba's
Pride'' in theaters because plans for the video release already
have been set in motion, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King'' was a massive box office hit in 1994 and
became the top video seller with 30 million copies in the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   Disney launched its direct-to-video sequel strategy in 1994 with
``The Return of Jafar'' and sold a surprising 10 million copies of
its first ``Aladdin'' sequel. Disney now has plans to release as
many as four high-profile, direct-to-video titles annually by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Disney dropped plans for a direct-to-video
sequel to ``Toy Story'' and switched the sequel to a late 1999
theatrical release as part of the entertainment giant's increased
moves to protect its cornerstone franchise of animated movies.

INDIANS, COLON HUMBLE YANKEES, 6-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The New York Yankees' 114 victories this season will
mean nothing if baseball's best team does not advance to the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   That became a distinct possibility last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians _ Central Division champions and overwhelming
underdogs in the American League Championship Series _ moved within
two victories of their third World Series berth since 1995 with
last night's 6-1 triumph at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians lead the best-of-seven series two games to one, and
that bodes well for manager Mike Hargrove's ballclub. History
reveals that the winner of Game 3 advanced to the World Series nine
of 12 times after opponents split games 1 and 2 of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team believes in itself,'' said Indians first
baseman Jim Thome, who drove in three runs on the strength of his
second- and fifth-inning home runs. ``We knew coming into this
series that the Yankees were the team to beat and really have been
the team to beat all year with what they did during the regular
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Bartolo Colon, who surrendered only four hits and
four walks for the victory, threw the first complete game in ALCS
play since former White Sox left-hander Wilson Alvarez during their
1993 series against the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, though, belonged to the Indians' sleeping giant.
</P>
<P>
   Thome, whose second-inning, solo home run gave the Indians' a
1-0 lead, ensured the victory with his two-run, fifth-inning homer
off left-hander Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The affable, left-handed power hitter struggled throughout
September and this postseason since his return from the 15-day
disabled list. Thome suffered a fracture to his right hand Aug. 7
after being hit by a pitch thrown by Alvarez, now with the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Thome returned Sept. 16, but the first baseman hit .195
(8-for-41) with 15 strikeouts and only one home and three runs
batted in during the remainder of the season. The postseason
continued to be unkind to Thome, who entered last night's game
hitting .130 (3-for-23) with nine strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a palm reader yesterday, and she told me ... No, Jimmy
is a good hitter,'' Hargrove said. ``You look at his career stats
and you see what he's done year in and year out, and he's normally
a very good, consistent hitter throughout the season. I feel the
broken hand caused him to be a little inconsistent the last two
weeks of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome's second home run gave the Indians a 5-1 lead and
highlighted their four-run fifth inning in which right fielder
Manny Ramirez and left fielder Mark Whiten also hit solo home runs
with Pettitte on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Whiten's 416-foot blast signaled the end for Pettitte, who fell
prey to the big inning once again this season. Opponents victimized
Pettitte for four or more runs in a single inning a league-high 10
times during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of leaving too many pitches out over the
plate,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``I thought he had it
straightened out after the second inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees' offense _ which this season led the
major leagues in runs scored _ continues to be kept in check. The
Yankees have scored only 18 runs through their six postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we just got kicked tonight, and there's frustration in
that,'' Torre said. ``We're not scoring any runs. I think everybody
is a little frustrated with that fact alone.''
</P>
<P>
   That frustration will run much deeper without a World Series
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Indians appear confident, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We protect against overconfidence,'' Hargrove said, ``because
you don't give us any credit for being here.''

THE YANKEES ARE SUDDENLY ON A LIFE RAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Suddenly, what is supposed to be the greatest season
in American League history is drifting on a raft, like the one
Orlando Hernandez rode out of Cuba. Suddenly, it is the Cleveland
Indians, not the Yankees, who look like the team that won 114
regular-season games and was believed to have a dugout reserved for
it in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Joe Torre's patience doesn't seem to be that much of a
virtue, and the Yankees, for the first time since they gathered in
Tampa, Fla., almost eight months ago, have to prove they can defeat
a most unfamiliar opponent called adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, with Ya-Gotta-Believe now written all over them,
didn't need 12 innings here Friday night, and didn't need help from
the umpires, or more brain lock from Chuck Knoblauch. The Yankees
didn't have anyone to blame but themselves, as George Steinbrenner
_ stone-faced in his box, furious at the thought of losing to the
city of his birth _ will certainly remind Torre before the Yankees
get back on the field for Game 4 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians manhandled the Yankees, 6-1, at Jacobs Field,
treating Andy Pettitte like the batting practice pitcher, while the
Yankees made Bartolo Colon _ a guy with a reliable fastball and not
much more _ look like Bob Gibson. They kept hitting the ball to
Omar Vizquel, who is about as good as it gets at shortstop. They
produced the grand total of four hits and, trailing by two games to
one in the four-of-seven-game American League Championship Series,
now give the ball to a rookie who a year ago was watching his
playoff baseball at a Cuban CNN bureau. Now the real drama begins,
and we will find out how much greatness these Yankees really have
in them.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Yankees coasted to the playoffs as the wild
card, and wilted in the face of playoff pressure. There was nothing
close to a crucial game for them this season either, which
certainly wasn't their fault. But here they are, down a game in the
series, facing two more on the road, not hitting a lick, in the
bowels of a pitching rotation that is up against a long ball lineup
that awoke Friday night from a two-game slumber and used the
bleachers for target practice against Pettitte, who had nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure the Yankees are under now will surely not be
reflected in Torre's words or his body language. Bill Parcells, a
man Torre admires and vice versa, would be burying bodies in the
back of the clubhouse by now, but that is not Torre's way. Like
Bobby Cox with his Braves, Torre can only trust that all those
regular-season victories _ an American League-record 114 in the
Yankees' case _ will ultimately mean more for them than the 111 the
Indians won in 1954, before losing the World Series in a four-game
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Torre tried a rare team meeting Friday afternoon, ``just to make
sure, with everything that's been going on for the last day and
half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure that all the signs were right, and
stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before he discovered that Pettitte had,
shockingly, almost no stuff at all. The Yankees manufactured a run
off Colon in the first inning, but Jim Thome hit the first of his
two home runs to right field in the second. Then Mark Whiten, who
would later hit one of three fifth-inning home runs off Pettitte,
doubled and soon scored on a single by Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Getting beat by Thome and Manny Ramirez is one thing. Having to
endure Whiten, a Yankee castoff last season after an off-field
episode that would make Ken Starr blush, was like adding a can of
kerosene to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Torre should have pulled Pettitte before the
Indians' fifth-inning eruption blew the game open, and lightened
whatever load there was on Colon. For two days, every time Torre
was asked about Pettitte and his very shaky second half of the
season, he referred his audience back to Game 5 of the 1996 World
Series, a 1-0 shutout. ``I've always appreciated people who had
faith in me and trust in me playing this game,'' he said. ``This is
Game 3 of a similar situation, on the road, and to do what he did
in Game 5, that will stay in my memory bank.''
</P>
<P>
   This team has a track record with Torre, a championship and a
season that at times seemed too good to be true. Maybe it was. Or
maybe the Yankees have just been set up to prove the kind of
greatness that comes from the heart, from the gut, from a man who
earlier this summer faced life and death on a raft. The Yankees are
in Orlando Hernandez's hands now.  &QL;

THOME'S SLUMP ENDS WITH A COUPLE OF BLASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Several hours before the American League
Championship Series began on Tuesday, all the Cleveland Indians
were corralled in their clubhouse before batting practice. All but
one. Jim Thome kept pacing the corridor beneath Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How cold is it out there, Cleveland-like cold?'' he asked a
few hallway loiterers.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to pace while whirling a bat in his hand until it
was the Indians' turn at batting practice. As Thome stood on the
field, with the red-white-and-blue bunting in the background, he
looked around and displayed a smile as big as a half moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it is all about,'' Thome said. ``You cannot beat
this.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm was pure as he began this series, and it never
wavered, no matter how disappointing his at-bats. Even after he
struck out once in Game 1 and three times in Game 2, he refused to
get frustrated or uptight and kept on swinging freely until
something connected in Game 3 against the Yankees Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thome wheeled his sturdy frame and made contact with two Andy
Pettitte fastballs, both of which ended up over the wall and into a
roaring crowd in right field at Jacobs Field. Thome's two home runs
_ one a solo shot estimated at 421 feet in the second inning, the
other a two-run rainbow estimated at 369 feet in the fifth inning _
put the Indians firmly in control to win Game 3, 6-1, and they
helped provide Cleveland with a 2-1 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I've been having a hard time with left-handed
pitching lately,'' said Thome, whose right hand was fractured by a
pitch on Aug. 7, causing him to miss a month of playing time.
``They've been trying to establish the fastball inside. I was
fortunate tonight to get ahead in the count and get a good pitch to
hit. I've been having such a hard time lately that it wasn't on my
mind to hit two home runs. I was just trying to put it in play.''
</P>
<P>
   This is as good as Thome has looked since returning to the
lineup on Sept. 16. He finished the last 12 games of the season
hitting .195 with one home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a palm reader, so I knew,'' manager Mike Hargrove joked
when asked if he knew Thome was ready to break out. ``No, Jimmy is
a good hitter. Look over his career and see what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome has always had a knack for the home run. In the fifth
inning, his second homer barely crept over the wall in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Paul O'Neill was going back, I didn't know if it was
going,'' Thome said of the Yankee right fielder. ``I was trying to
blow it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome was one of three Indians to hit homers off Pettitte in the
fifth inning, which put the Indians ahead, 6-1. Manny Ramirez and
Mark Whiten joined Thome in their show of power. And it was a show,
all right, as Thome thrashed his way out of a 1-for-8 slump through
Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get good pitching like we have lately, it's
contagious,'' Thome said. ``The offense just relaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome looked at ease despite his recent struggles as he tried to
get adjusted to swinging the bat with a pad on his healing hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the pad wasn't really the problem,'' he said.
``It just felt like spring training all over again, especially
against left-hand pitching. The first week back, I was just trying
to get a feel for everything again. Hitting is about momentum and
getting good pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cleveland's disastrous loss in Game 1 and its fluke-aided
victory in Game 2, no one could argue the merits of the Indians
victory in Game 3. Obviously, they are not daunted by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Yankees have been the team to beat,'' Thome said.
``For us, going in you have to bring your game to another level.
We've won because our pitching has put us in a situation where we
could win. After the first inning, you could see the momentum shift
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Thome sent up his first home run of the
night. It was a release of the nervous energy that he had been
building for hours before the series even began.

102 INDICTED IN CRACK SALES TO WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS IN MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs throughout to add info. on charges made against dealers,
details of drug ring operations and comments from owners of local
businesses.)  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Law-enforcement officials announced the indictments
Friday of 102 members of a sophisticated drug operation that
discreetly sold millions of dollars' worth of crack cocaine to
white-collar workers in midtown Manhattan over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the seven gangs involved catered to what the
dealers called the ``S and T crowd'' _ the suit and tie crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said
the suspects were indicted on felony charges of conspiracy,
narcotics sales, weapons possession, attempted murder and assault.
He said 77 of the gang members were in custody and 25 were being
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who also appeared at the news
conference, said the drug operations were among the largest in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven of the suspects identified themselves as members of
subgroups of the Bloods street gang, based in Los Angeles,
investigators said. But Safir said the gangs appeared to have no
link to the Bloods.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the gang members' practice of
selling drugs indoors and the fact that they shunned firearms
showed the evolution and adaptability of the drug trade under the
Giuliani administration's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes.
</P>
<P>
   They said a continuing demand for drugs fueled the operation.
Half of its $5.5 million in annual sales were made to white-collar
workers, investigators said. Business was most brisk in the early
morning, when office workers arrived for work, and at noon, when
they went on lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Arsenault, assistant Manhattan district attorney, said
the white-collar workers ``bought big and they paid twice as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shift from the aggressive, gun-toting drug gangs of the
early 1990s, the five gangs involved apparently shunned
confrontation with other gangs to avoid drawing police attention.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the gangs operated out of the former Evans Hotel at
273 W. 38th St. near Eighth Avenue, and then worked around the
corner in the Mammoth Pool Hall at 550 Eighth Ave., officials said.
To avoid warfare, dealers declared a truce and worked out a shift
schedule among themselves, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers from different gangs shared customers and drug supplies
and even warned each other when police approached, investigators
said. In a major shift that law-enforcement officials said helps
explain the city's plummeting homicide rate, disputes among the
gangs were settled by slashings and stabbings, not by gun battles.
Gang members told the police that they no longer carry guns because
they fear that they will be stopped by police officers enforcing
the city's crackdown on low-level crimes, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In the arrests of the gang members, only four guns were seized,
law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arsenault said he believed that the small number of guns seized
and the small number of shootings involving the gangs, two since
1996, showed that the police crackdown is getting guns off city
streets. Fewer guns means that confrontations among drug dealers
result in stabbing wounds instead of fatal shootings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing drug gang cases for 10 years,'' he said.
``I've had one other case with one stabbing. This case had five.''
</P>
<P>
   The decade-long gold rush for the drug operations ended in
January, when renovations forced one of the gangs, the Dog Pound
Gang, to move out of the West 38th Street building.
</P>
<P>
   The gang tried to move into the Mammoth Pool Hall, where four
other gangs _ the Green Team, the Blueberries, the Yellow Bags and
the Clear Team _ had been cooperating with one another,
investigators said. The gangs took their names from the color of
the bags they used to package the crack, investigators added.
</P>
<P>
   The Dog Pound Gang refused to take part in the existing
operation, and in January, two Dog Pound members shot and wounded a
Blueberries manager, law enforcement officials said. The shooting
drew the authorities' attention and eventually led to Friday's
indictments. ``They got greedy,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Two factions of a neighborhood gang known as the Gangsta Killa
Bloods then moved into the pool hall, establishing a truce with the
Clear Team and Yellow Bags gangs. The Dog Pound, Green Team and
Blueberries gangs were forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of nearby businesses said they were pleased that the drug
operations had been dismantled. Andrew Scheman, owner of Scheman &AMP;
Grant Hardware, said the drug trade has been a long-running
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug dealing really affects my business,'' he said. ``You can
get killed around here if you don't know what you're doing.''

<P>
   Police investigators said the office workers were apparently
uncomfortable buying their drugs on the street.
</P>
<P>
   During surveillance operations, office workers described by
investigators as ``men and women in suits carrying briefcases''
were seen buying their drugs in the stairwell leading to the
Mammoth Pool Hall on the building's third floor.
</P>
<P>
   A few office workers immediately smoked the crack in the pool
hall's bathroom, investigators said, but most left with the drugs.
The dealers took advantage of their prime location and raised their
prices accordingly, Arsenault said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very lucrative operation,'' he said. ``What was sold
for $5 dollars to an addict was sold for $10, $15 or $20 to the
suit-and-tie crowd.''

   AFGHAN-AID-GROUPS (KABUL, Afghanistan) _ Nearly three months
have passed since 23 international aid groups left this country

people, a third of the city's population. There is no one to take

</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-YEN (TOKYO) _ The yen's sudden jump against the dollar

of coke Wall Street traders were snorting in the '80s. Is it
progress that our new rich can turn salad dressing into a status
symbol? By Frank Rich.

is the Cleveland Indians, not the Yankees, who look like the team
slated for the World Series. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKS-HERNANDEZ (CLEVELAND) _ Armed with a video camera,
Hernandez walked through the Tower City Mall here Friday, taping

Cleveland Indians and Dwight Gooden. By Buster Olney

demonstrated that Friday night at Madison Square Garden in their
energetic season opener.

   Although the show was entertaining for the loud capacity crowd,
the result was unsatisfying for the home fans as the Flyers headed

ARMED WITH A LEAD, PADRE FANS BELIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMANTHA STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ A strong sign that this city is going bonkers for
the Padres came Friday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their
heads for a radio promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance
at skybox tickets for post-season play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more a show of support for the team than it was for
the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the ``Jeff and
Jer'' show. ``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald Padres _
Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About a
thousand people showed up _ men, women and children. We had 10
barbers and 20 hairdressers and it took six hours for the lines to
either get buzzed or straight-razored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked at the turnout. But this is a bandwagon town.
`Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' type public. You'll see
an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've won and then
hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National
League Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a
two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans
began gearing up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional
ways. It would be the team's first World Series appearance since
1984, and in the downtown business district Friday, marquees and
banners read ``Go Padres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by
several hundred fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up
a half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from
three years ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores,
the Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put
family entertainment in the park after they bought the team in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a more diversified group of fans than I saw in
Atlanta,'' Lucchino said. ``Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're
proud of our three generations of families who come to the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old homemaker from La Jolla, has been a
fan since she was 10 and the Pacific Coast League Padres played at
Lane Field near the harbor. She would take a streetcar after school
to meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seats. Later, she
brought her four children to Jack Murphy Stadium for the National
League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd. Now, she brings her
grandchildren to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different groups in the stands,'' she said, ``the
upper class, the middle class, the business person, the
beer-drinking fan, the children, all of the Mexican fans from
across the border. We are true fans _ all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also giving credit
to the balmy weather. ``Padre fans are a cross-section from all
over the county,'' she said. ``Downtown, suburban, rural, east,
north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies to the
new kids _ the X generation. A lot from across the border. The
Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect
weather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in
October has got to be better than in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Carrion, who was born in San Diego and has been a
baseball fan for 25 years, brings his 10- and 8-year-old sons to
the stadium. ``This is a great chance to let my children see the
players work,'' Carrion said. ``They can look up to these guys and
understand their character and their work ethic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Padres ticket office estimates that on average, more than
15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from San
Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have the
first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana.

<P>
   CACASUS-PIPELINE (Washington) _ A two-year campaign by the
Clinton administration to persuade major oil companies that they
should quickly build a multi-billion-dollar pipeline in the
Caucasus, a campaign that has become a centerpiece of U.S. foreign
policy, appears to be on the brink of failure. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROVERSIAL-CANONIZATION (Rome) _ At a Mass in St. Peter's
Square on Sunday, Pope John Paul II will pronounce Edith Stein, a
renowned Jewish intellectual who became a Carmelite nun and died at
Auschwitz, a saint and a martyr for the Roman Catholic faith. Edith
Stein, while undoubtedly a remarkable woman, is perhaps one of the
most contested choices for canonization of John Paul's pontificate,
which celebrates its 20th year next week. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   With:
</P>
<P>
   CANONIZATION-STEIN (Undated) _ The miracle that qualified Edith
Stein for sainthood began with the kind of thoroughly avoidable
childhood accident that haunts the imagination of every
conscientious parent. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CULT (Tokyo) _ The cult that planted nerve gas in the
Tokyo subway three years ago, killing 12 people and injuring
thousands more, is back. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   WORLDBANK-MEDIA (Washington) _ After surveying the Asian
financial crisis, the World Bank has decided that a strong and
independent news media could be an important protection against
economic mismanagement and government malfeasance in developing
nations. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-CONFLICT (Calamar, Colombia) _ The bloody struggle over
the future of Colombia, raging between shadowy groups of men and
women with masks and false names, is closing in on Calamar, a main
transit point in the coca trade scratched out of the jungle 20
years ago by the refugees of earlier conflicts in this stricken
country. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-AID (Nairobi, Kenya) _ In 1989, the world's governments
launched Operation Lifeline Sudan. Now, nearly a decade and more
than $2 billion later, the situation is virtually identical,
despite one of the largest relief operations ever. The expenditure
will grow endlessly, relief officials said this week, unless there
is an end to the war. And it does not please the donor governments
and relief agencies that rebel leaders have bluntly declared that
they expect the aid to continue so the war can. By Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WASH-VOTER-DISCONTENT (Longview, Wash.) _ There is no question
that voters are upset here in Washington, a state that has been a
particularly accurate electoral bellwether in recent years. But
three and a half weeks before Election Day, it is also clear that
many voters are not at all sure where to direct their anger. By Sam
Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENICIAN-SHIPS (Undated) _ The Phoenicians were the master
seafarers of antiquity, but modern scholarship knows little of the
vanished people and almost nothing of their empire's basis, its
merchant ships. Now, however, the cold depths of the Mediterranean
have yielded a bonanza that might change all that _ if
archeologists and treasure hunters can learn to work together. By
William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   AIR&AMP;SPACE-ANNEX (Silver Hill, Md.) _ The Air and Space Museum
expects to complete design work next month on a giant new
exhibition hall at Washington Dulles International Airport, with
room for objects that would never fit anywhere else, including the
prototype space shuttle and an early model Boeing 707. By Matthew
L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   ALA-PENSIONLESS-COPS (Tuscaloosa, Ala.) _ In 1966, Willie Bies
Jr. became a police officer in this university city, assigned to
the poor black neighborhood on the west side where patrol cars were
often pelted with rocks. In 1991 Bies retired, becoming one of only
two Tuscaloosa police officers to work for 25 years without getting
a pension. Like the other officer, Herbert Harris, Bies is black.
The case of the two officers' fight for police pensions illustrates
how a third of a century after the civil rights movement extended
equal treatment under the law to all Americans, people employed
under the rules of the segregationist South are still battling for
justice. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   PIKES-PEAK-EROSION (Cascade, Colo.) _ Hiking below the
spectacular Pikes Peak Highway, Gail Snyder points out the
behind-the-scenes damage to the mountain. For decades, rain water
has drained unchecked off the gravel road leading to the
14,110-foot summit, carving gullies deep enough to swallow
ponderosa pines whole. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PODESTA-PROFILE (Washington) _ John David Podesta, the lean, wry
roller-coaster enthusiast who senior White House aides say is
likely to become their next chief of staff, keeps an unusual
photograph of President Clinton on his office wall. By James
Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   UNUSED-BOMB-DETECTORS (Washington) _ The Federal Aviation
Administration has spent more than $122 million on machines to
detect bombs in checked baggage, but those machines that have been
installed sit idle for most of the day, according to investigators
from the Department of Transportation. By Matthew L. Wald.

   WASHINGTON _ As the world's finance ministers and bankers argued
and strategized here last week about the most virulent outbreak of
economic turmoil in half a century, it often seemed as if they were
watching a spectacular fire, viewed from the safety of a
well-catered picnic just across the river.
</P>
<P>
   While nibbling on fresh shrimp and sushi, the leaders of the
global economy marveled at how high the flames were soaring, and
how quickly they leapt from house to house. But mostly, they talked
about what an amazing global economic village they planned to build
some day on the charred landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It will be magnificent: Big buildings equipped with
computer-controlled sprinkler systems that kick into action at the
first whiff of smoke. A protective shield will descend on nearby
structures to keep them from going up in flames, too. There will be
new safety rules: Kindly leave your combustible hedge funds, your
insolvent banks, and your crony capitalists at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that was missing was a plan for putting the fire
out.
</P>
<P>
   At the crisis-wracked annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank _ the institutions created 53
years ago to assure global stability after World War II _ the
21st-century village was termed the ``new international financial
architecture.'' President Clinton insisted it would be designed
``to tame the pattern of boom-bust on an international scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the groundbreaking ceremony is years away. And
with 20 million people in East Asia falling back into poverty this
year, the IMF cutting its estimates for world growth by more than
half, Muscovites taking to the streets and the dollar taking a
mysterious 25 percent plunge in two days, it seemed odd that the
overseers of the global economy were more comfortable talking about
how to prevent the next crisis than how to survive this one.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't exactly help when IMF managing director Michel
Camdessus tried to sound reassuring by declaring, ``We are not in
1928.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that everyone wants to talk about
long-term solutions. New financial architectures sound neat and
well-planned, a system as thoroughly modern as trading stocks on
the Internet. Unfortunately, solving the immediate crisis is far
messier _ for it involves navigating a global economic landscape no
one has mapped, complicated by political failures no one could have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the economic problem is a classic panic: Fear has
overwhelmed greed. The Asian crisis caused investors around the
world to pull back. But Russia's economic collapse last summer
signaled that countries really can default _ and there is not much
their creditors can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, banks and investors have been unwilling to take the
normal risks that are a necessary part of keeping the world running
smoothly. Suddenly they see trouble everywhere, and they are simply
refusing to lend or invest in countries to which, only 18 months
ago, they were willing to funnel money at astoundingly low interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that money has poured out of emerging markets like
Southeast Asia and Latin America and fled to safe havens, chiefly
United States Treasury bonds. The resulting shortage of credit is
strangling economies around the world, and threatening to afflict
the American economy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve and no stranger to odd things that
happen when a herd mentality takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   The new architecture everyone is talking about is supposed to
quell this kind of flight for the exits _ first by setting up a
system of global smoke detectors that would sound whenever a
country was courting financial trouble, and then by setting up a
system of common rules so investors would know that bad debt
problems, if they arise, would be dealt with sensibly.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that if all nations and their biggest
corporations are required to reveal far more data to investors,
people might think twice about how much money they pour in. And
building some common legal standards for dealing with bad debts,
bankruptcies and defaults could prevent a wild stampede for the
exits as soon as a crisis breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   But creating these systems takes time. It took America and
Europe most of this century to figure out how to regulate the
markets _ and it is still a work in progress, as the near-collapse
of a giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, proved just a
few weeks ago. Getting nations new to market capitalism to embrace
these rules could take decades. But the crisis is now.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary times, the process of restoring confidence _ a
psychological feat as much as an economic one _ and persuading
people to put their money to work again would be hard enough. But
these days it is made even harder by something that markets and
investors hate _ political uncertainty, as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   The financial ministers here were treated to the extraordinary
experience of debating the future of the world economy face-to-face
with a president who was in the opening phase of what promises to
be a long impeachment inquiry. ``You might find that the leader of
the world's biggest economy,'' one European finance minister said,
``could spend more time figuring out ways to save the world economy
if he was not also trying to save his job.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Europe has its own distractions: a change of government in
Germany and a preoccupation with monetary union, a process that
could be undermined if a world recession sets in. Japan was here to
reassure the world _ again _ that after seven years of dithering,
it finally understands that its fast-sinking banking system is
sucking down its neighbors as well.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and he responds in a
tone of I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it. Add to this the first big
investment-house collapse in China, more anti-Chinese riots in
Indonesia, and a fraying, nuclear-equipped Russia that can't decide
whether failed capitalism is better or worse than failed communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of uncertainty, when you have a global crisis, you
need one or two powers with the vision and the reach to act
globally,'' said Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist in Asia for
Deutsche Bank. ``And yet every day, you see evidence that everyone
is preoccupied _ either not interested, or interested and unable to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some steps that many here thought would help. Clinton
repeated his call for a global movement to promote growth, chiefly
by cutting interest rates. He was talking largely about Europe, but
Germany spent the week resisting; it is traditionally preoccupied
by inflation, even though the threat to the world these days is
deflation. In private, several officials said, Clinton was fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans, the least affected so far by the chaos, remain
unconvinced that things are as bad as everyone says: The Swiss
finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, complained that the problem was
in everyone's heads, and that ``many speakers tend to overdramatize
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had another idea: Change the rules of the IMF so it can
provide aid to some fundamentally healthy countries like Brazil
BEFORE the tornado strikes, in hopes that this will lessen the
chances that investors will panic and pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the scope of Clinton's ideas left other countries
underwhelmed, and wondering whether the president, distracted and
weakened, has the power to do what he insists the United States
must do: Lead the way out of the crisis. His two speeches to the
finance ministers lacked any proposals that involved spending
American taxpayers' money, because he was still arguing with
Congress over coughing up $18 billion that the United States has
already committed to the nearly broke IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Congress and the IMF has frozen other
action. For example, Rubin is debating whether to use billions of
dollars under his control as an American contribution to a pool of
money to shore up Brazil. But Congress was outraged when that money
was tapped for Mexico in 1995 (it has since been repaid) and the
White House is in no mood to anger anyone on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States is hardly the only country where domestic
politics make it hard to turn the Titanic away from the icebergs.
Japan's opposition fears that the government will use billions of
taxpayer dollars to bail out its biggest banks, without firing the
managers who created the mess, or assuring that the shareholders
lose their investment. And the banks would rather go under slowly
than commit ritual suicide.
</P>
<P>
   With the world's second-largest economy remaining frozen, the
rest of the world is reluctant to lend the banks more money, though
there were signs last week that a logjam in the fragmented
Parliament might be breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Russians, who have told the IMF how little
they think of its economic reform plans, while a new government
prints money to pay off pensioners and the military. But Russia is
running out of real money, and a senior IMF official notes that
Russia is essentially blackmailing the West by saying that without
IMF aid, political chaos could reign.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political battles that are compounding the
world's economic troubles are far more prosaic _ like rewriting
bankruptcy laws. Still, they offer a glimpse of why that new
international financial architecture could run into some building
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand is a good example. This year borrowers there simply
stopped paying their debts. But because Thailand has no effective
bankruptcy law, Thai companies can delay efforts to liquidate
reorganize them. Essentially, they can hold their lenders at bay
for years, while, magically, whatever value is left in their
companies gets drained away. Because their money is unrecoverable,
Thai banks have stopped lending and the world has stopped lending
to Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
   So the IMF, as part of its aid package, is requiring Thailand to
rewrite its bankruptcy laws on the Western model. But there's a
hitch: Many of the legislators are the country's most powerful
businessmen. They are resisting, complaining that foreign
businesses are snatching up Thailand at fire-sale prices. Which, of
course, is exactly what a few savvy American and European companies
are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's called capitalism, and it's a lot more fun in up markets
than in down markets.

<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for
re-election, went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other
morning to accept an award from mass-transit advocates. But the
reporters who had gathered there showed little interest in the
shiny train car at the senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly
asked him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not going to make any comment with respect to that
subject matter,'' D'Amato responded. ``I am not just a citizen. I
am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato is something else as well: a candidate in what may
be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variations of his
elliptical response can be heard in Senate races around the
country, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering
similar questions. All of which suggests that after the House voted
Thursday to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races
for the U.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the
electoral equivalent of jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes to impeach Clinton, the matter goes to the
Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority whether to
convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, the
Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive force
into the Senate contests.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, even those who support Clinton, expect their political
leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior,
and candidates have been doing that. But impeachment is another
matter; most polls show the nation is against it. The danger for
Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility,
the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which
there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of
whether he should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the strategists involved in the races, there is
little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue. Advisers to
candidates of both parties said in interviews last week that they
were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or should do on
the issue to gain the advantage _ or guard against harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell how this one is going to go,'' said Mike Russell,
a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.
``This is a very surreal environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 are held by Democrats and 16
by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats in all. Republicans would
have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce the 67 votes necessary
for conviction, assuming such a vote were to go along party lines.
Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, which seems almost
unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political
Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, at least, none
of the Senate candidates has made an explicit appeal for votes
based on how they would vote on a presidential jury. But she and
others are wondering if this may be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   This is difficult ground to measure. One of the central
questions of this political year has been how Clinton's dealings
with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time,
politicians assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a
rebuke to Clinton, just as many Republicans did in November 1974,
three months after President Richard M. Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But now some analysts wonder if the partisan fight in Congress
last week might have the opposite effect among some Democrats.
``That's the problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of an
independent political newsletter in Washington. ``It's not that we
don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where the general
public stands on impeachment. The problem is that we don't know
where the electorate stands on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as
they cast their ballots in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart
Stevens, a Republican consultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such
strategies, he said, tend to work only with a small number of
single-minded or sophisticated voters.
</P>
<P>
   Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is
that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race,
state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of
the candidates and the composition of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to
their advantage, it would be in states with a Democratic edge or
with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support
the president. In contests like those, it might well prove to be in
the interest of a Democratic candidate to, as one consultant put
it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in
which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly
pledges to vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could
prove effective. ``This is an issue where there is a huge
disconnect between the elites and the public,'' said Fred Yang, a
Democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas.
That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California, New
York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By
contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be
less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Republican consultants are telling their
candidates to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of
impeachment. The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate
elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House might think from the overall public numbers
that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election,''
said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races
this year. ``Republicans certainly aren't going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some hints of how things might play out could be seen last week,
and there was probably no better place to watch it than New York.
Clinton is so popular that the Democratic candidate for governor,
Peter Vallone, whose campaign is in serious trouble, released a
commercial denouncing impeachment. In the Senate race, which
features two of the nation's most politically perceptive
politicians, D'Amato sidestepped impeachment questions while his
opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, announced that he opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato responded to questions about Clinton with the language
that Republican consultants have been suggesting to their
candidates. ``When and if that matter comes to the Senate, I will
decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time,''
D'Amato said. ``It would be very premature for me to suggest any
course of action without it being referred. Because, indeed, we may
be called upon to act as a jury of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is
conducting the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the
issue. In a live telecast of the hearings, he said the president
deserved a lesser punishment, such as censure or reprimand. And
Schumer plans to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last
week that impeachment will grow as an issue. ``Senator D'Amato
claims he does not want to share his opinion with the people of New
York,'' Morris said. ``And if he doesn't have an opinion, he's the
only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television
commercial, Morris responded: ``We don't talk about what we're
going to do. I wouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.''

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The world watched tens of thousands of Communists and
their allies march on the Kremlin last week, demanding the removal
of President Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a telegenic protest
it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of Russian discontent. For
that, you had to go 5,300 miles and six time zones east, to the
Siberian city of Yakutsk.
</P>
<P>
   Yakutsk has 250,000 people, no money and more hardship than
Moscow could dream of. And there, at the appointed hour of 10 a.m.,
in the town square across from the requisite statue of Lenin,
perhaps 40 people showed up to unfurl a few red banners and stamp
their feet against the cold. By 11 the square was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in Yakutsk was far more common across Russia on
Wednesday than was the mob of marchers in that television broadcast
from Moscow. There is a lesson there. Since Russia's feral brand of
capitalism started crumbling Aug. 17, bringing down the banking
system, foreign trade, the ruble and most of a government with it,
everybody has been waiting for the moment when the population cries
``Enough!'' and takes matters into its own anarchic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it ain't going to happen _ not anytime soon, anyway.
Russia, the cradle and exporter of global revolution, turns out to
be not much of a consumer. It clings to the here-and-now with a
vengeance _ maybe out of habit, almost certainly out of fear that
stirring the pot will only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesians exploded into riots and looting under similar
economic circumstances a year ago. Russians complain, then conclude
their harangues with the national motto, ``Shto dyelat?''_ ``What
is to be done?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it is beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem, I think, is in the mentality,'' said Andrei
Gnatiuk, who heads a political consulting firm involved in election
campaigns across Russia. ``People have to understand that they're
the masters of their own fates. Socialism greatly perverted us. We
became used to being guaranteed a piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Masha Lipman, an editor and political analyst in Moscow for the
weekly news magazine Itogi, agrees. In 75 years of Communist rule,
people traded freedom for an assured, if sometimes bleak,
existence. She says that smothered the democratic notion that
individuals working together can change the social order.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that history backs them up: The Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991 mostly of its own weight, not out of any
collective national action. Yeltsin enjoyed popular support at the
time, but he was a catalyst of change, not the agent.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of the succeeding crises _ not the parliament's
attempt to seize power from Yeltsin amid hyperinflation in 1993 nor
the current collapse _ have ordinary Russians been much more than
interested spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that, of course, may well be due to the quality of the
alternative. The Communist Party has never shed its reputation for
the sort of rigidity and wrongheadedness, let alone cruelty, that
contributed to the Soviet Union's downfall, and its leaders today
are uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Bolsheviks were Yeltsin's major foes in 1993 and again last
week. Many major newspapers saw the turnout on Wednesday _ less
than a third of even modest projections _ as a major setback for
the Communist Party, which had seemed on the upswing with its
return to power in key parts of Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not simply the Communists. Russians have yet to swarm
to any of the strongmen seeking to fill the vacuum left by
Yeltsin's declining fortunes _ not to Moscow's authoritarian mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, or to the former general who iron-handedly runs the
huge Krasnoyarsk region of central Russia, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   One popular notion is that the country is exhausted _ by the
bloodletting during the civil war after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution; by the millions of deaths in World War II; by Stalin's
mass killings; by the wrenching changes that followed the end of
Communist rule in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, the conviction in the early 1990s that democracy
and capitalism would rescue Russia from a worse fate has more or
less been extinguished. Still, nothing has replaced it that is
attractive enough to spur people to plunge along yet another
uncharted course. The devil they know is better than the one behind
the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry, yes; but people are also tired,'' said
Sergei Markov, a well-known political analyst here. ``And people
are afraid of bad government much less than they're afraid of
chaos. They're prepared to have any kind of bad government more
than instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of those theories probably has some merit. Historians might
argue as well that Russia has never experienced a truly democratic
society, even now; that it was excluded from the Renaissance and
its critical links to Western political and social philosophy; that
top-down leadership, rather than bottom up, is the rule when it
comes to ruling Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may be true. But amid the general gloom over the
Russian psyche, Gnatiuk has another explanation, one that he says
is actually supported by empirical data.
</P>
<P>
   Gnatiuk says that Russians are better off than they let on, and
that they are simply not in the mood to revolt. He cites polling
data from his own consulting firm. It concludes that most Russians
believe their lives have improved in recent years, but that they
also believe the lives of their neighbors have gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is the media _ especially the Western media, now available
throughout Russia _ that have convinced them the nation is a lost
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always giving some sort of bad news that people
somewhere are eating dogs because of hunger, or eating cows and now
eating the feed and so forth,'' Gnatiuk said. ``Everyone thinks,
`The country will go out on the street and on strike because
everybody's living badly, but why should I go out on the street? I
have a TV and a refrigerator. I work; my parents have a pension.
But those who are doing badly will go out.'''

   Imagine you are being treated for cancer, a fact known to your
Travelers' insurance agent from your medical tests and insurance
forms. Imagine also that you are applying for a mortgage from, say,
Citibank, where you've banked for years and which has just merged
with Travelers Group. Despite your excellent credit rating, your
mortgage is denied by Citibank for reasons that are unclear.

about how to invest your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Both situations may be hypothetical but they aren't so
far-fetched, according to a growing number of bankers, lawmakers,
banking regulators and consumer advocates worried about the
potential dark side of the mergers sweeping the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   As banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies combine into
huge new conglomerates, and with legislation before Congress to
make such mergers even easier, there is increasing concern about
the amount of personal financial and medical data that can be
collected under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this privacy debate has centered mainly on the use of
patients' medical records, especially by health maintenance
organizations. But a new twist has been added as banks have
expanded into businesses like securities and insurance sales, both
of which involve the collection of a wide range of personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Citicorp and Travelers Group completed their $50
billion merger, creating the world's largest financial services
conglomerate, with 70 million customers. The new company,
Citigroup, has access to a wealth of customer information,
including mutual fund accounts, health claims on insurance
policies, and credit card, mortgage and car loan balances. Many
consumer advocates are worried that such sensitive data can easily
be transferred from one part of the company to another and possibly
be disclosed to outside parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for banks to realize the challenge they
face in the privacy area is something new, different and more
difficult than what they've dealt with before,'' said Acting
Comptroller of the Currency Julie Williams. ``It's in their
self-interest to recognize privacy as a customer concern and deal
with it successfully or they may be subject to more restrictive
controls on the ability to use this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbank, which is acquiring BankAmerica Corp., has already
run into trouble with customer privacy. The company recently paid
nearly $40 million to settle a class-action suit and end a
government investigation after more than 18,000 customers, many of
them elderly, were sold complex derivative securities that were far
too risky for them. Nationsbank's brokerage arm had used the bank's
customer list to target people to approach, many of whom mistakenly
believed that the derivatives were safe and insured. As a result,
Nationsbank has imposed new limits on the use of private data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to a banker used to be like going to confession or
seeing a psychiatrist _ we thought the information was protected,''
said Edmund Mierzwinski, executive director of the U.S. Public
Interest Group, a nonprofit pro-consumer organization. ``But that's
no longer the case. These mergers are creating bigger data bases
with more power.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services companies argue that the ability to swap data
between one arm and another is a driving force behind many mergers.
Banks want to broaden their ability to ``cross-market'' credit
cards to checking deposit customers or sell stocks and bonds to
holders of car loans. But bankers say they must be careful to
balance this desire to sell new products against the need to
maintain the trust of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned,'' said Edward Yingling, executive
director for government relations at the American Bankers
Association. ``The key question is, what is the proper balance
between appropriate and valuable cross-marketing and invasions of
privacy? No one believes medical records should be used for
cross-marketing in ways that would be invasive. It's more difficult
when financial information can be used to show our customers that
other products might be very good for them. That's what everyone
has to wrestle with.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows bank customers to sign ``opt out'' forms,
preventing one part of a bank from giving personal information to
another. The Comptroller's office has found, however, that few
banks highlight this option. ``Most bank customers can't ever
recall seeing anything like this,'' Ms. Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its merger application to the Federal Reserve Board,
Citigroup made a ``Global Privacy Promise,'' which would ``provide
customers the right to prevent Citigroup from sharing customer
information with others, including affiliates, for cross-marketing
purposes.'' Customers will also be given opt-out provisions and
Travelers has pledged that it will not share the medical or health
information of its insurance customers ``for marketing purposes.''
Consumer advocates like Mierzwinski say such protections should be
a matter of law, and not established case by case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., has been leading a push in
Congress for greater financial privacy restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hardly any safeguards out there,'' Dodd told the
Senate Banking Committee last month. ``As each year goes by, the
vulnerability of the people we represent becomes more exposed. The
longer we delay, we are exposing millions to unfair access by
people who should not have access.''

GIRL TALK: WHAT IT IS, AND ISN'T

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Monica Lewinsky poured her heart out to Linda Tripp, she
was clearly looking for girl talk.
</P>
<P>
   Girl talk runs deep. It begins in the sandbox, when girls are
asked which boy they want to select and boys are asked which insect
they want to dissect. Encouraged to dissect romantic possibilities,
women soon find themselves analyzing relationships to whomever will
listen. They will confide in a pet, a plant, a passing mirror, an
embittered Pentagon bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Men are less inclined toward such revelations and also more
likely to be congratulated for making them. Compare the political
sensation of the year, with its miles of tape, to the year's
literary sensation, ``Birthday Letters,'' a slim volume written by
Ted Hughes about his dead wife, Sylvia Plath. The man kept quiet
about his feelings for 35 years, then published 88 poems _ that's
an average of 2.51 poems per year _ and the collection was hailed
as an eloquent emotional outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a depressed obsessive poet laureate is more likely to
get good reviews than a depressed obsessive intern, but the double
standards here go beyond career choice. In 1989 Hughes wrote to
Plath's biographer that he preferred the rumors fueled by his
silence to being ``goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life
with Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, men are taught at a young age that talking about
emotional life is akin to vomiting, as Ms. Lewinsky learned when
she sought to confide in a male friend, Dennis Lytton. He changed
the subject and later said: ``It was kind of shocking. I didn't
want to get into it further.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's other publishing sensation of the year, ``Bridget
Jones' Diary'' by Helen Fielding, gives us a woman who spends five
times as much time analyzing relationships as having them. The
novel's structure mirrors that of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' in which
Darcy disappears for chapters on end while the women discuss him.
The ratio of relationship analysis to time spent with actual guy,
just in terms of pure pages, may not approach Ms. Lewinsky's but is
heartbreaking still.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not macho to yammer on about matters of love, unless
of course you're yammering about your sexual prowess. Booklist
praised Dennis Rodman for his ``unabashed honesty'' in describing
his exploits in ``Bad As I Wanna Be.'' But chatting about a woman's
sexual escapades, a woman's romantic feelings or even their own
feelings can make men squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Within their own friendships too, men may have a threshold for
just how many feelings they can stand, as Paul Theroux learned when
he kept telling his mentor V.S. Naipaul his most honest thoughts
and Naipaul stopped speaking to him. Since he could not destroy a
friendship that was already destroyed, Theroux felt liberated to
write ``Sir Vidia's Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than talking about feelings is writing them down. Claire
Bloom did, and her ex-husband, Philip Roth, retaliated by turning
her into a vindictive fictional character in his next novel. Joyce
Maynard did too, and her book shows that her relationship with J.D.
Salinger was obviously doomed. If you're as major a fan of girl
talk as Ms. Maynard is, it's not a good idea to fall in love with a
hermit.
</P>
<P>
   But girl talk is usually more private than a tell-all book. It
has secretly taken place for centuries. Shakespeare knew about girl
talk, and used female collusion as a plot device in ``All's Well
That Ends Well.'' These days the chatter continues on the phone, at
the Ritz-Carlton or over martinis in best-sellers like ``Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl talk has guidelines. You don't steal a man you hear about
during girl talk. You don't repeat secrets told during girl talk.
And you definitely don't tape it. Violating the code of women can
have disastrous results, as when Scarlett O'Hara throws herself at
her friend Melanie's husband in ``Gone With the Wind.'' Just at the
moment you realize who your real friends are, the woman who trusted
you may die a saintly death and leave behind a dull guy and a
lifetime of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, the cynical sacrifice of girl talk to scandal
politics was first perpetrated by Lynn Armandt, who snapped a
picture of her friend Donna Rice sitting on Gary Hart's lap. She
later sold her confidences and photos to People magazine. Ms. Rice
got to ruin a political career and then was offered modeling
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp's tapings constitute the ultimate betrayal of the
code of women. She was supposed to provide compassion, empathy and
dieting tips; she provided grand jury testimony. You simply don't
want to be on your deathbed or even on a runway in Milan, modeling
the latest ``Roma Outsize'' stylings, wondering if you should have
confided in a more reliable girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Immunity is nice, but it's not friendship.

   It's not easy being Monica _ even for one night. The nation's
major mask makers have taken a pass on Monica Lewinsky this
Halloween, worried about possible lawsuits over the use of her
likeness. So revelers will have to improvise with wigs and berets,
and many plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Party stores and costume makers report that this season's
best-selling spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President
Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Abracadabra in New York City sells Clinton masks with Pinocchio
noses (available for several years). Halloween Adventure, another
New York shop, offers masks of the Clintons with Titanic life
preservers. In Washington, Backstage Inc. got some practice for
Halloween recently when a bar held a Linda Tripp look-alike
contest. ``They bought blonde wigs and took black Magic Markers to
the roots,'' said Sandra Duraes, the manager.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Monica masks has been a disappointment to some,
but the mask companies may have been wise to steer clear. An aide
(yes, an aide) to Ms. Lewinsky said no one had asked permission to
license a Monica mask, but that if anyone did, Ms. Lewinsky would
refuse. The aide said Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers are looking for ways
to crack down on entrepreneurs who have used her picture on
cookies, T-shirts and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the full Monica, like slipping past a Secret Service
agent, takes creativity. At Morris Costumes in Charlotte, N.C.,
clerks are cutting the red ribbons out of their Snow White wigs.
``Bada-boom, bada-bing _ you've got Monica Lewinsky,'' said C.
Ashley Coolik, an enterprising sales associate.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Inc. in New York's Flatiron District, recommends adapting
its ``Witchy Woman'' mask. Abracadabra offers a Monica wig, a beret
and a wig-beret combo. Annie's Costumes and Magic, in Plantation,
Fla., offers a blue dress. ``The big Halloween dilemma is where to
put the stain,'' said assistant manager Jerry Sturdevant. Various
``intern kits'' also are for sale. At the chain of Spirit Halloween
Superstores, the package costs $14.99 and includes a hat, a pearl
necklace and an ``intern pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Halloween fads of recent years suggest that becoming a popular
costume is a fleeting measure of infamy. Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker,
Saddam Hussein, Lorena Bobbitt and Woody Allen all were hottest
when the news about them was the worst. Thomas Campbell, the
president of Classic Distributing Co. in Audubon, N.J., pointed out
that he still hasn't been able to unload 2,000 O.J. Simpson masks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Santino, a professor of popular culture at Bowling
Green State University, said more than simple notoriety is
involved. ``It's more dangerous _ you've been made a joke,'' he
said. ``This is the people's holiday, and we delight in rubbing
their nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the costume business has its decorous few. Frankie Stein,
the owner of Frankie Steinz Costumes in New York, considered
offering a knit dress with a stain but decided it would be tacky.
``We were tempted, but we've seen the light,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others see a windfall. Morris Costumes president Philip
Morris predicts that Clinton will have a Nixon-like shelf-life.
``Ten Halloweens from now, we'll be selling Clinton masks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   James Bradley, the sales manager at Mask Illusions in Chula
Vista, Calif., is already thinking ahead. He has begun working on
next season, calculating that a mask of Starr will be big. ``Ken
Starr's head is shaped like a pear and he has big cheeks and a very
comical smile that he tries to put on,'' Bradley said. For
precedent, he points to the lasting appeal of President Jimmy
Carter's big teeth, and Ross Perot's floppy ears.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real optimists are the mask dealers who said they
could console themselves about this year's shortage since by this
time next year, no one will be talking about Monica Lewinsky.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Across the river from this city's majestic
waterfront, in an area that was swampland not long ago, a gleaming
collection of skyscrapers is emerging. The most impressive,
ambitiously named the World Financial Center, is scheduled to
become the tallest building in the world when it is completed in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters hope the area, known as Pudong, will become China's
Wall Street, with investment banks and other financial institutions
alongside a stock exchange with state-of-the-art technology that
opened earlier this year. A new airport is under construction in
Pudong; so is a $1 billion General Motors plant that will make
Buick sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the ambitious plans, however, occupancy rates in
Pudong are only around 70 percent. The Shanghai real estate market
has gone bust, after years of boom, and pessimists argue that it
portends a collapse in the spectacularly fast growth that China has
enjoyed since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So many of its neighbors in Asia are mired in financial wreckage
that economists and international traders fear that China may be
the last and heftiest domino.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government-ordered closing of the Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., a big investment company
swamped by debt, heightened concern about the vulnerability of
China's rickety financial system, already burdened by insolvent
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese consumers are still spending, construction teams are
still working 24-hour shifts and planners are moving ahead with
hugely ambitious development plans. Despite all the ominous
reminders of the dangers attending the nation's wrenching shift
from a planned economy to a market economy, there is reason for
optimism that the economy will grow in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, China has escaped the worst ravages of Asia's
financial crisis because it is still so far behind the rest of the
world in its efforts to create a modern economy; with a striving
population of 1.2 billion people, it has a per capita income of
only about $350 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Its incomplete economic transition is, oddly enough, something
of a blessing now. For one thing, China's currency is not freely
traded, so speculation isn't a big problem. For another, its main
stock markets are closed to foreign investors and are thus immune
to the large-scale withdrawals of capital that have plagued other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of China's banks are run by the state, and though
they are deeply in debt, the banks face no shareholder pressure to
account for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still way behind, so they've got a lot of easy
catching up to do,'' said Brewer Stone, head of investment banking
in Asia for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There is vast potential for improving the efficiency of Chinese
companies, Stone said, as well as for creating new products that
Chinese consumers do not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   Citing one example, Stone pointed to a Chinese company called
Hai'er, which has built a remarkably successful refrigerator and
household appliance business stressing follow-up service. At a time
when multinational companies are scaling back their operations in
Asia, Hai'er is planning a big expansion into the personal computer
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot less bullish on China after what has happened over
the past year,'' Stone said. ``But the bottom line is that China
still has much to do in terms of productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Within China, there is a debate about whether the leadership
will be able to achieve the 8 percent growth rate that they have
promised. With a restructuring of state-owned companies turning
millions of urban workers out in the streets, any serious slowdown
could have potentially disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's leaders say they are planning a $1 trillion public
works program to keep the economy growing at a time when exports to
neighboring Asian countries are falling sharply. Whether or not
they succeed, signs point to enough pent-up demand among China's
consumers to keep things humming for a while.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has made a big bet with its plant in Pudong, and
plans to start assembling sedans there later this year. Although it
is debatable how much demand there will be for an expensive luxury
car in a market where both companies and individuals have limited
spending power, overall car sales are still climbing 4 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And GM is looking for another project to invest in, expecting
the market for small cars to grow even faster than for larger
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at China as an emerging market, although maybe not
as bright as it looked two years ago, it still looks very stable,''
said Larry Zahner, president of General Motors China.

   SHANGHAI, China _ Across the river from this city's majestic
waterfront, in an area that was swampland not long ago, a gleaming
collection of skyscrapers is emerging. The most impressive,
ambitiously named the World Financial Center, is scheduled to
become the tallest building in the world when it is completed in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters hope the area, known as Pudong, will become China's
Wall Street, with investment banks and other financial institutions
alongside a stock exchange with state-of-the-art technology that
opened earlier this year. A new airport is under construction in
Pudong; so is a $1 billion General Motors plant that will make
Buick sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the ambitious plans, however, occupancy rates in
Pudong are only around 70 percent. The Shanghai real estate market
has gone bust, after years of boom, and pessimists argue that it
portends a collapse in the spectacularly fast growth that China has
enjoyed since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So many of its neighbors in Asia are mired in financial wreckage
that economists and international traders fear that China may be
the last and heftiest domino.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government-ordered closing of the Guangdong
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., a big investment company
swamped by debt, heightened concern about the vulnerability of
China's rickety financial system, already burdened by insolvent
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese consumers are still spending, construction teams are
still working 24-hour shifts and planners are moving ahead with
hugely ambitious development plans. Despite all the ominous
reminders of the dangers attending the nation's wrenching shift
from a planned economy to a market economy, there is reason for
optimism that the economy will grow in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, China has escaped the worst ravages of Asia's
financial crisis because it is still so far behind the rest of the
world in its efforts to create a modern economy; with a striving
population of 1.2 billion people, it has a per capita income of
only about $350 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Its incomplete economic transition is, oddly enough, something
of a blessing now. For one thing, China's currency is not freely
traded, so speculation isn't a big problem. For another, its main
stock markets are closed to foreign investors and are thus immune
to the large-scale withdrawals of capital that have plagued other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of China's banks are run by the state, and though
they are deeply in debt, the banks face no shareholder pressure to
account for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still way behind, so they've got a lot of easy
catching up to do,'' said Brewer Stone, head of investment banking
in Asia for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There is vast potential for improving the efficiency of Chinese
companies, Stone said, as well as for creating new products that
Chinese consumers do not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   Citing one example, Stone pointed to a Chinese company called
Hai'er, which has built a remarkably successful refrigerator and
household appliance business stressing follow-up service. At a time
when multinational companies are scaling back their operations in
Asia, Hai'er is planning a big expansion into the personal computer
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot less bullish on China after what has happened over
the past year,'' Stone said. ``But the bottom line is that China
still has much to do in terms of productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Within China, there is a debate about whether the leadership
will be able to achieve the 8 percent growth rate that they have
promised. With a restructuring of state-owned companies turning
millions of urban workers out in the streets, any serious slowdown
could have potentially disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's leaders say they are planning a $1 trillion public
works program to keep the economy growing at a time when exports to
neighboring Asian countries are falling sharply. Whether or not
they succeed, signs point to enough pent-up demand among China's
consumers to keep things humming for a while.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has made a big bet with its plant in Pudong, and
plans to start assembling sedans there later this year. Although it
is debatable how much demand there will be for an expensive luxury
car in a market where both companies and individuals have limited
spending power, overall car sales are still climbing 4 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And GM is looking for another project to invest in, expecting
the market for small cars to grow even faster than for larger
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at China as an emerging market, although maybe not
as bright as it looked two years ago, it still looks very stable,''
said Larry Zahner, president of General Motors China.

   WASHINGTON _ A two-year campaign by the Clinton administration
to convince major oil companies that they should quickly build a
multi-billion-dollar pipeline in the Caucasus, a campaign that has
become a centerpiece of American foreign policy, appears to be on
the brink of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to
make a decision later this month about how to begin transporting
the vast amounts of oil that are believed to lie under and around
the Caspian Sea. For the region's fragile new nations, wedged
between Russia and Iran, the decision may be a momentous turning
point.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian region has emerged as the world's newest stage for
big-power politics. It not only offers oil companies the prospect
of great wealth, but provides a stage for high-stakes competition
among world powers.
</P>
<P>
   This grand rivalry has begun with an intense competition for
control over pipeline routes that will carry Caspian oil to foreign
markets. Much depends on the outcome, because these pipelines will
not simply carry oil but will also define new corridors of trade
and power. The nation or alliance that controls pipeline routes
could hold sway over the Caspian region for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been exerting every form of
persuasion at its disposal to persuade the oil companies to choose
a route that would run from Baku, the capital of oil-rich
Azerbaijan, through Turkey to its Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. But
it is evidently losing the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, congressional aides and oil executives
said in interviews last week that the companies will probably
decide that the American-backed pipeline is too expensive to build
now. The companies are expected to announce that they will rely on
a much shorter pipeline that is already being built from Azerbaijan
to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, or an enlarged
pipeline along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   From Georgia, the oil would be loaded into tankers and shipped
across the Black Sea toward Europe _ a move that not only would
deny potentially billions of dollars in revenue to Turkey, a U.S.
ally, but would mean a sharp increase in oil tanker traffic through
the narrow Bosporus strait, which Turkey strenuously opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is expected to be announced on Oct. 29, and a
senior executive of the oil consortium, Robin Branagan, asserted in
a telephone interview from Baku that ``at the moment all options
are still open.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington, however, expect that the
American-backed route will not be chosen. They are already debating
how serious a setback it is for the administration and the security
interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment, but I wouldn't call it a defeat,'' said
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. ``Half a loaf is better than nothing.
The oil is going to come out on an east-west axis, rather than
south through Iran or north through Russia. And Baku-Ceyhan may
still happen down the road.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies are expected to couch their announcement in
terms that will be as reassuring as possible to all parties and to
include a pledge to build the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline someday. But
that is not enough to console some in Washington who have worked
hard to secure an immediate commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a defeat, to be honest,'' said a State
Department official who concentrates on Caspian issues. ``We pushed
this project to the top of our agenda, but we weren't able to
provide the sweeteners or whatever was necessary to get it done. We
wanted to get something for nothing. It's a setback for our
commercial interests and certainly for our prestige. It's another
case of talking big but not backing up what we say.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said one reason the United States was not able to
impose its will on the oil companies was that President Clinton has
``lost the power of moral persuasion'' because of scandals that
surround him.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more tangible factors at play.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the low price of oil, which made the companies
reluctant to embrace a project that could cost $4 billion or more;
uncertainty about how much oil the Caspian will produce over the
next few years, and hope that U.S. sanctions against Iran may soon
collapse, making a pipeline through Iran possible.
</P>
<P>
   The administration favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it
would pass through only relatively friendly countries _ Azerbaijan,
Georgia and Turkey _ and would bind them closer to the West;
because it would pull Azerbaijan and Georgia out of the Russian
shadow; and because it would not pass through either Russia or
Iran, both of which have offered routes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the administration, however, the Baku-Ceyhan
route is also the longest and most expensive to build of all
proposed routes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the oil companies discreetly asked the Clinton
administration if it would be willing to pay part of the cost of
building its favored Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. They were told that any
such payment would be viewed as a government handout to the oil
industry, and was therefore politically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to subsidize the Baku-Ceyhan line themselves, U.S.
officials urged Turkey, through which most of the line would run,
to offer the companies a generous package of incentives and tax
breaks. They said this week that Turkey never produced such a
package, and complained that the instability of Turkey's government
has made it a difficult partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil companies sometimes don't even know who they should be
negotiating with over there,'' asserted one oil consultant. ``We
kept telling the Turks that they had to come to the table with
something to offer, but it didn't work. Now of course they're going
to be very upset, but in part they brought this on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are working to assure that the text of
the companies' announcement is as positive to U.S. interests as
possible. Several said that given economic realities, they could
understand a decision by the companies to build a pipeline only as
far as Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would reflect the difficulty of getting a consensus on all
the cost issues at a time of low oil prices and of anxiety about
large capital investments,'' said Ambassador-at-Large Stephen
Sestanovich, who has helped shape U.S. policy toward Caspian
countries. ``Given all this, the companies naturally want to be
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to making Baku-Ceyhan happen,'' Sestanovich
said. ``A couple of years ago people didn't take the idea of an
east-west corridor seriously at all. Now everyone can see it's just
a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   An oil company executive involved in making the pipeline
decision said that by building a pipeline to Georgia, the companies
would be responding to U.S. concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have received what they want, which is an east-west
route, but in a phased approach,'' the executive said. ``Most
things in life come in stages. If you're going to build a huge new
house, do you build it all now or start small and expand it as you
need it? That's how we're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline from Baku to Georgia's Black Sea coast is already
under construction, but it will not have enough capacity to handle
the heavy volumes of oil that are expected to be shipped from the
Caspian in coming years. The fact that a right of way already
exists, however, would make construction of a larger-capacity
pipeline relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear what the companies will do with their oil
once it arrives at the Black Sea. The Bosporus is the only maritime
route out of the Black Sea. It runs through the center of Istanbul
and is already overcrowded. Turkish officials say it cannot sustain
a sharp increase in tanker traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey, in a telephone interview,
declined to comment on the oil companies' deliberations until they
officially announce their conclusion. But he said competition for
pipeline routes would shape events in the Caspian region for
decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a new complex of economic and strategic issues that
will shape the next century,'' Cem said. ``Certain countries in the
region will become big players in world affairs, and countries
outside the region are anxious to press their own interests. The
rivalry, the competition for influence, has already begun.''

A JEW'S ODYSSEY FROM CATHOLIC NUN TO SAINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Germany, Netherlands)  (Eds: See also CANONIZATION-STEIN) 
(mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ At a Mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday, Pope John Paul
II will pronounce Edith Stein, a renowned Jewish intellectual who
became a Carmelite nun and died at Auschwitz, a saint and a martyr
for the Roman Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein, while undoubtedly a remarkable woman, is perhaps
one of the most contested choices for canonization of John Paul's
pontificate, which celebrates its 20th year next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she was beatified in 1987, many Jewish groups and
members of her family have questioned the Vatican's logic and
sensitivity, arguing that Edith Stein was sent to the gas chambers
because she was a Jew, and not because she was a nun.
</P>
<P>
   In canonizing Sister Teresia Benedicta, the name she adopted
when she took the veil, the Vatican feels it is paying homage to
her as a Jew and as an extraordinary Christian _ and to the tens of
thousands of Catholic priests and nuns who were also killed by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   By singling out a Jewish convert, though, the pope is reopening
the Vatican to questions about the role of the Roman Catholic
Church during the Holocaust and how the Vatican views that clouded
history.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who has sought to make reconciliation between
Catholics and Jews a hallmark of his papacy and who earlier this
year issued an ``act of repentance'' for the failure of Catholics
to deter the mass killing of Jews, has also persistently chosen
saints that, to critics, seem to undercut that healing process.
</P>
<P>
   The canonization of Edith Stein, which coincides with a roiling
controversy in Poland over the erection of crosses in a gravel pit
adjacent to Auschwitz, is not an isolated move. Last weekend the
pope traveled to Croatia to beatify as a martyr Cardinal Alojzije
Stepinac, who was persecuted by the Communists during the Cold War.
Although the Vatican argues that the cardinal saved hundreds of
Jewish lives during World War II, he is still viewed by Serbs and
many Jews as a symbol of the Catholic Church's complicity with the
Fascist regime in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unnecessary and painful act,'' Abraham Foxman,
national director of the Anti-Defamation League in New York, said
of Edith Stein's canonization. ``It's another step towards
Christianizing or universalizing the Holocaust. By saying everybody
was a victim, it's a way of saying the church had no role or
responsibility.'' He continued, ``Given all the painful, unresolved
issues, why her, and why now?''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who has beatified 805 people and canonized 280,
has made more saints than any other pope. He has revived the
process and made it a cornerstone of his papacy. Like the
encyclicals and apostolic letters he issued, the saints he named
will define his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the beatifications and canonizations of dozens of
African and Asian saints, signal his long-stated desire to broaden
the base of the church. The canonization of Edith Stein _ and the
planned beatification of the wartime pope, Pius XII _ reflect the
pope's stated wish to seek redemption for the church during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, 78 and ailing but determined to usher in the third
millennium, also seems in a hurry to complete goals that an
eventual successor might not share. The selection of Edith Stein is
the latest, perhaps most dramatic example of how the process of
making saints has been changed, speeded up and streamlined by the
pope. In a 1983 overhaul of the process, for example, the
adversarial role of the promoter of the faith, commonly known as
the devil's advocate, who argued the ``con'' in each case, was
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein's path to martyrdom is convoluted. In 1942, she was
a refugee in a convent in the Netherlands. That year, the Dutch
bishops were told by the Nazis that if they abandoned their
intention to denounce the deportation of Jews, the Nazis would
spare Jewish converts. When the bishops refused, Edith Stein and
hundreds of other converts were deported. The Congregation for the
Causes of Saints concluded that because the Nazis rounded up Jewish
converts in retaliation for the bishops' defiance, they were
persecuting the Catholic Church, and hence, Edith Stein.
</P>
<P>
   As the religion writer Kenneth Woodward described it in his book
``Making Saints,'' the Dutch bishops' act was a kind of ``class
action'' that covered all converted Jews who died as a result of
the bishops' resistance. The Rev. Simeon Tomas Fernandez, the
81-year-old Carmelite priest who has been the postulator, or chief
church advocate, for Edith Stein's cause since 1962, does not
disagree. ``They were all martyrs, of course, but nobody else was
proclaimed a saint by the local population,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican reasoning baffles some of Edith Stein's survivors.
``If the Nazis wanted to persecute the Catholic Church, why didn't
they arrest the clergy who wrote the letter?'' said Susanne
Batzdorff, 77, a niece of Edith Stein who fled the Nazis by
emigrating to the United States in 1939. ``Instead, they rounded up
the Jewish converts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Batzdorff, who said she planned to attend the canonization,
explained that the family still views her as a Jewish martyr.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Edith Stein was an exceptional woman,
as Jew and as Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1891 on Yom Kippur to an Orthodox family in Breslau,
Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), she was a brilliant philosophy
student in Gottingen, where Edmund Husserl, a founder of
phenomenology, made her his assistant and protege. She began her
academic career as an atheist, but gradually grew intrigued by
Christian theology. She became a Roman Catholic in 1922, inspired
partly by the life of Saint Theresa of Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Husserl's recommendation, she was denied a teaching
position at the University of Freiburg because she was a woman. She
taught at a Catholic girls' school, then in 1932 became an
instructor at the Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in Muenster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933 she was forced to quit because of a Nazi decree banning
Jews from teaching positions. That year she entered a Carmelite
convent in Cologne. When she took her vows, she offered her life in
atonement for the sins of her ``unbelieving'' Jewish people. The
Vatican note omits that detail from her biography. She continued
her philosophical and theological writings at the convent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among her admirers was the Rev. Karol Joseph Wojtyla, a Polish
priest who read her works while studying phenomenology and theology
in Rome in 1948. Wojtyla is now Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, after Kristallnacht, she fled Germany with her sister
Rosa for a Carmelite convent in Echt, Netherlands. After the Nazis
occupied the Netherlands, she began seeking refuge in Switzerland,
but convents there could not find room for her sister, so they
remained in Echt. After the bishops' letter, she was arrested on
Aug. 2. As she was led away, one witness reported, she told her
sister, ``Come, Rosa, we are going for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   She died at Auschwitz on Aug. 9, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The official quest for her sainthood began in 1962, when her
cause was opened before the ecclesiastical tribunal of Cologne. At
first local clergy members put her cause on the path of saintliness
for ``heroic virtue,'' which required an exemplary life and, at the
time, several miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein's cause was one of the first to benefit from the
1983 reform of canonization, which relaxed some requirements and
simplified many bureaucratic procedures. Among other things,
martyrs were no longer required to perform a miracle for
beatification, the last step before canonization. That year, the
bishops of Poland and Germany petitioned the Vatican to consider
Edith Stein a martyr. Within four years, she was beatified.
</P>
<P>
   The cure recognized by the church as a miracle, necessary for
canonization, occurred in 1987. Benedicta McCarthy, who was named
after Sister Teresia Benedicta, was 2 and a half years old when she
swallowed a huge dose of Tylenol and was rushed to the hospital.
Her family and friends prayed to the child's namesake and her
recovery, which amazed her doctors, was pronounced a miracle before
the pope in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vatican's view, nothing else stood in the way of adding
Edith Stein's name to the roster of Roman Catholic saints. ``We
have no assurances that the climate will be any different in 20
years,'' the Rev. Peter Gumpel, a Jesuit priest and former top
official of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, replied when
asked why the church was canonizing Edith Stein now. ``Our task now
is to set the historic record straight. We cannot make concessions
that violate the truth.''

JAPANESE CULT THAT USED NERVE GAS HAS RESURFACED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The cult that planted nerve gas in the Tokyo subway
three years ago, killing 12 people and injuring thousands more, is
back.
</P>
<P>
   Aum Shinrikyo, which was found responsible for the sarin attack
and for several murders with VX, the most toxic nerve agent known,
is regrouping, recruiting new members at home and abroad, and
raising vast sums of money, security officials and Japanese and
American terrorism experts say. The U.S. State Department has
designated it a terrorist group, although it has not been linked to
any illegal acts since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of the sect that masterminded the most serious
terrorist attack in Japan's modern history, the officials said, is
a result partly of Japan's unwillingness to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo district court deprived Aum Shinrikyo of its legal
religious status in 1995 and liquidated its assets after declaring
it insolvent the following year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese government decided last year that the Justice
Ministry had not proved that the group posed an ``immediate or
obvious threat'' to Japanese society. It rejected a request from
security officials to outlaw the sect under a 1952 law against
subversive activities. The law has never been applied.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, despite security experts' warnings, Aum Shinrikyo,
arguing that the government has effectively sanctioned its
existence, has used the decision to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no word of repentance or apology,'' concludes
the Public Security Investigation Agency, the main intelligence arm
of Japan's Ministry of Justice, in a 70-page report issued in
January. Moreover, the document states, Aum Shinrikyo _ the name is
the Buddhist mantra ``Om'' followed by ``Supreme Truth'' _ has not
revised or abandoned ``its dangerous doctrine that justifies murder
to achieve its ends.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report and interviews with Japanese security
officials and independent experts, the group now has about 5,000
followers, including 500 ``monks,'' followers who are ``ordained''
and live communally. It operates some 28 installations at 18
branches (down from a peak of 24) throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   A BAN IN RUSSIA PROVES NO DETERRENT
</P>
<P>
   Despite being banned in Russia, the group is still active there,
as well as in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. It maintains
encrypted Web sites and chat rooms in Japanese, English and Russian
and controls a network of electronic, computer and other stores
that generated about $30 million in revenues in 1997. Its
publishing company, now its second-largest source of revenue,
reopened in April and issues at least one book or pamphlet a month,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is far weaker and poorer than it was at the peak of
its influence in 1995, when it owned about 30 pieces of property
throughout Japan, as well as a business empire that controlled
restaurants, computers and other technology companies. Its net
worth was estimated at $20 million to $1 billion. It was also said
to have 10,000 followers in Japan and up to 40,000 in other
countries, 30,000 of them in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group's resurgence deeply troubles security
officials, who say they monitor known followers and businesses 24
hours a day and continue searching for three of its leaders accused
of involvement in earlier plots and deadly assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the group's resurgence abound. Among them, say the
police and other experts, is Trisal, a store that customizes
computer systems at discount prices. The tiny office, four stories
up a steep, narrow staircase in a small Tokyo office building, is
staffed by very young salespeople and jammed with bargain hunters,
most of them also young.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the cult had a financial stake in the company, a
Trisal spokesman said, ``Not really.'' And a spokesman for the
group declined to comment on whether it has a financial stake in
Trisal or in any of the other electronics companies that Japanese
authorities identify as directly or indirectly controlled by the
sect.
</P>
<P>
   But Hiroshi Araki, the spokesman since his predecessor's arrest
in 1996, did not deny that Aum Shinrikyo had financial ties to
several businesses reportedly owned by or employing its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming them and discussing such things would only help the
government harass the companies and people who work for them,''
Araki explained in an interview in the group's library, which was
filled with books and pamphlets describing the beliefs of the
sect's founder and spiritual leader, Shoko Asahara.
</P>
<P>
   The half-blind 43-year-old guru preached his own blend of
Hinduism and Buddhism with an apocalyptic spin. According to his
books and preaching, his followers will rise from the ashes of
Armageddon. To speed the new order, he planned to help destroy the
old one by assembling a corps of young scientists to develop and
use chemical, biological and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Asahara remains in jail while being tried on 17 counts of
murder, kidnapping, trafficking in guns and drugs, the subway
attack with sarin nerve gas, and other assaults with chemical or
biological weapons. He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tokyo attack, the police said that 427 people, known
or suspected members of Aum Shinrikyo, were arrested; of those, 215
were eventually released without charge. Of the ones let go, the
police said, 155 have returned to the cult. Of those charged, 156
have been convicted. More than 30 members are still on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the convictions, arrests and what the police acknowledge
is constant surveillance, the cult has continued to hold regular
training sessions, recruiting members and raising money. In May,
more than 500 believers and others curious about the sect gathered
at a resort near Mount Fuji to hear sermons and receive training in
yoga, meditation and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials and private experts estimate that the group
raised about 50 million yen, or about $350,000, from that meeting
alone.
</P>
<P>
   While the police say there is no evidence that the cult has
resumed its efforts to make or buy weapons of mass destruction, the
cult still worries them. Using anthrax, botulism toxin and a
variety of other germ or chemical weapons, the sect repeatedly
conducted covert attacks against targets including a U.S. military
base where thousands of Americans live, throughout the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although these earlier efforts failed, the sect's secret sarin
attack on an apartment complex in Matsumoto almost a year before
its Tokyo subway attack resulted in seven deaths and 600 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   After the police finally raided the sect's compound at the foot
of Mount Fuji following the subway sarin attack, they found tons of
chemicals for use in weapons, although the cult's stocks of VX, 50
kilograms of sarin and other deadly agents had already been
destroyed, said Anthony Tu, a Colorado State University chemist who
advised the Japanese police on the case.
</P>
<P>
   While many Aum Shinrikyo members are now unwilling to identify
themselves as such, security officials say that hundreds of
hard-core believers remain despite the 1995 subway attack. Many
provide financial assistance to fellow members, officials say, and
even to the three senior cult fugitives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine that such fugitives could still be at
large here without the active help of believers,'' one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials expressed particular concern about the
group's continued allure for young scientists, engineers and other
well-educated people who might be able to reassemble an arms
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Izumi, a reporter at the daily Asahi Shimbun, said that
almost 200 of some 1,400 Aum monks investigated by security
officials were university students or graduates. Most of those who
put bags of sarin nerve gas in the subways in 1995 were graduates
of the science departments of leading universities.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts have interpreted the rise of religious cults _
185,000 of which are registered with the government _ as a response
to the strains of modern Japanese society. They also caution about
the persistence of the underlying conditions that leave young
Japanese vulnerable to groups like Aum.
</P>
<P>
   As Taro Maki, the former editor of Sunday Mainichi, put it, ``In
a country whose fathers are utterly preoccupied with work, whose
mothers want their children to be winners and whose educational
system prides itself on the fiercest of competition for admission,
these new-new religions, as they are called _ or pseudoreligions,
as I call them _ are attractive to kids who don't quite make the
cut, or to those who do but see little purpose to their lives.''
Maki waged an early campaign against Aum Shinrikyo.
</P>
<P>
   Even many defectors remain mesmerized by Asahara. Still calling
him their father, they have told Robert Jay Lifton, the American
psychiatrist who is writing a book about the group, that the guru
retains almost mystical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Araki, the Aum Shinrikyo spokesman, said he had abandoned art
history studies at Kyoto University after attending a lecture by
Asahara. The guru, he recalled, left him with an almost
``indescribable sense of peace and inner harmony.'' Asked how he
could defend the guru's orders to kill innocent people with sarin,
Araki, 30, replied that he still could not believe that Asahara was
responsible for the attacks, because the guru ``would not give such
an unjust command.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree about whether the group is still dangerous.
Many argue that with Asahara and other leaders in jail, it poses
little immediate threat. Even security officials concede that given
their surveillance, it would be unlikely to stage illegal actions
now. But they worry about copycat attacks, and about Aum
Shinrikyo's potential.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, they say, the group is led by a secretive
steering committee of six senior members who have increasingly
focused on two of Asahara's six children _ his third daughter and
his youngest son _ as spiritual symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But by next summer, Fumihiro Joyu, the group's former spokesman,
may be out of jail, since he has been charged only with relatively
minor crimes like perjury. Because he continues to declare his
adoration of Asahara and has become something of a teen idol _
girls are said to swoon over his photo and snap up Joyu T-shirts
and posters _ government and private experts fear that he could
regalvanize the group and reunite its warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICIAL AMBIVALENCE AIDS SECT'S CAUSE
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is little support within political circles
for banning the group, even among some of its most ardent
opponents. Maki, for one, argues that outlawing the group would
only drive it underground, making it harder to track and possibly
compelling it to ever more desperate acts.
</P>
<P>
   He and others also trace this hesitancy to a reaction against
the prewar government's repression of political, and particularly
religious, groups. Noting that Japan's modern legal system was
adopted after World War II at the behest of the United States, the
government has been sensitive to any charges of limiting religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Japan's political left and other small groups fear the
precedent: they might be the law's next targets, said Seizaburo
Sato, research director of Japan's Institute for International
Policy Studies. Religious status in Japan affords considerable
political sanctuary. So other religions, some of which support
political groups and agendas, oppose any government action that
might constrain their own freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sato noted, for instance, that the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist sect
founded here in the 1930s, recently delivered 7.5 million votes in
national elections to the party it supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``So no political party is going to alienate religious groups
and sects by supporting a ban on the Aum,'' Sato said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoko Egawa, the author of several books on Aum Shinrikyo,
argues that short of banning the group, the government could do
more to discourage its activities. ``The authorities could use the
tax and employment laws more effectively to help curtail their
resurgence,'' she said, ``but they do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even suspect a widespread sympathy for cult
members who say they knew nothing about the violence. They embraced
the group because of its opposition to the materialism that, while
making Japan the world's second-strongest economy, has also created
nostalgia for values that may have been discarded in the postwar
rush to modernize.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoichi Funabashi, the diplomatic correspondent of Asahi
Shimbun, rejects this. He said opposition to invoking the law
against subversive activities reflected the broader political
paralysis that has prevented Japan from taking serious measures to
resolve its economic crisis. ``Civil society has an obligation to
protect itself,'' he said.

WASHINGTON VOTERS UPSET, BUT CONSEQUENCES REMAIN UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Wash. _ There is no question that voters are upset
here in Washington, a state that has been a particularly accurate
electoral bellwether in recent years. It broadly backed President
Clinton and congressional Democrats in 1992, turned to Republicans
with spectacular vengeance in 1994, then returned to Clinton in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in 1998, the state's voters are again distressed over
events in Washington, D.C., where the House of Representatives has
decided to begin a historic inquiry that could lead to the
president's impeachment. But three and a half weeks before election
day, it is also clear that many voters are not at all sure where to
direct their anger _ and thus whether they will do so in any
distinct fashion in the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they'd take the whole bunch _ Clinton, that woman, Ken
Starr, the Republicans in Congress, the media _ I wish they'd take
the bunch, put them on the Queen Mary, tow it away and sink the
whole thing at sea,'' said William H. Stout, a retired machine
operator in this Columbia River port town. ``But no, I can't really
tell you who I blame the most for how out of control this thing has
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Rheaume, a 55-year-old nurse at St. John Hospital here,
was also embittered by the scandal but perplexed about where to pin
the blame. ``Democrats and Republicans both, they're having their
little soap opera over there, and it's costing me $40 million and
counting,'' she said. ``It really makes me furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because of this uncertainty, many political experts
here detect a great degree of volatility in the electorate, just as
Congress is recessing and campaigns are kicking into high gear. The
impeachment issue could possibly congeal as a major factor in the
final weeks, they say, perhaps affecting turnout. But it could just
as possibly become a curious non-factor in the elections _ a major
matter on people's minds, to be sure, but not one that they will
translate into a reason to punish one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole sense of anger out there is very real, but it's also
like a heat-seeking missile that's missing a target,'' said Robert
Gogerty, a Seattle-based political consultant who usually works for
Democrats but is not involved in any state races this year. ``It's
really complicated, and people don't quite know who to blame. But
if they do lock onto something in these next few weeks, God help
the target.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogerty and many of the candidates running this year also agree
that in a very general way, 1994 represented a referendum of sorts
on Bill Clinton (even though he was not on the ballot), while
1996's congressional elections represented a referendum on House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans' handling of their
first majority in Congress in 40 years. But the 1998 elections,
they say, are not necessarily being seen by voters as any sort of
referendum on whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, none of the forces that seem to inspire the most
ire among dozens of voters interviewed here _ Clinton, Kenneth
Starr and his team of prosecutors, the news media, even Monica
Lewinsky _ are on any ballot in any congressional election in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that people could train their sights on the
Republicans who control Congress, who were broadly seen as inclined
to push for the president's removal, or the Democrats, viewed as
more lenient. And there are candidates of both parties trying to
seize such ground: in at least four races in the state involving
congressional incumbents, the challengers _ two from each major
party _ are urging voters to send a message about the impeachment
matter by voting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taber, the Republican challenger to Rep. Adam Smith, a
Democrat, said a vote for him would send a message that the
president should be made to pay for ``illegal and immoral deeds.''
Jay Inslee, a former Democratic representative running against Rep.
Rick White, a Republican, said that he would work to bring the
whole matter to a close and let Congress focus on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But many other candidates said that they saw no evidence the
inquiry was a ``swing issue'' among voters, and that they were not
pushing it on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this race is and should be and will be about local
issues,'' said Brian Baird, the Democratic candidate for an open
seat in the state's third congressional district, which covers much
of southwest Washington, from the fast-growing, white-collar and
Republican-leaning suburb of Vancouver, Wash., to more
traditionally Democratic, working-class strongholds like Longview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baird, a psychology professor at Pacific Lutheran
University in Olympia, nor his Republican opponent, state Sen. Don
Benton, have made the impeachment inquiry an overt issue in the
campaign, though they acknowledge that voters care about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm hearing from people is that there's shame enough and
blame enough to go around,'' said Baird, who came within 887 votes
two years ago of defeating the Republican incumbent, Linda Smith,
who is now giving up the seat to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're disappointed in the president,'' Baird added.
``They're angry at Kenneth Starr. They're upset with the Congress.
They're frustrated with the media. But I don't think it all points
in a particular direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton, who said he had not read ``one whit of the Starr
report'' because he had been so busy campaigning, said he did not
raise the issue of impeachment proceedings in his standard pitch to
voters, though he did say it could be a factor in his and other
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very relevant,'' said Benton, ``not that
particular case per se, but it has certainly brought the issue of
morality and integrity and honesty of our public servants more to
the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   One distinct possibility, of course, is that many disaffected
voters will simply stay home. In 1994, many traditionally
Democratic voters did so, a critical factor in the Republicans'
stunning success here.
</P>
<P>
   But turnout was by no means close to historic lows in the recent
round of primary balloting in Washington. And with several
controversial initiatives and a closely fought Senate race between
Ms. Smith and Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat, on November's
ballot, most political observers here doubt that turnout will be as
low as it was in 1994, when 51 percent of registered voters went to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   John Kornbrust, a 32-year-old truck driver in Longview, said
that he voted for Clinton in 1992, ``didn't get around to voting''
in 1994, probably because he felt vaguely disillusioned with the
president at the time, then did turn out in 1996 for Clinton again
because he felt the Republican-controlled Congress was not
interested in looking out for working-class people like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll vote this year,'' Kornbrust said. ``I think it's
important.'' He said that he had not made up his mind on either the
Senate contest or the local congressional race, but that Clinton's
personal conduct and the impeachment proceedings were not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it basically comes down to the same old thing it always
does,'' he said. ``With Republicans, you'll probably get your taxes
cut and they'll stop at least some of the giveaways, but then
they'll nail you on stuff like Social Security and health care,''
programs he thought Democrats were more likely to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the dynamic he outlined is clearly present in
the congressional race. Benton promotes himself as a champion of
smaller government and tax cuts while Baird promises that he will
fight to protect programs like Social Security and to improve
education.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Washington state have zigzagged in recent elections in
a way that reflects the national electorate. In 1992, voters here
backed Clinton and returned their traditional Democratic majority
in the state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, though, they turned on Democrats, booting House Speaker
Thomas Foley out of office and handing seven of the nine
congressional seats to Republicans, the biggest such switch of any
state. But in 1996, just as in the country at large, they backed
Clinton for re-election and gave Republicans a diminished majority,
as one of the state's seats switched back to the Democrats and two
others nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, many voters in the third congressional
district said they would be satisfied to continue with a Clinton
presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see right now looks pretty good,'' said Byam Youngman,
a medical-equipment dealer in Vancouver. ``They're balancing the
budget. There's a surplus, probably a tax cut. I guess the
president gets some of the credit for that, just because he's the
president, but I think the Congress is mostly responsible for the
good things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the president's conduct weighed on their minds.
``I was brought up in a Democratic family, and a lot of my
relatives would still vote for Jack the Ripper if he was the
Democratic candidate on the ballot,'' said Pat Taylor, a
50-year-old glassware dealer from the town of Pe Ell. ``But I don't
think we should just say forget it, let the president get away with
it, which is what I think Democrats want to do. I listened to Ross
Perot the other night, and he's right _ what kind of message is
that sending to our kids?''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Tom Bert, a Longview contractor still making up his
mind about the elections, ``I guess I'm in a situation where,
depending what happens, if a vote for the Republicans is a vote
against what the president has done, I probably would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Broxton, 45, the manager of a Longview tile company,
said she would be a firm Democratic vote this year, in part because
she thought party leaders would press for a ``somewhat quicker
resolution'' of the Clinton matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just dirty pool, the way the Republicans are making too
much out of all this,'' Ms. Broxton said. ``They went too far, way
too far, and all it's done is hurt the United States. This process
makes us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy Kennedy, 42, a welder and construction worker who usually
votes Democratic but passed on voting at all in 1994, said she
thought the Republicans were behaving ridiculously by going after
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is between him and Hillary, and if I were
Hillary I'd slap him silly,'' she said. ``But it's not the
Republicans' business to be slapping him silly over this.''

   MOSCOW _ The world watched tens of thousands of Communists and
their allies march on the Kremlin last week, demanding the removal
of President Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a telegenic protest
it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of Russian discontent. For
that, you had to go 5,300 miles and six time zones east, to the
Siberian city of Yakutsk.
</P>
<P>
   Yakutsk has 250,000 people, no money and more hardship than
Moscow could dream of. And there, at the appointed hour of 10 a.m.,
in the town square across from the requisite statue of Lenin,
perhaps 40 people showed up to unfurl a few red banners and stamp
their feet against the cold. By 11 the square was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in Yakutsk was far more common across Russia on
Wednesday than was the mob of marchers in that television broadcast
from Moscow. There is a lesson there. Since Russia's feral brand of
capitalism started crumbling Aug. 17, bringing down the banking
system, foreign trade, the ruble and most of a government with it,
everybody has been waiting for the moment when the population cries
``Enough!'' and takes matters into its own anarchic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it ain't going to happen _ not anytime soon, anyway.
Russia, the cradle and exporter of global revolution, turns out to
be not much of a consumer. It clings to the here-and-now with a
vengeance _ maybe out of habit, almost certainly out of fear that
stirring the pot will only make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesians exploded into riots and looting under similar
economic circumstances a year ago. Russians complain, then conclude
their harangues with the national motto, ``Shto dyelat?''_ ``What
is to be done?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it is beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem, I think, is in the mentality,'' said Andrei
Gnatiuk, who heads a political consulting firm involved in election
campaigns across Russia. ``People have to understand that they're
the masters of their own fates. Socialism greatly perverted us. We
became used to being guaranteed a piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Masha Lipman, an editor and political analyst in Moscow for the
weekly news magazine Itogi, agrees. In 75 years of Communist rule,
people traded freedom for an assured, if sometimes bleak,
existence. She says that smothered the democratic notion that
individuals working together can change the social order.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that history backs them up: The Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991 mostly of its own weight, not out of any
collective national action. Yeltsin enjoyed popular support at the
time, but he was a catalyst of change, not the agent.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of the succeeding crises _ not the parliament's
attempt to seize power from Yeltsin amid hyperinflation in 1993 nor
the current collapse _ have ordinary Russians been much more than
interested spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that, of course, may well be due to the quality of the
alternative. The Communist Party has never shed its reputation for
the sort of rigidity and wrongheadedness, let alone cruelty, that
contributed to the Soviet Union's downfall, and its leaders today
are uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Bolsheviks were Yeltsin's major foes in 1993 and again last
week. Many major newspapers saw the turnout on Wednesday _ less
than a third of even modest projections _ as a major setback for
the Communist Party, which had seemed on the upswing with its
return to power in key parts of Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not simply the Communists. Russians have yet to swarm
to any of the strongmen seeking to fill the vacuum left by
Yeltsin's declining fortunes _ not to Moscow's authoritarian mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, or to the former general who iron-handedly runs the
huge Krasnoyarsk region of central Russia, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   One popular notion is that the country is exhausted _ by the
bloodletting during the civil war after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution; by the millions of deaths in World War II; by Stalin's
mass killings; by the wrenching changes that followed the end of
Communist rule in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, the conviction in the early 1990s that democracy
and capitalism would rescue Russia from a worse fate has more or
less been extinguished. Still, nothing has replaced it that is
attractive enough to spur people to plunge along yet another
uncharted course. The devil they know is better than the one behind
the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are angry, yes; but people are also tired,'' said
Sergei Markov, a well-known political analyst here. ``And people
are afraid of bad government much less than they're afraid of
chaos. They're prepared to have any kind of bad government more
than instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of those theories probably has some merit. Historians might
argue as well that Russia has never experienced a truly democratic
society, even now; that it was excluded from the Renaissance and
its critical links to Western political and social philosophy; that
top-down leadership, rather than bottom up, is the rule when it
comes to ruling Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may be true. But amid the general gloom over the
Russian psyche, Gnatiuk has another explanation, one that he says
is actually supported by empirical data.
</P>
<P>
   Gnatiuk says that Russians are better off than they let on, and
that they are simply not in the mood to revolt. He cites polling
data from his own consulting firm. It concludes that most Russians
believe their lives have improved in recent years, but that they
also believe the lives of their neighbors have gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is the media _ especially the Western media, now available
throughout Russia _ that have convinced them the nation is a lost
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always giving some sort of bad news that people
somewhere are eating dogs because of hunger, or eating cows and now
eating the feed and so forth,'' Gnatiuk said. ``Everyone thinks,
`The country will go out on the street and on strike because
everybody's living badly, but why should I go out on the street? I
have a TV and a refrigerator. I work; my parents have a pension.
But those who are doing badly will go out.'''

IN CONGRESS, A BREAK IN A SEASON OF SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Miss., Va., Calif., Mass., Ga.) (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress savored the sheer comfort of asexual
political skirmishing this weekend as lawmakers struggled with lost
legislative causes and artificial doomsday deadlines in their
attempt to quit and go home to face the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sent here to talk about Monica Lewinsky,'' said Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, hurrying from committee room to House floor as the
leadership pushed, then failed, with a plan to finish by Sunday. He
darted about as the nation's lawmakers tried to disentangle
themselves from a harrowing closing week that was dominated by the
House's impeachment challenge to President Clinton even as other
issues wilted on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going home to talk health care, Social Security, jobs and
education,'' Kucinich, D-Ohio, insisted, radiating delight at the
hometown prospect of Monica-free vox pop, far from the madding
Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone numbed by the White House scandal, the last-minute
hagglings between and within the two houses in the Capitol was a
tonic in the closing days. Public debate can once more romp far
from the body politic's erogenous zones to topics like the usual
last-minute repriming of the federal budget, the length of the duck
season in Mississippi and the Sense of Congress Resolution
Concerning the Inadequacy of Sewage Infrastructure Facilities in
Tijuana, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The simple sight was bracing when two gangs of rival politicians
crossed each other's paths in the Capitol press gallery to fence
and parry over the patients health care bill, which was failing on
Friday even as the impeachment inquiry took off. They verbally
charged and countercharged beyond all grand-jury risk of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan scrum featured lighthearted exchanges of greetings
at the door, then hard stares of umbrage before the cameras. And
the only thing close to a document dump _ the lurid signature event
of the long presidential inquiry _ was a mere scrap of campaign
e-mail from the Democrats' health care arsenal, somehow purloined
by Republicans. Mercifully for this, no one demanded the
appointment of an e-mailgate independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, House members marked time at their rhetorical
oars with campaign themes while their leaders privately negotiated.
``A Do-Nothing Congress!'' came the debating charge to the
Republicans as Democrats sarcastically insisted that the session's
main accomplishment was the renaming of National Airport to Ronald
Reagan National Airport. David Dreier, R-Calif., smiled back in
rebuttal, spewing a long list of claimed accomplishments and
declaring, ``Guess what? The 105th Congress has the highest
approval rating of any Congress in recent history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their effort to escape the impeachment issue as much as the
session, the lawmakers' routine obligations seemed momentarily
ennobling. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, had faced the
House in the impeachment debate on Thursday and morosely declared,
``I wish I could just ignore all this and make it go away.'' He
brightened considerably on the job by the next day when he took a
minute from the closing push to greet some Colorado schoolchidren.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders struggled to craft some sort of 105th denouement,
there were notes of poignancy in the fine print. Rep. Jay Kim,
R-Calif., who had suffered the ignominy of wearing an electronic
ankle bracelet in the Capitol in facing conviction for accepting
$250,000 in illegal campaign money, was duly pronounced guilty
under House ethics rules, too. But, already on probation and
rejected by primary voters, Kim was free of the people's business
after a six-year career.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawmakers sought to wind things down in the debating
chambers, Bob Scribner, an ebullient member of the Capitol Guide
Service, worked a floor below, fielding questions from weekend
visitors. Almost shyly, the subject of the president and the intern
and impeachment was occasionally broached, with a high school
student asking the guide if history points to how it will all turn
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what happens next,'' said Scribner, his
voice ringing in the stony majesty of the Capitol crypt. ``It's all
pretty much up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurrying through the House Rayburn office building, Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., rued the might-have-beens of this 105th Congress.
``The impeachment fight drained the energy from so many substantive
issues, and the most dramatic example was campaign finance
reform,'' he said as a frustrated co-sponsor of the campaign bill.
The measure passed the House with an unexpected surge, then
foundered as the public faced a summer flood of scandalous detail
about the presidential liaison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate killed reform without any fanfare,'' Meehan said.
``The president was handcuffed. The front pages were about Monica
Lewinsky. And the Senate didn't take any heat at all. We couldn't
even generate pressure on Al D'Amato,'' he said, underlining the
current campaign season, richer in contributions than ever. The
unmentioned advantage of Capitol incumbents eager to get home is
that the soft money levels have been quietly tripling over the last
congressional round, even as the nation's agenda is being set for
the impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   For all the steely partisanship of the session, there were human
moments noted by lawmakers, even in Thursday's incendiary House
debate kicking off the impeachment inquiry. Members on both sides
of the aisle could be seen listening closely when Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., conceded that the president lied but pleaded for
reprimand, not impeachment, as his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, rarely accused of being humble, looked up at Speaker Newt
Gingrich presiding with the gavel and, in what could only have been
a painful moment, referred to the ethical lapses of both of them in
noting: ``Both the speaker and I have been reprimanded by this
House for lying before official proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank nodded peaceably toward the speaker and added, ``That has
not kept either of us from continuing to do our duty, to our best
possible.''

<P>
   GLOBAL-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ At the crisis-wracked annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _
the institutions built 53 years ago to create global stability out
of the wreckage of World War II _ the 21st century village was
termed the ``new international financial architecture.'' President
Clinton insisted said it would be designed ``to tame the pattern of
boom-bust on an international scale.'' Unfortunately, the
groundbreaking ceremony is years away. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the House votes to
impeach Clinton, the matter goes to the Senate, which must decide,
by a two-thirds majority, whether to convict him and, thus remove
him from office. So the Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new
order of disruptive force into the Senate contests. Voters, even
those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders,
Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior and
morals, and candidates have been doing that. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCE-MERGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ As banks, brokerage firms and
insurance companies combine into huge new conglomerates, and with
legislation wending through Congress to make such mergers even
easier, there is increasing concern about the amount of personal
financial and medical data that can be collected under one roof. By
Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ The world watched tens of thousands of
Communists and their allies march on the Kremlin last week,
demanding the removal of Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a
telegenic protest it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of
Russian discontent. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Monica Lewinsky poured her
heart out to Linda Tripp, she was clearly looking for girl talk.
Girl talk runs deep. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   HALLOWEEN-LEWINSKY-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's not easy being Monica
_ even for one night. The nation's major mask makers have taken a
pass on Monica Lewinsky masks this Halloween, worried about
possible lawsuits over the use of her likeness. So revelers will
have to improvise with wigs and berets, and many plan to do so.
Party stores and costume makers report that this season's
best-selling spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and even Kenneth
Starr. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ So many of China's neighbors in Asia
are mired in financial wreckage that economists and international
traders fear that China may be the last and heftiest domino getting
ready to fall. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BIZTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wall Street loves jargon, which makes
its business sound mysterious and important and serves as a sort of
secret handshake. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   GEOPOLITICAL-CORRECTNESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If there is a
worldwide canard about political correctness, it is that it's an
American disease. Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly
incorrect. Every country has its own strain. By Donald G. McNeil
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-SEXISM-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ A first-person look at
sexist attitudes toward women in South Africa, where sexism may be
even more pervasive than official racism once was. Remarks by
President Nelson Mandela suggest he is no exception. By Suzanne
Daley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Partisan rancor is not

KOSOVO TALKS SHOW SIGNS OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The continuation of negotiations Saturday
by the U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, with both the ethnic Albanian
leadership in Kosovo and the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, suggested that enough common ground was being found to
avert NATO air strikes, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke spent about an hour and a half with Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian political leader, in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, and then returned here for still more discussions with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The longer talks went on and the more exchanges took place
between the two sides in the Kosovo conflict, the greater the
chances for a peaceful resolution, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic backs down, however, many Serbs in this
frightened capital say the mere threat of air strikes has enabled
the Yugoslav leader to strengthen rather than weaken control of his
economically depressed country.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a high likelihood, the diplomats said, that NATO
would formally declare an activation order, the last step necessary
to authorize air strikes. The secretary-general of NATO, Javier
Solana, said Saturday in Brussels that the alliance had completed
all the necessary decisions before declaring the order.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have consistently said they believe that it would
take the final authorization of air strikes to push Milosevic to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Saturday in Belgrade that Milosevic had decided
that taking NATO air strikes was not the most profitable route to
his political survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, an independent newspaper that in a crisis
like this is considered to reflect a sense of what the secretive
Milosevic is mulling, reported Saturday that the Yugoslav leader
``objects to some parts of the proposed agreement'' but that a deal
was in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Milosevic was against NATO soldiers being
part of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Senior Clinton
administration officials have said in the last several days that an
``international presence'' would be necessary in Kosovo to verify
the withdrawal of Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have also suggested that the ``presence'' would be
used to help the international aid effort that will be needed over
the winter to assist about 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
were forced to flee their homes during a three-month offensive by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not been specific about the composition of
the ``presence'' that is being contemplated. Holbrooke has noted
the opposition in Congress to sending American soldiers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph also reported that Milosevic had asked for
all economic sanctions to be lifted against Yugoslavia, including
the ban on loans from the International Monetary Fund and financing
from the World Bank. The newspaper said that Holbrooke had offered
a gradual lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holbrooke was characteristically tight-lipped about his
discussions Saturday in Pristina. The situation was ``just as
serious'' as some days ago, he said, before taking the 40-minute
flight back to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He met with a three-man negotiating team for the ethnic
Albanians in Pristina but spent the bulk of his time with Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has led the ethnic Albanian policy calling for the
independence of Kosovo rather than some kind of enhanced autonomy
within a Yugoslav framework. His peaceful pursuit of independence
has earned him Western backing over the violent guerrilla tactics
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian group trying to
win independence on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Holbrooke was the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia,
Christopher Hill, the main author of an interim political plan for
the status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's plan would restore to Kosovo some degree of autonomy,
stripped away by Milosevic in 1989, but postpone for several years
the question of independence. It also lays out details of much
greater representation of ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs
nine to one _ in the province, in the police force, the courts, a
legislature and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Holbrooke is armed with six points of negotiation
that he brought with him from a meeting with the so-called contact
group in London Friday. The group consists of Russia, the United
States and European countries that monitor events in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The points include the withdrawal of the Yugoslav national army
and the Serbian police in Kosovo to the levels that pertained
before March, when the crackdown against the guerrillas began, and
the storage of heavy weapons, the freedom for the 250,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees to return to their homes without intimidation
from Serbian police, and the start of talks based on the Hill plan.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the talks, according to U.S. officials, have
been the Serbian and Yugoslav military issues _ an immediate end to
hostilities and the withdrawal of troops and weaponry. Unless these
forces are reduced and the reductions can be verified, those ethnic
Albanians whose homes have not been destroyed in the summer
offensive will lack the confidence to return to their villages, the
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, which after a series of car bombs and similar
attacks in the past two years have fought openly since the spring
for Kosovo's independence, said Saturday that they would continue
to respect a cease-fire they announced on Friday.

MIRACLE IN MASSACHUSETTS QUALIFIED STEIN FOR SAINTHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With CONTROVERSIAL-CANONIZATION) 
(mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The miracle that qualified Edith Stein for sainthood began with
the kind of thoroughly avoidable childhood accident that haunts the
imagination of every conscientious parent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when Benedicta McCarthy was 2 and a half years old, her
parents left her for a few days at her home in Brockton, Mass.,
with her 11 older siblings, the eldest of whom was 20. Unseen by
her brothers and sisters, Benedicta discovered the family's cache
of free Tylenol samples in colorful plastic packets, and took them
for candy.
</P>
<P>
   When her siblings noticed that Benedicta was acting strangely,
they took her to the local hospital, where doctors discovered that
she had swallowed enough Tylenol to amount to 16 lethal doses.
</P>
<P>
   Benedicta's parents, arriving home, learned that their little
pigtailed daughter was in a coma, her liver and kidneys failing,
her body suffering a staphylococcus infection.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthy family decided it was time to tell everyone they
knew to begin praying to Edith Stein to intercede with God to save
Benedicta's life.
</P>
<P>
   Benedicta had been named for Edith Stein, the Jewish philosopher
who was killed in Auschwitz as Sister Teresia Benedicta, the name
she took when she converted to Catholicism and became a nun.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthys, educated intellectuals and committed pacifists,
had named many of their children for martyrs and thinkers they
admired. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy had left the legal profession to
become a Catholic priest in the Melkite Church, which allows
priests to marry. Mary McCarthy schooled her children at home. They
had a room of their house turned into a chapel, and when the
children were young the family had said the rosary together every
day. With Benedicta deathly ill, a chain of people praying to Edith
Stein spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Benedicta walked out of the hospital totally
recovered, carrying a red balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was a miracle,'' said Dr. Ronald Kleinman,
who treated her at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an interview
last year. ``I'm saying it was miraculous. I'm Jewish. I don't
believe per se in miracles, but I can say I didn't expect her to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthys say they did not wish to publicize the incident,
but the Catholic newspaper in Maine heard about it and wrote an
article. Eventually Roman Catholic Church officials sent a team to
investigate whether Benedicta's recovery could be legitimately
declared a miracle attributable to Edith Stein. As a final step,
they brought Kleinman to the Vatican where, he says, Italian
doctors and members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints
interrogated him for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most children who swallow huge doses of Tylenol do not become
deathly ill, but Kleinman said he had to explain that Benedicta's
case was unusually dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a Catholic doctor,'' said the Rev. Kieran Kavanaugh,
a Carmelite priest who helped investigate Benedicta's case in
Brockton, ``people would think it was something he just dreamed up.
Kleinman's willingness to give testimony and witness, to me that
was a miracle in itself. He had to go and convince all these
Italian doctors, and it wasn't an easy case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when Edith Stein is canonized a saint, Benedicta, her
parents and her 11 siblings will all be at the Mass in St. Peter's.
So will Kleinman and the three nurses who had cared for Benedicta
at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Edith Stein's canonization says to me,'' Benedicta's
father said in a telephone interview minutes before leaving with
his family for Rome, ``is that in the end, evil doesn't win. In the
end, God prevails, God is victor.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody likes to say, ``I goofed'' _ particularly when the
mistake helped cause the meltdown of stock and bond markets around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is part of the reason the public pronouncements about the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and the
billion-dollar bailout of the hedge fund organized by the Federal
Reserve have been couched in language as arcane as the military
lingo in a Tom Clancy novel. (Another reason is that Wall Street
loves jargon, which makes its business sound mysterious and
important and serves as a sort of secret handshake.)
</P>
<P>
   But for readers whose cereal boxes don't come with Alan
Greenspan decoder rings, the following vocabulary builder may help
impress people at parties _ and perhaps prove handy as the
hedge-fund drama continues to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with hedge fund, which has nothing to do with
shrubs, and little to do with the kind of safety implied by, say,
hedging one's bets.
</P>
<P>
   A hedge fund, of which Long-Term Capital was a large and
prominent example, is a sort of mutual fund for the very rich and
for professional investors like pension funds and college
endowments, all of whom are supposed to be able to watch out for
themselves. That's why hedge funds are not subject to government
oversight (at least not yet). The main thing hedge funds have in
common is that the people running them get to take a chunk of any
profits the fund makes, in addition to an annual management fee;
this tends to encourage them to take big risks.
</P>
<P>
   Practically everyone who has left Wall Street in the past decade
claims to be running a hedge fund, even if they spend most of their
time practicing fly-fishing casts or watching ``The Jerry Springer
Show.'' So hedge funds come in a wide variety of sizes, from a
couple of million dollars to a billion-plus.
</P>
<P>
   But they can have an outsized influence on financial markets
because they can employ leverage, which basically means they make
their bets with borrowed money. Long-Term Capital borrowed about
$20 for every dollar investors put in, which is the kind of
behavior that ultimately sends compulsive bettors to Gamblers
Anonymous. On Wall Street, that lofty level of betting is sometimes
called nosebleed leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street makes it easier to ratchet up bets by creating
derivatives, or contracts whose value is derived from the
performance of something else. Anything else. The direction of
interest rates in Thailand. The number of rainy days in August. The
difference between the current interest rates in Thailand and the
number of rainy days in August, divided by the number of pages in
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   While some derivatives are commonplace and publicly traded _
like the futures that let farmers lock in the price of corn long
before the crop is harvested _ many are private wagers between two
parties, like barroom bets about which frog will jump the farthest.
That's why such positions can be so hard to unwind, or squirm out
of.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital was supposed to be a market neutral hedge
fund, which means it wasn't supposed to be betting on the overall
direction of the stock or bond market. The fund's actual strategy
was a secret, even to the people who invested in the fund or loaned
it money. Its activities were also hidden from regulators, leading
to complaints that nobody knew what the fund was up to, also known
as lack of transparency.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Long-Term Capital employed a kind of
computer-driven arbitrage, a word with a variety of meanings on
Wall Street. In this case, it seems to have meant buying stuff for
the wrong price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if toothpaste in your neighborhood usually sells
for about $4 a tube, and you find it in another store for $2, you
would snap up all you could. But you wouldn't necessarily brush
your teeth a lot more; you might sell the tubes on the street and
reap a 100 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this strategy, as Greenspan of the Federal
Reserve pointed out in his testimony to Congress earlier this month
(though not in these words), is that if enough people try to do
this toothpaste trading, either the store will raise the price or
folks on the street will stop buying your toothpaste and go to the
store instead. Either way, the chances of making a killing will
evaporate. Money being a lot easier to move than toothpaste, these
things happen in a flash in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   All this helps explain why Long-Term Capital had to move into
far-flung markets with low liquidity, meaning it's hard to buy and
sell things without pushing prices up or down sharply. Many of the
hedge fund's bets were in notoriously illiquid emerging markets,
which used to be known as Third World countries and are now called
submerging markets by Wall Street traders who have lost a bundle
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may not have had much success as an evil empire, but as
an evil emerging market, it rules. After Moscow defaulted on its
debt in August, spooked investors moved their money to the safest
spot they could think of: long bonds, the 30-year securities sold
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That flight to quality reversed capital flows, so money that had
been streaming into risky markets looking for extra profit poured
instead into places where there was little risk of loss. Investors
bid up the price of Treasuries while dumping everything else, which
shorted out all those high-tech computer models Long-Term Capital
was relying on.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fund was essentially bought by the banks and
brokerage firms that had loaned it money based mainly on the
perceived intellectual wattage of the fund's managers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Long-Term Capital fiasco, many investors have
moved, in Greenspan's words, from irrational exuberance to fear.
</P>
<P>
   All of this thanks to what economists call an exogenous event.
Also known as a surprise.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ If there is a worldwide canard
about political correctness, it is that it's an American disease.
Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly incorrect. Every
country has its own strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese think it bad taste to talk about burakumin, social
outcasts that include leather tanners and slaughterhouse workers.
It recalls ancient prejudices, but there are lands where the
repetition of not-so-old cruelties is what evokes horror: the
mention of ``scientific racism'' in Germany, for example, or the
similar assumptions behind South Africa's ``grand apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   All these linguistic taboos have something in common: they are
meant to take the sting out of confrontations by constantly
ratcheting down the sharpness of the words used. In the United
States, this is the process by which, over decades, ``village
idiot'' ratchets down to ``slow,'' which ratchets down to
``retarded,'' then to ``challenged'' and then all the way down to
``special.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's global culture, some of this kind of thing is
happening all over. Sometimes it is simply a reflection of fashions
emanating from America. In Mexico, for instance, where it is still
common for the common man to call homosexuals ``maricones,'' a deep
insult, the politically correct will say ``gay'' (though the word
is pronounced ``guy'' and means nothing in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, political correctness isn't just about America's
unspeakable words. It takes taboos to tangle, and taboos tend to be
local. For instance, Japanese newspapers simply avoid mentioning
burakumin and even the occupations they practiced, like butchering
meat. In formal Japanese, no one is blind, bald, fat or ugly. And
while a tall man in a group is ``the tall one,'' a short man is
``the fourth from the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, by contrast, a short man can be ``petiso'' _
``shorty'' _ and a dark-skinned man ``negro,'' and no offense is
taken. But make an aside about someone's mother and there will be
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With informers around for 20 years under the juntas, discussing
politics in most Latin American countries used to be dangerous,
especially for anyone who let slip socialist catchwords like
``bourgeoisie.'' Now politics can be discussed freely, but one must
disparage politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In France, discussing politics has always been the chief
instrument of torture used at the dinner table. Unrepentant lefties
will excuse a wildcat strike as a ``social movement,'' while
average folks may toe the pan-European line and justify government
austerity measures. Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front
gets 15 percent of the vote, so SOMEBODY must be discussing him,
but the newspapers just don't like to. Liberal journalists say that
ignoring his views will suppress them, but the theory seems thin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Americans are sick of discussing Bill Clinton's
sex life, the French are sick at the idea that Americans discuss it
at all. They assume their presidents fool around _ Francois
Mitterrand's mistress and their daughter attended his funeral _ and
the national ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy never compels a
leader to lie or obstruct justice about sex (not that the French
expect their presidents to be incapable of either).
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, by contrast, have many things that are illegal to
say or do, all related to the Nazi era: one may not deny the
Holocaust or make the Hitler salute. Except for rebellious
skinheads and soccer hooligans, jingoism is out, and outspoken
anti-foreigner sentiment is frowned upon. Still, many privately
blame Turks and Africans for higher crime rates and encourage
tougher immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some concepts protected by political correctness in the United
States don't export at all in most places _ women's rights, for
example. These are rapidly, and sometimes violently, retreating in
much of the Muslim world. And in Mexico, secretarial ads still ask
for ``good-looking young women.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners can't keep up with American changes, and often think
them foolish. Probably the most fashion-policed word anywhere is
that with which Americans refer to their countrymen of African
ancestry. In 50 years, that defining term has shifted from colored
to Negro to black to Afro-American to people of color to
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners may hoot at that, but they too have yielded to subtle
pressure to rename their minorities. Polite euphemisms coined by
19th-century liberals _ ``natives'' in Africa, ``aboriginals'' in
Australia (no doubt to avoid words like ``savages'') _ are now
themselves out of favor. ``Indigenous'' is OK in Australia. It used
to be OK in Mexico, but ``Indios'' is now preferred. (There is no
confusion with people from the Indian Subcontinent; Mexicans call
all of them ``hindus'' _ pronounced ``EEN-doos'' _ even if they're
Pakistani Muslims or Christians.)
</P>
<P>
   An African, by contrast, would never take a cue from the
now-fashionable American invention ``Native American'' because
``natives'' is an old insult. In South Africa, the former
``Bantus'' (an inoffensive word elsewhere in Africa) now run the
country, and non-whites are sometimes called ``the previously
disadvantaged.'' There is also nothing basic about ``black'' _ in
some contexts it refers only to black Africans while in others it
includes mixed-race people and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the context of political correctness, in some
ways South Africa resembles America, with blacks and whites
exchanging hostilities across an economic divide. In others, it is
unique. Its constitution, for example, curbs hate speech and
forbids discrimination that is based not just on race and religion
but also on sex, sexual preference, handicap, pregnancy status and
almost every imaginable ground.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because South Africa spent so much of the apartheid era
in isolation, America's political correctness and the backlash
against it arrived simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Take race. Everyone talks about crime, but for whites to dwell
on it too long smacks of racism, because most criminals are black.
Suburban wives complain about their maids, and husbands complain
about labor productivity, but it's all code for ``the blecks.''
White and black liberals strain to ask people of other races to
dinner, but to get caught practicing tokenism is a faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Given its many races, however, South Africa is also remarkably
rich in racial insults. It has a macho culture where one is
expected to roll with a punch and sensitive types are mocked. In
young, racially mixed groups of friends, people lightheartedly use
words like ``darkie'' and ``hout-kop'' (wood-head) for blacks,
``coolie'' and ``curry-muncher'' for Indians, ``bushie'' (Bushman)
or ``half-naat'' (half-baked) for coloreds and ``whitey'' or
``mlungu'' for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, English-speaking whites call uncouth Afrikaner ones
``hairybacks'' or ``rockspiders,'' while Afrikaners call the other
whites ``rooinek'' _ rednecks, as in sunburned British soldiers _
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Russia, where the most discriminated-against
groups are residents of the Caucasus _ Chechnyans, Azerbaijanis,
Georgians and so on. There, unlike elsewhere, Caucasians are
relatively dark skinned _ and to Russians inclined to be
derogatory, this makes them ``chorniye'' or ``blacks'' (except when
this is seen to be insensitive, in which case Caucasians become
``people of Caucasian nationality.'')
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in Russia it's the Caucasians who can be blacks,
but a person of African extraction is never black, except
derogatorily. (A white Russian, of course, is vodka, Kahlua and
cream.)

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tidy, fateful day of partisan struggle was
winding down as Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde forwarded
the recommended impeachment inquiry of President Clinton to certain
approval by the House.
</P>
<P>
   But he suddenly looked up, recalling another bit of urgent
business _ the committee's need to pose for its official group
photograph. ``I plead with you to show up,'' Hyde said to the
lawmakers, intent on replacing the existing class photo. ``I have a
lopsided picture in my office, not very bipartisan.'' To his left,
Rep. Barney Frank, the outspoken Democrat with the trigger instinct
of a standup comic, interjected, ``Why should that be any
different, Chairman?''
</P>
<P>
   There followed some easy laughter that was rare and much needed
as counterpoint in the rigidly partisan day as the committee
launched the House impeachment vessel upon highly uncertain
political seas.
</P>
<P>
   In the partisan debate that formally blessed the inquiry, the
Watergate gavel wielded artfully 24 years ago by Rep. Peter Rodino,
Hyde's predecessor in the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, was
invoked as if it were the magic sword of Excalibur. ``Here we may
be partisan in the highest sense,'' pleaded Rep. Christopher
Cannon, R-Utah. ``We must argue our views, we must look for facts
and characterizations that favor our side.''
</P>
<P>
   But lurking about the 105th Congress are some of the darker
insights of the Founding Fathers about partisanship, or
factionalism, as it was then termed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latent causes of faction are sown in the nature of man,''
cautioned James Madison, the Constitution's architect, in the
Federalist Papers. ``An attachment to different leaders,
ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power,'' he warned, has
``divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual
animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison's words might well be carved in House stone in
qualification of the more idealized Capitol chiselings on
nonpartisanship that urge debaters onward and upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, partisanship was a tool with which one
accomplished a policy agenda,'' said former Rep. Pat Williams, a
Democrat looking back from his new and gentler career as an
environmentalist in Montana. ``Now it's a mechanism whereby one
destroys the opponent, embarrasses his family and puts him in jail
at the end of the day. I think the American people despise it.''
</P>
<P>
   With similar regret, other Capitol Hill veterans insist there
truly were better times of partisan disputation focused on ideas _
before ``to Bork'' was coined as a political attack verb, from the
undermining of Republican Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.
</P>
<P>
   Those were days, too, before Newt Gingrich wielded the
partisanship of personal attack in destroying his Democratic rival,
Speaker Jim Wright, in a scandal assault.
</P>
<P>
   There are old-timers aghast that these days Speaker Gingrich and
Democratic House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt can barely tolerate
each other's presence, while the late Democratic Speaker Tip
O'Neill was a beloved buddy of Republican Minority Leader Bob
Michel when the sun set each day on their legislative wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, the Republicans had 40 years to collect
grievances,'' said former Rep. M. Caldwell Butler, R-Va., recalling
his party's decades in the House wilderness. He well remembers his
freshman year in the minority on the Judiciary Committee, when the
Watergate partisanship was indeed heavy-handed at first, despite
the fabled Rodino gavel. But this ultimately eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get near the nitty-gritty and the rules are ironed out,
you start addressing the facts. And the inclination becomes less
partisan and more specific between yourself and your own conscience
and not the party,'' said Butler, a 10-year House veteran who
finally voted to impeach. ``My own perception of it was that as the
Democratic majority became more aware of the importance of having a
bipartisan vote on impeachment, the deliberations became more
bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is hoping for a similar syndrome, provided the nitty-gritty
is deemed to be there in the case against Clinton, and presumably
with such partisan factors as Gingrich himself offstage. Initially,
at least, the Clinton case seems problematic for the furious tangle
of partisan animus and factual dispute at its heart. To win over
Democrats and the public, the Republicans must move beyond some
members' plain detestation of Clinton as their partisan engine, and
prevail on the firmer historical ground of a two-party adversary
proceeding rooted in demonstrated fact and Constitutional
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote approving the inquiry had a slight protective
coloration of bipartisanship, with 31 Democrats voting with the
Republicans, in fear, perhaps, of being demagogued as blatantly
tolerant of the president's transgressions. But Democrats are
fearful of gross partisanship in the coming inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the Republicans' Judiciary counsel, while
trumpeting himself as a die-hard Democrat, incensed committee
Democrats with an emotional postscript to his initial reading of
the case against Clinton _ a caution that America's hallowed
generations ``are looking down and judging what you do.'' Hyde
quickly struck the moralizing remarks from the record, but
Schippers was unapologetic. ``If they don't like what I said,
that's too bad,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of personal attack are rooted in well-funded
campaign stratagems that can dominate politicians' styles even
before they arrive here. The public plainly eschews partisanship as
the sort of device that infamously saw the government shut down in
a budget fight. But historically, partisanship can be viewed as a
clarifying agent as much as a muddling device when the great issues
are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In the furiously fought impeachment of President Andrew Johnson,
who was finally spared by the margin of one Senate vote, the real
issue was how punitively or magnanimously to re-integrate the South
into the Union _ nothing less than how to make the country whole
again.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate censure of Andrew Jackson in 1834 after his
scuttling of the national bank (a censure soon reversed), the
issues were federal versus local power and the shape of the nascent
economy at a critical juncture between agrarianism and
industrialization. Big stuff, and again necessarily ugly, perhaps,
in the tooth-and-claw partisanship of debate.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nixon impeachment was about a White House's array of
criminal behavior finally closing in on the nation's leader, with
congressional partisanship itself the nation's last best adversary
device for testing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never was a nonpartisan in politics,'' President Harry
S. Truman fervidly insisted, amused at the very idea _ long before
such phenomena as Watergate and Monica Lewinsky _ that any critical
dispute in the life of a nation can be somehow devoid of
partisanship.

   He looked at me blankly. Then, he looked annoyed, really
annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said ``I mean the master.''
</P>
<P>
   All he wanted was a signature acknowledging that we had received
our belongings, but mine would not do. Never mind that,
technically, the moving company was working for me, that every box
had my name on it and that my husband's name did not even appear on
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged. ``He's in the back,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready to cover southern Africa, I had shopped for hiking
boots with perhaps more care than needed. In the small ways that
you have of trying to brace for huge life changes, I had spent a
lot of time looking for just the right shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But what I really needed was a Wonderbra.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected snakes, elephants and malaria. I had expected
racism, bug-filled hotel rooms and the heartbreak of watching
children die. But the status of women here, the level of sexism,
astonished me. Some of South Africa's most prominent women,
including Ramphela Mamphele, who runs the University of Cape Town,
argue that sexism is actually a bigger problem in Africa than
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Here a woman is a babe first, last and foremost. The
better-looking she is, the easier life is. At least you get some
attention. No wonder most of the other middle-aged moms dropping
off their darlings at my children's school are in full makeup and
cleavage by 7:20 a.m. (I no longer get out of the car.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, women in many countries, including the United States,
have to deal with terrible sexism. Japanese women are groped on the
subways. Some Muslim countries deny women education and make them
wear virtual tents. But South Africa is in the midst of a social
revolution defined by its emphasis on equality and has the most
liberal constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest, however, that it is somewhat demeaning to hear constant
jokes about women as chatterbox shoppers or wily spendthrifts, and
eyes roll.
</P>
<P>
   I must have brought a half-dozen dinner parties to an
uncomfortable silence before I realized that the indignities of
being a woman here were not up for discussion among any group _
black, white or colored, rich or poor, young or old. A look of,
``Another obnoxious American woman'' ran across their faces, like
the news zipper in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to change in the status of women might be explained
by cultural factors _ whether one grows up as an African, whose
tribal laws treat women as children, or as a Dutch-descended
Afrikaner, whose church teaches that men must rule the home. The
social revolution of the 1960s largely bypassed even South Africans
of English descent. After all, under the international sanctions of
the apartheid era, this country spent decades as an isolated,
pariah state, and didn't even allow television until 1976.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank that first week, we found there was no such thing as
a joint checking account. My husband, I was told, could give me
permission to use his account, but it would carry only his name and
he could withdraw that permission at any time without notifying me.
No one there could understand why I found this objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   As I arranged for phones and bought office equipment every
payment form and service contract asked my marital status _ and
often, they wanted my husband to co-sign.
</P>
<P>
   And slowly I came to another realization. I was expected to
wait. Store clerks routinely abandoned helping me when a man walked
into the store looking the least bit anxious. If I approached a man
behind a counter to pay a bill and he was talking to a friend of
his, I could wait 10 minutes for him to take the money. The worst
was in airports. At car rental counters, men positively glower if
they are in a hurry and aren't waited on first.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I finally confronted the female clerk at an Avis
counter who had left me in mid-transaction to help a demanding
Afrikaner male. ``Why did you do that?'' I asked, trying to sound
gentle. ``I'm in a hurry too, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there is not much you can do about these things,'' she
said in a tone that suggested I was unfairly bothering her.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for a run of humiliations in front of your boss,
who's here on a visit?
</P>
<P>
   First we go to see President Nelson Mandela. The brief courtesy
visit has been incredibly difficult to arrange. But here we are.
Ten minutes of chitchat pass. Mandela leans over to my boss. ``You
know,'' he says to him, pointing at me, ``in my day, if you had a
wife who looked like that, you would be embarrassed. In my day, a
woman needed a little more meat on her bones.''
</P>
<P>
   (Where was that Wonderbra?)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next day was a meeting with the leader of the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. My husband, Donald G.
McNeil Jr., who is also a correspondent in the Times bureau, came
along. As we were leaving, I tried to give Buthelezi my card. He
took it without looking and sidled up to Donald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see you have a good Zulu wife who carries your cards for
you.'' he said. Ah, how sweet. They were bonding.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner that evening at the house of Harry and Bridget
Oppenheimer, the country's wealthiest family, the servants were
clearing dessert when Mrs. Oppenheimer stood: `Ladies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else seemed to know _ the ladies were to leave the room
now so the men could smoke cigars and talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, but,'' my boss protested, thinking that as a journalist I
shouldn't be missing out on talking politics with some of South
Africa's most powerful executives. ``She's the bureau chief.''
</P>
<P>
   That silence again. I meekly followed the other wives out.
</P>
<P>
   Early on a black woman journalist here complained of the way she
was treated and told me that she was thinking of having new
business cards made up saying she was her paper's bureau chief. She
thought the disdain for her really had to do with being black. But
I could match her slight for slight, and my card said bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   I can't count the number of times I have been asked who is chief
correspondent for The New York Times in South Africa by men who
were holding my business card in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   I've asked women why they put up with all this. Outside a
courtroom recently an attractive young reporter was struggling with
a soda machine. A middle-aged lawyer walked up, stroked the machine
and said. ``Oh, it's just like a woman: You put in money and it
gives you nothing back.'' He wanted applause for this amazing wit.
She laughed obligingly.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how she could stand it, and asked. She agreed the
remark was demeaning, but objecting outright was too much trouble,
she said, and besides, he got the machine to give her the Coke.
``I'm just waiting for guys like that to die out,'' she said. I
marvel at this patience.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I have learned a few tricks for getting by.
One, I can wiggle my way out of almost anything with these few
words. ``I'll have to ask my husband.'' Even got rid of the pushy
neighbor who had an ``emergency'' and wanted to dig our yard up to
find his pipes. ``Of, course,'' he said with great understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm leaning on that phrase quite a bit these days. It's
so handy.
</P>
<P>
   And my husband swears that I now wear much tighter shirts.

   A Hefty Charge Against Visa And Mastercard
</P>
<P>
   People who feel deprived of access to what now seems to be an
American right to buy on credit have a friend at the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the government filed an antitrust suit against Visa
and Mastercard, saying the nation's two biggest credit card
networks restrain competition and consumers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the lawsuit, Attorney General Janet Reno said
rules adopted by Visa and Mastercard for member banks were overly
restrictive, and therefore harmful to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and Mastercard denied the allegations.

   Dispute Over Nerve Gas  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   French experts detected traces of the nerve gas VX on Iraqi
warheads they examined but withheld their findings because they did
not want to damage Baghdad's efforts to have United Nations
economic sanctions lifted, according to several international
weapons specialists.
</P>
<P>
   France, which has major commercial interests in Iraq, officially
denied that it had found VX, or that it sought to help Iraq lift
the sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf war. It asked the U.N.
commission investigating Iraq's weaponry to resolve the dispute.

   AIDS Deaths Drop
</P>
<P>
   The federal government announced that 16,685 people died of AIDS
last year, less than half the number who succumbed in 1996, and a
stunning drop from the more than 43,000 in the peak year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was caused by the use of new drugs that can keep the
deadly disease at bay. But the number of people who annually become
infected by the HIV virus remains steady at about 40,000. So
accompanying the good news is a worry that infected people will be
living longer, giving them more chances to pass infections along.

   Tales From the White House  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The investigations into Clinton administration officials
continued to yield startling tidbits last week.
</P>
<P>
   Two black members of President Clinton's cabinet said they had
to submit urine samples, apparently for drug testing, while two
white cabinet secretaries said they did not, according to testimony
by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner described the conversation while testifying in the
trial of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who had to submit
a sample. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown also gave one.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said drug-testing
policy varied by agency. White House staff members are tested, he
said, but the president is not.

   Unconvicted
</P>
<P>
   Imelda Marcos will not be cooling her well-shod heels in jail _
not yet, anyway _ now that the Supreme Court of the Philippines has
overturned a corruption conviction against her.
</P>
<P>
   Is she off the hook? Not exactly. Other criminal and civil
matters loom, involving the billions that she and her husband,
Ferdinand, who died in 1989, are accused of stealing. And the
United States wants to discuss the small matter of $5 million in
unpaid income taxes from the Marcoses' days in Hawaii. She may be
barefoot yet.

   A Shorter Season  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 51 years and 35,001 games, the National Basketball
Association avoided losing regular-season games to labor strife.
But with the cancellation of the entire preseason and talks going
nowhere, Patrick Ewing and friends will be off the court awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't agree with their proposal,'' said Ewing, the
players association president, after both parties met Thursday.
They meet again Tuesday, which NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
called the ``drop-dead date'' for canceling part of the season.

   A Guilty Plea

   A few weeks before Christmas a 15-year-old fired at teen-agers
praying in the hallway of Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky.,
killing three and injuring five others.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Michael Adam Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally ill.
His pleas were accepted on the condition that he face the maximum
penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25
years.

   Sold, Time in Space
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for cash, Russia has agreed to sell the United States
most of its allotted research time aboard the International Space
Station for $60 million. The deal reduces Russia's role to mostly
that of a builder but not a user of the outpost during its five or
six years of orbital construction.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is also beefing up its own role. ``Our reliance on Russian
capabilities has to be reduced, not by eliminating their
involvement but adding layers of protection,'' NASA Administrator
Daniel Goldin told Congress.

   HMOs Accused of Fraud
</P>
<P>
   Probably few executives at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. or
Quorum Health Group ever gave much thought to tiny North Valley
Hospital in Whitefish, Mont. But now few will be likely to forget
it. The government said it had joined a lawsuit filed by a former
North Valley officer, who accused the two hospital companies of
defrauding Medicare through bogus expense claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed under seal almost six years ago, has already led
to federal investigations. Analysts expect that before it's all
over settlements might top $1 billion.

   Another Guilty Plea
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the co-owner of the San Francisco
49ers, had bigger worries than his team's recent loss to the
Buffalo Bills. DeBartolo pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
Baton Rouge, La., to failing to report an alleged extortion plot
concocted by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plea bargain, DeBartolo agreed to provide evidence
that Edwards had demanded $400,000 in cash in exchange for using
his influence to shepherd a DeBartolo riverboat casino project
through the local Gaming Board. He was ordered to pay $1 million in
fines and penalties. Prosecutors have their eye on Edwards.

   A Bit of Lucre From Lucky Dog &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do Larry Hagman from ``Dallas,'' Isabel Sanford from ``The
Jeffersons'' and Joe Lynn Turner from the rock group Deep Purple
have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They are all dogs. At least, they help play dogs in television
commercials for the Lucky Dog Phone Company, the first brand that
AT&AMP;T has created in its 113-year history that does not actually
mention AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason for that. Since 1885, AT&AMP;T, the nation's
largest communications company, has built an image based on trust,
reliability, convenience and a sense of community (as in ``Reach
out and touch someone'').
</P>
<P>
   But the Lucky Dog campaign, which supports a new calling service
called 10-10-345, is based on, well, good old greed.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, AT&AMP;T will give away 345 prizes to people who use the
service, plus a $1 million grand prize in January. Its market
research found that people who like to save money with flat-rate
services like Lucky Dog (a dime a minute, a dime to connect) also
like sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The research may also have discovered something else: that a
phone call is a basic consumer product rather than a high-tech way
to improve someone's life. Maybe that is why the AT&AMP;T executive who
invented Lucky Dog used to market Diet Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Hagman is the voice of a bull mastiff, Ms.
Sanford a basset hound and Turner a mutt.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hers Was Fact, His Is Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sex in America, at least for the rich and famous, is getting to
be an awfully high-risk activity. No, this isn't about AIDS _ it's
about people simply not being able to shut up about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one, there's the president's dalliance with . . . but
don't worry: the ``M'' word will not appear here.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the high-decibel, high-profile marriage of
Philip Roth and Claire Bloom. After it ended in a blaze of
ugliness, Ms. Bloom blasted into print with a 1996 memoir,
``Leaving a Doll's House'' (Little, Brown &AMP; Co.), in which she
depicts Roth as a control freak with a ``deep and irrepressible
rage'' at the very idea of being married and a ``profound distrust
of the sexual power of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts, Roth? Well, nothing explicit. But he DOES happen
to have a new novel out, called ``I Married a Communist.'' And it
DOES involve a failed marriage to an actress named Eve Frame (Hmmm:
all those one-syllable names), who, as it happens, writes a
vindictive memoir about said marriage. And Ms. Frame has a teen-age
daughter who is a source of great friction in the marriage, just as
Ms. Bloom did.
</P>
<P>
   If it's revenge, though, is it also art? Roth, who has an
uncanny way of squeezing an awful lot of his own life into his
fiction, may well have envisioned the book as a sweet riposte, but
whether the work succeeds on a literary level is another matter
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``While such matters may be of passing interest to literary
gossip-mongers,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times,
``they are not transformed, in this case, into plausible or
compelling fiction.'' The novel is ``unfinished and overstuffed,''
she wrote; the characters just ``talk and talk and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gore Vidal should have the last word about this steamy,
all-too-public battlefield. ``It's always best,'' he told a Times
interviewer when Ms. Bloom's memoir appeared, ``to stay out of
other people's divorces.''

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ If there is a worldwide canard
about political correctness, it is that it's an American disease.
Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly incorrect. Every
country has its own strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese think it bad taste to talk about burakumin, social
outcasts that include leather tanners and slaughterhouse workers.
It recalls ancient prejudices, but there are lands where the
repetition of not-so-old cruelties is what evokes horror: the
mention of ``scientific racism'' in Germany, for example, or the
similar assumptions behind South Africa's ``grand apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   All these linguistic taboos have something in common: they are
meant to take the sting out of confrontations by constantly
ratcheting down the sharpness of the words used. In the United
States, this is the process by which, over decades, ``village
idiot'' ratchets down to ``slow,'' which ratchets down to
``retarded,'' then to ``challenged'' and then all the way down to
``special.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's global culture, some of this kind of thing is
happening all over. Sometimes it is simply a reflection of fashions
emanating from America. In Mexico, for instance, where it is still
common for the common man to call homosexuals ``maricones,'' a deep
insult, the politically correct will say ``gay'' (though the word
is pronounced ``guy'' and means nothing in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, political correctness isn't just about America's
unspeakable words. It takes taboos to tangle, and taboos tend to be
local. For instance, Japanese newspapers simply avoid mentioning
burakumin and even the occupations they practiced, like butchering
meat. In formal Japanese, no one is blind, bald, fat or ugly. And
while a tall man in a group is ``the tall one,'' a short man is
``the fourth from the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, by contrast, a short man can be ``petiso'' _
``shorty'' _ and a dark-skinned man ``negro,'' and no offense is
taken. But make an aside about someone's mother and there will be
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With informers around for 20 years under the juntas, discussing
politics in most Latin American countries used to be dangerous,
especially for anyone who let slip socialist catchwords like
``bourgeoisie.'' Now politics can be discussed freely, but one must
disparage politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In France, discussing politics has always been the chief
instrument of torture used at the dinner table. Unrepentant lefties
will excuse a wildcat strike as a ``social movement,'' while
average folks may toe the pan-European line and justify government
austerity measures. Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front
gets 15 percent of the vote, so SOMEBODY must be discussing him,
but the newspapers just don't like to. Liberal journalists say that
ignoring his views will suppress them, but the theory seems thin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Americans are sick of discussing Bill Clinton's
sex life, the French are sick at the idea that Americans discuss it
at all. They assume their presidents fool around _ Francois
Mitterrand's mistress and their daughter attended his funeral _ and
the national ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy never compels a
leader to lie or obstruct justice about sex (not that the French
expect their presidents to be incapable of either).
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, by contrast, have many things that are illegal to
say or do, all related to the Nazi era: one may not deny the
Holocaust or make the Hitler salute. Except for rebellious
skinheads and soccer hooligans, jingoism is out, and outspoken
anti-foreigner sentiment is frowned upon. Still, many privately
blame Turks and Africans for higher crime rates and encourage
tougher immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some concepts protected by political correctness in the United
States don't export at all in most places _ women's rights, for
example. These are rapidly, and sometimes violently, retreating in
much of the Muslim world. And in Mexico, secretarial ads still ask
for ``good-looking young women.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners can't keep up with American changes, and often think
them foolish. Probably the most fashion-policed word anywhere is
that with which Americans refer to their countrymen of African
ancestry. In 50 years, that defining term has shifted from colored
to Negro to black to Afro-American to people of color to
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners may hoot at that, but they too have yielded to subtle
pressure to rename their minorities. Polite euphemisms coined by
19th-century liberals _ ``natives'' in Africa, ``aboriginals'' in
Australia (no doubt to avoid words like ``savages'') _ are now
themselves out of favor. ``Indigenous'' is OK in Australia. It used
to be OK in Mexico, but ``Indios'' is now preferred. (There is no
confusion with people from the Indian Subcontinent; Mexicans call
all of them ``hindus'' _ pronounced ``EEN-doos'' _ even if they're
Pakistani Muslims or Christians.)
</P>
<P>
   An African, by contrast, would never take a cue from the
now-fashionable American invention ``Native American'' because
``natives'' is an old insult. In South Africa, the former
``Bantus'' (an inoffensive word elsewhere in Africa) now run the
country, and non-whites are sometimes called ``the previously
disadvantaged.'' There is also nothing basic about ``black'' _ in
some contexts it refers only to black Africans while in others it
includes mixed-race people and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the context of political correctness, in some
ways South Africa resembles America, with blacks and whites
exchanging hostilities across an economic divide. In others, it is
unique. Its constitution, for example, curbs hate speech and
forbids discrimination that is based not just on race and religion
but also on sex, sexual preference, handicap, pregnancy status and
almost every imaginable ground.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because South Africa spent so much of the apartheid era
in isolation, America's political correctness and the backlash
against it arrived simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Take race. Everyone talks about crime, but for whites to dwell
on it too long smacks of racism, because most criminals are black.
Suburban wives complain about their maids, and husbands complain
about labor productivity, but it's all code for ``the blecks.''
White and black liberals strain to ask people of other races to
dinner, but to get caught practicing tokenism is a faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Given its many races, however, South Africa is also remarkably
rich in racial insults. It has a macho culture where one is
expected to roll with a punch and sensitive types are mocked. In
young, racially mixed groups of friends, people lightheartedly use
words like ``darkie'' and ``hout-kop'' (wood-head) for blacks,
``coolie'' and ``curry-muncher'' for Indians, ``bushie'' (Bushman)
or ``half-naat'' (half-baked) for coloreds and ``whitey'' or
``mlungu'' for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, English-speaking whites call uncouth Afrikaner ones
``hairybacks'' or ``rockspiders,'' while Afrikaners call the other
whites ``rooinek'' _ rednecks, as in sunburned British soldiers _
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Russia, where the most discriminated-against
groups are residents of the Caucasus _ Chechnyans, Azerbaijanis,
Georgians and so on. There, unlike elsewhere, Caucasians are
relatively dark skinned _ and to Russians inclined to be
derogatory, this makes them ``chorniye'' or ``blacks'' (except when
this is seen to be insensitive, in which case Caucasians become
``people of Caucasian nationality.'')
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in Russia it's the Caucasians who can be blacks,
but a person of African extraction is never black, except
derogatorily. (A white Russian, of course, is vodka, Kahlua and
cream.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John David Podesta, the lean, wry roller-coaster
enthusiast who senior White House aides say is likely to become
their next chief of staff, keeps an unusual photograph of President
Clinton on his office wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is there, he told a visitor last summer, to remind him of one
of his failures as deputy chief of staff, his current job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let the president of the United States pat a 1,000-pound
white tiger,'' he said, chortling as he looked up at the shot of
Clinton grinning beside the beast on a visit to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger did not bite, the Secret Service agents took their
hands off their pistol butts, and Podesta did not have to deliver
the message to the first lady that flashed through his mind: ``The
president's missing a few digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta had good reason to kick himself for not intervening. For
several years, the president's lamented impulse to pat tigers has
caused him far more heartache than amusement.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer with interests in policy matters ranging from the
environment to computer privacy, Podesta has found himself
repeatedly dragged back to a damage-control post. He has led
efforts to defend the president against accusations over the
Whitewater land deal, dismissals at the White House travel office
and, most recently, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One of his rewards was to be lied to by the president about Ms.
Lewinsky more thoroughly than any other aide, judging from grand
jury testimony disclosed recently. Another reward, senior White
House officials say, will be to replace his boss, Erskine Bowles,
when Bowles steps aside in the next couple of weeks. Podesta, 49,
will have the task of energizing an administration rocked by an
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have argued that the president should hire an
eminent Democratic wise man _ provided he can find and persuade one
_ to serve in a senior post, to bring dignity and maturity to a
tarnished White House. For example, when Ronald Reagan was
struggling to contain the arms-for-hostages inquiry known as
Iran-contra, he hired former Sen. Howard Baker as his chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But even some critics of the White House call Podesta as good a
choice as any. ``In all honesty, I think John's just as heavyweight
as any of them,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who got to know
Podesta when he was minority counsel to the Senate Judiciary
Committee, from 1981 to 1986. ``They'd be stupid not to put him in
there, because he's got all the ability in the world. He's a very
loyal, dedicated man.''
</P>
<P>
   Some White House aides acknowledged that hiring an outsider
might be good public relations. But several said that Podesta was
popular with the staff, substantively equipped for the job and not
in need of on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a job here he couldn't do,'' said Douglas
Sosnik, the White House counselor, ``and I can't think of anybody
else I could say that about.'' He added with a laugh, ``I hope he
thinks well of me for saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials cautioned that Clinton had made no final
decision about his next chief of staff. With some exasperation, one
aide said the president did not like to make up his mind about
personnel matters until he found himself in the Rose Garden
standing beside his new appointee. But several senior officials
said they had heard no names mentioned besides Podesta's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in recent years has promoted only people he knew well
and trusted into senior White House posts. ``That's what the
president needs more than anything, a known quantity,'' said Leon
Panetta, the former chief of staff.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one has quit the White House or the administration over the
president's affair with Ms. Lewinsky or his lies to his staff and
the public. Yet the White House staff is going through an abrupt
transformation, which Podesta will have to smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the former press secretary and public face of the
administration for three years, left last week; Rahm Emanuel, one
of the president's senior advisers and a scarred, seven-year
veteran of the Clinton wars, is planning to leave this month, and
Bowles, whom the president has called his closest friend in the
White House, is making his long-desired return to North Carolina,
possibly to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton has brought in several new aides to
protect him from impeachment. White House aides call the turnover
normal, a result of burnout from 16-hour days and six-day weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a pretty worn-out group of people,'' a senior White
House aide said. ``We need some new blood in here; we need some
energy in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta has served two tours in this White House, first as staff
secretary during the first term and then as a deputy to Bowles. In
between, he was a law professor at Georgetown University, where he
still teaches a class during the summer on congressional
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   From his years on Capitol Hill, Podesta has solid ties to
Democrats and Republicans, particularly in the Senate. With some
White House aides, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ``you almost
count your fingers after they left, if you shook hands with them.''
But, he said, ``everybody who's ever dealt with John is left
feeling that he treated them honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy predicted that Podesta ``will be more directly involved
with us on strategy than we've seen since Leon,'' a reference to
Panetta, who is a former congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta declined to comment, except to say, ``In response to my
unavailability to deal with this profile, I've discovered that the
secret to having good press relations is to have no press
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anyone else in the White House, including Podesta, Bowles
has cultivated a respectful relationship with Speaker Newt
Gingrich. But White House aides said they were far more worried
about currying favor among House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Elmendorf, chief of staff to the House minority leader,
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Podesta was unlikely to establish
the kind of relationship with the speaker that Bowles had. ``From
our perspective, that's fine,'' Gephardt said. ``We'd prefer that
deals not be cut with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bowles, Podesta is not a close friend or golfing buddy of
the president, whom he met in 1970. During one of his three trips
to the grand jury here, Podesta said that he had a ``close
relationship'' with Clinton, but that ``mostly I deal with him in a
professional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, his associates say, is inspired to work at the White
House out of commitment to the president's goals rather than out of
personal affection. As a result, they say, he was less upset about
the president's lies than some who were closer personally to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta testified that, shortly after the Lewinsky furor broke,
the president assured him during a talk in his private study that
``he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever,'' including
orally.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bowles, a Southerner, is warm and seemingly open, Podesta,
a Chicagoan, is more reserved, with a bone-dry and at times
astringent wit.
</P>
<P>
   Aides who do not know him well can have trouble understanding
his shorthand instructions. Some people, one White House adviser
said, ``don't understand him, can't relate to him or can't break
the code and get through.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, White House advisers, including Bowles, like to joke
that Podesta is two people: his pleasant, mild-mannered self and a
dark, evil twin, whom they call Skippy. It is Skippy, they say, who
icily dresses down underlings for shoddy work.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a measure of how comfortable his colleagues are
with both versions of Podesta that they are so willing to joke
about Skippy. Emanuel declined to comment about Podesta for this
article, saying, ``I'm waiting for the profiles on Skippy.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, who has been at the heart of what critics regard as a
White House conspiracy to obstruct justice, is himself a devotee of
conspiracy theories. He maintains what he calls a ``shrine'' in his
office of books, magazines and photographs related to the ``X
Files,'' near a book about his beloved roller coasters, ``Roller
Coasters of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else but the White House would someone grab onto the `X
Files' in a desperate attempt to cling to reality?'' he asked in a
commencement address last June at his alma mater, Knox College.
</P>
<P>
   In his three appearances before the grand jury, Podesta referred
several times to the ``X Files.'' At one point, he was asked if he
was ``the same John David Podesta who testified in front of us last
week.'' After some brief byplay, he replied, ``Was that a trick
question?'' He added that he had seen the ``X Files'' over the
weekend, and as a result was not certain of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   With glee evident even in the transcript, Podesta testified
about the conspiracy theories of a senior White House
communications aide, Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   He said Blumenthal had noticed reports that Air Force One
occasionally vanished from air traffic radar screens, usually
shortly before a claim of alien abduction. So, he told the grand
jurors, ``We have a new theory or a new defense that this whole
matter is somehow linked to alien abductions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that, while he could never be sure, he thought
Blumenthal was just kidding.

<P>
   CALAMAR, Colombia _ The bloody struggle over the future of
Colombia, raging between shadowy groups of men and women with masks
and false names, is closing in on Calamar, a main transit point in
the coca trade scratched out of the jungle 20 years ago by the
refugees of earlier conflicts in this stricken country.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have not left the town, less than a square mile,
in a year. The only road out is controlled by paramilitaries, who
have established a checkpoint a few miles from the nearest military
base and charge coca growers and food suppliers simply to get their
products in and out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here fear that checkpoint. They fear dying for simply
coming from Calamar, which the paramilitaries label a rebel support
base. In the last year, residents say, more than 100 local people
have been executed by the paramilitaries. Recently an entire family
disappeared from that road, first the son, then the father who went
looking for him, and finally the boy's mother, who went searching
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calm, but we're all very tense,'' said Amparo Gomez, 43,
whose family owns a bakery and billiard hall. ``We're surrounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrolling the streets a few hours each day and controlling the
surrounding forests are rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Latin America's oldest and most powerful
insurgency. The rebels have battered government military bases over
the last two years, and the newly inaugurated government of
President Andres Pastrana has pledged to open peace talks with them
by early November.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurgents have vowed to fight on until an agreement is
reached, and the military is fighting back. Just before Pastrana
took office in August, the rebels leveled military and police
counternarcotics bases nearby at Miraflores, killing 40 police
officers and soldiers and abducting 129.
</P>
<P>
   This region produces 65 percent of Colombia's coca. The people
of Calamar do not grow coca, but their economy depends on it.
Trucks laden with gasoline to process coca leaves into paste rumble
through, pulling over to observe the guerrilla-imposed 7 p.m.
curfew on road travel each night. Peasants come to sell coca paste.
Pilots stop to rest and load up for the next flight out from a
clandestine airstrip, charged $3,000 a time by the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the authors of the conflict, but we are its
victims,'' said Luiz Eduardo Betancourt, the local official
responsible for denouncing human rights violations by government
employees. State officials have warned Betancourt that he is on
paramilitary hit lists, perhaps because of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Terror began a year ago, after hundreds of paramilitaries
invaded the town of Mapiripan, 80 miles northeast of here, killing
at least 14 people during a five-day siege, according to the
Colombian Commission of Jurists, a human rights organization here.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told government investigators and others that the
paramilitaries seized peasants they accused of leading protests
against aerial fumigation of drug crops, torturing and mutilating
their victims before dumping them into the Guaviare River. The
paramilitaries beheaded two men and kicked their skulls through the
streets, survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Two civilians and two lower-ranking officers of the regional
antinarcotics base have been arrested in connection with the
massacre, although witnesses said 200 paramilitaries terrorized the
town.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano, leader of the paramilitaries in Colombia, said
he regretted only the incidents with severed heads. He threatened
``many more Mapiripans.''
</P>
<P>
   In May Castano's men massacred 14 peasants in Puerto Alvira,
east of Mapiripan. Two months ago they appeared just north of
Calamar, in Guacamaya. Rumor spread that uniformed army and police
officers were among the paramilitaries. Panic spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call us auxiliaries, but what are we supposed to do?''
said Mrs. Gomez. ``I'm here to sell bread. How am I supposed to
check if somebody is a guerrilla or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, any helicopter that passes overhead drives residents to the
streets with radios, madly tuning to the helicopter's radio
frequency to see if troops are flying in. Others dash for the
forest. Newcomers, seen as possible informers for the
paramilitaries, are allowed to move here only if a local resident
vouches for them.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, people avoid blaming one side or the other for
the terror that circumscribes their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking right now,'' said the Rev. Ramon Giraldo, the
local parish priest. ``If somebody took us outside and shot us
dead, nobody would say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Though heavily armed, the rebels appear respectful, paying for
purchases and chatting with locals over soda. But the commander of
the rebel contingent declined to talk to a reporter, saying he did
not have permission.
</P>
<P>
   In a town that has long suffered from government neglect, the
rebels impose a harsh order. They banned commercial fishing in the
Guaviare River to replenish fish stock, persuaded residents to
plant trees in the park and cracked down on unruliness. Men no
longer get away with killing, beating or throwing out their wives,
women in the town said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People run to them to settle every little dispute they have,''
said Giraldo. ``They are the authority here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rebel justice can run crude. On one recent morning, a pilot
waited at the airport for a cadaver he was to transport out. The
man had resurfaced after killing a neighbor, and was swiftly
executed by insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Calamar has never been easy. Mrs. Gomez arrived 25 years ago,
when there were no roads and only a tractor could get through the
rain forest. To sell produce, the entire family would trek 30 miles
to the state capital, San Jose del Guaviare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one baby in my belly, another on each arm, and one on my
back,'' she said.``We had nothing, but it was peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gomez and her husband, Carlos, who had come here after
nearly starving elsewhere in Colombia, started out planting yucca,
corn, rice and other subsistence crops. They ventured into coca,
but said they failed to make a decent living. Still, six years ago,
they had enough money to open the bakery and buy a few pool tables.
``Do we leave it all now?'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Betancourt's family first fled death threats from assassins,
then called pajaros, or birds, in 1965. They abandoned their small
coffee plantation in northwestern Colombia, and arrived in Calamar
in 1981 after trying, and failing, to eke out a living in the next
province north, Meta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no roads, no schools,'' Betancourt said. ``We
started to plant coca because that's what people would buy from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the guerrilla profit on the coca trade vary wildly,
from $100 million a month to $100 million a year. Around Calamar,
paramilitaries and insurgents benefit. The paramilitaries charge
$1,000 to $1,500 to allow trucks bearing coca's precursors past
their checkpoint, drivers and growers say.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say they feel safer with the insurgents nearby to
fend off any paramilitary raid. ``We're more vulnerable when they
think we're weak and unprotected,'' said Carlos Pedrozo, an
agricultural adviser to local farmers. ``This is a town of people
who have already been displaced from other areas. Nobody is about
to run again.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its hardships, Calamar has a feeling of community that
is hard won in Colombia, and not easily abandoned. Tatiana Rubio, a
20-year-old waitress and single mother, arrived here a year ago.
``People here watch out for each other,'' she said. ``It's not like
that everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Few here trust the military to protect them. The central
government says it has tried to crack down on military connivance
with death squads, but most residents here believe the
paramilitaries include active or retired security officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else is it that you'll have a military checkpoint on one
road, and a few hundred meters away have a paramilitary
roadblock?'' Mrs. Gomez said. ``Why doesn't the military shut them
down?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clark Clifford, the silver-haired Brahmin of the
nation's political establishment who advised presidents across half
a century of American history, died Saturday morning at the age of
91 at his home in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary of defense for one president, friend and confidant
of three others, Clifford frequently played the role of capital
wise man in inner-sanctum crises, helping President Harry S. Truman
find peace with labor and warning President Lyndon B. Johnson about
the folly of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   With a gentle drawl and an insider's run of the halls of power,
Clifford was consulted as well by Presidents John F. Kennedy and
Jimmy Carter, bridging the nation's postwar political era until he
ran into legal troubles in high-finance brokering.
</P>
<P>
   For all the roles he played in presidential history, Clifford
faced a rigorous ordeal in his final years, insisting on his
innocence to the end as he faced charges of fraud, conspiracy and
taking bribes in the biggest banking scandal in history, the
collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
</P>
<P>
   It was only earlier this year that Clifford and his law partner,
Robert A. Altman, reached a $5 million settlement with the Federal
Reserve Board, after federal prosecutors had whittled down the case
against them. Altman had been acquitted in 1993 in New York state
court of charges of bank fraud; indictments against Clifford had
been set aside because of his failing health.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford considered his role in extricating the United States
from what he called that ``wretched conflict in Vietnam'' to be his
finest moment; the day he was indicted and fingerprinted like a
common criminal, he said, was ``the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people in Washington, let alone Clark Clifford himself,
could have imagined so inglorious an end to so glorious a career.
From the time in World War II when he went to Washington as a naval
aide to Truman, Clifford was a highly respected lawyer and public
servant about whom scarcely an unkind word was ever uttered.
</P>
<P>
   He was a symbol of elegance _ 6 feet 2 inches tall, trim,
wavy-haired, his french cuffs always a {-inch longer than the
sleeves of his impeccably tailored double-breasted suits.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few who saw in him a little too much smoothness, a
touch of the riverboat gambler, perhaps. But to most people who
knew Clifford, he was a symbol of probity, even a legend in his own
time. Except for Spiro Agnew and a lone article in Ramparts
magazine, nobody had a bad word to say about him in public, at
least not until the BCCI scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Counsel Given to Four Presidents
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the White House or in his law offices across the
street from the White House, Clifford was the man politicians and
business leaders turned to for advice. Johnson, beleaguered by the
Vietnam War, turned to him to be his secretary of defense, and
Carter called on him to be a White House adviser. Kennedy asked him
for legal help and put him at the head of his transition team, and
Truman appointed him special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in government were as familiar with as many of the
nation's problems as Clark Clifford. He helped articulate the
policies for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. He
wrote the basic legislation establishing the CIA and the Defense
Department. On the domestic front, he wrote some of Truman's most
important speeches and helped keep labor peace in the postwar
period.
</P>
<P>
   With a thriving private law practice, Clifford liked to think of
himself as a bridge between business and government. But he was
more than that. Like many lawyers who made up the Washington
establishment, he advised corporations on how to navigate their way
through laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For each new client he had the same well-rehearsed speech that
he offered to one of his first clients, Howard Hughes. As Clifford
recounted it in his memoir, ``Counsel to the President'' (Random
House, 1991), he said his firm had no influence and would not
represent anyone before the president or any of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want influence you should consider going elsewhere,''
he would tell prospective clients. ``What we can offer you is an
extensive knowledge of how to deal with the government on your
problems. We will be able to give you advice on how best to present
your position to the appropriate departments and agencies of the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave the same speech to the Arab investors who came to see
him in 1978, the same investors who, it turned out, were front men
for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The bank, which
was chartered in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and had offices
in 70 countries, was shut down in July 1991 in a worldwide swoop by
banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
   BCCI was accused of fraud, laundering drug money and bribing
bank regulators and central bankers in 10 developing countries. It
was reported to have $20 billion in assets shortly before the
shutdown, but liquidators have been unable to find many of its
assets.

</P>
<P>
   The Importance of Credibility
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the mid-1980s, Clifford said his concept of
the practice of law ``is that through the years you conduct
yourself in such a manner that the staffs of the government
agencies have confidence in your integrity and your credibility.''
He added, ``I've never contended that I have influence, felt I had
influence or attempted to use influence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely his reputation for integrity and credibility
that led the group of Arab investors to seek Clifford's help in the
late 1970s when they wanted to acquire an American bank. The
Federal Reserve Board approved the takeover in 1981, reassured by
Clifford that there would be no control by BCCI, which he also
represented.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Clifford himself was to become chairman of the new
bank provided further reassurance to the regulators. The bank, with
Clifford as its chairman, was called First American Bankshares and
became the largest in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Robert Morgenthau, the district attorney in New
York City, disclosed that his office had found evidence that the
parent company of Clifford's bank was secretly controlled by BCCI.
The district attorney convened a grand jury to determine whether
Clifford and his partner, Altman, had deliberately misled federal
regulators when the two men assured them that BCCI would have no
control.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford's predicament worsened when it was disclosed that he
had made about $6 million in profits from bank stock that he bought
with an unsecured loan from BCCI. A New York grand jury handed up
indictments, as did the Justice Department. Clifford's assets in
New York, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said the investigation caused him pain and anger. If
the regulators had been deceived about any secret ownership by
BCCI, he said, he too had been deceived.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was deceived, it would have been an aberration. While
Washington lawyers like Clifford say they do not ``sell''
influence, what they do offer is sophistication, experience and
knowledge of the mechanics of government. That is why it was so
difficult for people to believe that Clifford, who was so
experienced at seeing around corners and anticipating problems for
his clients, could have been duped by front men for BCCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say I should have known, but a client tells his
lawyer what the client wants the lawyer to know,'' Clifford said.
``I have to admit that they came to me because of my standing and
reputation. If you think of that, then you'd understand better that
I'd be the last person they'd divulge this stuff to. I gave them
standing. Why would they jeopardize that? They knew if they told
me, I'd be out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   A `Wretched' War: Pride and Regrets
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent a total of only six years in government
service, those were the years that he liked to dwell upon. Looking
back one day in the mid-1980s as he was preparing to publish his
memoirs, he said in his customary measured tones, ``I believe the
contribution I made to reversing our policy in that wretched
conflict in Vietnam is very likely the most gratifying experience I
have had.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sense of self-congratulation. ``I was part of the
generation that I hold responsible for our country's getting into
that war,'' he said. ``I should have reached the conclusion earlier
that our participation in that war was a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford added: ``I've been quite severe with myself that I
didn't make a greater issue of it with President Johnson. I
permitted myself to be lulled into a false sense of optimism over
reports that came back from Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the nine months that he headed the Defense Department,
succeeding Robert McNamara in 1968, Clifford used everything he had
ever learned about the levers of power, all his skill as an
advocate and all his political capital to persuade the president
not to further escalate the role of American ground troops in South
Vietnam. U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia, Clifford
argued, was sapping the nation's strength as a world power.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, no longer in government service, he sought
to end the arms race as he had once tried to end U.S. participation
in the Vietnam War. When he began in government, the world had two
atomic bombs. Within four decades the world had 24,000 nuclear
bombs, and that awesome fact continued to preoccupy him long after
he left public office.
</P>
<P>
   In the Truman years, Clifford wrote that the language of
military power was the only language the Soviet Union understood.
He was nevertheless a consistent advocate of finding a way to
coexist with the Russians, and urged the adoption of arms
agreements and a nuclear freeze. He often said he was haunted by a
remark Winston Churchill had made about the superpowers and the
arms race: ``All they're going to do is make the rubble bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Old World Grace, Midwestern Openness
</P>
<P>
   Trim and disciplined _ he kept his weight at 180 pounds and
allowed himself dessert only when he fell below that, and he smoked
one cigarette a day, proving to doubters that he could do it _
Clifford was the personification of Old World grace combined with a
kind of Midwestern openness.
</P>
<P>
   To close the door on entering Clifford's office meant to close
out the hurried pace of the 20th century and to return to the more
measured rhythm of the 19th. In the cauldron of the Vietnam-era
Pentagon or in the paneled luxury of his Connecticut Avenue office,
there was always time for the niceties of gentlemanly conversation.
He would inquire after one's spouse, and ask whether the children
were writing from college.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential insider, Clifford had access to the corridors
of power and to the private clubs that were the marks of success.
He tried to play golf at Burning Tree Country Club in Maryland
every weekend, but he liked to take his lunch at the People's
Drugstore around the corner from his office. He said he could have
a sandwich and a glass of skim milk in 22 minutes at the lunch
counter there, while his occasional visits to the Metropolitan Club
meant an hour and 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His office kept a car and chauffeur at his disposal, but until
his health declined, he liked to drive himself to work from his
150-year-old house on Rockville Pike in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   No one can recall a time when Clifford raised his voice. What
Washington veterans do remember was his ability, even into his 80s,
to speak, seemingly extemporaneously and without notes, for 40
minutes. In fact, Clifford prepared every statement carefully and
then memorized it. ``The mind is a muscle,'' he said. ``The more I
use it, the better it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford had a way of taking his listeners step by step through
an argument, pausing every now and then to ask rhetorically, ``Do
you see?'' as he ushered them along with careful logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark was so smooth that when you lost with him, you thought
you'd won,'' said Phil Goulding, an assistant secretary of defense
under Clifford.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   His Father's Words: `To Live Is to Work'
</P>
<P>
   Clark McAdams Clifford was born in Fort Scott, Kan., on Dec. 25,
1906. He was named for his mother's brother, Clark McAdams, a
crusading editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Georgia McAdams Clifford, was, as her son remembered
her, a great storyteller, very dramatic and ``beautiful beyond
belief.'' His father was an official of the Missouri Pacific
Railroad, a man who, Clifford said, ``instilled in me the precept
that to live is to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He developed in me habits of industry _ too much, my wife
thinks sometimes,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   He was given chores to do when he was a boy, and as he got older
the tasks increased. When the family moved to St. Louis, he was a
delivery boy for a grocery store and in the summertime was a night
delivery boy for a drugstore. He also remembered earning $30 a
month for singing in a choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extremely happy childhood _ it was ideal,'' Clifford
said. ``I thought everybody loved his mother and father and would
go to the wall for his sister. Boy, was I naive!''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford attended college and law school at Washington
University in St. Louis. On graduating in 1928 he entered law
practice there. In the summer of 1929, while traveling in Europe,
he met a Boston woman, Margery Pepperell Kimball. They were married
on Oct. 3, 1931.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by their three
daughters, Faith Christian, of Chico, Calif., Joyce Burland, of
Halifax, Vt., and Randall Wight, of Baltimore; 12 grandchildren and
17 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   From Naval Aide to Truman Adviser
</P>
<P>
   Although Clifford was over the draft age and was already a
father when the United States entered World War II, he volunteered
for the Navy in 1943 and was accepted as a lieutenant junior grade.
After an assignment to assess the state of readiness at naval bases
on the West Coast, he was drawn into the White House in 1944, where
he began a career, as the columnist James Reston once put it, of
rescuing American presidents from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1945, when Truman attended the Potsdam Conference near
Berlin, Clifford found he did not have enough to do. ``You're kind
of a potted plant when you're a naval aide,'' he recalled. ``So I
offered to be helpful to Judge Samuel I. Rosenman, the special
counsel, who had more work than he could handle.'' When the
president returned, Rosenman said, ``Let's keep that young fellow
here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a speechwriter, and later as special counsel to Truman,
Clifford helped articulate the Truman Doctrine, a program proposed
in 1947 to help Greece and Turkey resist potential communist
expansionism, and related innovative programs for assisting
underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford also participated in the creation of the Marshall Plan
for the rehabilitation of Western Europe and in the formation of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Clifford to be Secretary of State George Marshall's
adversary on the issue of recognition of Israel. ``President Truman
said he would like me to prepare the case for the formation of a
Jewish homeland as if it were a case to be presented to the Supreme
Court,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who opposed recognition, became almost apoplectic at a
White House meeting when Clifford made his points _ points that he
could still reel off in detail 40 years later. When Truman decided
in favor of immediate recognition of Israel, Clifford said, there
were some tense days until Marshall relented.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford insisted that Truman acted out of conviction and
humanitarian considerations, not for domestic political advantage
as Marshall had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen Cabinet and Poker Games
</P>
<P>
   In his years in the Truman White House, Clifford was a
poker-playing regular of the kitchen cabinet; he even played a hand
or two with Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford was an important architect of the president's ``give
'em hell Harry'' whistle-stop campaign in 1948, when Truman won an
upset victory over the Republican nominee, Thomas E. Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford was also one of the principal architects of the
National Security Act of 1947, which unified the armed services and
established the CIA. Amendments that he framed two years later
greatly strengthened the authority of the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, he expressed regret that he had not made a
greater effort to kill the loyalty program instituted to root out
communist subversives. But he has been criticized for contributing
to the climate of fear by the proposition that ``the United States
must be prepared to wage atomic and biological warfare if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford left the White House in 1950 to open a law firm in
Washington, hoping to repair his personal finances, which had been
tattered by his years in the government, most of them at an annual
salary of $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman discussed with him the possibility of a seat on the
Supreme Court, Clifford said he would not be happy there. In 1949
he turned down an offer from a group of prominent Missouri
Democrats to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been in the Navy and the White House for almost seven
years,'' he said, looking back at that period. ``I had three
growing daughters reaching the age when daughters become expensive,
and going through this economic ordeal again that I'd been through
was an obstructing factor I could not overcome at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Making Millions as a Superlawyer
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the government, Clifford overcame his economic
problems so quickly that within four months he was able to move his
family from a rented house in Chevy Chase, Md., to the historic
house on three acres outside Bethesda that was his home for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Clients lined up outside his door. One of the first was Hughes,
who asked Clifford to be the Washington counsel for Trans World
Airlines. There followed a clientele that represented blue-chip
America and included General Electric, AT&AMP;T, ITT, RCA Corp., ABC,
DuPont, Hughes Tool, Time Inc., Standard Oil, Phillips Petroleum
and El Paso Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the man whose early ambition was to be the finest trial
lawyer in St. Louis became the first Washington lawyer to make a
million dollars a year _ because it was thought that he could fix
things for his clients as a result of his political connections.
Clifford said he always found this concept deeply disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   But the legend of his influence had grown so that a favorite
story around Washington was that whenever Clifford had occasion to
go to a government office on behalf of a client, the meeting would
be interrupted by the announcement that the president was calling
Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened exactly once,'' he protested. The president, he
said, was Kennedy, and there was a genuine emergency at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eisenhower years Clifford was not called by the White
House, but he remained active in Democratic politics. He was also
the personal lawyer for Kennedy, then a young senator from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, when Kennedy won the Democratic nomination for
president over Stuart Symington, whom Clifford had supported,
Kennedy asked Clifford to prepare an analysis of the problems
Kennedy would face in taking over the executive branch. Clifford
wrote a detailed assessment and, after the election, was named to
head the transition team.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner shortly after his election, Kennedy paid tribute to
Clifford for all the work he had done and for asking nothing in
return. ``All he asked was that we advertise his law firm on the
back of one-dollar bills,'' the president-elect quipped.
</P>
<P>
   After the abortive invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April
1961, an operation supported by the CIA, Kennedy again turned to
Clifford, who in 1947 wrote the legislation establishing the
agency. The president asked him to become a member, and then
chairman, of the newly created Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also turned to Clifford a year later, when the nation's
major steel companies refused to honor an agreement that the
president thought he had with them not to increase prices. The
companies backed down several days later, after Clifford convinced
them that it would be in their best interest to rescind the
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was hardly in office 24 hours when he called for
Clifford. Faced with the sudden and enormous task of running the
country after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson talked with Clifford
for two hours, then three, then four. It was late in the evening,
Clifford remembered, when Lady Bird Johnson entered the Oval Office
and reminded her husband, ``Just because you're president now
doesn't mean you don't have to eat dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rift Over Vietnam Strains a Friendship
</P>
<P>
   Clifford's warm relationship with Johnson became strained and
almost broke over Vietnam in 1967, when Johnson asked him to be
secretary of defense. Clifford's first assignment was to determine
how to meet Gen. William Westmoreland's request for 206,000 more
U.S. troops in Vietnam. The special panel Clifford set up to study
the issue soon became a forum for debating the rationale for the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Because he then had the complete confidence of the president,
whom he had known for more than 20 years, and because he had the
luxury of not being bound to previous official positions on
Vietnam, Clifford was able to ask the difficult questions. He did
not like the answers. No one could say whether the 206,000 troops
would be enough. No one could say whether the war would take
another six months, a year, two years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford finally came to the conclusion that there was no plan
for military victory in Vietnam and that the United States was in
what he called ``a kind of bottomless pit.'' He said he realized
that ``we could be there year after year, sacrificing tens of
thousands of American boys a year, and it just didn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clifford began to oppose Johnson on the war, a rift opened.
Clifford remembered a ``sense of personal hurt that I was doing
this to him.'' To help heal the breach, Clifford asked Johnson to
have lunch at his home on his final day in Washington, the day
Nixon was inaugurated as president. Johnson accepted and, as one of
his last official acts, awarded Clifford the Medal of Freedom with
Distinction, the highest award given to civilians in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having persuaded Johnson to cut back the bombing and negotiate
an end to the war, Clifford spent the next years trying to urge
Nixon to end the war. His efforts led Vice President Spiro Agnew to
accuse him of being ``a late-blooming opportunist who clambered
aboard the rolling bandwagon of the doves when the flak really
started to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Agnew's comments and a broadside from Ramparts
magazine at the other side of the political spectrum, Clifford's
more than 40 years in Washington passed with a relative absence of
criticism, until the bank scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one paid much attention when Ramparts called
Clifford a ``curious hybrid of Rasputin, Perry Como and Mr. Fix,''
in an article that depicted him as an architect of U.S. States
economic imperialism and linked that role to his legal work
representing major multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in his long career did he step out of character, and
that was when he referred to President Ronald Reagan as an
``amiable dunce.'' The remark was made at a private dinner party
but, unknown to Clifford, a tape recording had been made so that
the hostess, who was ill with the flu and unable to come to her own
party, could hear what was expected to be some sparkling
conversation. Excerpts from that tape were published out of
context.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford explained his remark this way: ``In the fall of 1982,
President Reagan said he would cut taxes by $750 billion,
substantially increase defense expenditures and balance the budget
in the 1984 fiscal year. Those were public promises. I made a
comment that if he would accomplish that feat, he'd be a national
hero. If, on the other hand, it did not work out after such a
specific and encouraging promise and commitment, I thought the
American people would regard him as an amiable dunce.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity some time later to retract his remark,
however, Clifford declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In time, even Carter, who kept his distance from the Washington
establishment, turned to Clifford for advice _ when Carter's budget
director, Bert Lance, came under attack for his banking practices
in Georgia. A former Kennedy aide later remarked, ``They ran
against Washington, but when the water comes up to their knees,
they call for Clark Clifford.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Challenge in His Later Years
</P>
<P>
   It was Lance who introduced Clifford to the Arab investors who
sought to take over the bank in Washington that was to become known
as First American Bank. Clifford and his young partner, Altman,
structured the deal that led to the takeover of the bank and,
according to prosecutors, the success of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in the United States. Clifford said to the
end that he did not know that BCCI had been behind the purchase of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the bank became a new challenge for his later years. He
looked at his contemporaries who had retired, and did not like what
he saw, he said in an interview in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them would go with their wives each morning to the
market and help with the marketing, pushing those carts and all,''
he told the interviewer. ``Well, I didn't find that very
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he accepted the clients who are now known to have been
associated with BCCI, and agreed to become the chairman of First
American Bank. In itself, some lawyers saw his wearing of two hats
as a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford was called before congressional committees and had his
lawyers send reams of material to the prosecutors in an effort to
show that his work for BCCI and First American was proper.
</P>
<P>
   How will history judge Clark Clifford, he was asked by a visitor
to his office several months before he was indicted. ``It depends
on the ultimate result,'' he said. ``If it comes and goes and
nothing else happens, gradually it gets swallowed up in history. If
it turns out badly, as far as history is concerned, I've taken a
bad tumble.''

CALL TO ARMS: A FREE MEDIA CAN DO BATTLE WITH GRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After surveying the Asian financial crisis, the
World Bank has decided that a strong and independent news media
could be an important protection against economic mismanagement and
government malfeasance in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economies of Asian countries and Russia go into free
fall, the independent newspapers, magazines, television and radio
stations these countries do have are being dragged down, and many
are failing or being forced to scale back their activities by lack
of money.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the opening session of the annual meeting of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, World Bank
president James Wolfensohn pointedly included ''the free flow of
information'' as one of the ``essentials of good governance'' on
which, he argued, sustainable economic progress depends.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier last week the World Bank was the host of a seminar
on the role of the news media in holding governments accountable
for their economic policies and fighting corruption and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank officials, in mulling over the Asian debacle, say
they have concluded that a freer, more aggressive and more critical
news media in the region would have put a brake on the governmental
corruption and theso-called crony capitalism that are widely seen
as at the heart of today's economic mess.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is already financing training for journalists
from the developing world. And while it has no plans to start
financing news organizations there, officials say it will encourage
charities, foundations and other aid-giving bodies to do more to
strengthen fledgling news media throughout the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A freer mass media would have challenged the quality of
economic policy and encouraged a more vigorous public response to
abuses'' says Mark Malloch-Brown, the World Bank's vice president
for communications.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate challenge is not so much to create new newspapers
or television stations as to save those that already exist from the
deepening recession, which is gripping more than a quarter of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some help is already on the way. Last week, international
financier George Soros gave $10 million toward an $80 million fund
he plans to create to help struggling, independent news
organizations in Russia ride out the severe economic downturn in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Russian economy in its present state, many fledgling
and established news organizations are threatened and some may
already have failed'' Sasa Vucinic, director of the Media
Development Loan Fund in Prague, told the World Bank seminar when
he announced Soros' initiative. ``The media has no political
independence without economic independence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the seminar agreed with the World Bank that a more
crusading news media could have softened Asia's economic crisis,
however complex the causes of the downturn may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience a genuine free flow of information can solve
almost any problem,'' said Frances D'Souza of Article 19, a
London-based anti-censorship organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption was not the only reason for the Asian crisis, but
more objective reporting would have shown that these countries were
building a mirage,'' noted Peter Eigen of Transparency
International, which seeks to combat bribery and corruption around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eigen said Denmark, Sweden and Finland, which Transparency
International recently named as the three least corrupt countries
in the world, also have the strongest freedom-of-information laws
in Europe as well as the highest rates of newspaper readership.
</P>
<P>
   But some speakers cautioned that seemingly free news media can
sometimes be caught by invisible shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Balding of the World Association of Newspapers, a
Paris-based press organization, said Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic could tolerate an apparently free opposition press
because the government's stranglehold on distribution virtually
confined it to Belgrade, preventing it from circulating throughout
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Balding said his organization is now financing an independent
newspaper distribution system in Yugoslavia that allows opposition
papers and magazines to reach six other Serbian towns in addition
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he pointed out that Nigeria's previous military
ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, allowed the local press considerable
freedom to say what it liked about him and his regime because he
was a tough-minded dictator who took no notice of what it wrote.

PERPETUATING AN `EMERGENCY' IN WAR-TORN SUDAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Faced with the prospect of pictures of
emaciated, malnourished children as well as thousands of deaths in
southern Sudan, the world's governments launched Operation Lifeline
Sudan and appealed for funds to meet the ``emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1989. By truck, plane and barge, tons of food and
medicine were delivered to the suffering in Africa's largest
country, where a civil war was the root cause of the starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a decade and more than $2 billion later, the
situation is virtually identical, despite what Operation Lifeline
describes as one of the largest relief operations ever. The
impoverished in southern Sudan are still starving and dying, and
the war goes on. Operation Lifeline Sudan, a consortium of two U.N.
agencies and 39 nongovernment relief organizations, has become
institutionalized, with offices and a staff at the bucolic U.N.
campus here issuing a steady flow of press releases.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is now spending $1 million a day on the relief
effort. The expenditure will grow endlessly, relief officials said
last week, unless there is an end to the war, which has already
gone on for 15 years. That seems remote, not least because neither
the United States nor the European Union is trying very hard to
negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department will soon declare Sudan an emergency _ for
the 10th consecutive year _ so that another $70 million to $100
million in U.S. disaster aid can be sent there this year, U.S.
officials said. The total U.S. contribution during the last decade
has been more than $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and at the relief organizations, unable
to explain even to themselves how an emergency can last for a
decade, now talk about an emergency that is ``complex'' or
``protracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Semantics do not resolve a far more serious question about a
conflict usually portrayed as pitting African Christians and
animists in the south against Muslim Arabs in Sudan's north: Is the
aid helping perpetuate the fighting, giving the factions what they
need to carry on a war in which both sides are guilty of atrocities
against civilians?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, absolutely,'' said a senior U.S. diplomat who has
served in Sudan. ``They talk about the war as between the north and
south, but the donors are a major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said a Clinton administration official in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that those views would not sit well with many in
Congress or at the White House, the officials did not want to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But the same view was expressed in a dozen interviews over the
last week, by diplomats, officials and aid workers from different
countries. And it does not please the donor governments and relief
agencies that rebel leaders have bluntly declared that they expect
the aid to continue so the war can.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are thinking hard about this ethical dilemma,'' said a
European Union relief official.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to call for an end to the aid, relief officials say,
knowing that it would mean starving children. But they acknowledge
that no one has calculated whether more lives can be saved in the
long run by substantially reducing aid to press the parties to stop
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. relief operation is now supplying food for about a
million people in southern Sudan, and the death rate, which was as
high as 63 per 10,000 population in some areas a few months ago,
has declined to about 3 per 10,000, relief officials said this
week. ``It's wrong to make the humanitarian agencies the fall guys
for the perpetuation of this war,'' said Brenda Barton, a
spokeswoman here for the World Food Program, which is spending $154
million this year on the relief effort; UNICEF is the other U.N.
agency that is part of Operation Lifeline Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our job,'' Ms. Barton said. ``The politicians have
to do theirs. Where are the governments who are funding this?''
</P>
<P>
   The vast aid effort has allowed the United States and the
European Union to avoid the more difficult task of pushing the
parties to end the war, relief workers and diplomats agree. The war
in Sudan is at once more complex and simpler than a
Christian-Muslim, African-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Like most wars, ``it is basically about power and money,'' said
a European diplomat who has followed the conflict for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's Arabs have long had both, and they do not want to share
it. But if the rebels ever defeated the government, the warlords in
the south, torn by ethnic loyalties and thirst for power, would
turn their guns and forces on one another, students of the war and
Sudan say.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Recently, the strongest rebel leader at the moment, John Garang,
the American-educated head of the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army, delivered a blunt message to a U.N. delegation. ``The SPLA
has decided to continue the war,'' he said, according to a
diplomat. ``It is up to the international community to provide
humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was ``outraged,'' the diplomat said. And at a
recent meeting with the rebels, another European diplomat fairly
shouted: ``What the hell has the SPLA done to help their people?
Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   No rebel movement can succeed without the support of the people,
and that requires that they be fed. Garang, whose soldiers always
seem to have enough food, has no supply lines to get food or other
stocks to the people in the south, which thus makes them dependent
on the international relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although Operation Lifeline Sudan strives to be impartial,
delivering relief to government areas as well, the overall aid
program favors the rebels, relief workers and U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal nongovernment relief agencies working in
Sudan is World Vision, a Christian organization that has its
headquarters in Washington. World Vision, which has called on the
U.S. government to reduce its ties to the Khartoum government, will
double its programs in southern Sudan next year, to $20 million,
with most of that money coming from the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment political efforts to end the war are in the hands
of something called the Intergovernmental Authority on Development,
which is made up of a half-dozen African countries.
</P>
<P>
   One senior European diplomat lamented that the group was ``an
excuse to do nothing,'' while acknowledging that the European Union
did not have a strong, unified policy for ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. diplomat said that Washington had ``no great
interest'' in trying to end the fighting. He added that the United
States could hardly play the role of a neutral mediator. The United
States has long accused the Sudanese of harboring terrorists, and
it recently launched a missile attack on a factory in the capital;
at the same time, senior State Department officials have openly
expressed sympathy for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could, however, use its considerable influence
with the rebels, European officials say, to help bring about a
comprehensive cease-fire and an embargo on arms deliveries to both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   If there is not ``some political movement'' toward ending the
war, said a European relief official, the relief bill is going to
soar. ``You ain't seen nothin' yet.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ To many Serbs in this frightened capital,
the threats of air strikes against the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, are producing one result that Washington says it does
not want: strengthening rather than weakening Milosevic's control.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they say, Milosevic may accede to some of the
demands on Kosovo and avert the calamity of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressures of outside military action have accelerated
in the past week, Milosevic has introduced new repressive measures
to halt foreign broadcasts, close an independent radio station and
hound academics at the University of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of the far right leader of the Radical Party
and deputy premier of Serbia, Vojislav Seselj, Milosevic has
whipped up an atmosphere of victimization that has turned
smoldering anger about his miserable economy into anger at the
West, and at the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very good at creating a xenophobia inside the country
and using that as an instrument to step down on any kind of
democratic process,'' said Milan Protic, a Serbian historian. ``So
what he has done in the past few weeks is declare an informal state
of war and used that to jump on the university and the independent
media.''
</P>
<P>
   After Milosevic signed the peace agreement that ended the war in
Bosnia three years ago, the situation in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo remained the last unfinished piece of business
in Milosevic's failed vision of a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Milosevic used Kosovo as the cause that
propelled him to power, whipping Serbs into an emotional frenzy
about the need to protect the Serbian province, the touchstone of
Serbian culture and home to the finest Serbian Orthodox churches
and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1995 he rallied Serbs around him in his losing
fight for Croatia and Bosnia. In the last six months he has played
a similar card with Kosovo. Although Serb fervor has proved harder
to stoke now, the hostility to ethnic Albanian dominance of Kosovo
remains acute among Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That dominance makes it increasingly difficult for Milosevic to
justify to the outside world his abrogation of the province's
autonomy in 1989 and the imposition of Serbian police control.
Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics in Yugoslavia, with
Serbia dominant.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade in the last few days, as homemakers have stocked up
on essential supplies and drivers have tried to find scarce
gasoline for their cars, many worry not so much about a NATO
bombing itself as about the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The public has been warned that an outside attack would result
in a declaration of a state of war by the government, giving the
authorities wide powers of mobilization, arrest without charges,
and introduction of food rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of the bombing; I know they won't bomb me,''
said Brigitte Miladinovic, a receptionist. ``I'm scared of what
happens afterward _ and all the crazy Serb men who will want to go
to Kosovo and fight the Albanians.'' On Thursday night, Seselj
appeared on a call-in show on Palma Television, a station owned by
a government supporter, appealing for volunteers to go to Kosovo in
the event of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In order to squelch dissent, the Serbian government issued a
decree on Friday officially banning the rebroadcast of the
Serbian-language reports by Radio Free Europe, British Broadcasting
Corp. and Deutsche Welle. These news services were broadcast by
more than 30 independent radio stations in Serbia, including Radio
B-92, the most influential of the nongovernment stations.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, said the managers of the radio stations, the decree
appears to be open-ended in effect.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Radio Index, run by university students was
ordered to vacate the studios it rented in the building of the
state-controlled television. Transmission was cut, Radio Index
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Belgrade, Milosevic has continued a
campaign started last spring of stripping professors who are not
members of his ruling Socialist Party of their posts in the law,
electronics and linguistics faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians in Serbia complain that the laserlike
attention that Washington has devoted to Milosevic has reinforced
his position, even though his real popularity is far less than it
was a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, as diplomats have poured into Belgrade to
plead with Milosevic about Kosovo, few of them have sought out
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo,
the Rev. Sava Janjic, said in an interview that he believes the
approach of Richard Holbrooke, who has been engaged in increasingly
intense negotiations with Milosevic as NATO steps up its threat of
air strikes, is ``encouraging the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a good settlement, you need all representatives on the
Serb side, but Milosevic is the only who is asked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals and opposition leaders insist that by
concentrating on Milosevic, Western leaders play into his hands.
Virtually the only time Milosevic appears on television in Serbia
is during the visits of foreign dignitaries, when he is filmed
sitting in an armchair in front of a bowl of flowers, listening
sphinxlike to his important visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here watch him and think: `If the international
community supports him, who are we to oppose him?''' said Protic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the xenophobia stirred up by media controlled by
Milosevic, however, there is far less enthusiasm for the cause in
Kosovo than there was for the earlier war in Bosnia. ``I personally
don't know one person who is willing to go and fight in Kosovo but
I have a lot of friends who volunteered to go to Croatia and
Bosnia,'' said a university student, who declined to give his name
for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombing did go ahead, some here predict, Milosevic would
emerge triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both ordinary people and intellectuals would turn against the
outside world,'' said Mladjan Dinkic, a young economist who heads
Group 17, a confederation of economists. ``In that case the country
would sink into complete isolation that would perfectly suit
Milosevic and his hard-line socialists, Seselj radicals and the
part of the Yugoslav left run by his wife, Mira Markovic.''
</P>
<P>
   The teetering Yugoslav economy is Milosevic's most vulnerable
point and, say his critics, the threats from NATO distract
attention from the general misery.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product of roughly $15 billion is about half
what it was in 1989. Nearly half the work force is unemployed, and
pensioners, who make up a large percentage of the population, are
now receiving their monthly checks of about $100 three months late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic doesn't know what to do with the economy and he
needs NATO to explain why everything is bad,'' said Gordana Igric,
a researcher with the Humanitarian Law Center, which compiles
reports on atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One of Milosevic's longtime critics charged that the Yugoslav
leader would continue to provoke crises for the sake of staying in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West struck a deal with the regime in Belgrade and the war
ended, but the hope for a real democratic reform was put on hold
when the regime received credibility and recognition,'' said Prince
Alexander of Yugoslavia, exiled scion of the country's pre-World
War II monarchy, in an appeal from his base in London.

   CASCADE, Colo. _ Hiking below the spectacular Pikes Peak
Highway, Gail Snyder points out the behind-the-scenes damage to the
mountain. For decades, rain water has drained unchecked off the
gravel road leading to the 14,110-foot summit, carving gullies deep
enough to swallow ponderosa pines whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forest floor is buried under 2 to 4 feet of gravel,'' said
Ms. Snyder, a Sierra Club spokeswoman. ``Alpine ponds are filled
with gravel, wetlands are filled with gravel.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculating that the city of Colorado Springs, the highway
caretaker, has dumped 1.5 million tons of gravel on it over the
last two decades to maintain it, the Sierra Club is suing the city,
charging it with violating the Clean Water Act. Because the
mountain is in a national forest, the U.S. Forest Service has also
been named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snyder and many environmentalists want the road paved to
help control erosion. But asphalt would be a sacrilege to auto
racing fans and drivers who gather here every Fourth of July for a
noisy, dusty day of events billed as the Race to the Clouds.
Climbing 12{ miles, twisting around 156 turns and switchbacks, the
race course has challenged drivers and mechanics since the first
checkered flag dropped in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravel always has helped level the playing field,'' said Rod
Millen, a New Zealand driver who holds the speed record for burning
up the mountain in 10 minutes and 4 seconds. ``In most races now,
there is a greater emphasis on the machine. When you have to race
on a loose surface road, the emphasis shifts from the machine to
the driver's skill. It would be great to keep that.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they intend to pave the road and make needed
repairs related to it. But the work could drag on for more than a
decade, they said, because the city has classified the highway as a
government enterprise that cannot receive local tax money. It can
receive federal grants, and Colorado members of Congress are
pushing for them.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only race cars that travel to the summit. The mountain
is the nation's most heavily visited high peak. Last year, Pikes
Peak drew more than half a million visitors: 60,000 on foot,
200,000 on a cog railroad and 300,000 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The highway starts at an altitude of 7,400 feet, about 1,100
feet higher than the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire,
the highest mountain in New England. In climatic terms, the
hourlong, 19-mile drive from the start of the road to the peak's
summit is the equivalent of driving 4,000 miles due north. Cars
climb from golden aspen groves and mule deer meadows to rocky
tundra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists find the ascent, on gravel without guardrails, so
unnerving that Forest Service employees have to drive their cars
down the mountain. But overall, tourist enthusiasm remains strong.
Last May 1, Colorado Springs increased the highway toll by
two-thirds, to $10 for each adult. Despite the increase, the number
of summer visitors grew by 4,000 over the summer of 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pikes Peak, the mountain, is really the tourist anchor for the
entire region,'' said Kitty Clemens, director of the regional
tourism board, Pikes Peak Country Attractions Association. About 80
percent of the visitors to the mountain highway are from out of
state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the tourism dollars and cars rolling,
environmentalists say, the highway's managers have left Pikes Peak
awash in gravel. ``There are live ponderosas falling into
gullies,'' Ms. Snyder said. ``There are beaver ponds filling with
gravel, there are trees with 6- to 7-feet of gravel around their
base.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Noting that the city had cut its annual spread of road gravel
from 50,000 tons in the early 1990's to about 20,000 this year, Ms.
Snyder said, ``It's like going from 500 cigarettes a day to 200
cigarettes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   While the highway may have been state of the art when it opened
in 1915, she said, it needs to undergo a $15 million repair to
sharply diminish erosion from runoff. Instead of using
old-fashioned ``shotgun culverts'' to pipe water off mountainsides,
Ms. Snyder said, the city should install modern culverts, designed
to brake and dissipate water draining off the road. Ponds should be
built to trap sediments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club said in its suit filed in U.S. District Court
that if the city did not adopt a binding timetable to implement an
acceptable remediation plan, the court should order the Forest
Service to suspend the city's operating license for the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been reports coming out since the 1950s saying,
`You have got a gravel problem,''' said Michael Freeman, the lawyer
for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund Inc., which filed the suit for
the Sierra Club. ``The city ignored the problem for decades. They
ignored the Sierra Club for decades, until we sued them. They could
make this lawsuit go away tomorrow if they would make a binding
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Race officials favor erosion controls, and warn that paving
would lull tourists into driving dangerously fast. Noting that the
race is the second oldest car race in the nation, after the
Indianapolis 500, Buster Cogswell, chairman of the Pikes Peak
International Hill Climb, said: ``There is a rich tradition and
history. It has been on gravel since 1916.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snyder retorts, ``Pikes Peak is not a theme park, nor a race
track.''
</P>
<P>
   With the toll increase, the annual gross revenue from tolls and
concession sales should hit $2.5 million, said Hans D. Schalk, the
city's manager of the highway. ``This is a national monument that
has been neglected,'' Schalk said. ``Congress could come to the
table with $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to ask the City Council for authorization to
double within two years the paved section of the highway, to 14
miles. Then, offering music to environmentalists' ears, Schalk
asserted, ``The future of this highway is a paved highway.''

turmoil of trying to care for and house tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanian refugees flooding into this country from Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province, one man's efforts to help stands out. An ethnic
Albanian who left Kosovo for a better life with his family in
Switzerland many years ago, the man returned to Albania to build
apartments. Before he could finish putting windows and doors on his
first building, the refugee crisis erupted. Seeing that the people
needed shelter, he borrowed $8,000 to finish the building and is
now housing _ for free _ 108 people in 24 apartments. Although they
are sleeping on floors with no lights and running water, to them he
is a godsend. (Roughton, Cox News Service, 450 words).

14-19) that seek a way for peaceful co-existence between the giant

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ In 1966, Willie Bies Jr. became a police
officer in this university city, assigned to the poor black
neighborhood on the west side where patrol cars were often pelted
with rocks. He did such a good job that the police chief made him
the training officer who taught rookies the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Bies, then a corporal, retired, becoming one of only
two Tuscaloosa police officers to work for 25 years without getting
a pension. Like the other officer, Herbert Harris, Bies is black.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1968, which was when, the two officers said, they realized
that they were being excluded from the pension plan, they have
pleaded their case with every public official who would give them
an audience as well as sued the city, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Tuscaloosa Police and Firemen's Pension Fund,
which is controlled by white officers and firefighters, has argued
in court papers that the Bies and Harris are not entitled to
pensions because they did not make contributions to the pension
plan. Instead, the two paid Social Security taxes, from which other
officers were exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the pension board and their lawyer declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the two officers' fight for police pensions
illustrates how a third of a century after the civil rights
movement extended equal treatment under the law to all Americans,
people employed under the rules of the segregationist South are
still battling for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities in the South classified laborers, or ``outdoor
workers,'' as temporary employees, letting them go for one month
each year. So these workers, most of whom were black, have been
legally denied pensions, said Richard Seymour, who directs the
employment practice project of the Lawyers Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring temporary and part-time workers to avoid paying benefits
has again come into fashion and affects all ethnic groups. But the
practice is under scrutiny from the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund Inc., which suspects the practice is used to
discriminate against some workers on the basis of race, said Steve
Ralston, a lawyer for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bies, 62, and Harris, who retired in 1992 and died of pancreatic
cancer on Sept. 28 at the age of 65, both said that when they and
two other black men were hired in 1966 and 1967 they were hired
outside the civil service system, but were promised that if they
completed a year's probation they would have permanent jobs with
full benefits. (The third officer was dismissed after confessing to
a robbery. The fourth died two decades ago.)
</P>
<P>
   But in 1968, Social Security taxes were still being withheld
from their checks, instead of pension contributions. The rest of
the police force was exempt from Social Security taxes. Six current
and former city officials and three local civil rights leaders
familiar with the case confirmed the two officers' accounts of the
hirings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a year after they started seeking inclusion in the
pension plan, the badges of all four officers were replaced with
badges reading ``special police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Dan Burroughs, now retired, said recently that he
hated taking their badges. ``Bies and Harris left my office and
went back out and did exactly the same work as every other police
officer _ faced the same dangers,'' Burroughs said. ``And they did
a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Bies and Harris sued the city to be given equal pay and
rank for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, U.S. District Judge Sam Poynter ordered their badges
returned. But the judge accepted the city's contention that the
officers' Social Security benefits would roughly equal the value of
any police pensions, said Jack Drake, a Tuscaloosa lawyer who
represented them in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Bies and Harris also approached local officials for help,
including David Andres, a young white lawyer who, in 1977, had just
been elected the city commissioner for public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to these men is wrong,'' Andres said recently.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the pension fund's board of trustees, he tried to
add the two men to the plan in 1980, but found white officers were
firmly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The police and fire chiefs voted with Andres, but the four
elected representatives of the police officers and firefighters
opposed the action and the motion failed, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Bies and Harris the vote, they couldn't believe
it,'' Andres recalled. ``I arranged to have another vote, and this
time I invited Bies and Harris to the meeting, so that they could
see for themselves that they were being lied to.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, new lawyers retained by Bies and Harris brought their
battle for a pension back to Poynter because, since 1991, the
pension of a retired officer or firefighter had been worth $1,880 a
month, three times the value of the Social Security benefits that
neither man was then old enough to collect.
</P>
<P>
   The city agreed to give both men full police pensions, and
Poynter ordered that they be ``retroactively placed on the rolls of
the Police and Firemen's Pension Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also ordered both men to pay the pension fund the
amount that would have been deducted from their paychecks over 25
years, even though similar amounts had been withheld for Social
Security taxes from their checks, but not those of other police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Bies would have had to pay $36,270 _ a sum equal to his gross
pay for a year and a half _ when he retired in 1991 without any
type of pension.
</P>
<P>
   But the pension fund challenged the ruling, saying the city had
no right to settle on its behalf. The judge then voided his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Turberville, a lawyer from Birmingham, Ala., who brought the
case for the two officers, said the pension fund's lawyer, Robert
Prince, had told him the fund would litigate the case until it
drove Turberville's firm into bankruptcy, if necessary. The case
was not pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Prince said he was not authorized to comment. The three pension
fund trustees who could be reached declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Laumer, a lawyer who worked for Turberville at the time,
said that in 1993 she took Bies and Harris to a meeting with two
dozen Tuscaloosa police officers in an attempt to settle the
matter, only to encounter racial hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was at a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan,'' she
said, recalling whispered epithets. ``One of the police officers
said, `You all got off the garbage truck and that's what you
wanted, so what are you complaining about?'''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bies nor Harris had worked on garbage trucks, though
both had been laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The case is in the hands of Norman Stein, a professor at the
University of Alabama Law School who runs a federally financed
clinic to help people deprived of pensions, and Sue Thompson, a
Tuscaloosa lawyer who runs a practice helping poor people in civil
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson said, ``Nobody here wants to deal with the real
issue, which is that the city leaders and white officers did not
think they should have been hired and did not believe they should
be paid equally because they do not believe that they are equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The city, she said, could simply pay the retired officers what
they would have gotten since they retired, less their Social
Security benefits and a modest pension for city laborers that is
paid starting at age 65. Harris said a month before he died that he
had not received his laborers' pension, either.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson said the Harris family should receive the money he
should have been paid since 1992, plus survivor's benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Alvin DuPont, who calls Tuscaloosa ``the most progressive
city in Alabama,'' was chairman of the pension fund in 1993, when
the case was last in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently whether he believed that the two police
officers had been treated fairly, he said: ``If you put it on a
question of fairness, well, it's kind of self-incriminating if I
say that it isn't fair, isn't it? They represented the city real
well, those two. To get caught in this after they served the city
so well is, well, unfortunate. So I'd like to see them get
something. Yes. Something. They should get something.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Tuscaloosa's black officers hired after the first four
are in the pension plan. There are now about three dozen blacks out
of 225 officers.

Nova Scotia. The rain will persist in northeast New England and
scattered showers will linger over the higher terrain of the
central sections. Fog will be common in the valleys of the central
Appalachians, but sunshine will dominate much of the Middle
Atlantic region, with seasonably mild readings.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly sunny, pleasant conditions are expected from the central
Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The morning will feature patches of dense
fog in the Tennessee Valley, but afternoon sunshine will boost
temperatures to above normal readings. A weak cold front will
dissipate across southern Florida, but variable clouds and widely
separated showers are expected.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of warm air will reach from the Plains into the
Mississippi Valley. Moisture will begin to stream north from the
western Gulf of Mexico leading to clouds in east Texas. Farther
north, clouds will form in the Missouri Valley as mild, moist air
rises over cool air to the north. Showers will develop from eastern
Nebraska to the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Cold rain will be driven by gusty winds from central North
Dakota to eastern Montana. Wet snow will taper off in the Big Horn
mountains early as winds blow from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine and cool weather is likely in the central Rockies until
clouds arrive from the Northwest later on. An offshore storm will
bring rain to western Washington with showers spreading inland. The
Southwest will be sunny and a bit cooler, but dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Shrinking Surplus
</P>
<P>
   The year began quite wet from Washington to Boston with most of
the Northeast ending the spring with a rainfall surplus of nearly
10 inches. However, since the summer, the Middle Atlantic region
has turned very dry, while New England has stayed moist. Thursday
and Friday, Boston tallied more than 3 inches of rain, raising the
year to date rainfall to more than 48 inches, which is 18 inches
above the normal precipitation to date. Washington only measured a
trace of rain, helping to shrink their surplus to a mere three
inches above the normal precipitation. &QL;

INDONESIAN MAGAZINE RETURNS WITH GUSTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After four years and a momentous turn of
events, Tempo magazine, once Indonesia's best-selling news weekly,
is back on the streets. It has a new look and a determination to
win back the readers stolen away by the government of the former
president, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   It is out with a cover article on the reports of widespread rape
of ethnic Chinese women during the uprising against Suharto in May.
The new Tempo dived head first into the volatile territory that
earned the magazine its reputation as one of the country's few
independent sources of information. Suharto's successor and the man
who now leads the country, President B.J. Habibie, was the subject
of the cover article of the previous issue _ in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this day we do not know why we were closed, but we heard
that it had to do with our story on the warships from East
Germany,'' said Tempo's chief editor, Goenawan Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Tempo lost its publishing license soon after looking into the
government's purchase of 39 second-hand Soviet-built warships,
which was recommended by Habibie, then minister of research and
technology. Two other influential publications, Editor and DeTik,
were also closed that year for reasons that were never fully
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the four-month-old Habibie administration is
sincere about liberalizing controls on a press that was muzzled and
manipulated for more than three decades, Goenawan said: ``We don't
care if they're committed or not. It's more about our commitment to
opening the doors to find the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempo may face stiff competition in a media landscape that in
recent months has seen dozens of new magazines and tabloids. But
Ashadi Siregar of the Institute for Research, Education and
Publications, an independent media research group, said the image
of Tempo as the only magazine that was not co-opted by the Suharto
regime would boost its credibility over the competition as would
its commitment to investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other publications have taken the position of Tempo,'' he
said. ``In the end, even the old government lost a reliable source
of information when Tempo was killed because there was no other
magazine that really reflected the thinking of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's newsstands in Indonesia bear testimony to the striking
changes that have occurred since the since resignation of Suharto.
From a time when editors were told whose picture should appear on
what pages and reprimanded for ``cynical reporting,'' the local
media are now tackling issues once deemed too sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Papers down to the village level carry headlines not only on the
business practices of the former first family and human rights
violations by the military, but also on illicit dealings and
charges of nepotism in their local administrations.

MACHINES TO CHECK AIRLINE BAGS MOSTLY IDLE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration has spent more
than $122 million on machines to detect bombs in checked baggage,
but those machines that have been installed sit idle for most of
the day, according to investigators from the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, which cost $1.3 million each to buy and install,
are supposed to be capable of handling 225 bags an hour, but of 13
that were audited by investigators, nine handled fewer than 200
bags a day, according to a report released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some got so little use that the operators could not maintain
proficiency in running them, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some airports, they're sitting relatively unused,''
Lawrence Weintrob, an assistant inspector general of the
Transportation Department, said in a telephone interview. ``Some
airports that are using them are using them rarely, or process
relatively few bags through them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cathal Flynn, assistant administrator of the FAA for civil
aviation security, said the average number of bags processed
through each machine was rising sharply as airlines gained
experience. Flynn and airline representatives said that part of the
problem was that the computerized system for choosing which
passengers' bags get scanned was still developing, and would not be
fully implemented until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't ironed out all the kinks in the process,'' said
Susan Rork, managing director of security at the Air Transport
Association, the trade group of the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized system singles out individuals about whom there
is too little information to conclude that they are not a threat,
officials say. It also draws a sample from the group judged not to
be a threat, to increase the chance that a terrorist would be
caught, and to make the system fairer, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, he said, is that if the system were changed to
require that a larger number of passengers have their bags
scrutinized, then at peak periods people would be delayed so long
they would miss their flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get people fuming at a line, that's not good either,''
Flynn said. That, he said, would probably discourage machine
operators from doing their jobs right. And delays, he said, would
damage public acceptance of security measures.
</P>
<P>
   In written comments responding to the report, the FAA said that
the agency would ``pursue a more coherent strategy with air
carriers to ramp-up to a higher level of use.'' However, the agency
said, it would be ``many years'' before technology allowed
screening of all bags.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors also said that the machines in use could handle only
about half as many bags as they did in lab tests, partly because
they sound false alarms far more when in use at airports. Each
false alarm requires time to resolve. (All alarms so far have been
false, officials said, because no bombs have been detected.)
</P>
<P>
   The machines' higher false alarm rate is ``probably a reason why
they don't use it as often as they should,'' Weintrob said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine of the machines have been installed so far; plans are
to have 74 in place by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of airports where the machines are installed declined
to comment and asked not to be identified. Under FAA rules, airport
operators are responsible for various aspects of security, but not
for screening bags. That responsibility falls to the airlines.

AVIATION TREASURES TO LAND AT NEW SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of Robert Padgett framed by aircraft propeller is
being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make

(ak) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVER HILL, Md. _ Robert Padgett worked slowly, lovingly, on
the Soviet surface-to-air missile, freshly painted gray but with
its Cyrillic markings intact, to make sure that it would be in
prime condition for historians a century from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Middle East unit _ it was full of sand when we got
it,'' said Padgett, a restoration technician at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was captured by the Israelis from the Egyptians in
1967, he said. An SA-2, the kind of surface-to-air missile that
brought down Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane in 1960, it was
still sleek and nasty-looking, sitting on a trailer, casually
pointed at the Smithsonian's Hawker Hurricane, a mainstay of the
Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, which was undergoing
restoration a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution is often described as the nation's
attic, but it has an attic of its own, called the Paul E. Garber
Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility, here in suburban
Maryland. It is squeezed full of treasures that will not fit in the
Smithsonian's famous museums.
</P>
<P>
   For every plane on display at the National Air and Space Museum
headquarters in Washington, there are three more stashed away here,
in an obscure complex of pink corrugated metal buildings, crammed
with biplanes, spaceship parts, surface-to-air missiles, kamikaze
planes and gliders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air and Space Museum is hoping to move some of them to a
new display place soon. The museum expects to complete design work
next month on a giant new exhibition hall at Washington Dulles
International Airport, with room for objects that would never fit
anywhere else, including the prototype space shuttle and an early
model Boeing 707.
</P>
<P>
   The National Air and Space Museum is the most popular tourist
attraction in Washington, drawing more than 9 million people last
year, but it displays only about 30 percent of its aviation
collection. Officials predict that the annex, several times the
size of the original, located off the end of runway 1-R at Dulles,
will attract 2.5 million to 3 million people in the first year
after its scheduled opening in 2003. It will show off not only the
objects, but also the restoration process. When restored, the
aircraft look good as new, but they are not actually flyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all restored to the condition they were in at the
last time they flew,'' said the director of the Air and Space
Museum, Donald Engen, a retired admiral and a former administrator
of the Federal Aviation Administration. ``We arrest the corrosion,
and put old hydraulic lines back into them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Smithsonian's approach, he said, ``a hundred years from
now, people can come back and see the technology of the time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Engen, who was a dive-bomber pilot based on the aircraft carrier
Lexington in World War II, said the SA-2 missile is the kind that
killed his son-in-law, a pilot in the Vietnam War. He wants it
preserved along with the 200 other aircraft here, which would be
taken to the new Dulles museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Dulles museum is also expected to have a large-screen Imax
theater and a restaurant. The Virginia state government has
contributed $39 million for access roads and other infrastructure,
and Congress voted $8 million for design work. The museum still
needs $130 million, of which it hopes to get 20 percent from
corporate donors. Then it will start looking for individual
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Garber center, named for the museum's first curator, is open
for tours every day, but reservations must be made two weeks in
advance. The new museum would make the collection more accessible,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Engen is especially proud of another aircraft being
reconditioned here, the last surviving Aichi Seiran, a plane built
by the Japanese to fit, folded up, inside a submarine. Taking off
from floats, it was supposed to bomb the Panama Canal. A Japanese
company that makes aircraft model kits, Tamaiya, contributed
$150,000 to help recondition the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also aviation curiosities, including jet engines that
never quite worked out, gyrocopters that were supposed to
revolutionize travel, an ``air scooter'' meant to hover over the
ground, a 3-foot-wide model of the ``mother ship'' flying saucer
used to make the movie ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' and
the ``Airphibian,'' a plane with a steering wheel and removable
wings, meant to be driveable on a highway.

   SAME SONG, SECOND VERSE: A RE-ELECTION BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Parris Glendening's bid for a second term as
Maryland's governor has been an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, a liberal Democrat in one of the country's most
Democratic states, won his first term in 1994 by only 5,993 votes
and has battled mightily ever since to enlarge his constituency.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the final month of the current campaign, he remains
in serious political trouble, with several polls showing him locked
in a dead heat with his Republican opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, the
conservative former state representative he barely managed to best
the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   For all their dominance of Maryland politics, Democrats still
seem unsure about just how much they love their governor, in part
because many in the state's heavily black metropolitan areas,
notably Baltimore and Prince George's County on Washington's
outskirts, think he has given them short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two most powerful black politicians, Mayor Kurt
Schmoke of Baltimore and Wayne Curry, the chief executive of Prince
George's County, did all they could in the summer's Democratic
primary to deny the governor renomination, with both backing his
main rival, Eileen Rehrmann, chief executive of Harford County.
Neither sided with him once he won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has tried repeatedly throughout the fall to win
over Schmoke and Curry, whose populous jurisdictions have become
crucial factors in statewide races in recent years. But until last
week, he had made no progress.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, under pressure from the national Democratic
Party and the White House, Schmoke and Curry called a news
conference and announced their support for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do all we can to encourage a big turnout,''
Schmoke said. Had the governor, in return, promised to pay more
attention to Baltimore and Prince George's, should he win
re-election?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing a whole bunch of votes and it's important that
our constituents be heard,'' Curry replied.
</P>
<P>
   Political doubters noted that Glendening was not at the news
conference, even though he later said he was ``very, very
pleased.'' Schmoke said there was not enough time to invite him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the doubters was Ms. Sauerbrey, who with the help of
national Republicans has recently mounted a major campaign of
attack advertisements against the governor and has also moderated
her conservatism a bit in an effort to woo even more of his
supporters. What did she think of the Schmoke-Curry announcement?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit-and-run endorsement,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   A THRILLER, OF SORTS, IN FLORIDA POLITICS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Down in Florida, they refer to it as Dead Man Running.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not one of those stories about a candidate who
managed to get on the ballot, only to die just before Election Day,
too late for his name to be erased and a substitute chosen. This is
about an imposter _ or so claims Diane Ellis of Palm Harbor, just
north of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis, a Democrat who works as a legal assistant, is running
for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives, struggling
every step for name recognition and financing. Her Republican
opponent is Gus Bilirakis, a well-known Palm Harbor lawyer and the
well-financed and well-connected son of the area's veteran
congressman, Rep. Michael Bilirakis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis says Gus Bilirakis is dead, gone the better part of
three years. The man politically masquerading in his place, she
insists, is one Danny Divito, though she does not make clear
whether she believes he is the Danny DeVito of film fame, who knows
a bit about stand-in work, or whether it is some other Danny Divito
or DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   How? Why?
</P>
<P>
   In a note sent to Citizens for Fair Campaign Practices, a local
group that monitors elections, Ms. Ellis offered this cryptic
explanation: ``My Republican candidate Gus Bilirakis is a fake. His
name is Danny Divito/New York from Washington D.C. 40 years of age
_ Greek. Congressman Michael Bilirakis is paying him to replace his
son who is DEAD 1995 _ Sept. 23. He wants to win the seat!''
</P>
<P>
   Her information, she said, came from a private investigator. But
she declined to identify him, leading the Campaign Practices group
to label her assertion ``weird.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gus Bilirakis _ the Gus spotted by local Floridians on
the street every day, always standing taller than the Hollywood
star, Danny DeVito _ he reports he is alive and well and chuckling.
But he says he also feels sad for Ms. Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Ms. Ellis' fellow Democrats, especially the local party
chairwoman, Nancy Whitman. Saying that Ms. Ellis ``is not going to
win any intelligence contests,'' she demanded the other day that
Ms. Ellis apologize to Bilirakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Ms. Ellis said _ only to add that she still
believed her opponent was one Danny Divito.
</P>
<P>
   NAME RECOGNITION OF WRONG KIND
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Fay Boozman, the Republican candidate in this fall's
U.S. Senate race in Arkansas, is a hard-right conservative who
opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the life
of the mother is threatened. But insofar as rape is concerned, he
told a Kiwanis Club a couple of weeks ago, abortion is mostly a
moot issue anyway.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning: Pregnancy rarely occurs after rape because the
stress of the assault triggers a biochemical reaction in the victim
that makes conception unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who also is an ophthalmologist, said he knew this
to be the case from anecdotal information he had picked up over the
years and from his own medical residency in the 1970s at the
University of Arkansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fall, Sen. Boozman has been struggling to catch
up with his Democratic opponent, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a former
congresswoman. She leads him in the polls by close to 15 points, in
part, political analysts say, because she has much better name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Or did have better name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a columnist for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette wrote
about Sen. Boozman's talk to the Kiwanis, which had been little
noted until then. And now the senator has major name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates called a news conference and accused
him of being ``insensitive to rape victims,'' thousands of whom
become pregnant every year, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lincoln, a moderate who supports abortion rights and whose
husband is an obstetrician, said that the senator, as a physician,
should ``know better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``inexcusable,'' she asserted, that he did not understand
that rape resulting in pregnancy is ``a woman's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the senator apologized, acknowledging he had
``offended many'' with his ``lack of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now asking the people of Arkansas, and especially the
women and young ladies of Arkansas, to forgive me,'' Dr. Boozman
said. ``I am truly sorry for any hurt that I have caused.''

NATO NEARS FINAL ORDER TO APPROVE KOSOVO STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ NATO is ready to approve an ``activation order'' on
Monday, opening the way for its military commanders to order air
strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo and perhaps in the
Serbian heartland itself, senior Western officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Once the order is approved, almost certainly at a meeting of
NATO ambassadors in Brussels on Monday, American officials believe
the pressure on Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, to
agree to withdraw his forces from Kosovo may reach a decisive
level.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, said one senior NATO diplomat, ``the safety catch
will be removed, the gun will be pointed, and we hope this will
trigger a switch in Slobodan Milosevic's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   With the experience of the negotiations to end the Bosnian war
behind them, American officials _ including the special envoy to
the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke _ have long been convinced that
Milosevic would only compromise under the imminent threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO preparation and planning is now moving forward with a
very strong momentum,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in
Europe, said Saturday. ``If necessary, NATO air power will
systematically take apart Milosevic's air defense structure and
expose his military and police machinery of repression in Kosovo to
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears that at least a few days would be needed
between Monday's activation order and any air strikes. Although
NATO's operational plans are ready, aircraft still have to be put
into position.
</P>
<P>
   This would clearly be the period in which Holbrooke, who worked
closely with Clark on the peace accord that ended the Bosnian war
in 1995, would have maximum leverage with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana, said
Saturday that ambassadors from the 16-nation alliance had completed
all the work necessary to prepare for the authorization of air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Atlantic Council has today cleared all the decisions
necessary prior to an activation order,'' he said, adding that
there was ``still no compliance on the ground and time is running
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has been told to end all military and police
operations in Kosovo, withdraw his forces in a verifiable way and
open negotiations with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian community, which
accounts for about 90 percent of the population of the province. If
he fails to comply with these and other demands, NATO has said, it
will begin military action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic has been consistent in at least one way throughout
Yugoslavia's slow death: he has maneuvered tirelessly to keep the
violence out of Serbia. As Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia
successively bled, not a shot was fired in Serbia. This suggests
that he may be ready to blink to avert NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But the patience of Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state,
has clearly been tried. Her language about Milosevic this week _
including a reference to ``accumulated barbarity'' in Kosovo _ was
strikingly undiplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is, of course, used to harsh Western criticism. But he
knows that the American coalition backing force is by no means a
resolute one, and no Western government wants to provoke Russia by
attacking, if that can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Both Germany and Italy, which are between governments, have been
particularly concerned that the legal basis may not exist for NATO
airstrikes. But their hesitations have been overcome in the last
two days. Beniamino Andreatta, Italy's acting defense minister,
said Saturday that forces were ready to join their NATO allies ``to
mount the maximum pressure so that law is restored in Kosovo.''

CLINTON URGES MORE MONEY FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., N.Y. Nev., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton challenged Congress Saturday to
provide money in the budget being hammered out on Capitol Hill for
billions of dollars' worth of new education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to see this Congress walk away from America's
schoolchildren,'' the president said in his weekly radio address.
``We must use this moment of good fortune to make an historic
investment in the quality of our public schools, and we've still
got a few days to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed a second stopgap spending bill on Friday night to
keep the government running through midnight Monday. Republicans in
Congress and White House officials were meeting over the weekend to
negotiate a new budget to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insisted they had no intention of shutting down the
government and interfering with functions like the issuing of
Social Security checks and keeping the national parks open. But, as
Clinton said Saturday, ``I can't keep granting extensions
indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of issues were on the table, ranging from how to conduct
the census in 2000 to various education programs to several
ideologically polarizing questions over contraception _ for minors,
for federal employees and for overseas family planning
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest items _ how much money to give to the
International Monetary Fund _ appeared close to being resolved.
Republicans said they would provide the president's full request of
$18 billion only on certain conditions, including having the agency
stop lending money at below-market interest rates and having it
operate more openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who
is chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the
Appropriations Committee. ``We're in a position to reach some type
of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also sounded optimistic. ``I think it's too
early to tell, but I think there are more hopeful signs than there
have been in quite some time,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's
national economic adviser. He added that ``the entire world is
waiting on this United States Congress'' to provide the money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the likelihood was strong that the IMF matter would be
rolled into one gigantic spending bill that Congress would present
to the president on a take-it-or-leave-it basis early next week.
Only with the president's signature would lawmakers be free to go
home to campaign for re-election, although many left Washington
temporarily this weekend while their leaders sat behind closed
doors hammering out the final package.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides seemed fairly confident of a settlement by early next
week. Clinton plans to be in New York on Monday raising money for
Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic Senate candidate, and Peter
Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, who is running for
governor. On Tuesday, he plans to visit Florida for more
fund-raising and to join in an event with retirees to highlight his
contention that he has saved the budget surplus to shore up Social
Security for aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is one of the flash points with Congress.
Republicans argue that Clinton is actually raiding the surplus to
pay for billions of dollars in education and child-care programs
that he had expected to pay for with money from a settlement with
the tobacco companies, which never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   They also say he wants to take billions from the surplus to pay
for ``emergencies'' that are not true emergencies, like the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the year 2000 computer
bug, both of which were foreseen. They agree that some of the
emergency money the president seeks _ to improve security at U.S.
embassies around the world and to help Americans who were hit by
natural disasters _ are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations stalled late last week, in part over the emergency
spending. Republicans said the president had not identified other
cuts to pay for his additional programs. The White House says the
Republicans want to break into the surplus for a tax cut. The
proposed tax cuts have dwindled over time from a high of $80
billion over five years to a current proposal of about $9 billion,
mostly in extending tax credits that were due to expire.

</P>
<P>
   After the House voted on Thursday to open an impeachment inquiry
into the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Clinton was
eager to show that he was tending to the people's business _ and
eager to remind them why they voted for him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As he has since his election in 1992, Clinton cast himself as
the guardian of education and promoted his education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   It includes money to make sure all children can read by the
second or third grade, to help colleges provide mentors to students
beginning in the sixth grade to guide them toward college and to
repair old schools and modernize them for new technology. Clinton
also wants to hire 100,000 teachers in schools across the country,
particularly in difficult-to-recruit settings like inner cities and
rural areas, to reduce the size of the average class to 18 students
in the first grade. The total package would cost about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also concerned about some education issues
that have little to do with money. These include a Republican ban
on the president's proposal for national testing of fourth-grade
students in reading and eighth-grade students in math, and a
Republican plan to dissolve bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said: ``These are the education issues that the
American people support _ why they elected the president twice _
and what we need to have in this budget before the president can
feel strong enough about it to complete the budget and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of Congress have cleared only six of the 13 spending
bills needed to keep the government running.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate demonstrated just how contentious some of these
issues were and how fluid the situation was when one Democrat, Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, managed on Friday to sidetrack the bill that
finances the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The contention involves a proposal, supported by Reid, to
require the federal government to provide contraceptive coverage
for the 1.2 million women of childbearing age who are federal
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses had passed the measure and Republican leaders had
agreed to include it as part of the Treasury-Postal bill. But in an
effort to placate conservatives and pass the overall bill,
Republican leaders dropped the contraceptive measure at the last
minute. An infuriated Reid then vowed to kill the bill. First, he
stalled it by ordering a clerk to read out loud every word of the
bill on the Senate floor, a highly unusual procedure that paralyzed
the Senate for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's maneuver prompted Republican leaders to pull the bill
from consideration. Now they plan to toss it into the omnibus
package, without the contraceptive measure. But Democrats are
pressing the White House to insist on restoring the measure before
the president agrees to the total package.

 &HT;    Kosovo refugees find shelter in wealthy Kosovar's `goodwill'
 &HT;    WITH ALBANIA-REFUGEES
 &HT;    With PHOTO
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of locator map, Durres is on Albania's
Adriatic Coast, directly west of Tirana.
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ After living 30 years in Germany and
Switzerland, Rame Sylmetaj last year decided it was time to invest
_ and certainly to turn a profit _ in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, it was possible in Kosovo, Sylmetaj's home
region, for a young man to venture into the world to seek his
fortune. This would have been impossible in Albania, which did not
allow its citizens to hold passports until 1990. But as part of
Yugoslavia, Kosovars enjoyed far more freedoms than their brothers
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A careful and lucky investor, Sylmetaj, now 49, did well, but
for some time had wanted to return among the Albanian people.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, he bought some land near the road between Durres,
Albania's primary port city, and Tirana, the capital, and began
building a small apartment building. His family remained in
Switzerland. He had hoped to have the apartments up and rented
within a few months and move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed.
</P>
<P>
   In February tensions in Kosovo between ethnic Albanian
separatists and the Serb-dominated government flared into warfare.
Sylmetaj read that thousands of Kosovars were being made refugees
by the fighting. He heard there were refugees in need of housing. A
man with housing, albeit unfinished housing, Sylmetaj organized a
small convoy of vans and headed to the mountain town of Tropoje
where he had heard there were refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 60 refugees and brought them here,'' he said last week
as he gave a foreign visitor a brief tour. He said Kosovar
Liberation Army leaders gave him some money to provide for food and
other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to borrow $8,000 to get these doors and windows
installed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, more refugees began showing up, so now Sylmetaj has 108 --
including 47 children -- in his care.
</P>
<P>
   The building is far from complete, and by U.S. standards hardly
inhabitable. The top floor is far from completion, so the refugees
inhabit 23 of the 24 bedrooms that are complete enough for people
to live in. He lives in the 24th room.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the walls are bare cinderblock, and there are no doors
between the small rooms.
</P>
<P>
   There are no kitchens, just electric stoves powered by rigged
wires connecting to poles outside. The women cook on the stoves and
boil their laundry clean. There are no lights in the rooms, and the
refugees sleep on thin cotton mattresses on the floor, which is
covered by cardboard and horsehair blankets.
</P>
<P>
   The new wood-framed doors and windows, which seem luxurious in
their rough settings, have been kept open over the hot, humid
summer, and flies swarm in clouds where there is food or water.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a garden hose provides the drinking water. The children
play on a muddy patch in front of the apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   For five months, they have lived there in a safe if somewhat
squalid sanctuary. Sylmetaj is paid no rent and is provided only
food and medical assistance by relief agencies, said Ilir Gjoni, an
official with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless him, he has kept us alive,'' said Sahit Tola, who is
living in one of the apartments with his wife and two small
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmetaj, who talks mostly about the practical needs of his
guests, has little to say about what moved him to help these
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a part of goodwill,'' he said. ``That's all.''

TRAVEL BAN BURDENS STUDENTS FROM GAZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA STRIP _ As his classmates filed into lecture halls last
month to start the fall semester at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank, Jamal Safi found himself stranded at home in a bleak refugee
camp in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Safi, 26, a mechanical engineering student from the Bureij camp,
south of Gaza City, was refused entry to the West Bank by the
Israeli authorities when he tried to cross from Jordan after a
summer course in Egypt. So instead of starting his fifth and final
year at Bir Zeit, he was chafing at his enforced idleness, one of
hundreds of students from the Gaza Strip who have been denied
permits to study in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel useless,'' Safi said as he whiled away another day in
Gaza, waiting for a response to another travel-permit application.
``I have nothing to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time Safi was stopped trying to cross into
the West Bank from Jordan, but he had been barred from leaving the
Gaza Strip for various periods in recent years, along with the
other students from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Israel justifies the restriction on Gaza students traveling to
the West Bank, now in its third year, on security grounds, saying
students from the Gaza Strip include political militants who might
be prone to anti-Israeli violence. But the ban has disrupted the
education of thousands of students and contributed to the growing
isolation of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from those in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That separation began with a travel ban imposed during the 1991
gulf war and deepened in 1993 after a series of deadly Palestinian
attacks on Israelis. The Israeli authorities barred free passage of
Palestinians to Israel and between the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
instituting a restrictive permit system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, periodic Israeli closings of the Gaza Strip and West
Bank _ including one in force for the past three weeks _ have been
put in effect after suicide bombings in Israel and other violence;
the closings have prevented even permit holders from leaving the
two areas. Gaza is surrounded by a security fence, and the only
exit for tens of thousands of laborers who normally commute to jobs
in Israel is an elaborate Israeli checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians on opening
``safe passage'' routes through Israel between the Gaza Strip and
West Bank have bogged down during a 19-month stalemate in peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Students from the Gaza Strip, who at first could get permits,
albeit with difficulty, were evicted from the West Bank and banned
from traveling there after the militant Islamic group Hamas carried
out a series of suicide bombings in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen Gaza students were allowed into the West Bank with
permits early this year in what was supposed to have been a first
step in loosening the ban. But no further permits have been issued,
leaving hundreds of students who have sneaked in over the years
studying illegally in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some have used false identification papers and other deceptions
to leave the Gaza Strip, staying in the West Bank during vacations
to avoid being stranded at home.
</P>
<P>
   Others have traveled to Egypt and then to Jordan and on to the
West Bank, or have flown to Israel from Turkey, making a circuitous
journey to reach campuses that are only a two- or three-hour drive
from their homes. In recent weeks, however, the Israeli authorities
have turned back Gaza students trying to cross into the West Bank
from Jordan, and controls have also been tightened at Ben Gurion
airport in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian academic officials call the Israeli policy a
``criminalization of education'' that has forced students to study
on the sly, under constant threat of eviction and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Safa Abdel Rahman, 22, a Bir Zeit senior from the Gaza Strip,
first arrived in the West Bank four years ago. She has not returned
home for two years to avoid getting stuck in the Gaza Strip, and on
her daily ride to classes she sometimes has to bluff her way past
Israeli checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel this peace,'' she said of the Israeli-Palestinian
accord signed five years ago. ``It was supposed to make life
easier, but it has made it more difficult for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Ziyadeh, 23, an economics major from the Bureij camp, has
also not been home in two years; he commutes warily to the Bir Zeit
campus from his nearby apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Ziyadeh's view, the ban on travel from Gaza to the West Bank
is part of an Israeli policy to divide the Palestinians and prevent
the establishment of a strong, cohesive Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make it difficult for the Palestinian
Authority,'' he said, ``when it declares our state, to mix people
and create one society with common traditions, where people will
support each other.''

ISRAEL ADVERTISES FOR CLUES TO LOST SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Seeking to solve a mysterious maritime
tragedy, Israel has appealed to the public in Turkey and elsewhere
to help it find the wreck of a submarine that disappeared 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine crew members were lost with the sub. Today they
constitute by far the largest group of Israeli military personnel
listed as missing in action. Despite many naval searches and quiet
inquiries in various countries, Israel still has no clue about how
they met their fate.
</P>
<P>
   A large advertisement signed by the Israeli military and the
Defense Ministry appeared in a leading Turkish newspaper in
September. It offered a reward of $5,000 to $300,000 for anyone who
``provides valuable information about the reason for the
submarine's disappearance'' or who ``produces any piece of the
submarine or items from it found on the coast or the open sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement was also published in Egypt, France, Greece
and Russia. The first three have Mediterranean coasts, and Russia
was apparently added because there is hope that a retired military
officer somewhere there might have information.
</P>
<P>
   Phones have begun ringing at Israeli missions in Istanbul and
Ankara. One caller said he had found a puzzling electronic device
on a Mediterranean beach and invited an agent to examine it.
Another said he had psychic powers and could locate the sub if he
saw a photo of it.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli diplomats say other Israeli missions abroad have also
begun receiving responses to the advertisements, as has the Defense
Ministry in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The missing sub, the Dakar, was bought from Britain and set out
from Portsmouth for Haifa, its new home port, on Jan. 8, 1968. On
Jan. 24, as it was believed to be passing south of Crete, it lost
radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   A series of naval searches turned up no trace of the vessel.
Thirteen months later, one of its emergency buoys washed ashore in
Egypt, but since then there has been nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Searches off the Egyptian coast, made possible in the 1980s
after relations between Israel and Egypt improved, were
unsuccessful. So was a reported expedition near Rhodes, a Greek
island that lies close to Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Because the submarine was lost only months after Israel fought a
war against Egypt, some have theorized that it might have been
attacked by Egyptians or their Soviet allies. There is no evidence
to support that theory, however, and Israeli experts say they still
believe there could have been a collision, fire, mechanical failure
or other accident.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the time that has passed, Israel has kept the
investigation active. Families of the victims have banded together
in a loose support group, and assemble each year at a memorial that
stands in a Jerusalem military cemetery. Israel is known for taking
extraordinary pains to find missing troops or their remains.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Jerusalem, the Israeli military said
naval investigators had ``invested great effort'' in their searches
and recently finished ``yet another searching season in the
Mediterranean.'' It said a U.S. naval crew had helped in this
year's effort.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to offer a reward, according to the statement, was
made ``in coordination with the families of the missing'' and was
part of Israel's determination ``not to leave a stone unturned in
its pursuit of solving the mystery of the disappearance of the
Dakar.''

ROSS ACCUSES LETHARGIC LIONS (1-4) OF PLAYING ONLY FOR THEIR
PAYCHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions have Barry Sanders, a future Hall of Famer.
They have Herman Moore, one of the top three receivers in football.
They have all that talent, and just one victory, and coach Bobby
Ross has had enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a team meeting after the embarrassing loss to the Chicago
Bears last week, a heated Ross blasted his team, calling them
unmotivated and unfocused, and he promised harder practices.
Publicly, Ross was just as angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear about long practices,'' Ross said last
Monday. ``I shortened them last week and took them out of pads.
That may be the last time, too. I'll tell you that. If they don't
like it, they can lump it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago, which was 0-4 coming into the game, the Lions
had a fourth-quarter collapse and lost, 31-27. The loss seems to
have shaken up the Lions and Ross, who blamed almost everyone,
including his staff, for the poor game Detroit played. When Ross
spoke of his 1-4 team, he seemed exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like: `We want our checks and that's good enough
for us. Winning isn't that important as long as we get our
paycheck,''' Ross said. ``And that's exactly the way we finished
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   A head coach accusing his team of just playing for a paycheck?
It was a bold statement, one that Ross obviously made to fire up
his team. Some players, though, did not take too kindly to what
Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his opinion,'' said defensive end Robert Porcher.
``Everybody has one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some Lions players are scared of losing their jobs. They
think Ross may make massive changes in the coming weeks if the team
does not play better. Moore has even privately expressed a concern
the team may trade him, which is highly unlikely. But when the
coach starts saying that heads will roll, even star players begin
checking their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' anger is understandable. He is accustomed to success: he
has not had a losing record in six pro seasons, he took San Diego
to a Super Bowl, and he took the Lions into the playoffs last year
in his first season in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have been chronic underachievers throughout the
1990's, and maybe it will take a blowup like the one Ross had to
shake the team out of its seemingly decadelong malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross may have to endure several more weeks of misery.
Detroit plays Green Bay on Thursday night, and then Minnesota, now
5-0, on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Lions have been playing, winning either of those
games would take a small miracle. But Ross is convinced he can turn
the Lions' season around, and he made it clear it could be a
painful process for Lions players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got tunnel vision on how it's going to be done,'' Ross
said. ``And it's going to be done the right way. We're not going to
back off from it for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're either going to have to conform and learn to do it, or
somewhere down the road something's going to happen.''

   Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins' career took a
stunning turn this week when he showed up in the office of coach
Dom Capers, said he no longer wanted to start for the Panthers and
asked for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   What Collins did _ basically quitting on the team _ shocked the
organization to its core. Collins has sealed his fate in Carolina,
and next season he will either be with another team or out of
football.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Panthers deactivated Collins for Sunday's game in
Dallas, but said he would rejoin the team next week. ``I felt it
would be better for our football team to not have the distraction
of having Kerry with us on the sideline after what transpired,''
Capers said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who has not spoken with reporters since his meeting
with Capers, was blasted by some of his teammates after they heard
of his requests.
</P>
<P>
   One player, who asked not to be identified, said he never wanted
to play with Collins again. Another was angry but more
understanding. ``He has quit on us,'' said offensive lineman Frank
Garcia. ``But that's the best decision for him, and I'm going to
support him in that decision and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is why? Inside the Panthers' organization,
there is silence when scouts and personnel men are asked about
Collins. They only say that there is more to the story, but they
will not elaborate. The only comments have come from Capers, who
said: ``His heart wasn't totally into what he was doing. He said he
felt like he disappointed the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers are attempting to trade Collins before Tuesday's 4
p.m. trading deadline, but because of his history of problems on
the field and off, they will not get much. On the field, Collins
led the league last year with 21 interceptions and this year
already had 6. He has completed just 47 percent of his passes, and
ranks 22nd in the league in passing with a quarterback rating of
70.8. The Panthers, who just two seasons ago were in the National
Football Conference Championship game, are 0-4. Off the field,
Collins created problems for himself last season by using a racial
slur about a black teammate.
</P>
<P>
   When the Panthers contacted almost a dozen teams this week about
trading Collins, they were rejected each time.  &QL;

NFL NOTEBOOK: SPECIAL TEAMS; SACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special Teams Improve
</P>
<P>
   There were 29 punts or kickoffs returned for touchdowns last
season in the National Football League. This year, there have
already been 15. Why the increase? One factor, special-teams
coaches and players say, is that teams are putting more starters on
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the days of trying to gain a respectable 15 yards are
over. Players want to break one every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't catch a punt trying to get 10 yards,'' said Deion
Sanders, the great return man for the Dallas Cowboys. ``I catch a
punt trying to score every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks Tougher Than Hits
</P>
<P>
   Which is tougher, hitting a home run or getting a quarterback
sack? To Minnesota Vikings defensive-line coach Andre Patterson,
there is no question that getting to a quarterback is the most
difficult single thing to do in sports. He uses Vikings pass rusher
John Randle, who had a league-leading 15{ sacks last year, to make
his point.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire had 70 home runs in 509 at-bats this season, or one
homer for every 7.27 attempts. Last season, Randle was in on almost
all of the 586 passing attempts made by Minnesota opponents. That
means Randle had a sack about once every 38 attempts.

<P>
   TUXEDO PARK, N.Y. _ One of the English Children, Peggy Robinson
Gibson, stood Friday in the backyard that once was as familiar to
her as any place on earth and gazed at the placid vista of Tuxedo
Lake and the wooded hills turning color above it.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, she said after lunch, that a lot of the vivid red
sumac beyond the stone retaining wall had been trimmed back.
Otherwise, things were pretty much as they had been on the day she
first saw it: Oct. 5, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the Battle of Britain was in its third month. German
bombers had extended their raids to the Midlands, targeting
industrial centers like Birmingham, Coventry and Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tuxedo Park, the pastoral 2,200-acre retreat that tobacco
heir Pierre Lorillard had built for himself and his successful
friends, Mrs. Gibson and 17 other British children found respite
from the terror their parents feared would breach the English
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   They became known as the English Children, an affectionate
sobriquet they retain in Tuxedo Park to this day, though all are
well into their 60s. Most were between 7 and 10 when they came to
live in the baronial stucco house with 19 bedrooms that had been
named Children's House and donated for their use. Village residents
contributed money for their food, clothing and medical care and to
pay for the housekeepers and cooks who served them. They attended
the small, private Tuxedo Park School (40 pupils then, 183 through
the ninth grade today), which is housed within the gated community
in Orange County. They experienced baseball, went to the circus at
New York City's Madison Square Garden and, for air defense
purposes, learned to identify silhouettes of German fighter planes,
a useless task as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1944, when most of them learned they would be boarding
the Cunarder Mauretania for the homeward crossing to Liverpool,
some of them wept at the prospect of departure. Fifty-eight years
later, on this weekend, seven had returned for their first, and
probably only, alumni reunion.
</P>
<P>
   If there are soul-deep scars from being sent away by their
families to cross the submarine-infested North Atlantic on their
own, they do not show. In Tuxedo Park, they say, life was safe and
good and, perhaps most important, normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just strolling over here,'' said one of the children, Tony
Robinson, 65, of Worcester, as he ambled past a garden where he
said he had once planted larkspur. He was making his way toward a
large rock outcropping in the backyard of Children's House.
</P>
<P>
   He reached the outcropping, where two other alumni were already
perched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called Big Rock,'' Robinson said, ``because that's what
it looks like when you're 7 years old. I proposed to Fiona on it in
1942.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiona is Fiona Ross Buchanan, who is 67 and lives in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned him down,'' she said. ``Not mature enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The gentle ribbing and reminiscing carried through a round of
receptions and visits that began with lunch in the same dining room
where they had taken most of their meals as war refugees. More than
30 people fit comfortably at three tables, just steps from the
pantry where Maggie Ross Redfern, Fiona's sister, said she had
suffered punishment tours folding napkins and making oleomargarine.
</P>
<P>
   But memories are selective and six decades have taken their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us at lunch, right here,'' Mrs. Redfern said,
recalling how she was told that she would be sent home. Her sister
said she had no recollection of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   What both of them recall, however, is the sense of youthful
anticipation at the unexpected opportunity to visit the United
States, a notion inculcated by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said to us, `This is going to be a great
adventure,''' Mrs. Buchanan said. ``You know, the States, an ocean
crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her sister, ages 8 and 7, were both well aware of the
war _ ``Hitler, the monster _ collecting newspapers, the
bombings.'' But their comfortable lives at Rickerby Cottage, their
Cumberland country home near the Scottish border, seemed remote
from the devastation in London and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't at all worked up,'' Mrs. Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in Worcester, Robinson was hearing the news
that he, too, would be heading to the United States. They were part
of an effort, largely arranged by a two-country organization, the
Children's Overseas Reception Board, under which about 5,000
British children were evacuated to the United States early in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The connection to Tuxedo Park came through one of its residents,
Alexander Tomes, whose sister was married to a son of former
British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Lead by Tomes, a group of
Park residents arranged for the children's passage and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson came from a family of eight. The two eldest children,
both boys, would stay in Britain, anticipating conscription if the
war continued. The two youngest were 5 and 8 months, too young to
travel. The four middle children, Tony, Phillip, Fay and Peggy,
would be sent overseas together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember being frightened,'' said Robinson, a
Cambridge graduate and professor whose speciality is teaching the
teaching of reading.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 children had gathered in Glasgow in mid-September and
spent 10 days stranded in port aboard the Empress of Australia
after just missing a westbound British naval convoy. There is
disagreement about why they were stranded. Either their ship was
being outfitted with mine detectors, or a mine net was being
installed in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What happened next made the Empress of Australia the last vessel
carrying British children to cross the wartime Atlantic for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The departed convoy had left with another passenger ship, the
City of Benares, and several days out, the passenger ship was
torpedoed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children had been told they must sleep in their warm
clothes,'' Mrs. Buchanan said. ``After a certain point, it was
considered safe and they were allowed to wear pajamas.'' It was on
that night that the ship was hit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Buchanan and Robinson, the children and others
on board scrambled safely to lifeboats. But in hostile waters, the
naval convoy had strict orders to steam on. Abandoned, the
passengers, including 77 children, died of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those on the Empress of Australia would not learn of the
sinking until the war's end. Their ship made it safely to Halifax,
Nova Scotia, where they boarded a train to Montreal and then
another to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal. There, they were met
by their hosts from Tuxedo Park and received the first hugs they
had had in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult situation,'' Robinson said, describing
the potentially awkward role the American caretakers would have to
fulfill. ``They didn't want to take the place of our parents, and
it wasn't a boarding school. They made sure we maintained a
relationship with our parents. We wrote to them, we talked about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan recalled being taken to the British Broadcasting
Corp. studio in Rockefeller Center to hear recordings of broadcasts
that British parents were allowed to make for their children in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the reunion, which included several American
classmates of the English Children, emerged gradually from
trans-Atlantic correspondence that began earlier this year with a
letter from Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted ``to get in touch with the school and wondering if it
was still here,'' said Vera Brigham, 89, the school historian, who
has lived in the Park since 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, received in January, was turned over to the school's
headmaster, James Burger, who asked Mrs. Brigham to reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled out all the stops,'' she said. By this she meant that
she and Robinson began lining up alumni on both sides of the
Atlantic and elsewhere. (Two Robinson siblings, Philip and Peggy,
came from Australia. Fay Robinson Schoelier came from Worcester.
Jill Sieveking English came from Ireland.)
</P>
<P>
   The returnees, as well as some of their American classmates,
appeared at an all-school assembly program Friday morning, donating
a plaque to be awarded annually to a middle school student who best
demonstrates a love of reading.
</P>
<P>
   One young man asked about the safety of the royal family, which
later in the day put Robinson in mind of a popular wartime tune,
``The King Is Still in London.'' He explained that the royal
family, including the two young princesses, remained in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, chatting on a patio at the rear of Children's
House, Robinson was asked again about the song. He grew pensive,
and then shyly broke into a light tenor:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentry stands at the palace gate,
</P>
<P>
   Though he's no longer dressed in red.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes are looking everywhere,
</P>
<P>
   But he never turns his head.
</P>
<P>
   The royal standard waves above for everyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   The King is still in London town,
</P>
<P>
   That's where he wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he rose and walked out into the garden. ``I want to see if
I can find the larkspur,'' he said.
</P>

COMMENTARY: WHEN WINTER NEARS, WESTPORT SIZZLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. _ Darkness comes early these days. Each rainfall
strips more leaves from trees, soon to be bare. But despite omens
of winter, Michelle Genovesi has summer on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Genovesi, real estate agent extraordinaire, has clients who
routinely rent out their houses for the summer season. Three such
rentals are already listed in this Gold Coast suburb, which is not
generally thought a resort, expanding and contracting with the
seasons. If the Wall Street tumble doesn't blunt demand, about 70
houses will soon be listed, to be leased from Memorial Day to Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate agents are a bullish bunch by nature, and Ms.
Genovesi and her colleagues at the William Raveis agency here have
been chirping about a mere market correction, putting a happy face
on a global meltdown. But their optimism could be justified in
terms of summer properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market goes flat, we do well in the summer,'' said
Ms. Genovesi, consistently the top producer at the agency, which
beckons its tasteful clients with oriental rungs, nautical
paintings and bouquets of dried hydrangea. ``Then people are
cutting back on going to Europe and doing other, more costly
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here has the riches of F. Scott Fitzgerald or Paul
Newman, two of Westport's favorite sons. Some are divorced, widowed
or elderly and of limited means. It is these homeowners, for the
most part, who give up summer at the shore for the rental income
that helps pay bills from October to June.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Hakes, for example, rents out her graceful family-size home
on Apple Tree Trail _ ``one of the sweetest, quietest streets at
the beach,'' her listing says _ and moves in with her daughter in
town. At $18,000 for the season, Ms. Genovesi said, Mrs. Hakes will
be able to afford a new roof and a renovated bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The typical summer renter, by contrast, is a young family from
Manhattan, with a couple of kids, a stay-at-home mom and a
commuting dad. A house on the East End of Long Island, or on
Martha's Vineyard, would separate the couple from Monday to Friday.
In Westport, everyone eats dinner together at the end of an easy
Metro-North commute.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest properties are ``just steps'' from Compo Beach, a
long crescent of shoreline on the sound. These same houses are
within walking distance of the Longshore Club Park, with its tennis
courts, sailing school, marina, golf course and pool at the water's
edge. The club is free for Westport taxpayers. Renters pay ``a
pittance,'' Ms. Genovesi said. (Translation: $350 for the season.)
</P>
<P>
   Prices may soften. But last summer's rentals ranged from $2,500
for a week in a two-bedroom, 100-year-old house on Main Street to
$75,000 for the season in a Great Gatsby estate on the sound, with
pool and tennis court. Agents here and in the Hamptons say that
Westport prices are about half the rents on the East End of Long
Island. There are 10,000 homes in town, with a median value of
$700,000; 73 of them rented last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The listings testify to a life style that has made Fairfield
County synonymous with luxury. A home with eight bedrooms and five
baths is considered middle-of-the-pack. Easy access to the beach
can be trumped by clay courts and a heated pool. Charm and
character, exquisite antiques and an exercise room are nice. So is
a landlord who pays for pool and lawn care.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the landlords are frugal Yankee widows. One of Ms.
Genovesi's clients rents out while vacationing in Spain. Another
has several residences. (She can't recall how many.) A third spends
the summer volunteering his expertise in developing nations as a
retired CEO in developing nations. Then there is a fellow real
estate agent, a single mother, who moves in with a friend each
summer in order to rent out her home and make her mortgage payments
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the renters eventually buy, among them Pat Maxwell,
another of Ms. Genovesi's associates. Ms. Maxwell, who is divorced,
summered in Sag Harbor until one particularly awful five-hour drive
back to Manhattan on the Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   She had long been devoting far too much time to the weekly
conundrum of whether to leave the beach early and ruin Sunday, or
stay until the traffic quiets at 10 p.m. and crawl through the
workday on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the weekend is spent deciding when you're going to get on
the road,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ``It becomes too much of a
production. This takes half as much time and costs half as much
money.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MADDUX GETS CALL TO END BRAVES' FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ak) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Atlanta Braves weren't quite hanging by their
fingernails from the edge of a cliff. It wasn't exactly what you'd
call being tied to a track with a train snorting down on you. Or
swimming toward shore just ahead of a mouthful of sharp teeth
attached to a gluttonous shark.
</P>
<P>
   But close. For the Braves _ predicted by many to ease into the
World Series _ had traveled to San Diego, decidedly enemy
territory, after shockingly losing the first two games of the
National League Championship Series at home. A loss to the Padres
yesterday afternoon would mean virtual curtains.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves prepared to play the San Diego Padres here at
Qualcomm Stadium, they were aware that no National League team had
come back from a two-games-to-none deficit after dropping the first
two games at home in the 28 previous league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   And thus they called on their ace, Greg Maddux, the way Pauline
called for her hero to intercede in her perils, or the surrounded
pioneers cupped their ears in hopes of hearing the cavalry's bugle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being called on,'' said the Padres' Tony Gwynn, in, yes,
another metaphor, ``to right the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pressure is on. Correct?
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, looking typically like a professor of anthropology in
his spectacles, said, ``It's better than Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that the challenge was a treat, that it wasn't just
another day at the ball yard. ``No way,'' he said. ``Not even
close. The playoffs never get old, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Maddux, the four-time Cy Young award winner and the
major-league ERA leader this season at 2.22, believe that whipping
San Diego will be a simple chore for him, especially since one of
the Padres, the estimable Gwynn, an eight-time National League
batting champion, has clubbed him to the tune of a career average
over .400.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handles the bat as well as anybody probably ever has,''
Maddux said. ``You feel like he's going to put the ball in play.
And so you know he's going to get his hits.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth straight postseason in which Maddux has
pitched, and the fifth over all. In the first round this year,
against the Cubs, he won going seven solid innings. Before they
beat the Houston Astros in the division series, the Padres had not
won a playoff game in 14 years. ``I think it's a much bigger
advantage in the first round of the playoffs,'' Maddux said of
postseason experience, ``because one of the hardest things to
control early is nerves.'' Obviously the Padres have done a good
job of keeping themselves together in the the second round, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's tricky pitches can make big men with 5 o'clock shadows
and menacing bats grow limp. He doesn't stun the observer with
eye-popping physical gifts, but he has become a master of his
craft. Others throw harder on the mound, but few, if any, think
clearer there.
</P>
<P>
   And don't try to outthink him. ``Even if you guess right on a
pitch,'' said the Padres center fielder Steve Finley, who is
hitting in the neighborhood of .200 in his career off Maddux, ``the
odds are that it probably won't be in the strike zone. He'll want
you to go fishing for it. When you're facing Greg Maddux, if you
think and try to hit at the same time you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Maddux is so good, what was he doing pitching in Game 3
of the series yesterday? Why not in Game 1? Well, he was demoted,
as it were. He had such a rough September that his ERA rose from
around 1.50 to 2.22. Which is hardly horrendous. But John Smoltz
and Tom Glavine, who also have Cy Young trophies above their
fireplaces, were pitching better. So Braves Manager Bobby Cox,
playing a kind of shell game with three of the best hurlers in
baseball, moved Maddux to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really wasn't him at the end of the regular season,''
said Merv Rettenmund, the Padres' batting coach. ``He was getting
his pitches up in the strike zone. I don't anticipate seeing that
in the playoffs. Don't expect to see any balls over the heart of
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Gwynn give helpful advice to his batting brothers on how
to hit Maddux? ``No,'' Rettenmund said. ``Tony sees the ball like
no one I've ever seen play. He picks up the ball so well that he
can tell by the way the pitcher is about to release the ball what
kind of pitch it's going to be. He can tell by their fingers in the
air. Tony can't tell other people how to do it. You just gotta know
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And what did Gwynn have to say about Maddux? ``There's no secret
potion,'' he said. ``Every time it's a battle, fighting and
scrapping. I've gotten my hits off him, but they've been mostly
singles. He has such great control that he puts the ball where he
wants to _ mostly just off the strike zone. And the movement on the
ball is as good as anyone I've ever faced. His breaking ball will
run in on you, it'll run away from you. The fastball's got a tail.
If you get too aggressive with him, you get yourself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work with Maddux. Ain't no free vittles out there.''

GIANTS AND FALCONS DO LEAST WITH FIRST-ROUND PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   A first-round pick in the National Football League's annual
college draft is a prized commodity, the cornerstone of a
franchise's talent base. Players chosen in the first round who
become stars for the franchise that selected them highlight the
roster of most NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   But two NFL teams have made little of their first-round choices
this decade, so little that they are the only two teams in the
league to have just one starting player whom they chose in the
first round of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night, they play each other at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants and the Atlanta Falcons are those two teams,
having either picked that poorly in the first round or been that
unlucky with their picks.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, the one probable starter this weekend is wide
receiver Ike Hilliard, taken by the team in the first round in
1997. For Atlanta, it's tackle Bob Whitfield, a first-round
selection in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The league average is nearly four first-rounders _ 3.93 to be
exact. The average among playoff teams from last season is even
higher (4.42).
</P>
<P>
   Three teams _ Minnesota, Buffalo and New Orleans _ have seven
starters taken in the first round. And in Minnesota's case, that
does not even include the Vikings' first-round pick this year, wide
receiver Randy Moss, who is technically not a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has six first-round starters. The Giants have one.
Their 1995 top pick, running back Tyrone Wheatley, has not even
been active for three games. Six other Giants first-round picks in
the 1990s are no longer with the team.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a lesson in the vagaries of the college draft.
The 2-3 Giants and the 3-1 Falcons, it would seem, have been doing
it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   On most teams, the first-round selections have become vital team
leaders. All but seven NFL teams have a first-round choice leading
the team in either passing, rushing or receiving. Hilliard, for
example, is the Giants' receiving leader. Nine NFL teams have
first-round selections who are leading in two or more of those key
statistical categories.
</P>
<P>
   In last season's Pro Bowl, 14 starters in the game were
first-round picks still playing for the team that drafted them.
</P>
<P>
   Where have the Giants gone wrong? It has been a combination of
misfortune and misjudgment. Consider the team's 1989 first-round
pick, center Brian Williams. He was on the verge of a Pro Bowl
berth when he was accidentally poked in the eye last year. Double
vision has prevented him from resuming his football career.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' 1990 pick, running back Rodney Hampton, was
certainly a valuable pick. Hampton, released by the team this
spring, became the franchise's career leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's the Giants' first pick of the 1991 draft:
running back Jarrod Bunch. A complete bust, he played just three
seasons with the Giants and is now out of football. The 1992 pick,
tight end Derek Brown, never blossomed for the Giants either.
Unprotected in the expansion draft, he went to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 top pick, quarterback Dave Brown, was a starter for
parts of four unceremonious seasons before the team gave up on him
last year. Wide receiver Thomas Lewis was the first-round selection
in 1994. He frustrated two coaching staffs with myriad injuries and
inconsistencies in four seasons. When he became a free agent this
past winter, the Giants ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, buried deep on the Giants' depth chart, was taken in
1995. Cedric Jones was the Giants' first-round choice, and the
fifth overall pick, in 1996. Jones is a backup defensive end for
the Giants with one career sack.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Hilliard and now this year's pick, safety Shaun
Williams, who has played in nickel defenses this year but is
currently sidelined because of a hamstring strain.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Accorsi, in his first year as the Giants' general manager,
acknowledged the obvious: that the team hasn't received much
production from its first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that,'' he said. ``There's no rationalizing it in our
offices. Usually you can't overcome that. But we've had success
last year and hopefully again this year because of what's been done
in the other rounds of the draft. That's what has saved us.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his predecessor, George Young, and the Giants'
scouting staff, Accorsi said: ``They did a great job with a bunch
of later-round picks. Charles Way, Michael Strahan, Keith Hamilton,
Jason Sehorn, Jessie Armstead _ those are all guys who are really
first-round picks in terms of talent and what they've done in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   But Accorsi understood that Giants fans might expect more than
one starter out of nine first-round draft picks this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no arguing that,'' Accorsi said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this situation most peculiar is that the Giants have
been built through the draft, even if it hasn't been in the first
round. All but six of the team's starters tonight were Giants draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   But when you watch a Giants offense that is 29th in the league
and dead last in production on third down _ when big plays are made
_ remember the Giants' first-round woes. Explosive talent is what
teams seek in the first round of the college draft.
</P>
<P>
   It's what the Giants, outside of Hilliard and a few other
players, have lacked.

AT CORNELL, OFFENSIVE PLAYS IN PUMPKIN SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ Nobody knows _ or at least no one is saying _ who
pulled the seemingly impossible prank of impaling a pumpkin on a
bell tower at Cornell University last October, creating a
five-month media sensation and an enduring mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But with Halloween now just three weeks away, Cornell officials
want to make sure that he or she or they do not do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that placing a pumpkin atop the 173-foot tower's
steeply pitched metal roof might become an annual prank. And with
the tower surrounded by scaffolding this year, its roof is more
accessible than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And so, several weeks ago, Cornell officials quietly began
planning anti-pumpkin measures. The strategy is almost as much of a
secret as the identity of _ and technique used by _ last year's
prankster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking some precautions because we're concerned about
people's safety,'' said Linda Grace-Kobas, a senior university
spokeswoman. ``But we cannot get into exactly what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grace-Kobas said only that campus police had already wired
``sensitive areas'' in the vicinity of the bell tower with alarms.
She refused to rule out the possibility that the school had other
precautions in store, including a heightened police presence around
the tower and newly installed alarms in and around other tall
campus buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be giving away a little too much information to
anyone making any plans,'' Ms. Grace-Kobas said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after hundreds of onlookers watched Cornell provost
Don Randel remove the pumpkin from its lofty perch in a rescue
attempt, it was placed on display in a glass museum case in the
lobby of the school's main administration building. But the pumpkin
quickly decomposed in its new surroundings, and after three months
on display, school officials decided it was time to put the pumpkin
in storage.

 &HT;    Kosovo refugees finding shelter in Albania a strain on resources
 &HT;    WITH ALBANIA-REFUGE
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    EDS: Optional add begins at 1500 words; for purposes of locator
map, Durres is on Albania's Adriatic Coast, directly west of
Tirana.
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ Many nights, Sahit Tola's 4 1/2-year-old
daughter will awaken in terror and crawl from her mat to seek the
sanctuary of her father's bed.
</P>
<P>
   The crackle of gunfire, an almost nightly phenomenon in this
unsettled country, startles her from slumber. The sounds play a
cruel trick on her sleeping mind, making her think for a brief
horrible moment that she is back home in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after days of thunderous shelling near their small
hamlet of Djakovo, her parents decided the time had come to go. The
couple gathered their daughter, 8-year-old son and what things they
could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving in mid-afternoon, they walked away from their village of
300 and headed west. For two days, the parents subsisted only on
the cold fresh water that flows in the Dinaric Alps, the jagged
mountain range that rises between Kosovo and Albania. The children
also had rations of candy. At night, they huddled together to keep
warm, not lighting any fires for fear they would be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, standing outside the half-built apartment house where
his family has found shelter near the port city of Durres, Tola
looked thin and tired as he retold his family's tortured odyssey.
He still wore the pale green sport shirt and jeans he wore the
afternoon he decided to flee. As he spoke, his daughter clung to
him, her blue saucer-like eyes not blinking as she studied a
visitor. She didn't return smiles; she said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's suffering from some kind of trauma,'' said Tola,
a 38-year-old factory worker. ``I've told my children about the
fighting _ they know who the Serbs are. But what more can I say to
them?''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Kosovo has made refugees of thousands of
families like this one. International monitors estimate that
250,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes during the seven
months of intense fighting between Serb forces and rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian, is the
southernmost province of Serbia, one of the two remaining republics
of Yugoslavia. Kosovo was largely self governing before 1989, when
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic placed the region under
direct Serb rule.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely organized KLA is fighting for independence, while
Serb officials say they are trying to quell a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   While most refugees have found shelter, up to 50,000 remain out
of doors in the rugged mountains of Kosovo. If they remain
unprotected, relief and government officials fear many may die when
the winter arrives in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 refugees have come to Albania, with officials here
preparing for another 20,000 _ in the belief that most of the rest
either will remain in Kosovo, or go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But what if more _ perhaps many more _ decide to turn to their
fellow Albanians for shelter?
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the question, Esma Boksi, an official in the northern
Albania town of Shkodra, takes a deep breath and lets the air
escape slowly through pursed, downturned lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then God help us,'' she says somberly. ``We can do no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June, 4,800 of the refugees have registered with Boksi, a
town hall worker pressed into service as refugee registrar. They
have come in waves of 1,000 or more, the ebbs coinciding with Serb
advances. These days, weeks after officials believe the refugee
flood has subsided, 20 or so a day still trickle into Boksi's
office. They seek identification cards, and information about food
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Boksi sees some irony in the Kosovars' asking for help in a
place like Shkodra. ``This is the poorest place in Albania,'' she
says, noting a 20 percent unemployment rate and the that about a
third of the families here are on government relief. ``Yet, we give
them bread and cheese when they come, all we can give.''
</P>
<P>
   She needs no statistics to support her point.
</P>
<P>
   Outside her small office in a decaying building in central
Shkodra, the street is more pothole than pavement. Craters in the
street and sidewalks are filled with a milkshake thick ooze of
standing water and the gray silt that covers everything.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets away, venders sell fruits and vegetables from
blankets laid down over mud. Nearby, goats, bone-thin wild dogs and
pigs rummage through the garbage and rotting unsold produce. Many
windows have no glass, and few buildings seem to enjoy even basic
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task to distinguish between the living conditions
of host and refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, about 2,500 refugees remain in the Shkodra district, many
in private homes, where the government has paid locals a supplement
of $10 a head to defray the costs of sheltering on average 15
refugees per family.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been placed in modest hotels and makeshift
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 have found shelter in a warehouse adjacent to the
Catholic Church of Lady Rosare. On Wednesday, construction workers
were laboring to convert the warehouse into living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, more than 50 families -- usually two families to a room
-- live in the dormitory that rumbles all day with the sounds of
hammering and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Fatos Stogha and her family of eight live in a room the size of
an American master bedroom. Stogha, 44, stands barefoot at the door
with her tall, lanky 15-year-old son Ruke, a bright-eyed boy who
seems eager for a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The room is dark, poorly ventilated and affords no privacy.
There are two toilets in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Stogha said her family left Decani four months ago. The town,
about 44 miles from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, has seen some of
the war's fiercest fighting. She believes her house was destroyed
in a Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In her room are four steel-framed beds. Along the walls are
cardboard boxes of their possessions. They take their meals in a
makeshift canteen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the conditions seem harsh to an outsider, she says
she has been well cared for and expressed deep gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to go home,'' she says. ``I want to go there as
soon as it is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With winter coming, officials are struggling to cope with the
needs of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be plenty of food thanks to international relief
organizations, but there is some concern about distribution once
winter comes and already difficult roads become impassable.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the single largest concern remains getting and
keeping roofs over the refugees' heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prospect made difficult because of the complex and
unstable political and legal conditions in this impoverished former
communist state. ``For example, they have the money to remodel
public buildings to make the dormitories,'' said Boksi, the Shkodra
official. ``But the town government has sold the public buildings
to private owners. There are very few public buildings left.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the refugees will have to leave, but no one hazards
a guess when that time will come. There are no plans to close the
border, and government officials and humanitarian groups are
planning for an indefinite stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will care for them as long as it is necessary,'' said
Tauland Dedja, the government official assigned to coordinate
refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet international observers worry the presence of the Kosovars
is providing a destabilizing force for an already fragile
government. The country is a tinderbox where government armories
have been looted and most nights feature various levels of gunfire
-- usually just young men enjoying the power of firing a
semi-automatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can take care of the humanitarian needs,'' said
Daan Everts, the ambassador here for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. ``The bigger matter is the political
problem this poses for an already very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian President Rexhep Meidani also worries that the Kosovars
will be destabilizing. ``This is a serious concern,'' he said
through a spokesman. ``Without international support, Albania does
not have a proper infrastructure to support the accommodation of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult with a poor economy, great unemployment,
a lack of security and a high degree of criminality,'' he said.
``The influx of refugees makes an already bad situation even
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some refugees are angered by what they view as the
government's appeasing stance toward Milosevic. The Albanian
government does not support full independence for Kosovo but does
favor more autonomy for the province. ``We want a balance between
the right of the Kosovars to self determination and the right of
Yugoslavia to territorial integrity,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But for refugees eager to lash out at the Serbs, this position
is too conciliatory, and Meidani worries they may be fomenting
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200 refugees were among those arrested during the
September uprisings in Shkodra and the capital Tirana, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Meidani sees no easy and quick solution. ``With all that has
happened, all the killings and atrocities, there is a new memory,''
he said. ``This will take a long time for everyone to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are in near unison in their assessment of what it will
take to make it possible for them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry to see the power of the U.S. military employed to avenge
them, they want NATO forces to strike hard at the Serbs and drive
them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans to deal with the Serbs,'' says Skender
Idrizaj, who is among the 50 or so refugees housed at the Hotel
Rozafa in Shkodra. The 52-year-old construction worker seethes over
the way he says the Serbs treated him and the other men from Decani
who escaped together last July.
</P>
<P>
   Idrizaj, a thin man with an enormous gray mustache, sits on his
haunches between two sofas in the hotel's large, dimly lit lobby
rolling cigarettes with thin white paper and finely chopped tobacco
as he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces intercepted the group of Kosovars with which he and
his family were traveling in September, he said. The Serbs
separated the men from the women. ``They told us they were going to
liquidate the men,'' he said. ``They made us stand up for two days
and made us drink sewage water.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian authorities deny mistreating the Kosovars and say
such stories are exaggerated to help convince the West to take
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this and similar stories were repeated frequently and
consistently last week by Kosovar refugees in different parts of
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Serbs freed them: Idrizaj believes they feared
being caught by Red Cross and other relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the Kosovars remain in Albania?
</P>
<P>
   He closes the metal box of tobacco and stows in in his jacket
pocket. ``We will stay away until the Serbs leave,'' he says,
licking the paper and rolling it closed. ``But if NATO and the
Americans don't act, maybe we will go back anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't live in this hotel the rest of our lives,'' he says,
lighting the twist of tobacco-filled paper and taking a deep drag.
``We'll go back to die there, to die together.''

 &HT;    Mainland China and Taiwan gingerly restart talks
 &HT;    WITH CHINA-BIOBOX
 &HT;    By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Mighty China and fortress Taiwan once again have
tucked away their guns and this week will make another tenuous
sortie into the realm of peacefully settling half a century of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions still are huge between the communist mainland and the
island that broke away after civil war 49 years ago, ultimately to
evolve into a raucous little democracy 100 miles off China's
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The delicately choreographed talks that begin Wednesday are not
even formal negotiations. They will not be conducted by government
officials and so far don't seem to have much of an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But when Koo Chen-fu, head of the Straits Exchange Foundation,
comes over to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the two
octogenarians will have the futures of their people on the table.
These are the highest level talks since the same two men held
break-through discussions in Singapore in 1993, then saw
missile-rattling disrupt the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important in the sense that the Wang-Koo meeting implies
that the two sides `normalize' their relations,'' said Zheng
Yongnian, a fellow at the East Asian Institute in Singapore who
follows cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have stepped gingerly in recent weeks in order to do
exactly that: pave the way for more normal and continuing contacts
after Koo's six-day visit that is scheduled to include an Oct. 18
meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military, for example, canceled exercises set for this
week in order ``to cultivate harmony and positive progress in
cross-strait relations,'' according to news reports from Taiwan.
Taiwan's troops would have employed their most sophisticated
weapons, including American F-16 fighter planes and Knox-class
frigates, the sales of which so raised the ire of Beijing's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chinese side, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan recently
promised Taiwan ``will enjoy greater autonomy than Hong Kong and
Macao'' if it reunites with the mainland. The former British colony
of Hong Kong became part of China in 1997, and Macao is due to end
four centuries as a Portuguese territory when it rejoins China next
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese government spokesman later explained that Taiwan would
maintain its own armed forces and get guaranteed positions in the
mainland government. Hong Kong and Macao were offered neither but
do hold guarantees to keep personal rights and freedoms, as well as
their capitalist economies under the ``one China, two systems''
formula.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of other possible concessions by the
mainland, such as replacing the red communist flag and changing the
country's name to ``China'' from the current People's Republic of
China, which was created when the communists took command 49 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 China-Taiwan talks were likewise promising, but the
dialogue didn't last. Beijing canceled a major follow-up
negotiation in mid-1995 in response to Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui's ``unofficial'' trip to the United States. It was viewed
as promoting Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Relations deteriorated. When China for a second time fired
unarmed missiles near Taiwan in March 1996, the United States sent
an aircraft carrier battle group to the South China Sea to warn
China to sheath its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of fence-mending finally produced this new set of
talks, but the path to resolution is hardly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Today many Taiwanese are edging toward a declaration of full
independence. Potentially, that could provoke an armed response
from the mainland state that the United States recognizes as the
sole legitimate Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   To remind his mainland counterparts that radical sentiment is
gaining strength among the island's 22 million people, negotiator
Koo reportedly has included in his delegation several Taiwanese of
the political faction backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang party, which founded the Taiwan
government when it fled losing battles against the communists in
1949, has been more amenable to some form of reunion that would
preserve Taiwan's autonomy without status as an independent state.
But even in the Kuomintang, voices rarely can be heard accepting
the mainland's formula applied to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Taiwan has not even publicly accepted Beijing's demands
that the talks immediately home in on the tough political questions
of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese leaders keep promoting discussion of less momentous
economic and cultural issues first, to facilitate the already heavy
exchanges of people and capital across the strait. For instance,
Taiwan wants an understanding on how to treat Chinese or Taiwanese
refugees who reach the others' territory.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't much interest the mainland side. President Jiang
has consolidated his hold on power on the mainland and is under
pressure by some communist party elements to flex his strength and
finally bring the island back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to do something regarding the Taiwan issue,'' said
Zheng of the East Asia Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's position was enhanced this summer, when President Bill
Clinton for the first time enunciated what Chinese call the ``three
no's,'' committing America not to recognize ``two Chinas'' or ``one
China, one Taiwan;'' not to support Taiwan seeking independence,
and not to endorse Taiwan's membership in international
organizations whose members must be sovereign states.

 &HT;    Taiwan talks: the men at the table with China-Taiwan
 &HT;    By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ How do governments negotiate when they don't recognize
each other?
</P>
<P>
   Two honored octogenarians, both heads of ``unofficial''
organizations and both long-time confidants of their respective
leaders, are tasked with resuming the talks that may determine
whether China and Taiwan live peacefully or go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their backgrounds:
</P>
<P>
   KOO CHEN-FU
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's lead negotiator is a savvy businessman from a native
family of the island's landed gentry. The Koos struck it very rich
after Chiang Kai-shek's government traded shares of Taiwan Cement
for much of their land in a so-called ``land-to-the-tiller''
program in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The family enterprise grew into a 60-company conglomerate
including China Trust Commercial Bank, Taiwan's largest
privately-owned financial institution, and China Life Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, 82, not only was a founder of the Taiwan Stock Exchange,
but also brought plastic to Taiwan: the credit card. He will not
likely endorse any agreement that might endanger Taiwan's deeply
embedded capitalist _ and more recently democratic _ system.
</P>
<P>
   Educated in law at National Taiwan University, Koo became a
political mover and shaker as president of an influential
industrial association. He has been an adviser to Taiwan's
president for a decade and a member of the Kuomintang's central
standing committee. He presides over Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The industrialist lately returned to an early love: the Chinese
opera he studied in the 1950s. Koo resumed practice and performed
in full face make-up in one of the Beijing Opera productions his
family sponsors in Taiwan twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   WANG DAOHAN
</P>
<P>
   Wang is not so wealthy as his counterpart but is rich in the
experience of cutting through thickets of communist politics and
bureaucracy. A fixture since the communists took over China in
1949, he served first as minister of the East China Industry
Department and then for 13 years as deputy head of the First
Ministry of Machine Building. Later positions mostly related to
foreign finance, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ministry of Machine Building in 1956 he encountered a
younger man whose path he would cross repeatedly. He was Jiang
Zemin, today the president of China, then just returned from
studies in Moscow. One affinity between Wang and Jiang: both sprang
from the engineering school of Shanghai's Jiao Tong University.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed mayor of Shanghai in 1980, Wang brought the city out
of isolation back to its old position as China's center of world
trade and finance. He spearheaded the Pudong project that created
an international industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed in the job in 1985 by Jiang. Although Wang
assumed a lower profile after leaving the mayor's office, he is
said to have been a mentor to Jiang and to have remained a close
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 83, has represented Shanghai at the Chinese People's
Congress and taught at the country's most prestigious universities:
Beijing, Fudan and Jiao Tong. He is president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Like Koo, he is a fan of Chinese opera but also a book-lover who
was known to wander alone through book stores of Shanghai when he
was mayor.

 &HT;    Clinton challenges Congress to increase school funding
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drawing a line in the sand in his budget battle
with an outgoing Congress, President Clinton warned Friday that
lawmakers ''should not go home'' until they increase spending on
classroom initiatives by about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the money is needed to renovate schools, hire thousands
of new teachers and help children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans countered that Clinton was picking a fight
over education, the last smoldering pillar of what one called a
''failed agenda,'' as a smoke screen to deflect public attention
from his troubles over Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The public wrangling took place on a day when Clinton signed a
continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown by funding
federal operations through Monday night, to give White House and
congressional negotiators time to hammer out agreement on dozens of
outstanding spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting from budgeting to politicking, Clinton fired an
election-year broadside at the Republican-led Congress, chastising
legislators for failing to pass White House-backed bills aimed at
campaign finance reform, curbing cigarette sales to youths, raising
the minimum wage and providing low-income Americans with new
health-care guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''But still, it is not too late for us to go forward together on
our children's future,'' Clinton said in a brief statement on the
South Lawn. ''Politics,'' he said, ''should stop at the classroom
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of threatening to veto legislation that
didn't fully fund his education proposals. But his top economic
adviser, Gene Sperling, said earlier, ''We would not sign, or would
veto, a budget that was weak on education. If it does not go a long
way toward meeting the president's priorities, the president will
not sign this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has requested $17.7 billion in spending on education and
training programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The requests include $1 billion for building new classrooms and
another $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers, in an effort to
reduce class size to an average of 18 pupils per classroom for
grades kindergarten through three.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also requested $4.6 billion for Head Start and $7.8
billion for Title I, two programs aimed at improving the
educational prospects for children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the bill passed late Thursday night by the House comes
up $4 billion short of White House funding proposals, said
Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with funding is that the White House had
originally counted on revenues generated by an increase in
cigarette taxes to pay for increasing the number of classrooms and
teachers in public schools. The prospect of receiving those
revenues collapsed earlier this year, however, with the defeat of
comprehensive tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top domestic policy advisor, Bruce Reed, said there
was nevertheless no reason to also kill the prospects for reducing
class sizes, which can top 28 students per class in many elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need smaller classes,'' said Reed. ''We'd like this
Congress to get some work done. They killed the tobacco bill. They
killed campaign finance reform. They killed the patients' bill of
rights. We're not going to let them kill education.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans retorted that Clinton was playing politics with
schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not make one call to any Republican congressional
leader to discuss improving education'' all year long,' said Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's attacks on our agenda are simply the politics
of deflection and avoidance: deflecting attention away from his
failed agenda, and avoiding the subjects of grand juries, perjury,
abuse of power and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they had worked hard to pass an education
budget that addressed many of the priorities Clinton outlined, as
well as others he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans have passed 22 major education initiatives,''
House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling said
in a prepared statement. ''The president's bills didn't pass
because they don't focus on quality and they don't drive dollars
directly to the classroom. Instead, they create top-down federal
education programs run by Washington bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a showdown over education comes against a backdrop
of furiously paced negotiations over a host of budget areas,
ranging from Clinton's proposal for $18 billion in additional
funding for the International Monetary Fund to his request for more
than $1 billion to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 appropriations bills that provide a road map for how
the government will spend $1.7 trillion next year, only four had
been sent to the White House for Clinton's consideration as of late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Clinton has signed into law two, which pay for water
and energy and military construction. He has vetoed one, an
agriculture bill Clinton claimed came up short in funding for
emergency farm aid, and has not yet acted on the other, the giant
defense appropriations bill.

AS GANNETT MERGES NEWSPAPERS, SOME FEAR LOSS OF LOCAL FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER with MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Many residents of Westchester County can
remember when every city and several towns had their own hometown
daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Papers like The Yonkers Herald-Statesman, The Ossining
Citizen-Register and The Tarrytown Daily News religiously covered
school and planning board meetings, where the small-scale issues
may not have resonated widely but were passionately felt
nonetheless. They told residents when the Lions Club was meeting
and whose home had been broken into overnight. When a neighbor
died, no matter whether it was someone who ran banks or cleaned
houses, the local paper bid a tender farewell in an obituary that
offered the highlights of a life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, these daily newspapers fell under the umbrella of
Gannett Co., the nation's largest newspaper chain, which eventually
consolidated many of their operations, from offices to presses to
sections like food, sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for most of the last three decades, the papers have clung
to their names and identities and continued to focus on community
news.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's publication, though, Gannett will merge nine
newspapers in Westchester County, one in Rockland County and an
edition in Putnam County, into a single morning paper: The Journal
News. From now on, the company will offer all readers in its
861-square-mile territory _ from Pelham, just north of the Bronx,
to Patterson, 50 miles farther north _ essentially the same front
page and the same platter of news, feature and service articles.
The region will be divided into four zones, each with its own local
news section.
</P>
<P>
   With the new paper, Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the Gannett
division based in White Plains, will be able to offer advertisers a
single place to reach 153,000 paying readers in 144 communities,
rather than a patchwork of 11 different newspapers. That merging of
readership, along with the Gannett chain's growing presence in New
Jersey, will make Gannett an even more powerful player in the New
York City suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   What worries many readers in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam,
though, is that Gannett may lose some of its microscopic emphasis
as it tries to do more stories with regional and countywide
interest. Can reporters, these skeptics ask, who are told to
concentrate on in-depth regional stories about Westchester's aging
sewer systems or the Tappan Zee Bridge, which binds Westchester and
Rockland like an umbilical cord, also sustain the zest to cover a
Monday night meeting of the zoning board?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems facing our areas are regional to a great
extent,'' said Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner. ``If there's
a shopping mall in Rockland like the Palisades Mall, it impacts
Westchester business as well. On the other hand, a paper has a
certain amount of pages and more regional coverage could mean
there's going to be less local coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gannett has drawn complaints from some readers because
last week it ended its policy of publishing obituaries for every
Westchester resident who dies. Reporters now write obituaries for
only the most prominent. Other deaths will simply be listed, and
families who want longer obituaries will have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my parents and their neighbors,'' said Stephen
Medwid, a 40-year-old Tarrytown actor. ``These people spent their
whole lives here and built the community. To not recognize what
they've done in the obituary column, well, it's criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper analysts like John Morton and Sig Gissler, a Columbia
University School of Journalism professor who studied Gannett, say
the trick for Gannett is to broaden the paper's outlook and achieve
economies of scale without alienating readers who cherish local
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a risk that you can overconsolidate,'' Gissler
said. ``A lot of people like their local, local coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gannett is doing reflects trends that have been altering
the suburbs for more than a generation. The image of suburbia made
up of an archipelago of closely knit, largely white and
middle-class villages where the wives shop on Main Street while the
husbands commute to Manhattan has long been a wistful throwback.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women do most of their major shopping in vast regional
malls like The Westchester in White Plains and the Palisades in
West Nyack and they may pass up a neighborhood hospital for the
specialized care of a regional hospital like the Westchester County
Medical Center. Women increasingly commute, and the jobs they and
working men travel to are increasingly outside Manhattan, in places
like Westchester and Rockland. Suburban newcomers are often from
Latin America or India, and may have more ties to their native
countries than to the villages they live in.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett has even noticed that two of every three families who
buy houses in Westchester have lived somewhere else in the county
and want to keep up with news of their former towns as well as
their current ones.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Gannett, which publishes 84 dailies, including USA
Today, say that as a result of surveying readers through so-called
focus groups, they have had to rethink their papers for a more
cosmopolitan and sophisticated age. Obviously, economic
considerations played at least as big a role in a chain that last
year had before-tax profits of 31.2 percent, according to an
analysis by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a financial services
company.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Monday's issue, Gannett editors will no longer
have to remake the paper 12 times a day, reloading the presses so
each paper carries its own nameplate and several individualized
pages for hometown news, social calendars and local advertisements.
Not only has that meant extra editors, but presses in Gannett's
White Plains headquarters have also had to start rolling as early
as 9:30 p.m., leaving 40 percent of Gannett's subscribers without
the results of late baseball games or late town meetings.

 &HT;    Sales of Glenn memorabilia skyrocketing
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. _ The commemorative baby spoon in genuine
pewter is $5.95 and features the Discovery mission insignia etched
into the handle. The key ring has a 1960s-era John Glenn grinning
from his silver suit between emblems of his first space mission and
his latest. It runs $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can spend more, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decorative plates, in blue with gold rims, will set you back
$21.95 and come in two versions: Glenn the Mercury Program pioneer,
and Glenn the 77-year-old space shuttle astronaut. And for real
money, upwards of $69.95, you can buy framed portraits of Glenn
inset with mission patches or lapel pins.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn the senior senator from Ohio, America's original
space hero and soon to be the world's oldest man in orbit, is
currently starring on Florida's Space Coast as John Glenn the
merchandiser's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, Glenn and the six other astronauts aboard the
shuttle Discovery will lift-off for nine days in space, and already
the selling of Glenn and his return to orbit is well underway.
</P>
<P>
   And going great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been selling out of everything John Glenn,'' said
Karen Kleinschmidt, a spokeswoman at the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hats and buttons and refrigerator magnets that tell the story of
Glenn's historic first orbit in seven short lines are flying out
the door. And T-shirts, lots and lots of T-shirts. From the
standard white with the Discovery mission insignia, to the deep
blue ``John Glenn's Return to Glory,'' to the bluntness of a
block-lettered, ``Once Is Not Enough, do it again John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Keegan of Cincinnati finally opted for none of the
big-ticket items. At 41, the X-ray technician vividly remembers the
grade-school day Glenn first rocketed into orbit 36 years ago, and
while visiting the space center last week she said she wanted to
get something to commemorate his latest effort. She chose a simple
cachet, an envelope decorated with Glenn's face and carrying a
shuttle fact sheet that will be mailed to her on launch day,
postmarked from the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a keepsake, something I could hand down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's shuttle mission has her excited, but not like when she
was as a youngster. ``Then it was so unknown, there was a lot more
of that fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Space Shop at Kennedy's Visitor Center may be ground zero
for the commercial celebration of Glenn's return to space, but it
is by no means cornering the market. Lowell Murrell runs a computer
graphics company called American Illustrator in Cocoa Beach, and he
is getting in on the Glenn boom, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had a John Glenn launch every month,'' Murrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell's company does special shirts for every shuttle flight,
but typically he only sells about 5,000. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went by that number already,'' Murrell said, without being
specific. ``We've had major hotel chains without gift shops buy
1,000 shirts. They're building them into their (rate) packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn himself has tried mightily during his seven months of
training to direct attention away from the sentiment of his return
and toward the scientific experiments he'll be conducting while in
space. Just last week, he scolded reporters and photographers
assembled in Florida for focusing on him, not the science, and he
read off a list of experiments to be done on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often you get into the human aspects of this, you don't
get into the scientific stuff,'' Glenn said. ``If I came out and
said the BRIC program, or the Biological Research In Canisters,
you'd be completely turned off by it, wouldn't probably print a
word or say a thing about it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But not even NASA, which does carry science books in its stores,
is selling T-shirts with BRIC initials on them. In fact, around the
corner from the Space Shop at the Visitor's Center is a freebie way
to participate in Glenn's return to flight and it's devoted
entirely to the glory of a once and future space hero.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-foot by 40-foot poster has been stretched across a wall for
people to sign, decorated at one end with a black and white collage
of images from Glenn's Mercury days, and at the other with a
portrait of the Discovery crew. Across the top it says ``Godspeed
John Glenn and Crew of STS-95,'' and in between is a web of
scrawled good wishes, too numerous to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act your shoe size, not your age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Return with Honor!''
</P>
<P>
   And one six-foot long, ``Geronimoooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Savino, 70, of Tallahassee, Fla., signed the wall and in
the few minutes she stood around afterward three others asked to
borrow her pen. She said she's thrilled by Glenn's return to space
in part because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have space travel in our generation, that's wonderful,''
she said. ``He's just seven years older than I am, and I don't
think I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did she write on the poster to Glenn?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just signed my name,'' she said. ``It's all full. Where I
put it there's very little space. There's a `Good Luck' and `God
Bless' and I'm in right about the middle of it.

 WHITE PLAINS: town meetings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Monday's newspaper, Gannett will revise the paper only four
times for four newly carved zones _ in southern Westchester,
central Westchester, the combined area of northern Westchester and
Putnam, and Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   While the front pages will have virtually identical assemblages
of foreign, national and particularly compelling local news, a new
second section of local news will be different for each zone. The
southern Westchester edition, for example, will have three separate
pages of news for Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the anxieties their merger is stirring, Gary Sherlock,
president and publisher of Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the
regional division here, repeatedly promised in interviews that the
new paper would carry more local news than it does now. But he also
made a subtle distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term local news is more broadly defined than just the news
of the town I live in,'' Sherlock said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this more cosmopolitan approach, Gannett has opened a
Manhattan bureau to tell readers about New York City decisions that
affect the northern counties on issues like transportation. And it
continues to emphasize more in-depth looks at issues affecting the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen Gannett reporters and editors who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said they had been assured that the
consolidation of the newspaper would not mean any job cutbacks,
though some editors might be reassigned to other positions.
</P>
<P>
   People wary of the changes contend that a New Rochelle reader
accustomed to a steady diet of hometown news may not feel satisfied
getting more stories about Yonkers and Mount Vernon but fewer about
New Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in Port Chester aren't particularly interested
in Yonkers, even though they're both in southern Westchester,''
said Sy Schulman, the former Mayor of White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Solomon of Port Chester, the head of the village's
historical society, who attends most civic meetings to let
neighbors know her gripes, said she missed the days when Gannett
kept an office in Port Chester for its Daily Item edition. She
could regularly drop off notices about upcoming meetings and
buttonhole reporters with a complaint about a nagging town problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Gannett closed that office in the mid-1980s and more
recently closed offices in Yonkers and Yorktown, requiring
reporters who cover those locales to work out of centralized
offices in White Plains and New Rochelle. More importantly, Gannett
has for the last few years been gradually homogenizing its front
pages in the Westchester and Putnam newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a local paper anymore,'' Ms. Solomon said of the
Daily Item, whose 100-year-old nameplate will cease to exist
Monday. ``When they moved out of Port Chester, it lost its
localness.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians with more regional constituencies, like County
Executive Andrew Spano, heartily applaud the merger, predicting it
will bring the same cohesiveness to Westchester that Newsday
brought to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our problems in this county is sometimes we're too
parochial,'' Spano said.
</P>
<P>
   And Feiner, who is running for Congress in the 20th
Congressional District for the seat now held by Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, is pleased that a unified Gannett will introduce him to
potential voters in Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time he laments that four or five years ago
Gannett stopped covering every town board meeting in Greenburgh.
Indeed, many Westchester politicians, like Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky of Greenburgh, are hoping that Gannett holds on to some of
its narrow-gauge coverage even as it tries to regionalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made Westchester is that we have kept distinct small
communities,'' Brodsky said. ``It matters if you live in Elmsford
and not in Ardsley. The smallness of the communities gave the place
an intimacy and heterogeneous feel that gets lost in an era of
malls.''

 &HT;    Clinton challenges Congress to increase school funding
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drawing a line in the sand in his budget battle
with an outgoing Congress, President Clinton warned Friday that
lawmakers ''should not go home'' until they increase spending on
classroom initiatives by about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the money is needed to renovate schools, hire thousands
of new teachers and help children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans countered that Clinton was picking a fight
over education, the last smoldering pillar of what one called a
''failed agenda,'' as a smoke screen to deflect public attention
from his troubles over Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The public wrangling took place on a day when Clinton signed a
continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown by funding
federal operations through Monday night, to give White House and
congressional negotiators time to hammer out agreement on dozens of
outstanding spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting from budgeting to politicking, Clinton fired an
election-year broadside at the Republican-led Congress, chastising
legislators for failing to pass White House-backed bills aimed at
campaign finance reform, curbing cigarette sales to youths, raising
the minimum wage and providing low-income Americans with new
health-care guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''But still, it is not too late for us to go forward together on
our children's future,'' Clinton said in a brief statement on the
South Lawn. ''Politics,'' he said, ''should stop at the classroom
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of threatening to veto legislation that
didn't fully fund his education proposals. But his top economic
adviser, Gene Sperling, said earlier, ''We would not sign, or would
veto, a budget that was weak on education. If it does not go a long
way toward meeting the president's priorities, the president will
not sign this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has requested $17.7 billion in spending on education and
training programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The requests include $1 billion for building new classrooms and
another $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers, in an effort to
reduce class size to an average of 18 pupils per classroom for
grades kindergarten through three.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also requested $4.6 billion for Head Start and $7.8
billion for Title I, two programs aimed at improving the
educational prospects for children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the bill passed late Thursday night by the House comes
up $4 billion short of White House funding proposals, said
Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with funding is that the White House had
originally counted on revenues generated by an increase in
cigarette taxes to pay for increasing the number of classrooms and
teachers in public schools. The prospect of receiving those
revenues collapsed earlier this year, however, with the defeat of
comprehensive tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top domestic policy advisor, Bruce Reed, said there
was nevertheless no reason to also kill the prospects for reducing
class sizes, which can top 28 students per class in many elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need smaller classes,'' said Reed. ''We'd like this
Congress to get some work done. They killed the tobacco bill. They
killed campaign finance reform. They killed the patients' bill of
rights. We're not going to let them kill education.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans retorted that Clinton was playing politics with
schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not make one call to any Republican congressional
leader to discuss improving education'' all year long,' said Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's attacks on our agenda are simply the politics
of deflection and avoidance: deflecting attention away from his
failed agenda, and avoiding the subjects of grand juries, perjury,
abuse of power and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they had worked hard to pass an education
budget that addressed many of the priorities Clinton outlined, as
well as others he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans have passed 22 major education initiatives,''
House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling said
in a prepared statement. ''The president's bills didn't pass
because they don't focus on quality and they don't drive dollars
directly to the classroom. Instead, they create top-down federal
education programs run by Washington bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a showdown over education comes against a backdrop
of furiously paced negotiations over a host of budget areas,
ranging from Clinton's proposal for $18 billion in additional
funding for the International Monetary Fund to his request for more
than $1 billion to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 appropriations bills that provide a road map for how
the government will spend $1.7 trillion next year, only four had
been sent to the White House for Clinton's consideration as of late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Clinton has signed into law two, which pay for water
and energy and military construction. He has vetoed one, an
agriculture bill Clinton claimed came up short in funding for
emergency farm aid, and has not yet acted on the other, the giant
defense appropriations bill.

 &HT;    When the social security bills come due
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hilda Meltzer is 71 years old, lives
alone in a subsidized one-bedroom apartment, has $700 in the bank
and goes out to dinner once a month _ ``usually Chinese or Italian
and never for more than $10 or $11,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't bought a dress since 1996 _ and it might be a lot
longer if the government gets what it's looking for: Meltzer
received a letter last month telling her she owes Social Security
$18,000.
</P>
<P>
   The three-page letter came from a service center in New York and
explained that her husband, Joseph, had been overpaid for three
years before he died in 1994. Meltzer said she wasn't aware of any
overpayments. But like any debt, a widow is liable for money her
husband owed, said John Raffa, a spokesman for the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   So the letter Meltzer received said she was on the hook for the
money and that her entire monthly checks would be used to recover
the sum, starting in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be dead before they get it all back,'' Meltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the appeals process described at the bottom of the
letter might have comforted the widow. If she can't afford to pay
or if it wasn't her fault, according to the letter, she can appeal
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Meltzer has been down this road once before.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she received a similar letter demanding $1,100.
Meltzer appealed the claim and lost. Since then her monthly Social
Security check _ the only income she receives _ has been reduced
from $561 to $551.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the settlement,'' she said. ``They're taking it out
of my checks $10 at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like we tried to make it as painless as possible,''
Raffa said. ``But it also sounds like she didn't keep going with
the appeals process. She may need someone to hold her hand, but we
have 240,000 people in Palm Beach County getting checks so we don't
always have somebody to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raffa said the agency won't make Meltzer pay back the
$18,000 if she can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our intention is not to take back money from a
71-year-old woman who really needs it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Sales of Glenn memorabilia skyrocketing
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. _ The commemorative baby spoon in genuine
pewter is $5.95 and features the Discovery mission insignia etched
into the handle. The key ring has a 1960s-era John Glenn grinning
from his silver suit between emblems of his first space mission and
his latest. It runs $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can spend more, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decorative plates, in blue with gold rims, will set you back
$21.95 and come in two versions: Glenn the Mercury Program pioneer,
and Glenn the 77-year-old space shuttle astronaut. And for real
money, upwards of $69.95, you can buy framed portraits of Glenn
inset with mission patches or lapel pins.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn the senior senator from Ohio, America's original
space hero and soon to be the world's oldest man in orbit, is
currently starring on Florida's Space Coast as John Glenn the
merchandiser's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, Glenn and the six other astronauts aboard the
shuttle Discovery will lift-off for nine days in space, and already
the selling of Glenn and his return to orbit is well underway.
</P>
<P>
   And going great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been selling out of everything John Glenn,'' said
Karen Kleinschmidt, a spokeswoman at the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hats and buttons and refrigerator magnets that tell the story of
Glenn's historic first orbit in seven short lines are flying out
the door. And T-shirts, lots and lots of T-shirts. From the
standard white with the Discovery mission insignia, to the deep
blue ``John Glenn's Return to Glory,'' to the bluntness of a
block-lettered, ``Once Is Not Enough, do it again John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Keegan of Cincinnati finally opted for none of the
big-ticket items. At 41, the X-ray technician vividly remembers the
grade-school day Glenn first rocketed into orbit 36 years ago, and
while visiting the space center last week she said she wanted to
get something to commemorate his latest effort. She chose a simple
cachet, an envelope decorated with Glenn's face and carrying a
shuttle fact sheet that will be mailed to her on launch day,
postmarked from the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a keepsake, something I could hand down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's shuttle mission has her excited, but not like when she
was as a youngster. ``Then it was so unknown, there was a lot more
of that fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Space Shop at Kennedy's Visitor Center may be ground zero
for the commercial celebration of Glenn's return to space, but it
is by no means cornering the market. Lowell Murrell runs a computer
graphics company called American Illustrator in Cocoa Beach, and he
is getting in on the Glenn boom, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had a John Glenn launch every month,'' Murrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell's company does special shirts for every shuttle flight,
but typically he only sells about 5,000. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went by that number already,'' Murrell said, without being
specific. ``We've had major hotel chains without gift shops buy
1,000 shirts. They're building them into their (rate) packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn himself has tried mightily during his seven months of
training to direct attention away from the sentiment of his return
and toward the scientific experiments he'll be conducting while in
space. Just last week, he scolded reporters and photographers
assembled in Florida for focusing on him, not the science, and he
read off a list of experiments to be done on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often you get into the human aspects of this, you don't
get into the scientific stuff,'' Glenn said. ``If I came out and
said the BRIC program, or the Biological Research In Canisters,
you'd be completely turned off by it, wouldn't probably print a
word or say a thing about it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But not even NASA, which does carry science books in its stores,
is selling T-shirts with BRIC initials on them. In fact, around the
corner from the Space Shop at the Visitor's Center is a freebie way
to participate in Glenn's return to flight and it's devoted
entirely to the glory of a once and future space hero.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-foot by 40-foot poster has been stretched across a wall for
people to sign, decorated at one end with a black and white collage
of images from Glenn's Mercury days, and at the other with a
portrait of the Discovery crew. Across the top it says ``Godspeed
John Glenn and Crew of STS-95,'' and in between is a web of
scrawled good wishes, too numerous to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act your shoe size, not your age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Return with Honor!''
</P>
<P>
   And one six-foot long, ``Geronimoooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Savino, 70, of Tallahassee, Fla., signed the wall and in
the few minutes she stood around afterward three others asked to
borrow her pen. She said she's thrilled by Glenn's return to space
in part because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have space travel in our generation, that's wonderful,''
she said. ``He's just seven years older than I am, and I don't
think I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did she write on the poster to Glenn?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just signed my name,'' she said. ``It's all full. Where I
put it there's very little space. There's a `Good Luck' and `God
Bless' and I'm in right about the middle of it.

 &HT;    Judge's order keeps lawmaker from hiring insurance analyst
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas insurance companies have managed to block
a Fort Worth legislator's attempt to have an industry critic review
their business practices to make sure Texans are getting affordable
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of insurance companies, District Judge Suzanne
Covington on Friday approved a temporary order that prevents state
Rep. Lon Burnam from hiring an outside expert to review Department
of Insurance records. A lawyer on the Legislature's legal staff
called the ruling unprecedented. The battle revolves around company
records that Burnam and industry critic Birney Birnbaum, a
recognized insurance data analyst, say will prove illegal
discrimination against minorities and poor Texans. Such
discrimination _ according to Burnam, other lawmakers and consumer
advocates _ makes it difficult for minorities and poor Texans to
find affordable insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The records show, by ZIP code, where companies have sold and
canceled auto and property insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam, a Democrat whose district includes many Hispanic and
elderly residents, has asked the Texas Department of Insurance to
provide him with the records, which it has begun to do. But he said
neither he nor his current staff has the expertise to analyze the
information; therefore, he wants to hire Birnbaum to review it. He
said he has found no one else with Birnbaum's experience and
background.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum is a recognized expert in analyzing insurance industry
information. He previously worked for the Insurance Department and
has served as an expert in other insurance-related debates.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum acknowledges being a consumer advocate, but says he has
not skewed his statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, insurers object to his involvement. They say courts
have made it clear that the records are not public information,
though they are open to lawmakers and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Birnbaum is in essence, by becoming a member of a
legislator's staff, circumventing a . . . court order,'' said
Beverly Reeves, an attorney for State Farm, a lead plaintiff in the
court action joined by about a dozen other companies and two
industry trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said as an employee of the Insurance Department, Birnbaum
improperly released secret insurance company records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a concern that our claims of confidentiality have not
been respected in the past by Mr. Birnbaum,'' Reeves said.
``Perhaps they won't be respected again.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum said he did not improperly release company records and
would face civil and criminal penalties if he released the ZIP code
information from Burnam's office.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he's disappointed that the insurance industry has
``flexed its muscle'' to temporarily prevent Burnam from hiring him
to review the records.
</P>
<P>
   Although issued against Birnbaum, Covington's temporary order in
effect prevents Burnam from hiring Birnbaum to analyze the
information, according to Birnbaum's attorney, D.J. Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really working at not being angry,'' Burnam said. ``I'm
really interested in getting this information and analyzing it
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Collins, the head of legal affairs for the Texas
Legislative Council, said he's unaware of any court order that has
affected lawmakers' ability to use their staff as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my memory, there is no similar circumstance in my 22 years
of working for the Legislature,'' said Collins, whose agency is an
arm of the Legislature that provides legal advice to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said of the insurers, ``They are creating a veto power
over who Representative Burnam gets to hire. They want an
uninformed Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, insurers have said the fight isn't about Birnbaum
but about maintaining the secrecy of sensitive information that
would reveal their marketing strategies and hurt competition. But
Friday's court hearing focused clearly on Birnbaum, not
competition. Attorneys for the insurers stopped just short of
saying they wouldn't have sought the restraining order if Burnam
was going to hire any other person to review the information. After
Birnbaum analyzed similar data last year, the department began
investigating seven insurance companies for illegal discrimination.
One of those investigations, against Nationwide insurance, has
resulted in a recommendation that the company be fined $10 million
for discriminating against minorities and other Texans based on
their age.
</P>
<P>
   The department has said legal action is pending against two
other companies, and other investigations turned up no wrongdoing
or have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Conway, another State Farm attorney, said the records
being provided to Burnam show where insurance is sold, not why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show rich people buy more insurance, like they buy more
of everything else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's temporary order will last for two weeks. A hearing
for a more permanent order has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of irritating,'' Burnam said of the court fight.

 &HT;    South African urges race dialogue in U.S.
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The head of South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission _ charged with exorcising the specter of
that country's racist past _ told an audience at the University of
Texas Law School that the United States must better examine its own
racial conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found the difference that unlike in South Africa where we
are taking on this question head on, America doesn't want to talk
about it,'' Alex Boraine said Friday. ``They say the problem's been
solved.'' Boraine, a South African attorney who is now a visiting
professor at New York University's law school, spoke about the
controversial truth and reconciliation commission, which began
hearings in 1995 to assess and come to terms with the years of
apartheid. ``The commission is enabling them to tell South Africa,
and indeed the world, of the deep-seated racism and rejection''
that took place, Boraine said. ``It's their story and it had to be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The South African community is shaped by our history and our
own peculiar transition from a dictatorship and something akin to
slavery to democracy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have said the hearings held over the past two and a
half years have only served to highlight atrocities committed
during the apartheid regime from 1960 to 1994, preventing any
racial healing. Others say the commission hearings should instead
be war crime trials similar to the Nuremberg trials held for Nazi
leaders after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compromise had to be made. It was a tough choice,'' Boraine
said of the transition to a democratically-elected government.
``But a (limited) amnesty is the price we had to pay for a
remarkably peaceful election.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report and recommendations will be presented to
South African President Nelson Mandela Oct. 29, when they will also
be released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Boraine spoke to a group of about 50 as part of the UT law
school's Tom Sealy Lectureship. He is now working on a book about
his experiences in South Africa and on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Carter, a professor of history at Emory University in
Atlanta, said some people in the United States mistakenly believe
that racial equality has been achieved and are dismantling
affirmative action programs in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Hopwood court ruling effectively ended race
preference programs in Texas public universities and became a
festering sore at UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the progress of the past 40 years, America remains
deeply divided along the color line,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boraine said South Africa is not the only nation
searching for a way to resolve historical racial disputes, pointing
to conflicts in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing that we haven't learned. The whole question
of 'Never again.' has actually resulted in 'Again and again,''' he
said. ``We're not merely dealing with the past, but we're building
the future.''

FIREFIGHTERS SEE VICTORY IN SUIT OVER DEATH BENEFITS

<P>
   OWEGO, N.Y. _ Firefighters in Tioga County were claiming victory
Friday in a battle to recover burial costs and death benefits for a
volunteer who died of a heart attack two years ago after a minor
house fire.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,200 volunteer firefighters in this upstate county
along the Pennsylvania border had been planning to hold a
demonstration about the case at the Oct. 31 meeting of the county
Legislature, said Kevin Ford, the fire chief in Campville, a hamlet
east of the village of Owego.
</P>
<P>
   But after the state Workers Compensation Board refused to review
the county's appeal of the case Oct. 1, Ford said, the county's
lawyers decided to drop a parallel lawsuit in state court.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer who died, Guy Pollard, a former Newark Valley fire
chief, suffered a heart attack in January 1996 while standing
beside a fire truck requested of his department by neighboring
Owego firefighters who were battling a minor house fire.
</P>
<P>
   While volunteer firefighters are unpaid, they are eligible for
death benefits and lost wages under workers' compensation law if
they die on the job. But Tioga County officials denied the claim
filed by Pollard's wife, Sharon, and twice appealed compensation
board decisions in her favor. The county's final administrative
appeal was refused Oct. 1, without comment by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sluzar, a lawyer who represented Mrs. Pollard in the
case, said his client expected to receive $6,980 for funeral
expenses and $400 a week in income retroactive to the date of the
original workers' compensation decision a year ago. The $400 a week
amounts to $20,000 a year, to which Mrs. Pollard would be entitled
as long as she lives. The county, which is self-insured for
workers' compensation claims, must also pay 9 percent interest on
the awards for unpaid benefits, Sluzar said. The total award had
not been calculated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   County Legislature Chairwoman Frances Leavenworth said the legal
challenge was dropped after three consecutive administrative
defeats, on the advice of the county's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leavenworth, R-Apalachin, added that the threatened protest
by the volunteers did not affect the board's decision. She said it
was responsible of county lawmakers to fight paying a claim that
could potentially cost taxpayers as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Legislature did was the proper process in dealing
with this claim,'' Mrs. Leavenworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Tioga County is not the only self-insured municipality fighting
workers' compensation claims filed by the families of firefighters,
said Tom LaBelle, the chief lobbyist for the State Association of
Fire Chiefs. LaBelle said there had been a major jump in the number
of cases over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The trend especially frustrates the organization, he said,
because state law specifically presumes that a firefighter's fatal
heart attack is a line-of-duty death, unless proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more counties _ in particular for claims
regarding malfunctions of the heart _ that fight tooth and nail,''
LaBelle said. ``I can guarantee, sitting in a house watching a
football game, that same firefighter would not have suffered a
heart attack.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   LaBelle, whose organization represents 15,000 career and
volunteer fire officials in and outside New York state, says the
appeals are penny wise and pound foolish. Firefighters who might
otherwise take risky assignments now must weigh the consequences of
their actions on their families, he said. About 83 percent of the
roughly 132,500 firefighters in 1,787 municipal fire departments
are volunteers, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have that heart attack serving your community, and in
repayment your community takes your widow to court over $50,000,''
LaBelle said in reference to the initial award of benefits. ``It's
short-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the county's legal battle was only $800, Mrs.
Leavenworth said, since the Binghamton legal firm used in the case
was on retainer. An October 1997 decision by Compensation Board Law
Judge Geoffrey Wilk, however, ordered the county's self-insured
fire district to withhold $8,000 as a lien on potential lawyer
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of such claims will soon increase. Gov. George Pataki
signed a bill into law this summer increasing the lump sum benefits
for a surviving spouse of a volunteer firefighter, and doubling the
weekly payments and funeral benefits. It does not affect claims
filed before Jan. 1, 1999.

 &HT;    Redfish device automatically finds cheapest rate
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to pin down just which long-distance
company really offers the lowest rate has given more than one
consumer a big headache. Many give up.
</P>
<P>
   But Redfish Telemetrix, a newcomer operating out of Austin and
Costa Mesa, Calif., will start selling on Monday what it bills as
the answer: Rate Seeker, a gadget that attaches to the telephone
and, on each long-distance call, dials using the company charging
the lowest rate at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   And _ this could prove a threat to family peace in some homes _
Rate Seeker also displays a running total of how much a
long-distance call is costing.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Romines of Austin, chief technology officer for Redfish
Telemetrix, said the device should help consumers get a grip on
their long-distance bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought gasoline like you bought long distance,''
Romines said, ``you'd go to a pump with no price (of gas shown),
you would not know how much fuel you put in your tank (and) a month
later or so, you'd get a bill for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate Seeker, which also can serve as Caller ID box, will cost
about $89 and come with a three-month subscription. Subscribers
then pay $5 a month for automatic updates of long distance rates.
(Or $4 a month if they buy an annual contract.)
</P>
<P>
   For those who spend at least $50 a month on long-distance calls,
the company claims, Rate Seeker can save up to 60 percent a month.
However, that estimate is based on a comparison with standard
long-distance rates, which are usually higher than the rates
available in various monthly plans from long-distance providers.
</P>
<P>
   When a customer dials a long-distance number, the device uses an
internal database to select the lowest rate from among 700
long-distance providers _ including AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint _before
selecting one and completing the call. Romines said users will not
notice any time delay.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month Rate Seeker will automatically connect with Redfish
Telemetrix's service center in Austin to download the latest rate
information.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer still would sign up for a rate plan with whichever
long-distance company they wish. Long-distance calls completed by
companies other than the usual provider would show up on their
local phone bill, said Romines, a former director of information
systems at the Public Utility Commission of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Janee Briesemeister, who follows phone issues for Consumers
Union in Austin, had not had a chance to study Rate Seeker but said
it probably would help only those making a lot of long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The device could save money for customers who make a lot of
short-haul long-distance calls, the only kind still handled by
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and other local phone companies,
Briesemeister said.
</P>
<P>
   But many long-distance plans with reduced rates require a
monthly subscription and are not available on a call-by-call basis,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vanston, an Austin telecommunications consultant who also
had not yet had a chance to study Rate Seeker in detail, said the
$50 threshold might be too low to make it worthwhile for many
customers. But he said small businesses with a heavy load of
short-haul long-distance calls might find it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Redfish chose Austin to launch its first product for several
reasons, including its willingness to try new technologies and a
still relatively large area code zone, Romines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a market big enough to prove our technology and
still small enough to manage effectively,'' Romines said. ``We
won't go and bite off Southern California until we get a little
experience here in a smaller market.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will directly sell Rate Seeker by telephone, (877)
473-3347, and on the Web (www.redfishtm.com). It will advertise on
buses and radio and in print.
</P>
<P>
   Redfish Telemetrix, started in 1996 and privately held, was
founded by Romines; its president, Christopher Miner, of Newport
Beach, Calif.; and Lance Brewer, a Costa Mesa lawyer.

COMMENTARY: GOP COVER STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout Thursday's impeachment debate in the House you could
hear the uncharacteristically low-keyed voice of the GOP's chief
inquisitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gentleman from Missouri is recognized for three minutes,''
Newt Gingrich would say. Or he would rap his speaker's gavel for
quiet and ask, oh so formally and respectfully, ``Does the
gentleman move the previous question?''
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then he would smile hideously, reminding us that
hypocrisy is as abundant in Washington as fertilizer on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   It was, frankly, chilling. Newt Gingrich presiding over the
possible impeachment of a Democratic president, even one as
spectacularly vulnerable as Bill Clinton, is insane.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Newt Gingrich who several years ago told a
group of young Republicans: ``I think one of the great problems we
have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be
nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient and loyal and faithful
and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around the
campfire but are lousy in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, refashioned by Gingrich and his right-wing
cronies, no longer has that problem. Since winning control of
Congress in 1994, it has consistently pursued a mean-spirited
extremist agenda and is now determined to turn the self-inflicted
wounds of Bill Clinton into an even larger majority.
</P>
<P>
   Try to imagine the implications of a bigger, more powerful, more
aggressive, more right-wing regime of Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is a party that is not content with trying to roll back
abortion rights. It is fighting on several fronts against
contraception. Just last week the Republican leadership in the
House, under pressure from the right, killed a measure that would
have required federal health plans that cover prescription drugs to
cover the cost of contraceptives. No one seemed to think it was
crazy to have abortion foes opposing a measure that would reduce
the need for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   This is a party that tried to eliminate federal nutrition
standards for school meals and fought hard against a meat
inspection system designed to protect the public from the deadly E.
coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   It's a party that attacked Medicare and Medicaid and went out of
its way to trash the environment. Clean air? Clean water? Forget
about it. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip and a sharp
critic of Clinton, denounced the Environmental Protection Agency as
the ``Gestapo of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   You want ethics? Pull the clips on Gingrich and learn how not to
behave. Or check out John Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House
Republican Conference. I wrote a column in 1996 describing how he
took money from tobacco lobbyists and handed it out to certain of
his colleagues on the floor of the House, while the House was in
session.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who couldn't find the high road if they approached
it by parachute.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Bill Clinton brought his problems on
himself. He destroyed his own presidency. But there are
consequences to be paid if the Republicans are allowed to feast too
ravenously on the political spoils.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have already lost the opportunity to control the
campaign season with discussions of such issues as the rights of
patients in the era of managed care, the need to move boldly to
rebuild the public school system, the concerns of working Americans
in a chaotic economic environment and the outlook for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Having been handed the gift of Monica Lewinsky, the Republicans
are running with her. She conceals their real agenda. If they can
parlay the Monica madness into substantially increased majorities
in the House and Senate, they can renew their conservative assault
on government and their subversion of the interests of ordinary
working Americans and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that this is a party that crafted extraordinary tax
breaks for billionaires while claiming the sky would fall if the
minimum wage was raised to $5.25 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and the Democrats fended off the most extreme
aspects of the so-called Republican revolution of the mid-'90s. Now
Clinton has given the right-wingers the opportunity to take care of
their unfinished business. Only the voters stand in the way.

DID JEWELRY OR DICE GAME LEAD TO MAN'S SLAYING? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is an eye-catching piece of jewelry _ a gold chain
and a pendant shaped like a bulldog's head, with rubies for eyes _
and it cost Marvin McIntosh his life, say prosecutors in New York
City's second death penalty trial since capital punishment was
revived in the state three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses call it the ``bulldog gold chain,'' and prosecutors
say that on a night in May 1996 McIntosh was shot to death on a
street in East New York, Brooklyn, while resisting three robbers
who wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the robbers shot the 28-year-old victim, prosecutors say,
but they contend that the fatal bullets were fired by Jermaine
Page, 24, the defendant on trial in state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn. Page faces a possible death sentence if convicted of
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Page's lawyers say that the person who fired the fatal shots was
not their client but a teen-ager who is to be tried later on a
charge of second-degree murder, which is not punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Page's lawyers also hold that the death arose not from a robbery
but rather from a dispute over a dice game. They have suggested
that Page did not fire any shots. The jury will decide these issues
after its deliberations begin sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   But one matter seems clear: when McIntosh, who lived in Staten
Island and worked for a private mail delivery service, bought the
chain and pendant at a Brooklyn store two months before he was
slain, he paid a good deal more than those accused of taking it
were likely to get for it.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $1,000. After his death, the case file shows, an
appraiser estimated its value as used jewelry at about $300.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have presented witnesses to back their differing
versions of the confrontation that ended with what one prosecutor,
Barry Schreiber, described to the jury as McIntosh's execution.
</P>
<P>
   That characterization perhaps hinted at why Schreiber's boss,
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes decided to seek the death
penalty for Page, under the 1995 law that reinstated capital
punishment in the state. When he made the decision in 1996, Hynes
gave no reason other than to say that he had reviewed the
``aggravating and mitigating factors'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's first trial under the new law, also in Brooklyn,
a former jail guard, Darrel Harris, was convicted of first-degree
murder in May for the execution-style killings of three people in a
robbery, and in June the jury sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Page's trial, the prosecution has sought to portray him as a
heartless killer who gloried in the spoils of his street robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fled and was found with that bulldog hanging around his
neck like a trophy,'' Schreiber told the jury, referring to
testimony by Larry Rilee, a detective from the Newport News Police
Department in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rilee said that when Page had been arrested at an aunt's home in
that city seven weeks after McIntosh's killing, he was wearing the
chain and pendant.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber said that ``his arrogance of wearing that trophy
around his neck'' made Page ``not deserving of mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   But a defense lawyer, Gary Villanueva, dismissed it as evidence
only of a mundane misdemeanor. Wearing the slain man's jewelry when
he was arrested, Villanueva said, means only that ``he's in
possession of stolen property.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking below the surface of the trial are the prosecution's
contentions that some of its witnesses have been threatened or
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this trial began, we have had a number of reported
threats to witnesses,'' Schreiber told Justice Priscilla Hall at
one point, with the jury not in the courtroom. Later, another
defense lawyer, Steven Chaikin, told a reporter that it was
``absolutely, positively'' not true that Page's relatives and
friends had threatened witnesses, ``as best as I know without being
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury has not been told about the purported threats, just as
it has not been told about other matters Ms. Hall has deemed
irrelevant or improperly prejudicial, such as the prior criminal
records of the accused man and his victim.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject of purported threats and intimidation did
surface before the jury at one point _ at least in the defense's
view. A prosecution witness, Gene McKinley, 19, was testifying
that, without knowing about McIntosh's killing, he had tried to
carry out Page's request to dispose of the gun that the prosecution
said Page had used. McKinley said he had been arrested and charged
with illegal gun possession but prosecutors had agreed to drop the
charge in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   He denied Chaikin's suggestion that to get off the hook he would
say what the prosecution wanted, insisting that the only conditions
of his deal were that ``I tell the truth'' and ``I'll also be moved
out of state.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a defense demand for a mistrial. The relocation
remark unfairly prejudiced Page because it implied ``he is a bad
guy and has connections with bad people,'' Villanueva argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denied,'' Ms. Hall said.

 COMMENTARY: FOBs _ FEMMES OF BILL  
 (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton's presidency crystallized with one
courtesan. It shattered with another.
</P>
<P>
   His plans to win the White House came together amid the
Aubussons, Baccarat, 7-foot-tall sterling torcheres and
18th-century hand-painted Chinese wallpaper in the Georgetown
drawing room of Pamela Harriman. His plans for a great legacy fell
apart in the windowless hallway near the Oval Office with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this scandal is not illicit sex. The problem is
that we need a better class of illicit sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began in the capable hands of a world-class femme
fatale. He ended up in the clutching hands of a junior fatal femme.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that Pamela would have been appalled by Monica.
</P>
<P>
   One talked in the deep rolling cadences of Winston Churchill;
the other, like a Valley mall rat. One gave her men monogrammed
silver cigarette lighters; the other, books like ``Oy Vey! The
Things They Say: A Guide to Jewish Wit.'' One dressed in Bill Blass
and Oscar de la Renta; the other, in the Gap. One served her men
foie gras; the other, pizza. One cultivated the most elegant female
friends from New York and Washington society; the other poured her
heart out to a wired-up Pentagon flunky. One collected delicious
gossip to amuse her lovers; the other just gossipped about her
lover.
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show, you can't get on-the-job training as a
courtesan at the presidential level. An amateur can put the whole
country at risk.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Lifetime cable channel will air ``Life of
the Party,'' based on Christopher Ogden's book about the woman who
was famous for her famous men.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman is played, with high
camp and little sympathy, by an actress with merely one name,
Ann-Margret. The Lifetime press release gushes: ``Men loved her.
Women envied her. Family scorned her. A nation adored her.''
</P>
<P>
   The film uses real news footage of Bill Clinton giving the
eulogy for his ambassador to France at her state funeral in
Washington last February.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harriman helped revive the Democratic Party in the '80s, by
raising money and bestowing an aura of glamour. She mentored Bill
Clinton, teaching him how to operate in the world's best salons,
how to handle himself with the players and the plutocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Now Monica has hurt the Democratic administration that Pamela
served so many canapes to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the time Pam spent teaching Clinton how to aim
high,'' Ogden says, ``she would have been horrified to see him
brought so low by Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   With their porcelain complexions and pillowy figures, both
Pamela and Monica zeroed in on powerful men, unfettered by any
twinges of conscience about wives, enveloping their quarry with
rapt gazes, flattery and sex that catered to male wishes and
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pamela was so about subtlety and cunning,'' says Sally Bedell
Smith, who wrote a biography of Mrs. Harriman called ``Reflected
Glory.'' ``She never would have been friends with Linda Tripp or
blabbed to 11 people. Monica plays the game all wrong. Pamela would
have taken that job with Bill Richardson, and set herself up as an
emissary between the U.N. and the White House. She never would have
wanted to work at Revlon.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harriman was a disciplined siren, a long-term strategic
thinker on romance, a woman who cocooned and nanny-ed her men,
played them off against each other, and always stayed friends with
old lovers. She would never have threatened or blackmailed a lover,
or denounced one as a Big Creep. She never even admitted to being
dumped; she simply picked herself up and moved on to the next
target.
</P>
<P>
   She was the consummate geisha, with a man's slippers, cocktails
and briefing papers at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the sort to snuggle in front of van Gogh's `White
Roses,''' says Ogden. ``Not to have a hurried encounter in a dark
hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumed that the femme fatale ethos would not survive
feminism. But it has roared back, as feminism has been compromised.
Men are as blind as ever to the transparent tricks, because they
love the flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Pamela. Bill and Monica. It's a cautionary tale. Live
by big hair, die by big hair.

SPORTS COLUMN: CLASS AND DIGNITY DISAPPEAR IN A LOUISIANA SCANDAL

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When Edward DeBartolo Jr., the opulent co-owner of the San
Francisco 49ers, was reportedly about to be indicted in December by
a federal grand jury in Louisiana investigating riverboat casino
licensing and other business arrangements, he suddenly resigned as
the 49ers' chairman. He also issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thankful,'' it read, ``for the support of my wife, my
children, my family and my friends. They know, as I do, that these
things simply are not true. I look forward to the time when I can
address these issues and tell my side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   But when that time arrived, ``these things'' turned out to be
true _ notably $400,000 in new $100 bills DeBartolo handed former
Gov. Edwin Edwards of Louisiana for his influence in the Gaming
Board's granting a casino license in 1997 to the Hollywood Casino
Corp., which included DeBartolo as an investor.
</P>
<P>
   After cutting a deal with federal prosecutors to provide
evidence against Edwards, the 51-year-old man known as Eddie D.
pleaded guilty Tuesday in Baton Rouge to concealing an alleged
extortion plot by Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the plea agreement, Judge John Parker
sentenced Eddie D. to two years' probation and ordered that he pay
a $250,000 fine, forfeit to the federal government the $400,000 he
paid Edwards and provide up to $350,000 in restitution that might
be claimed by anyone hurt by the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The financial penalties add up to $1 million, merely a drop out
of Eddie D.'s bucket. According to Forbes magazine's new list of
America's 400 richest people, he is worth $830 million.
</P>
<P>
   But all those millions won't buy what Eddie D. wants most now:
``getting my football team back,'' as he said after his sentencing.
All those millions didn't stop Commissioner Paul Tagliabue from
directing him to remain inactive with the 49ers and the National
Football League through the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   And all those millions, it is hoped, won't prevent the
commissioner from swatting Eddie D. with the George Steinbrenner
yardstick for in-house punishment among club-owner felons: a
two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted in 1974 on 14 felony counts that his American
Shipbuilding Co. had covered up corporate contributions to the
Nixon re-election committee and that he had obstructed justice,
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, eventually pleaded
guilty to one felony count of conspiracy as well as to one count of
illegal campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   After being fined $15,000 (AmShip was fined $20,000),
Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball for two years by
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn.
</P>
<P>
   As long as telephones exist, a club owner can't be completely
banned from making franchise decisions. During Steinbrenner's
exile, the Yankees signed right-hander Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter to
the first of the lavish free-agent contracts. The principal owner
wasn't allowed to charm Hunter, but he surely approved the $3.35
million package.
</P>
<P>
   When Harold Ballard, the major-domo of hockey's Toronto Maple
Leafs, was convicted of tax evasion, his prison sentence was
postponed until after the 1972 Canada-Soviet Union series. And
during his three years in prison, it was an open secret that he
continued to pull the strings on every Maple Leaf decision.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's situation is different. If and when Edwards is
indicted, DeBartolo would very likely be called to testify in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, Edwards' lawyers are very likely to be hard
on the man Edwards has called ``the Linda Tripp of Louisiana.'' In
what is expected to be an ugly trial, the NFL would surely prefer a
suspended 49er owner to be on the stand, not an active or even
inactive 49er owner.
</P>
<P>
   As for Eddie D.'s influence on the 49ers, a telephone isn't
enough anymore.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who is worth $820 million,
(according to Forbes magazine) and who took over after Eddie D.'s
resignation, will continue as the 49ers' chairwoman, but their
relationship is described, politely, as strained.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Eddie D.'s guilty plea, his profile in the 49er
media guide had wisely been changed.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's guide, he was described as having earned
``considerable stature and esteem'' for managing an NFL franchise
that has operated with ``class and dignity'' while winning a record
five Super Bowl championships.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he is described only as the chief executive officer
from 1977 to 1997, who ``saw his primary role as one of providing
emotional and financial support for his players and coaches,'' and
who is praised as a ``players' owner.''
</P>
<P>
   All that stature and esteem, all that class and dignity
disappeared in the swamp of a Louisiana scandal.

COMPLAINTS AGAINST HEALTH INSURERS ON RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Conn., Ill., Texas, Ohio, Md., Minn., Ariz.,
Fla., N.H., Ore., Wash., Kan.)  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State health insurance regulators are reporting
surging numbers of formal complaints from patients and doctors
against health insurers, primarily health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They say they doubt that the rise implies a deterioration in
care. They tie much of it to greater public readiness to fight HMOs
and to the insurance commissioners' efforts to encourage people to
file complaints. ``We are beating the bushes,'' said Neil Levin,
New York state's insurance superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   What troubles the commissioners more than the volume of
complaints is a broad shift in the nature of them. Disputes with
insurers have changed from conflicts over who should pay for care,
usually after it has been provided, to conflicts over denials and
delay of care and over medication and forms of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was about who pays,'' said Patricia Butler of
Boulder, Colo., a health care analyst and consultant to insurance
commissioners. ``Now it's about whether you get the service at all.
You might have your health hanging in the balance, so it's a little
more frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners say the formal complaints represent possible
violations of law and health-plan provisions, and are culled from
many more trivial and unsupportable claims. Depending on the state,
40 percent to 80 percent of the complaints are resolved in favor of
the patient or the physician.
</P>
<P>
   No one records national trends in the number of complaints, but
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners predicts that
35,000 will be filed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with 12 insurance departments of mostly populous
states with dense concentrations of managed care, those of New
York, Connecticut, Illinois, Texas, Ohio and Maryland said
complaints had grown at least 50 percent over the last one to three
years, far faster than the growth of enrollment in managed care
plans. Only one state, Minnesota, reported a decline; other states
with increases included Arizona, Florida, New Hampshire, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   New York reported a sixfold increase in claims against managed
care organizations from 1996 through September of this year. It
said that 76 percent of the 20,089 claims filed over the period had
been settled in favor of the consumers and doctors bringing them.
Levin ascribed much of the increase to the travails of one leading
HMO, Oxford Health Plans, and to fee disputes with physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, complaints from consumers have been climbing for
several years, to 846 in 1996 from 131 in 1993. In the fiscal year
ended in August, the number leaped to 4,914, largely because of a
new law allowing complaints by physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry executives say that in spite of the rise,
independent surveys regularly show that 80 percent to 90 percent of
managed care organizations' enrollees are satisfied with their
care, a figure that has changed little over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too simplistic to equate'' the rise in complaints
with the quality of care and reach the conclusion, ```Aha! Things
are getting worse,''' said Bill Pierce, spokesman for the Blue
Cross and Blue Shield Association, which represents 55
organizations that sell both managed care and fee-for-service
plans. And as enrollees become accustomed to HMOs, he said, they
find less to complain about. Pierce said candidates for state and
federal office had fanned public fears of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kahn, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said that 35,000 complaints a year from the
77 million enrollees whose insurance is subject to state regulation
was not a large number. ``You should have zero tolerance for
problems,'' he said. ``Inevitably there are going to be some.''
</P>
<P>
   That 80 percent of managed care enrollees are satisfied with
their care obscures the views of a less satisfied 10 percent or 15
percent who make much use of the organizations, said Karen Pollitz,
an analyst at the Institute for Health Care Research and Policy at
Georgetown University. ``In any health plan,'' Ms. Pollitz said,
``the vast majority are healthy and are not using the services.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Commissioners add that dwelling on the number of complaints
masks an issue they say is more ominous: the changing nature of
complaints. Kansas, for instance, had only 145 complaints through
September. ``But I'm not sure numbers are the best indicator,'' the
state insurance commissioner, Kathleen Sebelius, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother called us,'' Ms. Sebelius said. ``Her 15-year-old son
had attempted suicide and was going to be released from the
hospital in 24 hours. She was absolutely frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was afraid he'd be dead if he were released. We got him
permission to stay an additional week with extra evaluation and to
have a plan in place prior to any release.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blossom, New Hampshire's insurance commissioner, cited a
woman who had had a mastectomy under a fee-for-service plan. After
switching to an HMO, she needed another mastectomy, but was not
allowed to see the same doctor. ``We got involved and they
permitted it,'' Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, which reports a comparatively small 17 percent
increase in complaints from 1996 to 1997, Joel Ario, consumer
protection manager for the Oregon Insurance Division, sees two
forces at work. ``There are more genuine problems in the
marketplace,'' he said, and ``people are more aware of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance commissions have installed consumer hot lines and
many have put complaint forms on their Web pages. Some publish
``report cards,'' disclosing HMO accreditation levels, levels of
patient satisfaction and details of charges and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is learning to use the system,'' said Kip May,
deputy director of the Ohio insurance department.
</P>
<P>
   Through August, 17 states had also opened a new channel for
complaints in creating courts of third-party review _ nonpartisan
arbitrators, unaffiliated with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners also report wide variations in complaints from
company to company. Using ratios of complaints and plan enrollments
to permit fair comparisons, the Texas Department of Insurance
reports that last year, Foundation Health received three times the
complaints brought against Cigna Healthcare and 10 times those
against the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. Some small HMOs had no
recorded complaints.
</P>
<P>
   One striking exception to the surge in complaints is Minnesota,
which has had HMOs for more than two decades. After years of tight
regulation, complaints have dropped over the last few years to 600
or 700, from an average of 1,300 a year in the late 1980s, said
Kent Peterson, director for managed care systems in the Department
of Health. ``Every member has had the phone number of this office
on their membership card for 10 years,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: WILL THE YANKEES' LEADER PLEASE STEP FORWARD?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the moments following an eye-opening game that
left them with their first postseason deficit, the players sat
quietly around their clubhouse Friday night, mixing pasta and
meatballs with their crow. You wanted to see how many would look
and sound defeated, or defiant. You waited to determine, in their
hour of crisis, who the leader of the 114-victory New York Yankees
really was.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a record-breaking season, baseball and its fans have
been treated to a remarkable performance by this most egalitarian
bunch, probably the most superlative, superstar-less team our
generation has seen. From top to bottom, the Yankees have been a
study in conformity and comportment, a mix of unassuming
cornerstones, aging former All-Stars blended with younger,
burgeoning talents who checked their egos at the clubhouse door.
</P>
<P>
   This has been Joe Torre's team, a reflection of the manager's
demeanor that is so stable and infectious that it has even
becalmed, for the most part, the team's destructively volcanic
owner. But now the Yankees had somehow made a wrong turn off a
straight road to the World Series, and a fair question to ask was
who would be the one to yell, ``This way back?'' Who would be the
one to dismiss the queasy notion that a different kind of karma had
taken hold of an American League Championship Series the Cleveland
Indians were leading, 2-1, going into Game 4 at Jacobs Field?
</P>
<P>
   Those who watch for ominous signs that suggest fate is working
extra hard to vanquish form didn't have to look past the pitcher's
mound, where Doc Gooden was presented with an opportunity to send
the team he pitched for in similar circumstances here a year ago to
the brink of oblivion. Friday night, another Yankee castoff, Mark
Whiten, doubled and homered off Andy Pettitte. New York City's
Manny Ramirez hit the first of three two-out, fifth-inning home
runs that drove the Yankees from the game and Pettitte from the
mound, making Torre's unyielding faith in his sensitive left-hander
seem blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won three of four games this season,'' Torre said after
his team's passive 6-1 defeat in Game 3, knowing such a percentage
was now mandatory for survival. ``I just hope we swing the bats and
everybody has a sense of relaxation. That's all it's going to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Torre added, ``These guys are pretty professional.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could deny that, and maybe their trademark steadiness, a
few timely hits and six or seven strong innings from Orlando
Hernandez was all it was going to take to straighten out this mess.
Yet who can argue, after watching the accumulation of cool
efficiency known as the Atlanta Braves fall short in all but one
season this decade, that emotion and leadership are the part of
baseball that cannot be measured by calling the Elias Sports
Bureau?
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this Yankee team rode a few waves itself past the
Braves in 1996, but there were subtle but significant differences
in that team's makeup. Jim Leyritz and his fearlessness, for one.
Tim Raines, for another, was near the top of the lineup and his
game, as opposed to his current role as the alternating designated
hitter with Chili Davis. Cecil Fielder had money on his mind more
often than not, but his ornery nature was also a weapon against the
ennui that can engulf a team in a short series.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Yankees had Darryl Strawberry on the bench, not
watching from his sick bed. ``People keep talking about Darryl
motivating us by not being here, but I'll tell you something,
Darryl motivated a lot of guys on this team more by being on the
bench,'' Davis said before this series began.
</P>
<P>
   This Yankee team could never be Reggie and Billy and Thurman,
but you looked around the clubhouse late Friday night and wondered
if doubt had crept into its gentlemanly core. David Cone is the
Yankees' unofficial spokesman but he is not an everyday player.
Before long, Derek Jeter will be the Yankee captain, their leader,
but for now, he remains a valued member of the collective.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said there was nothing to do but play harder last night.
Tino Martinez sat by himself, digging into the pasta, trying to
eliminate the taste of his postseason swoon. Chuck Knoblauch,
Cleveland's new favorite player, still had his own Game 2 baggage
to deal with. Bernie Williams spoke so softly to a small group of
reporters you had to practically inspect the quality of his teeth
to understand what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, left at second base as Williams made the final out
of 1997 in this very ball park, sat with his feet up by his stall,
calmly discussing the Yankees' plight. ``It's frustrating not to
come through every time,'' he said. ``But that's just not the
nature of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what O'Neill says when he steps off the field, after
throwing his helmet, bat and hat when the balls do not drop. He is
the most passionate Yankee, their perceived leader. ``Paul leads by
example,'' Torre said. ``He doesn't give speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre hoped one would not be necessary. He hoped his Yankees,
New York's team, would do things their way. He hoped there wouldn't
be a point where people would have to say a lack of leadership was
the Yankees' one, fatal flaw.

JOSEPH SANDLER, 71, WORLD-RENOWNED PSYCHOANALYST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph J. Sandler, a psychoanalyst known internationally for
his major theoretical contributions and a leader of what a
colleague called a ``quiet revolution'' in psychoanalytic thought,
died Oct. 6 at his home in London. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   British psychoanalysis in the mid-1900s was split into divergent
and sometimes competitive schools, one led by Sigmund Freud's
daughter Anna, another by the British analyst Melanie Klein.
Sandler, a member of the Freudian group, was instrumental, through
his writings and teaching, in nurturing a gradual reconciliation of
the two camps, integrating Ms. Klein's ``object relations''
perspective with more classical psychoanalytic drive theory.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cape Town, Joseph Sandler was trained as an experimental
psychologist before receiving his medical degree from University
College Hospital in London. Joining the British Psycho-Analytical
Society at the age of 25, he worked at the Tavistock Clinic and
later, under Anna Freud, at the Hampstead Clinic (now the Anna
Freud Center).
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1984, Sandler was the Sigmund Freud Professor at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He then returned to England and
became the first scholar to hold the Freud Memorial Chair in
Psychoanalysis at University College, London. After his retirement
in 1992, he remained at the university as emeritus professor until
his death.
</P>
<P>
   During his term as president of the International
Psychoanalytical Association from 1989 to 1993, Sandler emphasized
the importance of empirical research, setting up a summer research
program for analysts and sponsoring an annual research conference,
according to Dr. Robert Wallerstein, a close friend and past
president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Otto Kernberg, a New York analyst who is now the
association's president, said Sandler's strong scientific interests
also helped forge links between psychoanalytic thinking and
neurobiology.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific author, Sandler wrote more than 200 professional
papers and edited 44 books, including a classic introduction to
psychoanalysis, ``The Analyst and The Patient'' (International
Universities Press, 1973), which he wrote with Christopher Dare,
Alex Holder and Anna Ursula Dreher. He was the founding editor of
the International Review of Psycho-Analysis and served as editor of
the International Journal of Psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie Sandler, who is also
a psychoanalyst, three children and seven grandchildren.

ALICIA PARLA, 84; SHOWED THE WORLD HOW TO RUMBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but
incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of
cancer Oct. 6 at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as
the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris,
captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the
Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of
Depression-weary revelers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out,
the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930s
and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down
version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance
the Cubans call the son.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose
extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than
of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted
to do on a dance floor before the 1980s, or ever on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips,
the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing
sight that she and it became overnight sensations.
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she
attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York
with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John
Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he
would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was
9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if
she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry
her.
</P>
<P>
   It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in
part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry
a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a
measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ``until a
millionaire comes along, as he put it.''
</P>
<P>
   A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a
little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who
ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at how good
she was, she began to get the notion that she might actually become
a professional.
</P>
<P>
   She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a
17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job
she was able to take over her mother's objections only after
promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother
serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something
Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer
became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and she was
such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated
Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for
a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out,
along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him
so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she
persuaded Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on.
``The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ``and I didn't like
doing it with a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's
eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss
Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was
simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu
recording of ``El Manisero'' (``The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit
and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a
musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with
another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss
Parla (and her mother) joined Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla
caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince
of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later
became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to
his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother
tagging along). ``He got it,'' she said. ``He was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier,
asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla
declined, saying, as she recalled, ``Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so
sorry. I'm a virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly
prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When
she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a
slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the
colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and
began shouting ``Vive La France.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the
crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing
the colors of the French flag. The next day, she was hailed by
critics as ``the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was
told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ``Mariana scarfs,'' copied
from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had
taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to
Brussels, Belgium, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her
a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.
</P>
<P>
   After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de
France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris
nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ``that lovely
Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she
returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months
later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba
was over.
</P>
<P>
   After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher,
discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen
Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo
Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over
the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and
Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest
Hemingway).
</P>
<P>
   When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then
married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States
and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the
Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as
a typist.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a
sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.

 &HT;    Corporate-run prison may finally get its first inmates
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If all goes according to plan, buses and vans will
pull into the back of D. Ray James State Prison just before dawn
Tuesday with the first 24 medium-security Georgia convicts to be
locked up by corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this time _ the state's third deadline in so many months
_ Georgia will begin its experiment with private prisons .
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's new and it will be under the public microscope
until they establish a track record,'' Corrections Commissioner
Wayne Garner said. Cornell Corrections Inc. of Houston will be the
first to open a private prison in Georgia, taking about 50
prisoners a week until it reaches 750 medium-security inmates at
the Charlton County facility, near the Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Corp. of America, a Nashville-based company that
dominates the private prison industry, is building two facilities
in Wheeler and Coffee counties; those institutions are expected to
begin taking its first prisoners later this year or in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While the state has committed to lease 750 beds at each prison,
all three will be built to hold 1,600. The companies are hoping
that Georgia will rent the other 850 beds, a total of 2,550.
Otherwise, the two companies will try to fill those extra beds with
inmates from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to work,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that by putting some 2,250 men in private prisons,
the Department of Corrections will save about $20 million a year
out of its budget of almost $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But private prisons have had problems in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In Youngstown, Ohio, for example, four murderers and two other
dangerous inmates cut through a gate and escaped from a prison
operated by Corrections Corp. of America. Before those escapes last
summer, that prison already had been the scene of more than a dozen
inmate stabbings, two of them fatal. Consequently, state officials
have been trying to close the supposedly medium-security prison
that is holding dangerous criminals from Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, two sex offenders from Oregon escaped from a CCA
prison that was supposed to be holding detained immigrants, not
violent state inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Garner has said those problems are no cause for alarm in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   As for being cheaper, several studies, including one by the U.S.
General Accounting Office, found there is no savings and in some
cases the cost of keeping inmates in a private prison is higher.
Only Texas has enjoyed a savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said this would save money but in reality it hasn't saved
money (in other states),'' said Tyrone Freeman, executive director
of the Georgia State Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   Garner says the contract will protect Georgia's taxpayers from
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the delays, Cornell's warden and DOC officials say
they are not concerned. The extra time has only ensured that the
building and the staff are ready, and Warden Lowell Hudson has used
the three weeks since getting a ``certificate of occupancy'' for
``crossing the T's and dotting the I's.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Georgia) being pushed into this because of the
crowding of state institutions,'' Freeman said. ``We still have
some major concerns.''

A LOOK AT HOW THE OTHER SIDE FEELS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 BY MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ ``We're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly out of nowhere, the words popped into the air in the
eerily silent Yankees' clubhouse. They came from one of the players
talking to another player, but the context was unknown. The
Yankees' context was painfully clear, however. They were in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had just lost to Cleveland, 6-1, Friday night and
fallen behind the Indians, two games to one, in the four-of-seven
American League Championship Series, the series that was supposed
to be the last stepping stone to the World Series for the team that
had everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Now, awaiting Game 4 Saturday night, the Yankees were uncertain
of their immediate future. They had to play two more games at
Jacobs Field and had to win one of them to force the series and the
Indians back to New York. The single critical question hovered over
their bowed heads: Having had no occasion during the season to face
such adversity, could they now overcome it?
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees wouldn't acknowledge the existence of adversity.
Others said they had handled it during the season when they had to.
But when, in a 114-victory, 48-loss season, had they had to?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge, and everyone in this room enjoys the
challenge,'' Joe Girardi, the cerebral catcher, said. But, he was
told, the club had not had a challenge all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree,'' he retorted. ``I think everyone, when we go out
every day, takes it as a personal challenge. Whether it's July 2,
Aug. 7 or April 5, every day's a personal challenge to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the specific position the Yankees were in, Girardi said:
``How often do you get in that position? You can only go from the
experiences you've had. We've been down before and we've come back.
You don't always play a seven-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Girardi added, ``The series probably most like this
during the course of the season was the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a man who understands his environment. He didn't
graduate from Northwestern having gained academic all-America
honors three times for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The interleague series with the New York Mets was back in June.
When the Yankees traveled to Queens for the start of the series,
they had a 10-game division lead, had just defeated the Braves
three times in a four-game series and had a 53-19 record.
</P>
<P>
   A loss here and there would not intrude on their inexorable
march toward posterity, but the Yankees were playing the Mets and
they could not lose the series. Winning two of three was mandatory,
or they would incur the George Steinbrenner version of being
banished to bed without dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So facing this creative form of adversity, this kind of
challenge, the Yankees responded by winning the first two games.
That they lost the third game was immaterial, just as their losses
in Games 2 and 3 of the league series would be immaterial if they
won three of the next four games.
</P>
<P>
   The order isn't important as long as the Yankees win the last
game they and the Indians play. For the moment, though, approaching
Saturday night's game, they were teetering on the brink of the
critical list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time all year we've got our backs against the
door, other than that first week of the season,'' said Shane
Spencer, the rookie home run hitter whose 15 minutes of fame seemed
to have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, that door could be a trapdoor, the one Joe Torre
was thought in danger of dropping through after the Yankees lost
the first three games of the season. Sure, the idea that Torre
could be fired at that juncture was silly, but it was the owner's
history that generated the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   What Steinbrenner would do should the Yankees not overcome the
Indians' 2-1 lead is a vision no one should want to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing with pressure over our heads all year,''
Chuck Knoblauch said. ``We've lost two, three games in a row
before. This team is full of strength and great focus. We'll come
out strong tomorrow and concentrate on winning. We've got to come
right back like we've done all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tried to do a good job of buoying themselves. They
would not even allow themselves to think they could possibly lose
the series, but for the first time they used the words ``must
win,'' as in, as Paul O'Neill said, ``We haven't had a must-win in
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yankees been in a must-win situation this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say so, yeah,'' O'Neill said. ``The first game of every
playoff you play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But no player preparing for a playoff opener has ever been heard
muttering ``must win.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill also said Game 4 would be ``a bigger game for us than it
is for them,'' but the Indians needed to win the game to maintain
their advantage. A Cleveland loss would put the Yankees in at least
a psychologically advantageous position, because the series would
be tied and the schedule would give the Yankees two of the last
three games at home.
</P>
<P>
   When Tino Martinez, he with the 0-for-13 batting record so far
in the series, talked Friday night about Game 4, he first referred
to it as ``almost a must-win game.'' But a minute later, in
response to a question, he said: ``Yeah, tomorrow's must-win. You
got to win tomorrow to even the series and to get the momentum
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Martinez added, know how to bounce back. If they do
know, they didn't learn it this year. After their 0-3 start, the
Yankees did not lose more than two games in a row until they had a
nearly 20-game lead with five weeks to play.

OFFICER WHO RODE ON RACIST FLOAT IS FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Police Commissioner Howard Safir dismissed
Police Officer Joseph Locurto on Saturday for wearing blackface and
an Afro wig on a float in a Labor Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my considered decision that Police Officer Joseph
Locurto does not deserve to wear the shield of a New York police
officer and should, in fact, be dismissed,'' the commissioner said
in a prepared statement, adding that the officer's ``racist
behavior set a very poor and reprehensible example which brought
shame on the New York City Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which follows the recommendation of a Police
Department judge, ends for now the 30-year-old officer's career
with the department, though he may still appeal the administrative
decision before the Southern District of the federal court.
</P>
<P>
   One of Locurto's lawyers, Norman Siegel, the executive director
of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said he would continue to
fight for his client before that court, noting that the thrust of
Safir's ruling was expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a surprise,'' Siegel said, ``because the mayor
said that he would be fired, and the handwriting was on the wall.''
He added that he had spoken with his client, who was out of town,
and had explained how he would proceed. ``Officer Locurto is
disappointed that he will not get back to work,'' Siegel said.
``But we are confident that the federal court will vindicate our
client on First Amendment and due process grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, a four-year veteran of the department, was one of a
dozen men who donned blackface and Afro wigs while riding on a
float in Broad Channel, Queens, during the neighborhood's annual
Labor Day parade last month.
</P>
<P>
   The float, titled ``Black to the Future: 2098,'' featured
Locurto, two city firefighters and several of their friends from
Broad Channel in similar costume, sometimes eating fried chicken
from buckets and other times throwing watermelon to the surrounding
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the parade, one of the men also re-enacted the
killing in June of James Byrd, a black man who was dragged to death
behind a pickup truck in Texas. Three white men have been indicted
on capital murder charges in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Like Locurto, the two firefighters, Jonathan Walters and Robert
Steiner, both 29, were suspended from their jobs following the
parade. They are awaiting a decision on their fate, expected later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Safir said that the officer
would be fired, and the officers union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, at first refused to represent him during his
departmental hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the politics surrounding the case, Siegel said the
decision to fire his client ``demonstrated the self-righteous
hypocrisy'' of the mayor and the police commissioner, who ``in the
name of racial sensitivity are firing someone who was off duty, out
of uniform, has an unblemished record and who testified truthfully
throughout departmental proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the decision is utterly baffling and irrational,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Locurto's lawyers argued during his hearing last week that their
client had been prejudged by the commissioner, that the punishment
did not fit the crime and that his participation on the float was
protected as free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to fire Locurto, Safir agreed with the judge, who
dismissed those arguments, saying that the ``egregiousness'' of the
officer's misconduct had done a ``tremendous disservice to this
organization and the people of New York City.''

FRED GRUBEL, 89, WHO HEADED JEWISH RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Grubel, who as executive director of the Leo
Baeck Institute expanded the organization into a respected
historical research center for the study of German-speaking Jewry,
died Oct. 4 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 89 and lived in
Riverdale, the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Grubel had worked until three years ago when, his family said,
failing health forced him to give up the position he had held for
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The institute was first conceived after World War II at a
meeting in the Jerusalem apartment of philosopher Martin Buber, and
was named for Leo Baeck, the Reform rabbi and theologian who, as
head of the National Agency of Jews in Germany, struggled to
protect Germany's Jews against intensifying Nazi oppression in the
1930s. Baeck, who became a symbol for German Jewry in its agony,
was among those liberated from the Theresienstadt concentration
camp in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Baeck died in London in 1956, the institute was
set up with branches in London, Jerusalem and New York for the
purpose of promoting the study of Jewish life. In the 1960s the New
York branch acquired a mansion at 129 E. 73rd St., and under
Grubel's leadership its archives and library were expanded,
attracting such prominent historians as Fritz Stern, Peter Gay and
Peter Demetz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Grubel's accomplishment,'' said Carol Kahn Strauss, the
current executive director, ``was that he turned the institute into
an international research facility that provided material not only
on the period since 1933, when Jews virtually perished under the
Nazis, but also on the long period when German-speaking Jews were
so significantly involved in European history.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubel was already 60 years old when he took over as executive
director in 1968. From childhood in his native Leipzig, he had
wanted to study and teach history, but according to his daughter
Lucille Goldsmith, he was thwarted in this ambition by anti-Semitic
quotas and turned instead to the study of law. But as he was
completing his law studies he was expelled from his university
under Nazi laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Grubel became the director of the Jewish community of
Leipzig, a position that brought him together with Baeck. It also
brought him in tense contact with the Gestapo, which was then
imposing greater and greater restrictions on Jews. In 1938, he was
sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp for six months.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before the outbreak of the war, Grubel obtained a
British visa that enabled him and his wife, Lisa, and their infant
son, Henry, to emigrate to Britain. For two years, both husband and
wife worked as domestic servants in a parsonage until 1940, when
they were able to enter the United States as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   After studying business and accounting, Grubel worked as an
accountant for the Joint Distribution Committee, an amalgam of
Jewish relief organizations. At the end of the war, he traveled
through much of ravaged Europe, monitoring assistance for displaced
persons. He later worked as a certified accountant at Maimonides
and Montefiore hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1968 that he attained his youthful dream,
working to promote historical research. In his time at the
institute, the library grew to 60,000 volumes, becoming one of the
largest collections anywhere concerning German Jews. Officials and
scholars in Germany and the rest of the world increasingly visited
the institute, less as a shrine than as a living and valuable
resource.
</P>
<P>
   Grubel also played a role in organizing the publication of a
four- volume work from the institute in German whose translated
title is ``German Jewish History in Today's World.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by Ms. Goldsmith
and another daughter, Eva Fischer, both of New York City, six
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

every week. Then tragedy hit. Neil Bonnett and Davey Allison were
killed; Bobby Allison suffered severe head injuries in a wreck, and
the small racing town of Hueytown, Ala., never was the same. For
years, people in the state tried unsuccessfully to carry on the
tradition. And now, the Allisons and Farmer remain connected to

 &HT;    Just a matter of time until OU boots Blake
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The team's best quarterback is throwing passes some 10
hours and another football classification away for Division I-AA
Murray State. The wishbone offense implemented in the spring has
been junked. Its three best offensive linemen were injured last
week, two of them out for the season. The losing streak is two in a
row and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on as usual at the University of Oklahoma, if you can
call this living.
</P>
<P>
   Most Sooners fans would not, which is why they are bracing
themselves for the worst after the ugliest back-to-back seasons in
school history _ 4-8 and 3-8. Three years into the rebuilding era
under first-time head coach John Blake, OU doesn't seem anywhere
nearer to being a finished product than it was when it fired Howard
Schnellenberger after one desultory season in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only thing close to meeting a construction schedule
was Blake's lavish, just-completed, $598,000 home in northwest
Norman. Many north of the Red River feel the 36-year-old head coach
made his bed, but he might be allowed to live in it only another
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The book on Blake is he'll be looking for work after the season
finale against Texas Tech on Nov. 21 even though he has two years
left on a five-year deal paying him about $575,000. Critics would
call him the Gerry Faust of Oklahoma but for fear of insulting the
former deposed coach of Notre Dame. Blake could be the worst hire
in college football history.
</P>
<P>
   The line to succeed the 20th head coach at OU will form behind
Tulane's hot commodity Tommy Bowden and Georgia's Jim Donnan, a
former Sooners offensive coordinator who has been bypassed for the
OU job three times and never been interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern's Gary Barnett might have taken the job if Oklahoma
only had been willing to wait until after the 1995 Rose Bowl to
make a decision, and he might be interested again. There's even the
annual Lou Holtz sighting when it comes to head coaching
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak Blake situation at OU couldn't be any more
diametrically opposed to Mack Brown's rose-petaled foundation at
Texas. Quite simply, while Brown is the second coming of Darrell
Royal, OU just wishes Blake would go.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has unified every UT faction, healed any divisiveness
created by his predecessor, made tremendous recruiting strides and
is riding an early crest of goodwill and even better coaching moves
that have endeared him to Longhorns everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, on the other hand, has been vilified for lying to the
media, alienating some high school coaches, failing to have a clue
on offense and just not having the organizational or communication
skills necessary to lead a program.
</P>
<P>
   Writers say Blake has rubdowns during office hours, rarely held
staff meetings last year and quit talking to his starting
quarterback at midseason. Last recruiting season, OU courted two
dropback passers and two option quarterbacks. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Blake has ditched the wishbone, claiming star tailback De'Mond
Parker can't block well enough even though his blocking has never
been highly regarded. Blake ran off quarterback Justin Fuente, who
this season has passed for 1,448 yards and 14 touchdowns for the
4-1 Murray State Racers. The revolving door continues at
quarterback, but split end Eric Moore moved back to quarterback and
could be a surprise under center today.
</P>
<P>
   After Berry Tramel's column in The Daily Oklahoman railed on
Blake's stupid decisions but stopped short of calling for his head,
more than 150 e-mails that arrived a day later were running 4-to-1
against Blake. Future schedules bring games with Notre Dame, UCLA
and Alabama, and Nebraska and Kansas State return in the Big 12
rotation in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What really cuts Oklahomans to the quick was their inability to
lure Brown to Norman as Gary Gibbs' successor after the 1994
season. Then-athletic director Donnie Duncan felt he had the North
Carolina coach all but signed until Watson Brown, Gibbs' offensive
coordinator, intervened and begged his brother not to ruin his own
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mack gentlemanly bowed out in deference to Watson, and for
Sooners fans the rest is misery.
</P>
<P>
   Since OU turned to Howard Schnellenberger in a disaster that was
compounded by the hiring of Barry Switzer's hand-picked choice of
Blake, the bowl-less Sooners have won only 14 of the last 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   Over that same span in North Carolina and Texas, Mack Brown's
squads boast a 30-12 record. His last three North Carolina teams
went to bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have finished in the Top 25 three of the last four
years. The Sooners can't claim a Top 25 finish since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, sitting at 2-2 with only one team with a losing record
among its final seven opponents, almost certainly has to win six
games and probably beat Texas or Oklahoma State or both to save his
job. Won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   After Texas' 34-24 win today, OU will get that much closer to
realizing its mistake and doing something to correct it.

 &HT;    Golf makers around the globe link up at Austin trade show
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don't call them a bag of sticks.
</P>
<P>
   At least not this weekend, when more than 600 custom golf club
makers from 41 states and 10 countries _ folks who go by names such
as Jack the Gripper and the King of Clubs _ are in town for the
10th annual Golf Clubmakers Association International hosted by
Austin-based manufacturer Golfsmith International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin conference, which runs through Monday, is the world's
largest annual event for golf club makers.
</P>
<P>
   Participants are in town for classes such as ``The Cardinal
Rules of Club Fitting'' and ``New Realizations of Shaft Fitting.''
They'll get to see the test results from a Golfsmith swing robot.
There's a trade show and hands-on technical demonstrations. And of
course, like any conference, there's a golf tournament, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Golfsmith is widely known for its 23 golf superstores
in the United States and Canada, the company got its start in 1967
as a club component company. Founders Carl and Barbara Paul sold
the club parts out of their two-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For 31 years, Golfsmith has assembled golf components and
shipped them to 90 countries, evolving into the largest mail-order
supplier of golf equipment and accessories in the world. The
company ships thousands of orders a day from its
190,000-square-foot headquarters at 11000 N. Interstate 35, making
it is one of United Parcel Service's largest Central Texas
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our retail business has been in the news, the
component side of the business is still very important to us,''
Nancy Nesbitt, spokeswoman for Golfsmith, said of the weekend's
conference. ``We're getting back to our roots.''

MIRACLE IN MASSACHUSETTS QUALIFIED STEIN FOR SAINTHOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
   The miracle that qualified Edith Stein for sainthood began with
the kind of thoroughly avoidable childhood accident that haunts the
imagination of every conscientious parent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when Benedicta McCarthy was 2 and a half years old, her
parents left her for a few days at her home in Brockton, Mass.,
with her 11 older siblings, the eldest of whom was 20. Unseen by
her brothers and sisters, Benedicta discovered the family's cache
of free Tylenol samples in colorful plastic packets, and took them
for candy.
</P>
<P>
   When her siblings noticed that Benedicta was acting strangely,
they took her to the local hospital, where doctors discovered that
she had swallowed enough Tylenol to amount to 16 lethal doses.
</P>
<P>
   Benedicta's parents, arriving home, learned that their little
pigtailed daughter was in a coma, her liver and kidneys failing,
her body suffering a staphylococcus infection.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthy family decided it was time to tell everyone they
knew to begin praying to Edith Stein to intercede with God to save
Benedicta's life.
</P>
<P>
   Benedicta had been named for Edith Stein, the Jewish philosopher
who was killed in Auschwitz as Sister Teresia Benedicta, the name
she took when she converted to Catholicism and became a nun.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthys, educated intellectuals and committed pacifists,
had named many of their children for martyrs and thinkers they
admired. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy had left the legal profession to
become a Catholic priest in the Melkite Church, which allows
priests to marry. Mary McCarthy schooled her children at home. They
had a room of their house turned into a chapel, and when the
children were young the family had said the rosary together every
day. With Benedicta deathly ill, a chain of people praying to Edith
Stein spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Benedicta walked out of the hospital totally
recovered, carrying a red balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was a miracle,'' said Dr. Ronald Kleinman,
who treated her at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an interview
last year. ``I'm saying it was miraculous. I'm Jewish. I don't
believe per se in miracles, but I can say I didn't expect her to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthys say they did not wish to publicize the incident,
but the Catholic newspaper in Maine heard about it and wrote an
article. Eventually Roman Catholic Church officials sent a team to
investigate whether Benedicta's recovery could be legitimately
declared a miracle attributable to Edith Stein. As a final step,
they brought Kleinman to the Vatican where, he says, Italian
doctors and members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints
interrogated him for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most children who swallow huge doses of Tylenol do not become
deathly ill, but Kleinman said he had to explain that Benedicta's
case was unusually dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a Catholic doctor,'' said the Rev. Kieran Kavanaugh,
a Carmelite priest who helped investigate Benedicta's case in
Brockton, ``people would think it was something he just dreamed up.
Kleinman's willingness to give testimony and witness, to me that
was a miracle in itself. He had to go and convince all these
Italian doctors, and it wasn't an easy case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when Edith Stein is canonized a saint, Benedicta, her
parents and her 11 siblings will all be at the Mass in St. Peter's.
So will Kleinman and the three nurses who had cared for Benedicta
at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Edith Stein's canonization says to me,'' Benedicta's
father said in a telephone interview minutes before leaving with
his family for Rome, ``is that in the end, evil doesn't win. In the
end, God prevails, God is victor.''

STEWART HAS THE KNACK, BUT HE WANTS AN OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Almost from the moment Dave Stewart retired from the
mound three years ago after pitching for 21 seasons _ and took the
most intimidating scowl in baseball with him _ all the former
four-time 20-game winner has ever wanted to be is a major league
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart is caught in something of a Catch-22 these days:
Because he has been so successful as the pitching coach of the San
Diego Padres this season, he could be excused for fearing that
nobody will give him the chance to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are going to say, `This guy's a great
pitching coach, this guy's got a knack for working with pitchers.'
'' Stewart said Saturday, as the upstart Padres held a surprising
2-games-to-0 lead in the National League Championship Series over
the heavily favored Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hope someone will give me the opportunity to show that I
can be successful at a different level.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that sort of thinking that led general manager Kevin
Towers to ask Stewart if he would consider becoming the Padres
pitching coach in the first place. Stewart, now 41, did not have
any prior coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we needed to address our pitching staff and add a
certain presence to help some of these young pitchers grow,''
Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had some great arms, but that they were
underachieving, not physically, but mentally. And Stew was a guy we
already had internally in the front office. I thought he would be
the perfect guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers knew about Stewart's desire to be a general manager. So,
the question is, why would Stewart, who has no managerial
aspirations, put a uniform back on?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking for the right reasons I can do this,'' Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can help the ball club win, I can help the organization and
I can teach. But I don't see my future on the field. At the ball
park, I love it. But when I'm off the field, I wish I was in my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said he initially hired Stewart, who was a member of the
Oakland Athletics organization, because of his networking
abilities, his background in the game and his numerous contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still utilize him the same way,'' Towers said. ``All I
have to do is walk down to the clubhouse. I have the best of both
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart knows he has made a strong first impression. Now he
wants the chance to make a name for himself in a major league front
office _ where there is still a dearth of minority general
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are no minorities, it should be something
that will help me,'' said Stewart, who is black. ``Whether it's
unfair, I don't know. I just think there should be more minorities
in decision-making positions and more opportunities for minorities
to interview for decision-making positions. And not just on the
field, where it doesn't seem like a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Stewart has helped turn around an
underachieving pitching staff. The Padres' 3.63 ERA _ the
third-best in the National League this season _ was more than a run
lower than last season's franchise-high 4.99. In fact, the 1998
Padres seem to have taken on the personality of Stewart and the
staff ace Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between him and Brown, I think the pitching staff finally
developed a true identity,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, a cross between mean and nasty on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart plays down his influence. ``The most important thing
about my job is to make sure the guys are motivated and focused,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't teach intensity,'' Stewart continued. ``What you do
is lay out a blueprint. They see the results and become that on
their own.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stewart has been able to teach is his philosophy: which
begins with pitching on the inside part of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I asked is take a part of the plate and make that part
your own,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy Koufax always said make that bat small. It makes you
pitch to the short end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, led by their starters Brown, Andy Ashby, Joey
Hamilton and Sterling Hitchcock, have outpitched the
heavily-favored Braves over the first two games of this series. And
they outpitched the favored Houston Astros to win their
three-of-five division series in four games. Stewart's pitchers
have limited the opposition to two runs or fewer in five of their
six post-season games thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how much of an impact he's had on the staff
over the last year,'' said Sterling Hitchcock of Stewart. ``But I
think he's had a huge impact. I think everybody has learned a
little something from Stew this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that include his ace?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do with Kevin Brown is let him alone,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fork ball is the only thing I worked with him on. He's an
independent broker, man. You don't need to mess with him. Brownie
had an attitude of his own. Everyone has their own personal
attitude. But as a staff, I think we've formed an identity of our
own. I don't know if it's mine. But we're pretty tough on
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   And uncomfortable, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncomfortable?'' Stewart said, the corners of his mouth barely
betraying a grin. ``Yes.''

EDITORIAL: COPING WITH ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The world's economic situation is perilous, and there is little
doubt that there will be pain and suffering in many countries
during the next few years. But the problems need not lead to world
recession, let alone depression. With time and wisdom, the problems
can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering in Washington of the world's financial leaders
last week proved to be long on alarming rhetoric and short on
action. The dismal forecasts contrasted sharply with what the
visiting central bankers and finance ministers could see around
them in a prosperous country where it is lies, not layoffs, that
dominate the news. But the United States is beginning to feel
effects of the Asian collapse, particularly in manufacturing, and
has reason to worry as Latin American economies are damaged by high
interest rates imposed to slow the exodus of foreign investors.
Similarly, Western Europe's export-led growth is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy _ and partly correct _ to blame market excesses for
the problem. Investors poured money into emerging markets with
little concern for risk, and then fled when the Asian crisis and
Russia's default led to large losses.
</P>
<P>
   Only now are we learning the extent that leverage _ that is,
borrowed money _fueled the great bull market of the 1990s. The
collapse of John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital hedge fund opened
eyes, and there are likely to be more surprises, and failures, as
the leverage is unwound. That means financial markets probably will
continue to have a bumpy ride, but in some ways this is good news.
Much of the leverage came from speculators borrowing Japanese yen
and investing the money in other countries. Now those yen are being
repaid, pushing up the value of the yen and easing the pressure on
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no magic wands, and the process will be slow,
necessary steps to protect the world economy have emerged.
Pro-growth policies will be needed in Europe and the United States.
Central banks will have to lower interest rates, and major
countries may have to cut taxes or raise spending to provide fiscal
stimulus. Fiscal reforms are required in Latin America,
particularly in Brazil. Countries that had relied on overseas
investors to finance large trade and budget deficits must deal with
a newly hostile investment climate.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate resources must be provided for the International
Monetary Fund. With private capital running scared, the role of
public money is all the more important. Some of it will be needed
to alleviate suffering in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries that have tied their currencies to the dollar
will have to let them float. There are advantages to fixed exchange
rates, but over time they can create imbalances that lead to big _
and unforeseen _ currency moves that can devastate economies and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Japan, which has fallen into a deep recession, must
reform its banking system and stimulate its economy. But even if
Japan makes the necessary changes, it will take years for its
financial system to recover from a mountain of bad loans, and
growth may be sluggish. The world will have to get along without a
Japanese engine.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are some policy prescriptions that
should be avoided. The United States is running a huge trade
deficit, as exports to Asia fall. There are cries for
protectionism, particularly in steel and agriculture, that must be
resisted. The trade deficit is a major reason that the dollar has
started to decline, a fall that will help to ameliorate the problem
over time.
</P>
<P>
   A weaker dollar can lead to higher reported inflation. If it
does, that will not be a good reason for the Federal Reserve to
back off from trying to stimulate the economy. It is deflation, not
inflation, that threatens the world now, and that will not change
until low commodity prices begin to move up in a convincing way.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting for countries that have been buffeted by
international capital flows to adopt capital controls, and they
conceivably could help by giving a country breathing room. But they
will work only if the countries involved use the respite to pursue
good policies. That does not seem to be happening in Malaysia,
whose government appears more interested in repression than reform.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about markets going to excess, with bouts
of unreasoned enthusiasm followed by equally illogical fear. World
growth in the mid-1990s was pumped up artificially by floods of
capital into countries and companies that were ill equipped to
handle them. Now world growth is likely to be held back by fearful
investors and by stringent credit standards imposed by banks newly
concerned about the risk of loss. That is unfortunate, but it is
something that can be dealt with if countries pursue
growth-oriented strategies.
</P>
<P>
   It is obviously true that market failures were a prime cause of
the world's problems, and improved regulatory mechanisms should be
sought. But no one should forget the benefits that markets have
brought to world growth, and will bring again when investor fear
subsides. A return to allowing governments to allocate capital
would be no improvement. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, markets
are the worst way to allocate capital _ except all those other ways
that have been tried from time to time.

RULING MAY HURT CAMPAIGN FINANCE CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision that could seriously undercut the
Justice Department's campaign finance prosecutions, a federal judge
has ruled that the department misinterpreted election laws that
restrict contributions by foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Paul Friedman of U.S.
District Court, appeared to threaten the department's effort to
investigate fund-raisers, Democratic Party officials and White
House aides for their role in soliciting millions of dollars from
overseas contributors in the 1996 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's order came as part of the pretrial skirmishing in the
case of Yah Lin Trie, a former Little Rock restaurateur and
longtime friend of President Clinton who became an important
Democratic fund-raiser and brought in hundreds of thousand of
dollars, much of it, congressional investigators say, from his
business contacts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Friedman found that the law, which bars foreign
nationals from contributing to federal elections, applies only to
hard money contributions. These are regulated by federal election
law and can be used to finance campaign activities that directly
benefit candidates for federal office.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that the contribution law permits foreign
nationals to make donations known as soft money, which is money
that cannot be spent on behalf of candidates like hard money, but
may be spent on generic party activities, like paying for state
party efforts or advertisements focused on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman wrote that the government argued that the federal limit
on foreign contributions ``applies to soft money donations as well
as to hard money contributions.'' But the judge added, ``The court
disagrees.'' He concluded that ``the statute does not on its face
therefore proscribe soft money donations by foreign nationals or
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not dismiss any counts related to soft money, but
said that the government would be required to prove in Trie's
trial, scheduled to begin on Feb. 1, that overseas contributions
were deposited into hard money accounts. His decision suggested
that prosecutors would also be forced to prove that fund-raisers
who solicited the contributions knew that the donations would be
divided between soft and hard accounts, a potentially
insurmountable hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said Saturday that lawyers were
considering an appeal of the decision, which was first reported
Saturday by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's order was the second ruling in a month to attack the
government's approach. Earlier, Friedman dismissed five of six
counts against another Democratic fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, accusing
the government of an ``Alice in Wonderland'' interpretation of the
law because of an indictment charging her with causing campaign
committees to make false statements. Friedman also dismissed three
similar counts against Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Friedman's rulings in the Trie and Hsia cases
represent a potentially serious judicial setback for the Justice
Department. The judge's order could affect other pending cases like
one against Pauline Kanchanalak, a Thai entrepreneur who has been
accused of bringing in nearly $700,000 in possibly suspect
donations to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the rulings underscore the difficulty confronting
prosecutors in trying to bring criminal cases using election laws
that the judge has said were intentionally engineered by Congress
to be weak and permit the kind of excesses at the heart of the
campaign finance case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they were feeling trapped
between Friedman and Republicans in Congress, who have assailed
Attorney General Janet Reno, not for bringing legally flawed cases,
but for failing to aggressively prosecute cases involving
higher-ups at the Democratic Party and the White House and for her
refusal to ask an independent prosecutor to take over the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Trie seemed to typify the kind of fund-raiser that Republicans
said corrupted Democratic fund-raising. When questions about the
source of his contributions surfaced after the election, the
Democratic National Committee returned $645,000 that Trie raised,
concluding that the money came from questionable or possibly
illegal overseas sources. Clinton's legal defense fund also
returned $640,000 contributed by Trie.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Justice Department prosecutors obtained a 14-count
indictment against Trie, accusing him of illegally making
contributions reimbursed by wealthy overseas donors, setting up
fictitious donors who made contributions financed by overseas
nationals and conspiring to conceal the identities of donors.

EDITORIAL: THE SURGE IN TEEN SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
show that teen smoking rates are soaring. In 1988, 700,000
teen-agers under 18 became daily smokers. Less than a decade later,
in 1996, the number of teens who became daily smokers had risen to
1.2 million. Two-thirds of the people who took up daily smoking
that year were under the age of 18. These grim numbers show just
how successful the tobacco industry has been in making its products
attractive to the high school set.
</P>
<P>
   This disastrous trend will not reverse itself without strong
curbs on tobacco marketing and sharp increases in cigarette prices,
two strategies that health experts say are crucial to reducing
youth consumption. But the Republican Congress, unwilling to break
free of the well-financed tobacco lobby, refused to approve
legislation this year that would have used these strategies.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative deal negotiated by some state attorneys general with
the tobacco companies to settle state lawsuits against the industry
also appears inadequate to combat teen smoking. Early reports
suggest that the settlement would require the industry to pay more
than $200 billion to the states over 25 years, but this would not
necessarily translate into higher per-pack prices. The biggest
manufacturers may simply absorb the new costs rather than drive
away their youngest customers. Billboard ads and promotional gifts
would be banned, but advertising with figures like the Marlboro
Man, which are popular with teen-agers, would still be allowed.
Given the new data on smoking rates, any deal accepted by the
attorneys general must make reducing teen smoking its primary goal.

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: PRESIDENT CLINTON'S NEW BEST FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early in this election season, a consultant for New
York City Council speaker Peter Vallone used a focus group to test
Vallone's potential as a gubernatorial candidate. Kevin McCabe,
Vallone's top aide, reported that the focus group initially felt
the speaker was ``a nice guy who'd been around too long.'' But,
McCabe added triumphantly, once shown extensive information on
Vallone's accomplishments, the group saw the error of its ways and
announced that he was an excellent public official who just needed
more publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Grasping onto reeds like this, and with the faithful McCabe at
his side, Vallone jumped into the race. But cynics have always had
doubts about that focus group _ mainly because it seemed
extraordinary that there were that many average citizens in New
York who knew enough about Peter Vallone to feel they were tired of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, it appears
that virtually the only people in the state familiar with Vallone
were the ones in that group. A month before the November election,
49 percent of the respondents in a New York Times/CBS News Poll
said they did not know anything about Vallone. Twenty-eight percent
claimed to know enough to have an opinion but did not know exactly
what that opinion was. This is no way to win an election, and sure
enough, Vallone is trailing the incumbent, George Pataki, by about
28 points. ``We got Pataki where we want him,'' cried McCabe, who
has a well-honed, if occasionally dark, sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   All of which gets us to Vallone's ads, in which he becomes
perhaps the first post-Lewinsky candidate in the country to wrap
himself around Bill Clinton. ``I think it's time someone stood up
for President Clinton,'' the candidate tells the camera, urging the
Republicans to let Clinton alone ``for the good in our hearts and
for the good of our country.'' (The last part was written by
Vallone himself, a sweet-natured man who is not exactly a
phrasemaker.) But the main message is that Pataki, in concert with
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Republicans in general, is ``determined to
bring the president down, even if it means hurting the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors do not actually have a whole lot to do with the
impeachment process, and it is unlikely that the president has
Pataki on his enemies list. On a pure issue level, Vallone might
just as well do ads on Japan's banking crisis. But his strategy
does make some political sense. For Vallone, anything that attracts
attention is a help. ``If people don't want to listen about tax
reform and health care, you have to get in the game somehow,'' says
McCabe.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's Democrats worry that their voters will be
too disheartened to vote this November while the Republican core
skips happily to the polls. But New York, as usual, is not quite
the rest of the country. In the dead-heat race between D'Amato and
Rep. Charles Schumer, the Times poll suggested that supporters of
Schumer, the Democrat, were the more energized. Clinton's approval
ratings in New York reveal a level of enthusiasm normally
associated with military victories rather than sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's other ads attack Pataki's reluctance to debate. That
is a tried-and-true tactic for challengers, but a rather
problematic one for Vallone, who is not what you would call a
verbal wizard. As a public speaker, he is best known for his
tendency to stop whatever he is saying to welcome each new person
who comes into the room. Vallone has big issues, like ethics,
campaign finance and debt reduction, but he has apparently decided
TV viewers would be more interested in Clinton and the fact that
Pataki declines to come out and fight.
</P>
<P>
   The world of the 28-points-behind gubernatorial candidate can be
a pretty depressing one, particularly if that candidate is strapped
for money. The options come down to leaving town (as one of Gov.
Mario Cuomo's opponents once did) or soldiering onward and hoping
that some unanticipated disaster befalls Pataki in his rose garden.
Vallone, who is an old pro, is sticking to business. ``He's like
Karl Malden as opposed to Robert Redford, but he's still very
confident,'' said McCabe.

 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. _ For Sunday's Chicago Marathon, where he has a
chance for a repeat victory and a world record, Khalid Khannouchi
will follow a familiar ritual.
</P>
<P>
   First, he will slip on a ring bearing the likeness of a dolphin.
The ring was given to him by his wife and coach, Sandra, who
believes that dolphins bring good luck. She keeps dolphin good-luck
charms all over the house: dolphin plates, dolphin figurines,
dolphin sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Khannouchi will give her husband a kiss at the start, and
then she will run a short portion of the 26.2-mile race. Maybe a
couple of miles. Once she was a serious runner herself, but now she
runs with her husband more for ceremony than for achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to see me there; it calms him down and makes him feel
better,'' she said. ``It sounds stupid, but we don't want to
change. Why break something that's been working?''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in his first marathon, Khalid Khannouchi won Chicago
in 2 hours 7 minutes 10 seconds, then the fourth-fastest time in
history. His was a classic immigrant's tale. He had come from
Morocco to Brooklyn four years earlier, washing dishes in a
restaurant, training after midnight on potholed streets, determined
to make it as a world-class runner.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping out of a race in Hartford in 1995, he sought a
ride home and got one from the woman who would become his coach,
his agent, his masseuse, his nutritionist and his wife. And after
Chicago, he became an international star who hoped to gain his U.S.
citizenship in time to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that Khannouchi, 27, will run for the United
States in Sydney, given the strict requirements for obtaining
citizenship. And setting a world record on the fast Chicago course
this weekend has become considerably more challenging. On Sept. 20,
Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil lowered the record by a stunning 45
seconds, to 2:06:05 from 2:06:50, by running the second half of the
Berlin Marathon in a searing 1:01:23 after running the first half
in 1:04:42.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa lowered his personal best by three full minutes in that
race. Sandra Khannouchi said she wondered if the Berlin course was
accurately measured. Khalid Khannouchi said he was happy for da
Costa but surprised at the time, because the Brazilian had not
given much indication that he was ready to run that fast. He was
especially taken aback by da Costa's ability to run the second half
three minutes faster than he ran the first half. ``A lot of people
can run under 2:06:05, but I don't think anyone else is going to
run it that way,'' Khalid Khannouchi said. ``It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three other sub-2:08 marathoners running the flat,
inviting course in Chicago: Elijah Legat and Moses Tanui of Kenya
and Gert Thys of South Africa. If da Costa's time is daunting,
Khalid Khannouchi said, the others can take encouragement from the
fact that they have beaten him routinely in other road races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are thinking, `If da Costa can run 2:06, I can run
better,''' he said. ``I have run with him many times and I always
beat him by one or two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   To set a record, Khannouchi feels he must run the first half of
Chicago faster than the 1:04:10 he ran last year. He will be happy
if he finishes in 2:07 or better, Khannouchi said. Finishing first
is as important as finishing fast. He was stung last year by
remarks that his Chicago victory was somehow a fluke, that he was a
lucky rookie who hit a home run his first time at bat. ``I have an
opportunity to prove that it wasn't a fluke,'' Khannouchi said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last June, the Khannouchis moved out of Brooklyn to the quieter
streets of Ossining; Khalid trains in nearby Rockefeller State Park
Preserve, where the traffic travels on feet or hooves, not tires.
He enters the 1998 race with fewer races and fresher legs. Last
month, he set a world record for 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) of 57
minutes 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was a road racer who had to be coaxed into
running a marathon by his wife. Sandra Khannouchi is a former 2:42
marathon runner for her native Dominican Republic. She knew that
fast times were in her husband's legs before he did. Now that he is
a star, everybody is interested in him. Even the Moroccan track and
field federation.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi left his homeland because, he said, he was not
allowed to travel to important competitions. Now that officials
want him to represent Morocco, he is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have anything to do with them,'' Khannouchi
said.
</P>
<P>
   A onetime soccer player who did not begin running until he was
15 or 16, Khannouchi now dreams of running for the United States in
the 2000 Summer Games. However, he received his green card only
last month and must now wait three years before he is eligible for
citizenship. He is seeking congressional help, but the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has been reluctant to speed up
citizenship for someone simply because he is an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my dream,'' Khannouchi said. ``I want to do it for my
country. I got a lot of help and support here. I got my family

EXPERTS DISCUSS HOW THE ARTS CAN AID NEWARK, N.J. 
</HEADLINE>

   NEWARK, N.J. _ The arts saved Cleveland and Pittsburgh and they
can save Newark, too, participants in a conference at Rutgers
University were told Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, titled ``Arts Transforming the Urban
Environment,'' brought together experts from around the world to
discuss ways that cities can discover an identity, take pride in
their cultural attractions and find the money to rebuild and
revitalize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts have been on many minds in Newark in the year
since the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened
with the goal of reviving a city in a protracted physical, social
and economic decline. Because of ``Newark's large civic gamble on
the arts,'' as Annette Juliano, a professor of art history at
Rutgers, put it, the conference was organized to explore and learn
from other communities' efforts. The four-day conference is
sponsored by Rutgers and ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders from Cleveland and Pittsburgh described how
arts-related construction and arts districts had revitalized their
cities, and officials from Charleston, S.C., said the preservation
of that city's distinctive cultural heritage had sustained it. But
beyond the talk of bricks and mortar, there were insights into the
arts' less tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   South African artists described using art and culture to create
a ``nonthreatening zone'' in which blacks and whites could come
together in a still tense post-apartheid Johannesburg. Adolfo
Nodal, Los Angeles' general manager of cultural affairs, said the
introduction of a chamber music group into a crime-ridden park had
made it safer.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this role for art and artists is an old one, said
Trevor Phillips, chairman of the London Arts Board. He read
passages from Dickens' novels about the squalor of 19th-century
London and noted that the public outcry the novels had provoked had
led to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been romantic to see the artist as a marginal
figure in society,'' Phillips said, ``but they are at the center of
things. When we talk about culture, we are talking about all of the
artistic endeavor a people can muster to say where they have been,
what they are and where they are going.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one workshop, Lawrence Goldman, president of the Performing
Arts Center, said that in the past, growth of the arts and culture
followed economic development. But in the last 15 years, he said,
the order has been reversed in many cities. As generators of
revenue, centers like Newark's rank below sports stadiums in the
eyes of public officials, but that will change, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with stadiums, cultural centers are ``the bargain of
the century,'' said Art Falco, president of Cleveland's Playhouse
Square Foundation, which spent $55 million a decade ago to renovate
four historic but run-down theaters into a downtown arts district.
Falco said studies had shown that the city's arts sector in 1994
generated $165 million in revenues for the city, compared with $79
million from its sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Trust for Cultural Resources transformed that
city's red-light district with performance and gallery spaces, said
Carol Brown, president of the trust. According to a recent survey,
the new arts district, nestled on the banks of the Allegheny River,
draws up to 35 percent more visitors annually than the city's
sports arenas do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What this investment in the arts says about a society and its
people remains a crucial question, said Stanley Katz, director of
the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy at Princeton University.
Katz said he wondered whether large halls like Newark's were an
efficient way of accomplishing social goals like instilling an
appreciation for the arts in children, and whether efforts to
promote cultural tourism were good ways to invest public and
private funds in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question in the end,'' said Katz, ``is not so much
whether there is economic development, but whether there is civic
development and a move to a more civil society. What is the real
relationship between the jobs created and the building of a civil
society?''

NEGOTIATING LEAGUE LINEUPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., Md., Ill., Mich.)    (jw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Kevin Brown, who has been the most dominant pitcher
in the postseason, will be a free agent in a couple of weeks.
Baseball executives only shake their heads when they are asked what
they think he will get. Pedro Martinez, at $12.5 million a year, is
the highest-paid player at the moment. Start somewhere north of
that figure.
</P>
<P>
   With one run and eight hits allowed in three postseason starts,
Brown has pitched the San Diego Padres to the cusp of the World
Series. Whether he winds up staying with the Padres or going
elsewhere, the 33-year-old right-hander is expected to remain in
the National League.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, some executives believe, pitchers prefer the
National League over the American. Gene Budig, the AL president,
and his chief aide, Phyllis Merhige, shouldn't take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free-agent pitchers don't want to go to the American League,''
Doug Melvin, general manager of the Texas Rangers, said.
``Basically, it has to do with facing the designated hitter instead
of the pitcher. In the American League, you have Scott Brosius
driving in 98 runs batting ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NL, Melvin said, pitchers bat ninth and that makes the
No. 8 hitter ``someone you can pitch around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pitcher,'' he added, ``you have to look at that. I've
heard pitchers comment on how it's a mental grind to have to go
through an American League lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager, who previously
worked under Melvin in Texas, said NL parks, strike zones and
earned run averages also make the league more attractive.
Furthermore, he said, not only does the pitcher as batter make the
NL lineup easier to negotiate, but NL teams also often sacrifice
hitting for defense with their middle infielders so the lineup
becomes even less hazardous to pitchers' health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard pitchers often say they like the National League,''
Minaya said. ``Seeing the way Randy Johnson pitched, he must really
like the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson indeed will join Brown in the free-agent market. Al
Leiter will be in that group, too, unless the Mets cut him off at
the pass and re-sign him before he becomes a free agent. Whether he
remains with the Mets or goes elsewhere, Leiter is one of those who
prefers the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Not all pitchers opt for the NL, Leiter said, citing David Cone
and Roger Clemens as two who have stayed in the American. But he
noted that he and Clemens have the same agents, the Hendricks
brothers, and said, ``I tell Alan all the time, if Roger
experienced what National League baseball was all about, he'd want
to be there, too _ getting up to hit, bunting, playing creative
baseball. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who began his career in the AL, added, ``If they
actually experienced it, I can't imagine any pitcher choosing the
AL as long as you had equal deals or didn't have a family reason
for being somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And the presence of the pitcher in the lineup instead of the DH?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had arguments with other pitchers who don't believe it's
as important as I do,'' he said. ``I think it changes the dynamics
of a whole season. I'm not talking about the difference in two or
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facing Brosius instead of Leiter, second and third and Brosius
coming up, I better be careful. Second and third and the eighth
hitter coming up with the pitcher in the hole, I know what I can
do. That over the course of 200-plus innings can mean the
difference of 15 to 20 runs, and that can be the difference between
a 2.5 and a 3.1 ERA or a 3.1 and a 3.8.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter pitched with Brown on the Florida Marlins in 1996 and '97
_those Florida Marlins _ and has enjoyed watching Brown become the
dominant pitcher he has been with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's good, and he obviously has the numbers to back
him up,'' Leiter said. ``He's feeling comfortable about himself as
a person rather than listening to people saying he is an
underachiever and talk about these mental things that went with
him. Those things bogged him down a little bit. Now he knows he can
dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has a reputation of being difficult with managers and
players, but Leiter said, ``He's a pussy cat as far as I'm
concerned. He was one of the nicer guys on the team. He might say
some things that you wouldn't normally say, but if you get to know
him he's certainly able to take criticism and communicates well
enough to not get anyone teed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who became the Texas general manager just as Brown was
leaving there as a free agent, said the pitcher's attitude has
always been questioned but asked, ``Is it an attitude or a hungry
desire to win?''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies plan to find out firsthand. Several
baseball executives said they expect the Rockies to pursue Brown as
aggressively as any player has been pursued.  &QL;

A SIMILAR TALE  
 A BIPARTISAN PITCH

   Randy Johnson, meet Doyle Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was traded to Houston minutes before the trading
deadline July 31, then proceeded to compile a 10-1 record and a
1.28 ERA in 11 starts for the Astros, who won their division
championship. Johnson pitched four shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Alexander was traded to Detroit in mid-August, then
reeled off nine victories without a loss and posted a 1.53 ERA in
11 starts. He pitched three shutouts and gave up no runs in two
other starts totaling 15 innings. The Tigers, who were in second
place when they acquired Alexander from Atlanta, won all 11 of his
starts and edged Toronto for the division title
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs this year, Johnson allowed San Diego only three
earned runs in 14 innings but lost both of his starts as the Padres
won the division series.
</P>
<P>
   In the league championship series in 1987, Alexander also lost
twice, his near-perfect pitching punctured as he gave up 10 runs in
9 innings. The Tigers lost the series to the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   A BIPARTISAN PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Before the House of Representatives last week passed the Curt
Flood Act altering baseball's antitrust exemption, several members
spoke in favor of the bill. Among the speakers were Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., and John Conyers, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the last time this year Hyde and Conyers are
on the same side of an issue. Hyde is chairman and Conyers the
ranking Democrat of the House Judiciary Committee, which will spend
the rest of the year investigating whether or not there are grounds
for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIES OF BELANGER
</P>
<P>
   As a labor leader, David Cone said, Mark Belanger ``had a lot of
Marvin Miller in him.'' In labor circles anywhere, no one could pay
anyone a higher compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was executive director of the Major League Baseball
Players Association when Belanger first became involved with the
union as the alternate player representative for the Baltimore
Orioles in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the younger reps, at least in the beginning, would
be spectators,'' Miller said. ``Mark never was. He was an activist
at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, a union official since he retired as a player in 1982,
died last week at the age of 54. He lived through every work
stoppage baseball has had. No one else on the players' side was
involved in all five strikes and three lockouts as Belanger was as
a player and a union official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely conscientious,'' Miller recalled. ``Player
reps came in all sizes and shapes. This one was there when the
meeting opened and there when the meeting closed, actively asking
questions, making appropriate comments, being an active part of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He developed all along, and by the time we got to the 1980 and
'81 negotiations, he was remarkably valuable. He had a kind of feel
for all of the nuances of those negotiations as they went from one
phase to another and we knew a strike was inevitable. He was
completely reliable when you wanted honest feedback, when you
wanted to check your own reactions. That was a very valuable asset
when you're in a crisis mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger also was a very valuable asset to the Orioles as a
shortstop, the best defensively of his time. He harbored no false
modesty about his ability. Doyle Pryor, a union lawyer, recalled a
story that attested to Belanger's view.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he was telling Belanger one day about a shortstop he
had read about who was being touted as his team's shortstop of the
future. It'll never happen, Belanger said. Why not, Pryor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him play in spring training,'' Pryor said Belanger
replied. ``A ball went through his legs.''
</P>
<P>
   So? Pryor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened to me,'' Belanger said.

YANKS WIN AS TEAM, AND STRUGGLE AS TEAM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Yankees distinguished themselves with 114
victories during the regular season by pushing themselves hard
through otherwise meaningless games. They took the lowly Kansas
City Royals as seriously as they did the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity that worked so well for the Yankees for six
months has seemed to be working against them in the playoffs. Going
into Game 4 of the American League Championship Series here
Saturday night, they had fallen into their worst offensive slump of
the year, and their manager seemed convinced that at its core, the
trouble was that everybody was trying too hard. The Yankees had
just four hits in losing, 6-1, to the Cleveland Indians in Game 3
here Friday night, to fall behind by 2-1 in the four-of-seven-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure I'm concerned about us not swinging the bats,''
Manager Joe Torre said. ``Everybody is trying to do it themselves
because we are going through a little bit of a flat time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Yankees had not been through anything like this all
year. They had scored a total of two runs in Games 2 and 3, or one
fewer than they scored in any two-game span this season. After
scoring five runs in the first inning of Game 1 in this series, the
Yankees had managed just four runs in the last 28 innings, and were
batting .167 over all and .125 with runners in scoring position.
And their slump had roots more than a weeklong: They scored just
nine runs in three games of the Division Series against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have better at-bats, we need to put better swings
on pitches,'' said Joe Girardi, the Yankee catcher. ``When you get
in situations like this, guys tend to try to do a little bit too
much. You just need to get back to where you were and do what your
part is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Bartolo Colon finished with a four-hitter in Game 3,
allowing one run, but he was staggering through the first three
innings. He could not throw any of his breaking pitches for
strikes; he appeared uncomfortable and frustrated on the mound.
During the second inning, both Sandy Alomar, his catcher, and Mark
Wiley, the Indians' pitching coach, went to the mound to settle
him.
</P>
<P>
   But when the window of opportunity was open on Friday night, the
Yankees did not go through. They scored a run in the first inning
and Chili Davis led off the second with a walk, before Shane
Spencer worked Colon to a three-ball count. But Spencer swung
wildly at what appeared to be ball four, a collarbone-high
fastball; he eventually struck out, and instead of having runners
at first and second and no outs, the rally was stunted.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill walked with one out in the third, before Bernie
Williams grounded into a double play, the first of three turned by
the Indians. Cleveland scored four runs in the fifth inning, and
Colon started throwing all of his pitches for strikes, his fastball
reaching 98 mph in the ninth inning. And that was all. ``We got
some pitches to hit,'' Torre said, ``fouled them off and hit some
balls hard, but double plays played a big part in his success early
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees played the game as if they expected to struggle for
runs. Chuck Knoblauch led off the first inning with a single and
Derek Jeter then bunted, apparently on his own; all year, Torre has
told Jeter he does not want him sacrificing himself, but Jeter felt
compelled to push ahead a runner.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the second inning, Torre ordered the infield to
play in with the score tied at 1-1 and a runner at third base, a
sign that Torre was unwilling to trade an out for a run in the
early innings and intended to cut off every run possible.
</P>
<P>
   Torre suggested afterward that he would probably alter his
lineup for Game 4 Saturday night, and for starters it figured that
Spencer _ who was 1 for 10 in the series, his glass slippers at
least a little cracked _ would be replaced by either Chad Curtis or
Tim Raines in left field. But it was not as if just one or two
Yankees were struggling. Most of the regulars seemed to be fighting
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter challenged Williams for the lead in the American League's
batting race in early September, but as the end of the season drew
near, Jeter seemed intent on hitting his 20th homer. As Torre has
mentioned, Jeter's swing changed down the stretch: He was trying to
pull the baseball, rather than maintaining his usual approach of
driving the ball to the opposite field or through the middle. Jeter
went 1 for 9 against Texas in the Division Series before getting
two hits in Game 1 of this series, but he did not appear
comfortable at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was batting .333 in this series, 4 for 12, but he was
having difficultly keeping himself from chasing high fastballs out
of the strike zone when he batted left-handed. Williams started
slowly because of this tendency, and got hot when he stopped
chasing the high fastballs. The Yankees needed him to be more
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, the Yankees' first baseman, was mired deeply in a
funk from which it seemed he might never emerge in this
post-season. Martinez was hitless in 13 at-bats in the series, with
6 strikeouts, and there had been times in the first three games
when he appeared to have no clue as to what he wanted to do, and no
confidence that he would execute. Martinez is like Andy Pettitte:
The harder he tries, the worse he gets.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball executive watching the playoffs said that
Martinez's problems might start with his hands: In the past,
Martinez's hands were ``quiet,'' or very still. Now he was waggling
the bat as he waited for a pitch, a habit that might cause him to
start his swing an instant too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Raines is a disciplined hitter who usually has good at-bats, but
already Raines had four strikeouts in his first six at-bats in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a patient hitter who knows how to draw walks, work
pitchers and extend an inning, and with that approach, he can help
the Yankees' production _ so long as the hitters around him are
contributing. But with Williams and Martinez slumping ahead of him
and Spencer and the catchers' struggling behind him, Davis' walks
were benign.
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Darryl Strawberry's cancer was diagnosed, it
did not appear as if the Yankees would miss him on the field. After
all, Spencer was hitting, providing power, and Davis and Raines
have the experience to share time as the designated hitter. Now,
Torre probably would love to have Strawberry as an option, for his
big left-handed swing, for the potential of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Torre could have dropped Martinez in the lineup, but that might
have only added to Martinez's already phenomenal collection of
angst. Torre could have promoted Scott Brosius _ the Yankees' most
consistent hitter in the post-season _ into the middle of the
lineup, but Brosius moved higher in the lineup early in the year
and never seemed comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   What Torre likely would do, other than a change in lineup, was
wait for them to start hitting, for the leaders O'Neill and Jeter
to propel a breakout. ``We need to have fun,'' Torre said, knowing
full well that if the Yankees didn't, they could be home soon,
thinking about what might have been.

HARLEM PASTOR TO ENDORSE PATAKI, AIDES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Calvin Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem and a Democrat who has forged close ties
to Gov. George Pataki during the last four years, will endorse the
Republican governor's steamrolling drive for re-election on Sunday,
aides to Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been invited to address Butts' congregation at noon,
the aides said, and at a joint news conference afterward, Butts is
scheduled to announce his endorsement, the first of the governor's
campaign by a major black leader in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki has a 2-to-1 lead in the polls over his Democratic
rival, the New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, an
endorsement by Butts was regarded as a trophy for Pataki, whose
administration has financed several Harlem development projects
supported by the minister and his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the governor is extremely pleased,'' Zenia Mucha,
Pataki's spokeswoman, said of the endorsement, which was reported
Saturday by The New York Daily News. ``The governor's commitment to
Harlem has resulted in tangible building projects and real jobs,''
she added. ``Rev. Butts has a real commitment to the betterment of
his community and has an enormous amount of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts, who supported Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1993 but stunned
city officials and black leaders last May by calling him a racist
on the verge of turning the city into a fascist state, has often
been an outspoken political maverick, flirting with alternatives to
established Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki won only 11 percent of the state's black vote in
his narrow 1994 victory, he and Butts have since nurtured a close
alliance. Butts, who has said he was considering running for mayor
in 2001, has been named to several state boards, including the
Empire State Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration has financed several Harlem projects
along 125th Street including a supermarket and retail and
entertainment centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Abyssinian Development Corp., an arm of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church, has been designated as co-developer of some of the
projects. While Butts has emphasized that he has no formal role in
the corporation, which has a separate board of directors, some in
Harlem see the corporation's selection as a political reward for
the support Butts has given Pataki.

   NORTH HAVEN, Conn. _ As Bill Mannetti strides through a swampy
piece of state land near the Quinnipiac River, he points out spots
where a trapper might place a beaver trap or a coyote trap _ there
at the bottom of that small hill, here in this shallow of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   Mannetti holds the permit for trapping on this land, but he
hasn't set a single trap.
</P>
<P>
   An animal rights advocate for 12 years, he has bid on the
exclusive right to trap animals on parcels of state property _ then
in effect declared the land a trap-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in Connecticut thought that trapping went the way
of the pillory and the thumbscrew,'' he said. ``People assume this
doesn't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mannetti, founder of Animal Rights Front, has joined
with other animal rights advocates in a campaign that could win
them permits for about 45,000 acres, nearly a third of the state
land where trapping is allowed. Frustrated by years of losing the
battle to ban certain kinds of animal traps statewide through
legislation, the advocates took a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the ground,'' Mannetti said. ``It's public land _
our land. We had no choice but to enter the program and, in a
sense, to undermine it. We'll spare some animals from very hard,
cruel deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has infuriated trappers, who say the animal rights
advocates are subverting a legitimate state program that is needed
to control the wildlife population. Their outcry has led state
officials to consider changing the rules so that people could not
bid on the property unless they had trapped animals, which would
prevent the animal rights advocates from bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just bid extraordinarily high and try to get these
properties.'' said Robert Crook, a lobbyist for the Coalition of
Connecticut Sportsmen. ``Animal rights people don't like any
animals killed. That's their mission in life. That's certainly not
the state's mission in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they should impose their philosophy or their
vegetarianism on us,'' Crook added.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights advocates' strategy is similar to one used by
conservationists in the West who have tried to win the grazing
rights on government-owned land to prevent overgrazing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are often thwarted, as in Idaho, where the state
Legislature changed the law so that only ranchers could bid on
state grazing land. And while Connecticut animal rights advocates
have been successful so far, the state may change the rules here so
that they cannot bid on the land next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, only licensed trappers can bid on the
approximately 120 parcels of state land where trapping is allowed
during the winter on 11 species of animals: beaver, raccoon, skunk,
possum, coyote, red fox, gray fox, muskrat, weasel, river otter and
mink. Mannetti was the first animal rights advocate to take the
state course to become licensed, and thus became eligible to bid
for trapping rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now the state is considering several alternative rules, said
Paul Rego, a state wildlife biologist, including a requirement that
bidders must have actually trapped animals, as opposed to just
holding a license. Connecticut could also, like many other states,
allow anyone to trap on those parcels, doing away with the bidding
process altogether, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our position is, wildlife has to be managed,'' Crook said.
``Certainly it's the position of the DEP And if you have an element
trying to prevent the management of wildlife, some action has to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Trappers pushed the state to make the change in policy this
year. Instead, the state is issuing permits for one year _ rather
than the traditional four years _ to give officials time to
consider the issue. The decision has drawn criticism from both
trappers and animals rights advocates, who charge Gov. John
Rowland's administration with waiting to make a controversial
decision until after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely a political move,'' said Alan Huot, a trapper.
``It's a reflection of the administration's shyness for anything
that is a controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland did not address that charge at a news conference Friday,
but he did say that though he opposes trapping as a hobby, he feels
it is a necessary tool for dealing with nuisance animals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the animal rights advocates held the permits on about
5,000 acres. This year they said they had hoped to win the rights
to about 70,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   After bids were opened on Friday, however, it seemed the
advocates fell short of their goal, winning permits to about 44,000
acres and losing some parcels to trappers who bid higher than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be known who won the permits for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   David Leff, the state's assistant commissioner for environmental
conservation, said that trapping is no crueler than other forms of
death faced by wild animals, like starvation or being killed by a
predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at trapping within that context,'' Leff
said. ``It's not like these are pets that are kept well-fed and
protected from disease and enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The trappers say they are pursuing a tradition and often
rendering a service to private landowner. Crook said that for
years, he used to trap beavers on the land of a neighboring farmer
who had flooding problems when they dammed up a nearby stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing the farmer a favor,'' Crook said. ``He was doing
me a favor. And everyone was happy. Except the animals rights
people.''

GOODEN'S GOAL: WIN IN POSTSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It is still strange to see Dwight Gooden's name
embroidered on a uniform not sewn in New York. Every stitch in time
seems to link Gooden to the city that celebrated his golden youth
as a Met, forgave his frailties as a man and embraced his rebirth
as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the stunning 20-year-old Cy Young award winner
anymore, nor the man whose personal weaknesses crashed his
spectacular world, nor the comeback pitcher who threw his first
career no-hitter at Yankee Stadium on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, here stands a resilient 33-year-old in Cleveland
clothing, still pitching even though his fastball has lost some
spice and his leg kick has lost some height. ``I'm too old now to
get my leg up that high,'' Gooden said with a smile on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He is not too old to reward the Indians for giving him a chance
when the hourglass finally ran out in New York. Gooden was
scheduled to be on the mound Sunday night to start Game 4 of the
American League Championship Series, attempting to do the one thing
he never accomplished in New York: win a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be big,'' Gooden said. ``A lot of things happened in
my career that I really didn't expect with awards, even the World
Series. But that's the only thing missing. That's the one thing I
would like to have, too, even if it's just one.''
</P>
<P>
   He came so close to attaining that one playoff victory last
year. He was a Yankee then, and the Indians were the enemy in the
division series. As Gooden took a seat on the Yankee bench, he
watched Mariano Rivera dig into his place on the mound with a
one-run lead in the eighth inning. That's when Sandy Alomar
unleashed an unthinkable home run that tied the score, and began
the end for the Yankees in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, any time Mariano came in the game, you figured it
was over,'' said Gooden, who is 0-3 for his career in the
postseason. ``I got spoiled watching him in '96. Like last year, he
was just guaranteed. Once that game was over, it was tough to
swallow because we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no more Yankee moments for Doc. The Yankees did
not pick up the option on his contract, which he discussed with the
principal owner, George Steinbrenner, before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an opportunity for me to come back,'' Gooden said
without elaborating. ``But I just thought as a player, it was time
for me to move on. I still felt I had a lot to give to that ball
club, but Joe Torre thought differently. You have to respect that,
though, because it's his team. The only thing that was tough for me
was that I was leaving a city where I had been my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure if Gooden would click in Cleveland. In the
beginning, some speculated that General Manager John Hart, who had
known Gooden since he was in high school, was wrong to have
extended a lifeline to the pitcher. Maybe Hart's sentiment had
overstepped reality.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Gooden looked as if his body was irreparably worn down
as tendinitis gripped his right shoulder during spring training and
in the first seven weeks of the season. But slowly, he sprung to
life in the second half of the season. He finished with an 8-6
record, with victories in his last five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   No one was better down the stretch for the Indians. The youthful
Jaret Wright and Bartolo Colon were like windup toys on their last
tick, while Gooden felt rejuvenated, winning with cleverness over
power. He owned the plate like a piece of real estate, boasting
location, location, location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember us ever hitting Doc well in New York,''
Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said. ``Doc has pitched the second
half of the season a lot like we saw him pitch against us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gooden's string of smart performances ran out when he did
not keep his wits about him in Game 2 of the Indians' division
series against Boston on Sept. 30. His puzzlement with Umpire Joe
Brinkman's strike zone turned to anger. And 22 pitches into the
game, Gooden's tirade caused him to be thrown out. Although his
ejection seemed to stir the Indians' emotions and ignite a victory,
Gooden was not especially proud of his last outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was unfortunate, and hopefully it won't happen
again,'' Gooden said. ``To me, that's over. Hopefully, this time
I'll be out there a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be odd to see him Sunday night and know that he is still
very much a part of New York, forever interwoven during the good
and bad times. And yet, Gooden, in a sense, will be out to defeat
his past and finally come up with an elusive postseason victory
against, of all teams, one from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about, playing in October,'' Gooden
said. ``No doubt it will be special to play against the Yankees. I
mean, I spent my whole career in New York. But once you take the
mound, they're just another ball club. You might not believe that,
but it's true.''

MAJOR GAY GROUP MAY BACK D'AMATO, WORRYING DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also filed in category `p') 
(nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned
that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is
about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are
intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights
Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the
closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation.
They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, organization officials and gay activists from
both parties who have been monitoring the debate say the group is
most likely to endorse D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth
term. They also raised the possibility that the group would endorse
both candidates, or remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three
major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been
searching for allies among the Senate Republican majority and
considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong.
</P>
<P>
   An endorsement by the group, which is held in high regard by
many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important in swinging
voters to D'Amato in a tight race. It would also be a major
symbolic victory for the senator, who has sought to recast himself
as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to
build his standing among moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to
portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify
to many voters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition
that has included black and gay voters, women and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement
underscores the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats
across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato as one of their best
opportunities to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seats in
the Senate _ enough to stop a Democratic filibuster. The
Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans
get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge
politically for the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close
friend of President Clinton's who is gay. He was referring to the
Senate majority leader, who has called homosexuality a sin and
likened it to kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's
largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State
Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been
very close to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its
board and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay
Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are
infuriated that it is even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also
runs on the Right to Life and Conservative Party lines and often
receives high ratings from the Christian Coalition, which typically
opposes legislation on civil rights for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization has been thought to be inching toward
a D'Amato endorsement for months, the lobbying campaign for Schumer
has picked up intensity in the last two weeks, driven partly by a
growing sense that the race is now closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for
gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made
personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not
to endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they did not know
whether the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign
officials declined to comment. Schumer met privately with the
group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the
group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties
to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement. Some
New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the
organization with phone calls, e-mail messages and letters.
Democratic officials have been encouraging the group's major donors
to express their opposition to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they
are hoping the group will endorse both candidates, or make no
endorsement at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are
important to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The last thing that they
should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so
supportive of their agenda.''

   The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay
and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership
of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. The group
was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of
the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato was
first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong
supporter of President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, the
endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts
to reposition himself as a moderate. Since 1993, the senator has
backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military,
sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay
workers and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the
nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights
Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay
electorate and help the organization insulate itself from
accusations that it is too close to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, including top officials
within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current
political climate, where Congress is almost certain to remain under
Republican control after November, gay people must build alliances
with moderate Republicans.

</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy
is to support friendly incumbents, even when their challengers have
better voting records on gay issues. That is the case in New York,
where Schumer's rating by the Human Rights Campaign has been
consistently better than D'Amato's. Both men, however, have angered
advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that
allows states to not recognize gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the
organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the
Republican challenger, William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts
Senate race, even though Weld's record on gay rights was considered
stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that
snubbing D'Amato would prove that the group is biased toward
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign
contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing
D'Amato will permanently damage the group, particularly among
women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the
group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in his opposition
to abortion during 18 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if the
group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame for installing the state
Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be
strongly anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride
Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as ``the architect'' of the state
Republican Party as a major reason the group endorsed Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he has criticized fellow Republicans in Washington for
their intolerance, here at home, his own party's blatant
discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some White House officials say they think a
Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost
meaningless among gay voters. They contend that it might even hurt
the senator among his conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an
HRC endorsement,'' said a White House aide who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``But I think some people in the Right to
Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, `Who is this
guy and why should we vote for him?'''

MAJOR GAY GROUP MAY BACK D'AMATO, WORRYING DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also filed in category `w') 
(nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned
that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is
about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are
intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the
Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights
Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the
closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation.
They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, organization officials and gay activists from
both parties who have been monitoring the debate say the group is
most likely to endorse D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth
term. They also raised the possibility that the group would endorse
both candidates, or remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three
major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been
searching for allies among the Senate Republican majority and
considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong.
</P>
<P>
   An endorsement by the group, which is held in high regard by
many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important in swinging
voters to D'Amato in a tight race. It would also be a major
symbolic victory for the senator, who has sought to recast himself
as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to
build his standing among moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to
portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify
to many voters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition
that has included black and gay voters, women and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement
underscores the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats
across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato as one of their best
opportunities to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seats in
the Senate _ enough to stop a Democratic filibuster. The
Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans
get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge
politically for the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close
friend of President Clinton's who is gay. He was referring to the
Senate majority leader, who has called homosexuality a sin and
likened it to kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's
largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State
Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been
very close to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its
board and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay
Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are
infuriated that it is even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also
runs on the Right to Life and Conservative Party lines and often
receives high ratings from the Christian Coalition, which typically
opposes legislation on civil rights for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Although the organization has been thought to be inching toward
a D'Amato endorsement for months, the lobbying campaign for Schumer
has picked up intensity in the last two weeks, driven partly by a
growing sense that the race is now closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for
gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made
personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not
to endorse D'Amato. White House officials said they did not know
whether the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign
officials declined to comment. Schumer met privately with the
group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the
group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties
to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement. Some
New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the
organization with phone calls, e-mail messages and letters.
Democratic officials have been encouraging the group's major donors
to express their opposition to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they
are hoping the group will endorse both candidates, or make no
endorsement at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are
important to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The last thing that they
should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so
supportive of their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay
and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership
of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. The group

FRANCE'S UNCOVERING OF DRUGS IS PROTESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Stephane Barthe is only one of the many fine French
riders who will not be competing Sunday in the world championship
bicycle road race in Valkenburg, the Netherlands. While most of the
others are ineligible because they have been accused of doping,
Barthe is staying away to make a public protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to represent France after what happened in the
Tour de France,'' Barthe, the 25-year-old former national champion,
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He is not protesting the use of illegal drugs, however, such as
the artificial hormone EPO or the human growth hormone that give
his rivals an edge over him in races. Barthe's complaint is against
the fact that the others were caught. ``I do not want to represent
a country that treats riders like dirt,'' he said. ``To hear people
say that bicycle racing is the most corrupt sport is pitiful.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two months after the Tour staggered to its finish with
the stigma of the Festina Affair _ the world's top-ranked team
expelled from the race because of systematic doping _ Barthe's
attitude is common among riders and officials.
</P>
<P>
   The French police and courts are still being blamed for their
conduct in uncovering the affair, few riders have been disciplined,
almost no sponsors have rebelled at the notoriety and, at the
highest level of the sport, little appears to have been
accomplished outside a few conferences and study groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, riders and officials agreed with the
words of Chris Horner, an American racer with the Francaise des
Jeux team, which has had three riders and its directeur sportif
called in for questioning in the last few weeks, after a masseur
was taken into custody and charged with distributing illegal
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of professional sports now,'' Horner said of
drugs. ``Every sport has some problems like that. You just have to
deal with it, in one ear and out the other, and keep training and
keep racing. It bothers you, of course, when your directeur is
called in by the police, but what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The directeur sportif, Marc Madiot, was released after he
acknowledged that although some of his riders used the drugs, the
team had not imitated Festina and established a formal program of
drug distribution. That is a criminal offense in France although
drug use is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole summer has been a disaster,'' said Lance Armstrong,
who is a favorite in Sunday's world championship, even though his
U.S. Postal Service team has not had any problem. ``No one has any
answers. These drugs are completely undetectable. What are you
going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Theo de Rooy, the directeur sportif of the Rabobank team from
the Netherlands and a fine rider a decade ago, is another who is
stumped for an answer. ``The stuff we're talking about now cannot
be traced in blood or urine,'' he said. ``So there's no instant
solution. We have to keep searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many others, de Rooy is also defensive. ``We're trying
to solve problems for the whole sports world,'' he said. ``Are
there no problems in other sports? We're on the firing line, as
always cycling is. We are the sport that started drug testing, that
started blood controls. We're starting a whole new system of a
health-maintenance book on every rider next year. If you think that
sports in general can be or must be the purest form of
entertainment while the whole world is rotten _ that's utopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabobank has not come under suspicion. As De Rooy pointed out,
the standard contract says that any rider who fails a drug test
will be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Cofidis team in France has an identical clause in its
contracts. When Francesco Casagrande, the team's leader, was
reported to have failed two medical tests because of an excess of
the male hormone testosterone in his blood this spring, he was told
by the team not to race further this season. Casagrande was
sentenced to a six-month suspension by his Italian federation last
month, a few weeks after he won the esteemed San Sebastian Classic.
</P>
<P>
   His victory stands since he passed the medical inspection in
that race. According to the rules of the sport, a rider is
permitted to continue competing while he appeals a positive finding
_ often a matter of several months. Christophe Moreau, a French
rider with Festina, was allowed to ride in the Tour de France this
summer, for example, after he tested positive in a race in March;
he dropped his appeal only last month after he was also implicated
in the Festina Affair.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules, as enforced by national federations under
the International Cycling Union, the guiding body of the sport and
a subject of general derision. Mention of its name _ it is known as
the UCI from its initials in French _ is usually met with a smile
and a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the UCI,'' said one rider mockingly. ``They're all
afraid of lawsuits. That's the main goal: Let's not get sued
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hein Verbruggen, the president of the UCI, admitted as much this
week when he tried to explain why his group had reduced the
suspension of three Swiss riders for Festina from eight months to
seven. Verbruggen conceded that the International Olympic Committee
advocates a two-year suspension, but, he noted, ``a ban for two
years for a rider means a ban for life.'' Such a sanction, he
added, could lead to costly legal battles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Verbruggen made no friends among the riders when he continued to
attend a UCI conference in Havana as the Festina Affair became
public, then merely dropped in on the Tour before spending the rest
of July in India on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he impress anybody with his most draconian ruling of the
fall: He told Laurent Jalabert, the Frenchman who ranks first among
the riders, that unless he apologized for describing the UCI as a
dictatorship and its officials as half Draculas and half neo-Nazis,
he could not ride in the world championships. Jalabert, who was
weary at the end of the season and dubious about representing
France, declined to ride.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday's road race will be conducted without Jalabert,
Laurent Dufaux, Armin Meier and Alex Zulle, the three Swiss riders.
Laurent Brochard, the defending world champion, will not be there
since he faces charges in the Festina Affair. Richard Virenque,
another Festina star, will also be absent although he continues to
deny his guilt despite public testimony by his masseur that he took
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, however, Brochard and Virenque are still
appearing in other races. And their sponsor, Festina, reported that
the scandal had a positive effect on sales of its watches and that
it would pay the team's $5 million expenses again next year. TVM, a
Dutch team sponsored by an insurance company, will also continue to
be supported next season although its directeur sportif has not
been allowed to leave France since July. For their own legal
protection, TVM riders no longer appear in races in France.
</P>
<P>
   The only team that appears to have lost sponsor support is
Casino, a French team that is ranked second in the world. Its $5
million budget was cut in half for next season when the supermarket
chain decided there was nothing positive in the photos of Rodolfo
Massi, the Tour's king of the mountains, being taken to jail on
charges of using and distributing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year will be a rebuilding season,'' said Vincent Lavenu,
the team's directeur sportif. ``We're losing a lot of riders. The
Festina Affair shook our sponsor. It will probably withdraw
completely in a while. The doping obviously wasn't good for us, but
life goes on.''

STRATEGY, NOT SPEED, WILL BE KEY IN ARKANSAS  
 AROUND ALONE UPDATE  
 NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: FRANCE, Ark., Conn., N.Y.)  (ak) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the half-million people who live within 30 minutes of Lake
Maumelle in Little Rock, Ark., access to clear water and
undeveloped hillsides is part of the metropolitan landscape. But
the area, which is staging a national sailing championship this
week, is not your average port of call for yachting's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are curious,'' said Drew Daugherty, the regatta
chairman. ``Many have never sailed in Arkansas before. We get
comments like, `What coast is that on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen sailing teams will be arriving for the Championship of
Champions, one of 11 major regattas sponsored this year by Rolex
Watch U.S.A. U.S. Sailing, the sport's governing body, invited the
1998 champions of about 80 one-design classes in the country. On
average, 20 teams show up at the event, said Greg Fisher, U.S.
Sailing's committee chairman for the 22nd annual event.
Three-member crews will be competing Wednesday through Friday in a
fleet of Flying Scots, 19-foot sloops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always look for new and different places to have
regattas,'' Fisher said. ``The Grande Maumelle Sailing Club is one
of the most active and competitive clubs in the country. Not that
many sailors on the East and West Coast know about it. But it has a
very strong background in one-design sailing. When we asked them if
they wanted to do this race, they jumped at the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, just ask David Dellenbaugh, an America's Cup veteran
from Easton, Conn., about sailing in Little Rock. ``I didn't even
know they had a lake there,'' Dellenbaugh said. Lake Maumelle,
which is about 10 miles long, is used as a reservoir for Little
Rock's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Dellenbaugh, a tactical expert who sailed as the
only man on the women's Mighty Mary America's Cup team in 1995,
expects a demanding competition. ``It probably will be a tactical
series as opposed to a boat speed contest,'' he said. ``The fleet
of Flying Scots all have new sails, which ought to make the boats
fairly equal in speed.''
</P>
<P>
   As publisher of a monthly newsletter on race tactics, Speed and
Smarts, Dellenbaugh plans to play every angle. To keep his team's
weight down _ a race tactic for medium-to-light winds _ Dellenbaugh
has asked his sailing partner, Jimmy Crane, to bring his
12-year-old son, Robbie, as the third crew member. The Dellenbaugh
crew weighs about 450 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing against them will be some of the best one-design racers
in the country. They include George Szabo, of San Diego, two-time
defender of the title. He is also this year's titlist in the highly
competitive Snipe class.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite to win is Kelly Gough, an Olympic contender in
1980, who is national champion in the Flying Scot. Other one-design
classes represented include the Lightning, Thistle, Y-Flyer, Blue
Jay, Holder 20 and Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   Around Alone Update
</P>
<P>
   The French, who have long had a lock on single-handed racing,
are leading so far in the Around Alone, a sailboat race around the
world for solo skippers. Ahead by 50 miles in Class I is Marc
Thiercelin, skipper of the 60-foot racer Somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Class II, Pierre Mouligne leads a pack of nine 50-foot boats
by only a few miles. The leaders are about 4,500 miles from their
first stopover, Cape Town. The 26,000-mile race began Sept. 26 from
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Thiercelin's French rival, Isabelle Autissier, was ahead until
last week, when she broke the forestay on her 60-foot yacht, PRB.
The rigging problem prevented Autissier from flying her largest
genoa through light winds last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Thiercelin and Autissier were the first to break off from
the easterly track most of the fleet took after leaving
Charleston,'' said Herb McCormick, a race spokesman. ``They were
the first to dip south toward Cape Town after riding out a
southwesterly breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Autissier has dropped to fourth in Class I. Ahead of her, but
within 100 miles, are Josh Hall on Gartmore Investment Management,
and Mike Golding on Team Group 4.
</P>
<P>
   North American Championship
</P>
<P>
   One of the few mostly amateur big-boat classes in the country,
the J/44, has gathered 11 boats this weekend on Long Island Sound
for the 1998 North American Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his 1997 title is Jimmie Sundstrom of Rye, N.Y.,
skipper and owner of the J/44 Stampede. The three-day regatta began
Saturday at the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club in Oyster Bay,
N.Y.

   NEW YORK _ It is tempting on meeting Ted and Sherry Scofield to
slot them into a New York stereotype of the Young Southerners:
innocent and naive, just arrived in the big city, ready and waiting
to be marked by fate.
</P>
<P>
   But even before moving here, they figured out something many
people never really understand: It's a waste of time to ask other
people where to live, because the answers will always be biased.
``Everyone is loyal to their neighborhood,'' Scofield said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they set out on their own, using Web sites while still
living in Nashville, Tenn., to figure out which neighborhood, which
building and which apartment met their non-negotiable list of
demands: a lot of space, a terrace, and a washer and dryer.
</P>
<P>
   They were used to big places, to a horizontal life, to a
bathroom that was 250 square feet with two sinks and a Jacuzzi. So
they knew they couldn't just arrive in August, when Scofield, after
graduating from Vanderbilt University's joint program in law and
business, would start as an associate at the law firm of Orrick,
Herrington and Sutcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   They came up with a plan, which isn't surprising from two people
who are happy to say that their furniture in New York is arranged
just as it was in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   As he clicked on sites, Scofield compiled data on sales prices
and decided it made more sense to buy than rent, partly because he
believed from charts he developed that prices might still go up,
that the peak had not yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to buy, he became e-mail friends with Paul
Purcell, the relocation manager at Douglas Elliman, who quickly
advised them about things like the differences between co-ops and
condos. Purcell did not think they would be approved by any co-op
board, Scofield said. ``We have a good income, but nothing in the
bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condos, which do not require board approval, became their focus.
The decision vastly narrowed their search, because condos make up a
lesser proportion of the available housing. The Scofields
downloaded market data, floor plans and descriptions of condominium
buildings. They used general sites, like www.nyrealty.com and
www.nyc-condos.com, as well as those of individual brokerage
companies, like www.elliman.com, to help amplify the skimpy and
sometimes misleading information they said they found in classified
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield printed out dozens of floor plans to examine with his
wife. One of the first buildings whose plans they liked was Evans
Tower, a condo at 171 East 84th St., which they eventually chose,
because it was relatively near Central Park and had a health club,
roof deck and pool. Mrs. Scofield, a nurse who worked in sports
medicine in Nashville and is just beginning her job hunt here,
likes to run.
</P>
<P>
   Their e-mail adviser at Elliman connected them with Kerry
Martin, a Douglas Elliman broker he believed they would like. They
had heard stories about ``odd, snippy'' New York brokers, but Ms.
Martin's charm and helpfulness _ perhaps cultivated by some time
spent in the South _ proved a pleasant surprise, they said. They
faxed floor plans back and forth, getting her advice, narrowing
their list.
</P>
<P>
   By spring break, Ms. Martin had two dozen places to show
them.They liked Evans Tower best, but nothing was available. So
they kept looking, still using the Internet but conscious of its
limitations. The Web sites of the brokerage firms were useful for
only a general overview, they said, because the sites were often
out of date. ``You couldn't trust them for shopping,'' Scofield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just before they would have had to choose someplace
else, an apartment in Evans Tower became available. Like an
already-sold unit they had seen, it had a large bedroom, plentiful
storage, a washer and dryer, a small terrace, parquet floors and an
L-shaped living room/dining area with a galley kitchen. They put in
a bid for $342,500 _ just below the $345,000 asking price _ without
ever seeing it, and signed a contract. The monthly total of common
charges and taxes is $1,093.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get a mortgage from a New York bank for the amount
they wanted, they turned to National City Bank in Louisville, Ky.,
which had given Scofield a car loan when he was 16.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after taking the New York bar exam in August _ he
will get the results next month _ and just an hour before the
closing, Scofield saw the apartment for the first time.
Fortunately, with a nonrefundable deposit at stake, he liked it.
But they weren't surprised. ``We trusted Kerry to come over and
look and say it was good,'' Mrs. Scofield said.

PUTTING NEW LUSTER ON OLD HARDWOOD FLOORS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardwood floors, often the most visible and vulnerable blend of
form and function in a house, inevitably take a beating over time.
And when that happens, flooring experts say, homeowners usually
have two basic options: refinish what's there or cover it with
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more than one way to refinish a floor,'' said Walter
Sedovic, an architect based in Irvington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Sedovic, who recently refinished half a dozen floors in his
four-story house in Bronxville, N.Y., said that the kind of
refinishing job that hardwood floors need depends on the extent of
wear or damage.
</P>
<P>
   Floors that are merely scratched or scuffed, he said, usually
require little more than a new finish to recoup their former
beauty. Those that are severely scratched or stained, as well as
those on which portions of the finish have worn through to the wood
itself, may need to have the old finish completely removed and the
surface sanded smooth before a new finish can be applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an advocate of sanding down to bare wood,'' Sedovic
said. ``All wood mellows with age, and one of the things that's
nice about hardwoods like oak is that the grain becomes accentuated
over time. If you sand it back to a plain surface, you lose a lot
of that beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, when floors are not damaged to the point
where the finish has completely worn through, it is generally best
to just ``rough-up'' the surface coat without cutting through it
and into the wood itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You screen the floor instead of sanding it,'' Sedovic said,
explaining that screening involves using a floor sander equipped
with a mesh screen _ similar to the material used for window
screens _ instead of sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screen grit is finer than sandpaper grit,'' he said. ``It
gently abrades the finish without taking the wood surface apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sedovic said, homeowners who are thinking about
renting a machine to refinish their floors themselves might want to
use a reciprocating machine _ one that vibrates _ rather than a
belt sander or disk sander that rotates or spins and is more
difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   After screening, Sedovic said, the floor needs to be vacuumed,
damp-mopped, and then allowed to dry overnight before a finish coat
is applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually recommend a waterborne polyurethane,'' he said,
explaining that such a finish is odorless, quick-drying, and thin
enough to conform to the texture of the wood. ``You can build up
three coats and still have a feel left for the surface qualities of
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Dickel, an owner of Floors Like Glass, a hardwood floor
refinishing company in Goshen, N.Y., said that when floors are so
deteriorated that they must be sanded to bare wood, it generally
takes a minimum of four passes with the sanding machine _ three
with increasingly finer grit paper _ and then one final pass with a
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to use sealers,'' Ms. Dickel said, referring to
products that are sometimes used to seal the wood and thereby
enable the use of fewer finish coats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you use a polyurethane finish with no sealer, the first
coat goes on a little splotchy, and that's what you want it to
do,'' she said, explaining that when polyurethane is absorbed into
the wood it provides greater durability than when it just sits on
the wood surface. ``On red oak, two coats are usually sufficient,''
Ms. Dickel said. ``White oak, maple, fir and pine usually require
three coats to finish,'' she said, adding that the cost of
refinishing a floor in decent condition can range from $1.50 to $2
a square foot. Floors that are severely damaged can cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dickel pointed out that the best way to clean a wood floor
was to vacuum frequently, wipe up spills immediately and then damp
mop the floor with a solution of two tablespoons of white vinegar
in a gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way a wood floor is cleaned can have a significant
impact on the refinishing process when refinishing becomes
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Phill Maiorana, a floor refinisher in Bloomfield, N.J., said
that it was sometimes necessary to strip a floor in fairly good
shape to bare wood and then use a sealer as a first coat to insure
that the finish coat adheres properly to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone waxes their wood floors, the wax ends up getting
packed into the seams between the boards,'' Maiorana said. ``And
when a finish comes in contact with that old wax, they separate
like oil and water.''
</P>
<P>
   And since even sanding to bare wood provides no guarantee of
getting at wax caked between the boards, he said, it is sometimes
necessary to coat the floor with a sealer to dissolve the wax and
allow the finish coats to stick uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   At times, however, a floor has been refinished so many times
that refinishing it again will cause nails to show in the seams
where the boards are attached. Until recently, Maiorana said, when
that happened _ and the homeowner wanted to keep the look of wood
rather than lay down carpet or vinyl flooring _ the only solution
was to rip up the old floor and replace it with a new one or to lay
a new floor over the old one. Over the last few years, however, a
new product has been gaining in popularity with homeowners _ a
product that looks like wood but wears like iron: plastic laminate
flooring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laminate flooring is the hottest growing category in the
flooring industry,'' said Kevin Boothe, marketing manager for
Formica Flooring, a product made by Formica Corp. in Cincinnati.
``Laminates are more durable than wood, they don't scratch, they
don't dent, they don't rip and they don't stain.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Formica's laminate flooring _ which is only 5/16 of an inch
thick and can be installed over an existing wood floor _ costs
about $4 a square foot plus about $3 a square foot for
installation. Formica flooring products, Boothe said, are
essentially a sandwich of sorts of various materials bonded
together permanently by the application of high heat and pressure.
Like its competitors, the product comes in styles and colors that
mimic various wood grains.
</P>
<P>
   Boothe explained that most laminate flooring products were
installed using a tongue-and-groove method _ the same method used
for traditional wood flooring _ whereby adjacent planks with a
tongue on one side and a grove on the other are joined together.
But while wood planks are nailed to the subfloor, laminates are
glued to each other along their sides and allowed to ``float'' on
the subfloor _ normally covered by a thin foam underlayer _ with
about a quarter inch of free space around the perimeter to allow
for expansion and contraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A homeowner who has a few handyman skills and knows how to
measure can probably put in a floor over a weekend,'' Boothe said.
``And then you have a floor that needs no waxing, no buffing and no
polishing. Just go over it with a damp mop when it gets dirty.''

WASHINGTON VOTERS UPSET, BUT CONSEQUENCES REMAIN UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category code ``a.'')  
(ak) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Wash. _ There is no question that voters are upset
here in Washington, a state that has been a particularly accurate
electoral bellwether in recent years. It broadly backed President
Clinton and congressional Democrats in 1992, turned to Republicans
with spectacular vengeance in 1994, then returned to Clinton in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in 1998, the state's voters are again distressed over
events in Washington, D.C., where the House of Representatives has
decided to begin a historic inquiry that could lead to the
president's impeachment. But three and a half weeks before election
day, it is also clear that many voters are not at all sure where to
direct their anger _ and thus whether they will do so in any
distinct fashion in the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they'd take the whole bunch _ Clinton, that woman, Ken
Starr, the Republicans in Congress, the media _ I wish they'd take
the bunch, put them on the Queen Mary, tow it away and sink the
whole thing at sea,'' said William H. Stout, a retired machine
operator in this Columbia River port town. ``But no, I can't really
tell you who I blame the most for how out of control this thing has
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Rheaume, a 55-year-old nurse at St. John Hospital here,
was also embittered by the scandal but perplexed about where to pin
the blame. ``Democrats and Republicans both, they're having their
little soap opera over there, and it's costing me $40 million and
counting,'' she said. ``It really makes me furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because of this uncertainty, many political experts
here detect a great degree of volatility in the electorate, just as
Congress is recessing and campaigns are kicking into high gear. The
impeachment issue could possibly congeal as a major factor in the
final weeks, they say, perhaps affecting turnout. But it could just
as possibly become a curious non-factor in the elections _ a major
matter on people's minds, to be sure, but not one that they will
translate into a reason to punish one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole sense of anger out there is very real, but it's also
like a heat-seeking missile that's missing a target,'' said Robert
Gogerty, a Seattle-based political consultant who usually works for
Democrats but is not involved in any state races this year. ``It's
really complicated, and people don't quite know who to blame. But
if they do lock onto something in these next few weeks, God help
the target.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogerty and many of the candidates running this year also agree
that in a very general way, 1994 represented a referendum of sorts
on Bill Clinton (even though he was not on the ballot), while
1996's congressional elections represented a referendum on House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans' handling of their
first majority in Congress in 40 years. But the 1998 elections,
they say, are not necessarily being seen by voters as any sort of
referendum on whether the president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, none of the forces that seem to inspire the most
ire among dozens of voters interviewed here _ Clinton, Kenneth
Starr and his team of prosecutors, the news media, even Monica
Lewinsky _ are on any ballot in any congressional election in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that people could train their sights on the
Republicans who control Congress, who were broadly seen as inclined
to push for the president's removal, or the Democrats, viewed as
more lenient. And there are candidates of both parties trying to
seize such ground: in at least four races in the state involving
congressional incumbents, the challengers _ two from each major
party _ are urging voters to send a message about the impeachment
matter by voting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taber, the Republican challenger to Rep. Adam Smith, a
Democrat, said a vote for him would send a message that the
president should be made to pay for ``illegal and immoral deeds.''
Jay Inslee, a former Democratic representative running against Rep.
Rick White, a Republican, said that he would work to bring the
whole matter to a close and let Congress focus on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But many other candidates said that they saw no evidence the
inquiry was a ``swing issue'' among voters, and that they were not
pushing it on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this race is and should be and will be about local
issues,'' said Brian Baird, the Democratic candidate for an open
seat in the state's third congressional district, which covers much
of southwest Washington, from the fast-growing, white-collar and
Republican-leaning suburb of Vancouver, Wash., to more
traditionally Democratic, working-class strongholds like Longview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baird, a psychology professor at Pacific Lutheran
University in Olympia, nor his Republican opponent, state Sen. Don
Benton, have made the impeachment inquiry an overt issue in the
campaign, though they acknowledge that voters care about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm hearing from people is that there's shame enough and
blame enough to go around,'' said Baird, who came within 887 votes
two years ago of defeating the Republican incumbent, Linda Smith,
who is now giving up the seat to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're disappointed in the president,'' Baird added.
``They're angry at Kenneth Starr. They're upset with the Congress.
They're frustrated with the media. But I don't think it all points
in a particular direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton, who said he had not read ``one whit of the Starr
report'' because he had been so busy campaigning, said he did not
raise the issue of impeachment proceedings in his standard pitch to
voters, though he did say it could be a factor in his and other
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very relevant,'' said Benton, ``not that
particular case per se, but it has certainly brought the issue of
morality and integrity and honesty of our public servants more to
the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   One distinct possibility, of course, is that many disaffected
voters will simply stay home. In 1994, many traditionally
Democratic voters did so, a critical factor in the Republicans'
stunning success here.
</P>
<P>
   But turnout was by no means close to historic lows in the recent
round of primary balloting in Washington. And with several
controversial initiatives and a closely fought Senate race between
Ms. Smith and Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat, on November's
ballot, most political observers here doubt that turnout will be as
low as it was in 1994, when 51 percent of registered voters went to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   John Kornbrust, a 32-year-old truck driver in Longview, said
that he voted for Clinton in 1992, ``didn't get around to voting''
in 1994, probably because he felt vaguely disillusioned with the
president at the time, then did turn out in 1996 for Clinton again
because he felt the Republican-controlled Congress was not
interested in looking out for working-class people like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll vote this year,'' Kornbrust said. ``I think it's
important.'' He said that he had not made up his mind on either the
Senate contest or the local congressional race, but that Clinton's
personal conduct and the impeachment proceedings were not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it basically comes down to the same old thing it always
does,'' he said. ``With Republicans, you'll probably get your taxes
cut and they'll stop at least some of the giveaways, but then
they'll nail you on stuff like Social Security and health care,''
programs he thought Democrats were more likely to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the dynamic he outlined is clearly present in
the congressional race. Benton promotes himself as a champion of
smaller government and tax cuts while Baird promises that he will
fight to protect programs like Social Security and to improve
education.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Washington state have zigzagged in recent elections in
a way that reflects the national electorate. In 1992, voters here
backed Clinton and returned their traditional Democratic majority
in the state's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, though, they turned on Democrats, booting House Speaker
Thomas Foley out of office and handing seven of the nine
congressional seats to Republicans, the biggest such switch of any
state. But in 1996, just as in the country at large, they backed
Clinton for re-election and gave Republicans a diminished majority,
as one of the state's seats switched back to the Democrats and two
others nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, many voters in the third congressional
district said they would be satisfied to continue with a Clinton
presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see right now looks pretty good,'' said Byam Youngman,
a medical-equipment dealer in Vancouver. ``They're balancing the
budget. There's a surplus, probably a tax cut. I guess the
president gets some of the credit for that, just because he's the
president, but I think the Congress is mostly responsible for the
good things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the president's conduct weighed on their minds.
``I was brought up in a Democratic family, and a lot of my
relatives would still vote for Jack the Ripper if he was the
Democratic candidate on the ballot,'' said Pat Taylor, a
50-year-old glassware dealer from the town of Pe Ell. ``But I don't
think we should just say forget it, let the president get away with
it, which is what I think Democrats want to do. I listened to Ross
Perot the other night, and he's right _ what kind of message is
that sending to our kids?''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Tom Bert, a Longview contractor still making up his
mind about the elections, ``I guess I'm in a situation where,
depending what happens, if a vote for the Republicans is a vote
against what the president has done, I probably would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Broxton, 45, the manager of a Longview tile company,
said she would be a firm Democratic vote this year, in part because
she thought party leaders would press for a ``somewhat quicker
resolution'' of the Clinton matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just dirty pool, the way the Republicans are making too
much out of all this,'' Ms. Broxton said. ``They went too far, way
too far, and all it's done is hurt the United States. This process
makes us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy Kennedy, 42, a welder and construction worker who usually
votes Democratic but passed on voting at all in 1994, said she
thought the Republicans were behaving ridiculously by going after
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is between him and Hillary, and if I were
Hillary I'd slap him silly,'' she said. ``But it's not the
Republicans' business to be slapping him silly over this.''

 ON WEST BANK OF HUDSON, COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as its steel skeleton for a 420,000-square-foot office
building at 90 Hudson St. on the Jersey City, N.J., waterfront is
starting to rise, Hartz Mountain Industries has purchased another
acre of Colgate Center, where it plans to erect an identical
12-story building at a location designated as 70 Hudson St.
</P>
<P>
   Development is proceeding apace on the west bank of the Hudson
River, even as nervousness in financial markets is slowing
transactions in Manhattan. At its Newport development in Jersey
City, the Lefrak Organization is building a 575,000-square-foot
office complex. Just to the north, in Hoboken, SJP Properties has
full approvals for a 1.1 million-square-foot office tower called
Waterfront Corporate Center and expects to begin building in the
spring if an anchor tenant can be signed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the securing of an anchor tenant, the mutual fund manager
Lord Abbet, to a 20-year lease for 150,000 square feet _ and the
rush to meet a deadline _ that motivated the $10 million purchase
of the 70 Hudson site, said Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in the location and we had an option we had to
execute,'' Stern said. He said the Lord Abbet lease at 90 Hudson,
which enabled Hartz to secure longterm financing on the building,
encouraged the company to invest its own money in the land at 70
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The 70 Hudson site includes the 25-foot-high Colgate clock,
which was on the roof of the Colgate-Palmolive factory at the site
until the factory was closed in 1989, and will be moved before
excavation begins. Its future location has not yet been decided,
but people associated with the project said the intention was to
place it so that it will be easily visible.
</P>
<P>
   Hartz Mountain's actions at the two sites, Stern said, reflect
the ability of private developers to move quickly, regardless of
what is happening in securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he expressed some glee at the recent difficulties of
real estate investment trusts, whose activities have been curtailed
by their plunging stock prices. ``The REITs are dead in the
water,'' he said. ``They hit all their numbers, but Wall Street has
turned fickle and they can't print stock anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The REITs, or real estate investment trusts, had been using
operating partnership units, which eventually convert to common
stock, to make acquisitions without immediately triggering capital
gains taxes for the seller. With a low stock price, REITs are
reluctant to issue more stock and dilute the value of existing
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our own money into our deals,'' said Stern. And he said
that the success in finding an anchor tenant at 90 Hudson
demonstrates that traditional sources of finance are available for
developers who build properties that are attractive and priced
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get tenants, then we get taken out by insurance
companies and pension funds,'' he said, referring to the long-term
financing that replaces, or takes out, the developer's interim
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the success of past projects is an encouragement for
developers to press ahead. According to a third-quarter report by
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the vacancy rate for Class A space in Hudson
County, almost all of it on the waterfront, is just 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Class A vacancy rates in midtown Manhattan in the low
single digits and rents rising, many firms in New York are being
forced to look elsewhere in the region for office space, observes
Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, a Manhattan-based
firm. ``Most service companies in New York _ and they constitute
the bulk of tenants _ are looking for rents that begin with a 2 or
a 3,'' Cohen said, explaining that he meant rents ranging from the
high $20s to low $30s per square foot annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``That simply is out of the question in midtown,'' he said,
adding that some formerly fringe areas in Midtown South that had
previously been available were filled up as well. Given that the
buildings on the New Jersey waterfront are new and equipped with
the latest technology and just a few stops on the PATH trains from
Manhattan, they become an attractive alternative. ``It's the sixth
borough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Steven Pozycki, president of SJP Properties, said it was
wrong to think of the waterfront as part of the New Jersey office
market, despite the political jurisdiction. ``The west bank of the
Hudson is really part of the New York market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of sizable tracts of land in the old industrial
locations on the waterfront allows developers to offer prospective
tenants large floors that are almost impossible to find in
Manhattan. ``We are offering floor plates of 95,000 square feet,''
Pozycki said. ``In New York it would take two generations to
assemble enough land for floors like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Big footprints mean that buildings can be more efficient in
several ways: For example, there is less need for common areas,
such as elevator lobbies and reception areas, providing more work
space. And 12- to 14-story buildings, which are what is being
proposed and built on the waterfront, require fewer elevator shafts
than much taller buildings erected on smaller plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less penetration by elevators, so the space is more
efficient,'' said Joseph Hilton, who is a managing director of CB
Richard Ellis and specializes in the New Jersey waterfront. ``And
the availability of land means that it is easier and cheaper to
build than in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Lincoln Harbor development in Weehawken had
the room to add 1.4 million square feet of office space.
</P>
<P>
   Both developers and brokers emphasize the extensive
transportation infrastructure of the area, with train, bus and
highway links that are available to take workers from the suburban
areas of New Jersey to the waterfront. And they note that the PATH
trains provide quick service to both midtown and downtown
Manhattan, as do a growing fleet of ferries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, construction has begun for a light-rail system on
the west bank of the Hudson that will run north and south in an
area where most public transportation is oriented east and west.
Phase One of the system is scheduled to be completed from Bayonne
as far north as Hoboken by the spring of 2000, with further
extensions under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   This may add appeal for the young professionals who are drifting
into places like Hoboken as it has recovered from the industrial
drabness of the past. ``We are seeing the children of families that
moved out of Hoboken moving back in for the quality of life,''
observed Pozycki.
</P>
<P>
   Development on the riverfront appears different from other
office developments in northern New Jersey, said Norman Baker, a
senior managing director of Insignia/ESG. ``As New Jersey grew,
people clustered near the bridge and the two tunnels,'' he said.
``As they got comfortable they moved farther west. Companies that
started out right by the bridge in Fort Lee are in Parsippany now.
But the ones in Jersey City don't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   With rents in midtown Manhattan moving north of $40 a square
foot for less than state-of-the art space, brokers say brand-new
waterfront space on the New Jersey side of the Hudson can be
obtained from the high $20s for tenants who are the first to commit
to a project to the low $30s for those who follow later.
</P>
<P>
   But rents alone do not constitute the whole economic picture,
real estate executives say. New Jersey does not have New York
City's occupancy or local personal income tax and there are a
variety of financial incentive programs available to further lower
corporate tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of area development programs available and the
savings can be fairly substantial,'' said Joseph Romano, executive
vice president of Grubb &AMP; Ellis' New Jersey office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attractions of the waterfront, many companies are
apparently reluctant to pre-lease space, which favors companies
like Lefrak and Hartz Mountain, which can finance their own
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a project gets into the ground, the corporate guys
will make a commitment,'' Romano said. ``It really is, `If you
build it, they will come.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all its economic attractions, the waterfront offers
something that might be just as important as it is intangible _
magnificent views of Manhattan. Waterfront buildings offer an
unbroken view across the Hudson to the city's forest of
skyscrapers. ``People are attracted to the area because of the
quality of life and the views of New York,'' Pozycki said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I get excited by the journey,'' says Shawn Ray, a leading
contender for the Mr. Olympia title, the most prestigious in
professional bodybuilding. ``I see a little change in a muscle, I
go, `Oh, boy, look at that.' I mean you don't get excited eating
chicken and egg whites, working out, then tanning for an hour, then
feeling so depleted you've got to work out all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Diverted, I ask, ``Why do black guys need a tan?''
</P>
<P>
   Ray snorts. ``Same reason you do. To get darker, to get that
polish under the lights. I am a commodity, a product. I sell
charisma, performance. People look at me, 5-foot-7, weighing only
214 pounds, and my body seems attainable, or at least I am someone
you can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   I demur. ``Identify? I could be inspired by how you've sculpted
your body, but it's too extreme to identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray sits very still when he talks, but throbs with a contained
energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extreme?'' he says. ``I think Kerry Strug is extreme, a
4-foot-11-inch, 80-pound gymnast. Who would want to identify with
that? Why is she America's darling? Or some 350-pound NFL lineman.
That's extreme. And by the way, find out what chemicals he's taking
before you come ask us what we're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking Mr. Olympia contestants what they are taking is not all
that risky; the 18 bodybuilders who competed at Madison Square
Garden Saturday night tended to be friendly, good-looking men in
their 30s, superheros in their hometown gyms, and relaxed in the
sophistication of their pharmacology. At one time or another,
almost all have used various combinations of chemicals to get that
ripped, shredded, full look.
</P>
<P>
   You can make them laugh by asking about Mark McGwire's use of
the legal supplement androstenedione, which boosts the body's
production of testosterone. They think andro is candy, relatively
useless, and they slyly suggest that the home-run king probably
uses stronger stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne DeMilia, promoter of Mr. Olympia and an official of the
International Federation of Bodybuilding, says he does not test for
steroids because his athletes would then switch from injectables to
the less detectable but ``more toxic'' oral doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test for diuretics, which can kill you the same day,''
DeMilia said. ``We've lost two athletes in recent years and had
several close calls. We're worried right now about blood
thickeners, which drain water out of your skin. Muscles show right
through. I'm also worried about insulin use. Steroids are probably
the safest thing they use.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Coleman, at 285 pounds one of the bigger competitors this
year, thinks that what is in your bloodstream is less important
than what is in your genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you could take some injections and look like me?''
he asked, lounging on his hotel room bed. His girlfriend, Vickie
Gates, who later this month will compete for the Ms. Olympia title
in Prague, Czech Republic, was cooking one of his six daily meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are genetic freaks,'' said Coleman, an engaging 34-year-old
with an easy laugh. ``And we work very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has always worked hard. A high school football star, it
took him three years to crack the starting lineup at Grambling as a
middle linebacker. By that time, he realized that he didn't love
the violent contact and wasn't that good _ the pros were not
interested. After graduating with honors in accounting, he spent
two years as a Domino's Pizza manager figuring out that he didn't
love numbers that much, either. He answered an ad for police
officers in Arlington, Tex., and during training began intensive
weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   The gym owner offered him a free membership if he would compete
in the Mr. Texas bodybuilding contest. He won it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love it, 10 years later,'' he said. ``I like the
training, but I love the way people look at me, the comments, what
they have to say about my body. I won Mr. Universe in 1991 and
turned pro. The next year I entered Mr. Olympia and came in dead
last. Like I was invisible. But now they say I'm a front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Mr. Olympia title and its $110,000 first prize is
up for grabs this year with the absence of Dorian Yates, who won
the last six contests. He is sidelined with torn muscles. Despite
Yates' dominance, he is not well known outside bodybuilding, a
measure of the sport's status since the Arnold Schwarzenegger era
ended. Schwarzenegger became a cross-over superstar after Mr.
Olympia victories in 1974 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about comparing myself to Arnold,'' Coleman
said, almost dreamily. ``That charisma, that intelligence. Funny.
Classy. And the man can act.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Ray, a 33-year-old from Chino Hills, Calif., is not likely
to compare himself to anyone but Shawn Ray, who needs only ``the
gold card'' of a Mr. Olympia title, he says, to ``GO.'' But
muscling into the mainstream, from a sport that is barely
recognized as such, will be hard. Bodybuilding's image of
narcissism, drug use and eroticism turns off many potential
sponsors, even as those images _ often directly borrowed from

   Coleman the cop just wants to pose and pursue bad guys; his
``hybrid of aesthetics and mass,'' say the heavy-breathing muscle
mags, may be ``the physique of the future.'' But Ray the commodity
wants bodybuilding to purge its skulking drug gurus, its soft porn
magazines, the ``he-she'' women contestants on high-dose
testosterone, and get back to promoting the likes of him.

   ``I'm an athlete, but when I look at myself in the mirror I see
a work of art,'' he said. ``I'm in the process of enhancing myself.
When I weighed 180 pounds, I had a girlfriend who thought I was big
enough. She didn't want me to get any bigger. I dumped her. Who is
to say your thighs are too big, your legs too smooth? Who is to say
the `Mona Lisa' is better than a painting by Picasso?''

   (NYT12) NORTH HAVEN, Conn. -- Oct. 10, 1998 --
CONN-ANIMAL-TRAPPING, 10-10 -- Bill Mannetti, an animal rights
advocate for 12 years and founder of Animal Rights Front, has bid
on the exclusive right to trap animals on parcels of state property
-- then in effect declared the land a trap-free zone. ``We went to
the ground,'' says Mannetti. ``It's public land, our land. We had
no choice but to enter the program and, in a sense, to undermine
it. We'll spare some animals from very hard, cruel deaths.''

CO-OP ADMISSIONS: DOING THE NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the thicket of assessing the finances of prospective co-op
purchasers _ with its tangle of documents, murky requirements,
competing interests and board-member egos _ a would-be buyer's
application can be impaled on a thorn.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the case of a local storekeeper who wanted to
buy an apartment at Concord Village, a seven-building complex in
the eastern shadows of the Brooklyn Bridge, where prices range from
$30,000 for a studio to $150,000 for a two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   For want of a paragraph in a letter from his daughter's school,
the storekeeper was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   It was a prestigious private school, costing about $15,000 a
year, ``and with what they were showing on their tax returns,''
said Claudia Corwin, president of the Concord Village board, ``we
did not see how they could pay for this school, as well as their
real estate obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how subtle a lot of this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The board requested the letter after the storekeeper mentioned
during his interview that his daughter was in a private school. The
board was hoping, Ms. Corwin said, ``that the couple was getting
financial aid from the school, that their income wouldn't have to
cover that expense.'' They were claiming an income of about
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the letter came and it said nothing about financial aid,
indicating that the money for the school was coming out of their
pockets,'' Ms. Corwin said. ``And, therefore, we concluded that if
they could afford the school, obviously they had cash they weren't
telling us about _ a little thing like that, that the letter from
the school didn't mention financial aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the vagaries of the financial assessment process faced
by scores of hopeful buyers in a real estate market that _ despite
the buckling of some foreign economies and the gyrations of Wall
Street _ has, so far at least, continued to percolate.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers and others involved in the co-op market say the demand
for high-priced apartments, especially in Manhattan, has allowed
co-op boards in many white-glove buildings to retain or tighten
financial requirements. But boards in many middle-class buildings,
particularly in the other boroughs and the suburbs where the
effects of the last recession lingered longer, remain relieved to
be making sales, and more readily approve applications _ albeit a
bit more fussily.
</P>
<P>
   Fussiness, however, is not necessarily akin to precision. And
applicants _ no matter their financial status _ must deal with an
assessment process that lacks standardized requirements. Boards in
high-end buildings tend to demand that a buyer have reserve assets
that are multiples of the purchase price. In midpriced buildings,
boards are more concerned about what the proportion of an
applicant's maintenance and loan obligations would be to his
income. But in terms of required percentages, there are no set
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   As for recent zigs and zags in the financial markets, said Clark
Halstead, founder of the brokerage that bears his name, co-op
boards at the high end ``are case-hardened against knee-jerk
reactions.'' If an applicant's wealth is in stocks, Halstead said,
``what's happened recently is a 20 percent decline in that person's
net worth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, frankly,'' he said, ``20 percent is not enough to change
the picture for most boards with respect to approving that
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Halstead sees the approval process as ``the most thorough
invasion of your financial privacy that you'll ever suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this inquisition,'' he said, ``has not gotten better in
recent years. It's gotten a little worse. But in the past few weeks
there's been no change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle-priced range, said Herb Rose, a co-op consultant,
``the standards have relaxed considerably because there was such a
long period when it was impossible to sell an apartment,'' and some
owners even abandoned their homes after failing to meet their
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   At buildings still haunted by memories of sales droughts and
defaulting owners, Rose said: ``The boards want apartments to move
because they can't keep taking them back. So I don't perceive that
middle-range boards are becoming extremely cautious because
apartments are selling for little money, and there's relief that
there are some sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, whatever the price range, the approval process can be
stressful _ for both buyer and board.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harrison is the manager of River House, a 213-unit co-op
on 16 manicured acres in Peekskill, N.Y., where a two-bedroom sells
for about $80,000. ``It's amazing,'' she said. ``When people start
this process, I am straightforward: `We are going to run a TRW
credit check and a driver's license check. Be honest about any
problems.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `No problem, my credit is great.' And then
you run it and they have judgments, bankruptcies, chronic late
payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrison recalled one applicant who ``looked very
professional, like out of a catalog; this person said, `No
problem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a good administrative job, about $80,000 in income.
But the TRW was atrocious _ nothing paid on time, student loans
unpaid, bankruptcy. And she thought she was clean.''
</P>
<P>
   For the buyer, the process can seem like slogging through a
swamp seeded with mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no single standard, unfortunately, perhaps,'' said
Sylvia Shapiro, author of ``The Co-op Bible,'' a guidebook
scheduled for release in December by St. Martin's Griffin. ``It's
unfortunate for the buyer because he may not know what he's up
against. For the board, the lack of an objective standard may allow
them to make determinations without the buyer able to hold them to
account.''
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, said Ms. Shapiro, who is also
board president at the 229-unit Randall House in Greenwich Village,
``every building has its own financial and emotional persona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some board members get Napoleon complexes,'' she said, and
``try to be heroes and impose standards that they certainly could
not meet themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That creates friction between potential shareholders buying at
today's prices and entrenched board members who bought back in the
days when apartments could be had for a song.'' Not to mention
current shareholders seeking to sell, perhaps immobilized in their
hopes of closing on another home.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, however, has become standard in recent years. ``If
there is one currently commonplace requirement,'' said Stuart Saft,
chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, ``it is that the
applicant provide tax returns for at least two years. Ten years
ago, boards never asked for tax returns. It was considered too
intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   But intrusion has plumbed new depths in recent years _ perhaps
of necessity. As Rose, the co-op consultant, pointed out: ``We are
in a more complex world in which few people have only one income
source. Whereas years back a salaried person would give you their
W-2, and that was their income, now almost everybody has interest,
stock profits, capital gains on a real estate transaction, maybe
another business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the practical way to determine income is really to get
their tax forms.''

 &HT;    Fate of Everglades in judge's hands
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ten years ago today, the federal
government filed a landmark lawsuit accusing Florida of polluting
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Since then:
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers have spent more than $20 million on lawyers and $137
million to start a 12-year cleanup project.
</P>
<P>
   The Feds have become allies with the state but are fighting the
lawyer who filed the suit for them.
</P>
<P>
   The pollution continues _ and probably will for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the case may finally reach a rare milestone: a
ruling from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler could merely ratify the
status quo, accepting the $763 million plan that Tallahasse and
Washington have agreed upon for cleaning polluted farm drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Miami judge, best known for presiding over the trial of
Manuel Noriega, could send the Everglades case spinning.
</P>
<P>
   He could declare the plan unconstitutional, require dramatically
shorter deadlines or appoint a federal overseer, as
environmentalists have requested at various times. State officials
say those steps would raise the costs and delay the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler even mused last year that he could call the case to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   All he has said lately is that he intends to rule _ on
something.
</P>
<P>
   It would be his first major move since February 1992, when he
accepted a state-federal settlement that later drowned in
challenges by the sugar industry. He never has accepted the state's
current cleanup plan or its December 2006 deadline, even though the
federal lawyers asked him to three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the sugar industry, which is blamed for the bulk of
the pollution, say it's time for Hoeveler to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that industry-financed research proves that the
Everglades' pollution problems, exaggerated to begin with, are
already ebbing. And they say the suit has served its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need a federal court with a hammer over our heads
when there's a plan in place that is working?'' asked Barbara
Miedema, spokeswoman for the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of
Florida. ``The Everglades are not on the brink of collapse, as some
would like you to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and the Miccosukee Indian tribe maintain
that Hoeveler may be the only force that can keep the state from
abandoning the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's oversight and pressure to do it, we don't think
it can get done,'' said Miccosukee attorney Dexter Lehtinen. ``We
believe the government's going to get rid of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen was acting U.S. attorney a decade ago when he filed the
lawsuit accusing the state and the South Florida Water Management
District of funneling polluted farm drainage into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tribe's lawyer, Lehtinen has filed numerous legal
challenges against the 1994 cleanup plan that eventually arose from
his suit. Last month, he won a ruling from another federal judge
that the plan violates the U.S. Clean Water Act by letting
pollution persist until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, including the Florida Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club, want Hoeveler to make water managers finish the
cleanup by July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline water managers agreed to seven years ago,
before lawmakers approved the current plan. But they say it would
be impossible to meet that deadline now.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen said he will accept the 2006 deadline _ but not the
government's promises. He pointed to a recent court filing by the
U.S. Justice Department, which acknowledged that the cleanup will
probably miss some of the deadlines the government is asking
Hoeveler to approve.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen wants Hoeveler to appoint an expert, called a special
master, to keep track of the cleanup. He said it's a common
procedure in complex suits such as cases involving prison crowding.
</P>
<P>
   But water district lawyer Paul Nettleton said a special master
would only tangle an already complicated case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know one day to the next what Dexter is claiming,''
Nettleton said.
</P>
<P>
   The district, the state and the Justice Department have asked
Hoeveler to accept the state's plan. It relies on creating 66
square miles of marshes in Palm Beach and Hendry counties to filter
polluted water flowing into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The drainage is laden with phosphorus, a chemical found in
fertilizer and the Glades' muck soil.Government scientists say the
phosphorus is causing thick stands of cattails to spread, driving
out saw grass and making it hard for wading birds to hunt. They say
the chemical also is killing the brown algae that form the base of
the Everglades' food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hoeveler's inaction, the state's Everglades Forever Act
of 1994 required water managers to start the cleanup. They finished
the first of six filter marshes last year and are in the middle of
building three others.
</P>
<P>
   The marshes can't remove all the phosphorus, and government
scientists say some other technology _ possibly doubling the price
_ will have to make the water clean enough for the Everglades'
health.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar industry scientists dispute those claims, arguing that
government research has exaggerated everything from the spread of
the cattails to the harm caused by phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Hoeveler rules, the cleanup will lie under numerous
legal clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges by the Miccosukees have snarled key permits, and
water managers are feuding with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
over the terms of their federal dredging permit. Environmentalists
also have sued the district to try to make growers pay more of the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But water managers have overcome other hurdles, including a
now-vanished budget deficit that they once expected to exceed $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm ``Bubba'' Wade, senior vice president for United States
Sugar Corp., said he sees a pattern: Under Hoeveler's watch,
once-intractable problems have simply found solutions _ maybe
better ones than if he had ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look back on all this 10 years from now,'' Wade said,
``we may find that Hoeveler was the smartest of all of us.''

 UNDATED: tax forms. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But complicating matters for board members, Ms. Shapiro said, is
the fact that they ``can never be certain that a tax return
reflects reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow-up questioning sometimes indicates that not everybody
is totally candid with Uncle Sam,'' she said. ``It puts the board
in a conundrum: if they are not up front with Uncle, how will they
be with fellow shareholders?''
</P>
<P>
   There are, essentially, two financial components a board
considers in deciding whether to approve a sale _ or, in more
precise legal parlance, a transfer, because what is actually
happening is that stock and a proprietary lease are being
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misnomer to say you are purchasing a co-op apartment,''
Saft said. ``What you're purchasing is stock in the corporation
that owns the building and the right to live in a specific
apartment under a proprietary lease'' _ proprietary because the
buyer is both tenant and stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   One component of the board's inquiry is, obviously, to determine
the applicant's income; the other is to ascertain his or her net
worth _ assets less liabilities. The board's job is to determine
whether the applicant will be able to cover his or her regular
living expenses while paying off the apartment loan (commonly,
though technically incorrectly, called the mortgage), the
maintenance and any possible assessments for capital improvements
to the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking assessments should concern prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers and sellers wax poetic about all the improvements
because, of course, they enhance the building's value,'' Ms.
Shapiro said. ``But they are likely to be close-lipped about items
coming down the pike that will require an assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the building has recently been converted, the buyer might ask
to see the engineer's report commissioned by the tenants'
association, which will indicate work that may be needed. In an
established co-op, copies of board minutes for the last year or two
should indicate the work being considered. And, as Ms. Shapiro
said, ``I see nothing wrong, although it would be considered
revolutionary, for the buyer to ask, `What's coming up?' In my
seven years on the board, only one buyer took the trouble to get my
phone number and ask. She earned my respect, not my annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial inquiry process begins after the buyer and seller
agree on a price and sign a contract, followed by a period during
which the purchaser prepares a ``board package'' _ folders full of
documents _ with the broker learning the board's requirements and
acting as go-between. During the same period, assuming it is not an
all-cash deal, the buyer will apply for an apartment loan, with
most boards requiring a down payment of at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot submit the package until they get the mortgage
commitment,'' said JoAnne Kennedy, president of Coldwell Banker
Hunt Kennedy, a Manhattan brokerage. ``It may take four weeks to
get the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the papers are submitted, the building's managing agent
reviews the documents, then presents them to the board. If, after
picking the package apart to make sure the pieces fit, the board
tentatively approves, the buyer will be invited for an interview _
itself an arduous encounter, with designated board members
frequently demanding more explanation and documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process may take another month after the mortgage
commitment,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ``So there may be two months
between contract signing and board approval. That's two months the
seller doesn't know what to do. They can't show the apartment
because they are in contract; they can't purchase a new home.''
</P>
<P>
   One pioneering board, however, is taking steps to abbreviate the
process. Harold Spitzer, the president of 400 West End Ave., at the
corner of 79th Street, said his board would vote this month on a
policy of reviewing financial packages before buyers have received
loan commitments. ``We wouldn't approve the buyer before the
commitment is secured,'' he said, ``but we would review the
package. There's no reason to hold up the buyer or the seller on a
technicality; no reason not to let them off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a board has a buyer's financial package in hand, it will
first scrutinize the assets and then, in effect, write a budget to
assess the applicant's ability to meet his obligations. And, given
that there are no standard formulas for that assessment, there are
general principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``All buildings now are looking for a financial cushion, and
certain boards want more feathers than others,'' said Ms. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Many boards, she pointed out, had to take back apartments during
the last recession, ``so they want the buyer to have a minimum of
three months' mortgage and maintenance in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fussier boards, where they are looking at gigantic
mortgages _ a million and up _ want a reserve equal to or more than
the apartment cost,'' she said. ``And some East Side buildings want
assets that are multiples of the apartment price.''
</P>
<P>
   If the buyer has sufficient funds for an ``all-cash'' purchase,
the board will be less concerned about net worth. But not always.
``We had an out-of-town, fat-cat dad who bought his aspiring model
daughter an apartment with all cash,'' said Ms. Shapiro. ``But
until she made the cover of Vogue, she had no visible means of
support. So we asked, and dad agreed, to deposit a year's
maintenance into escrow. That way, the buyer got fast-track
approval and the board got financial protection.''
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the buyer is taking out a loan, the board will
examine its terms, again to determine whether the buyer can meet
his obligations. This is particularly true in small co-ops where
one shareholder's failure can overwhelm the others.
</P>
<P>
   There are four apartments in the brownstone on Pacific Street in
Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where David Becker is board manager and
everybody else is on the board. ``We had one unit purchased six
months ago by a woman who insisted that her boyfriend live in the
apartment,'' Becker said. ``But her income looked like it did not
support her financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is, not reporting the boyfriend's income was hurting
her. So we asked for his income statements _ and she was also able
to produce stubs showing she recently had a pay increase _ but all
we could gather from his W-2's was that he was in construction.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was an architect and construction manager for a
large renovation firm. Between them, Becker said, ``All problems
were solved.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are no set, objective standards, there are
guidelines _ based on the building's location. ``A Fifth Avenue
building will have a more restrictive formula than one in
Canarsie,'' said Saft. ``And one formula used in restrictive
buildings is that the buyer's net worth be at least double the
purchase price.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high-end market, with buyers willing to pay stratospheric
prices, boards for exclusive buildings demand high net worth. ``And
it's justified,'' Saft said. ``An apartment that sold three years
ago for $1.5 million may now sell for $3 million. Boards have to
question the unit's intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the value could double in three years, it could also halve.
And, therefore, a buyer financing half the apartment would have no
equity if the price went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shapiro added: ``Prices have escalated to such dizzying
levels that the bank, not the buyer or seller, may scuttle the
deal. The button-down banker may say, `Wait a minute, this
apartment is not worth $3 million,' and not lend unless the price
is reduced.''

 UNDATED: is reduced. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In less restrictive buildings, boards are less interested in net
worth and look for a monthly income about three times the
combination of the buyer's maintenance and debt service. ``That's
the modern version of the old formula that housing costs should be
25 percent of your income,'' Saft said. But in New York's expensive
market, that 25 percent is now closer to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If before the current market your housing costs were $1,000 a
month, then you would have needed $4,000 in income to get
approval,'' Saft said. ``Now they approve buyers with incomes as
low as $2,500.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he explained, less expensive buildings have
reduced income requirements to accommodate shareholders trying to
sell. ``To do this they have to accept people with a lower income
in proportion to their expenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some less-restrictive boards have informal formulas correlating
an applicant's income to the size of the apartment he or she is
seeking. At River House in Peekskill, Ms. Harrison said, the
guidelines are $30,000 in income to buy a studio, $40,000 for a
one-bedroom and $50,000 for a two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are just that, guidelines,'' she said. ``You could
have someone who meets a guideline salary-wise, but when you look
at their TRW their expenses are over-extended. You could have
somebody who makes $100,000, but just blows it. Or you could have
someone who makes a moderate salary, but has low expenses. You
really have to look at all aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain aspects, of course, can be problematic. And as a broker,
Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, is fully aware
of them, particularly for high-end buyers: ``Too-new money. Lack of
references from well-placed people. High salaries without strong
assets. New York as a secondary residence. Overseas assets. Parents
buying for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at any income level, Ms. Corcoran said, ``The hardest is
someone who is self-employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Pennisi, a real estate lawyer who advises boards, concurs:
``There are people in cash businesses, honest people. But they just
can't document, dollar for dollar, their income.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the boards Pennisi advises ``had a hot dog vendor; good
income, in the $50s or $60s; but if the hot dog business drops, if
he gets a cold corner, the income drops.'' The board, Pennisi said,
``liked the guy, nice personality; he checked out with prior
landlords, but he didn't have a credit history.'' The solution:
``This guy put up six months' maintenance, and they approved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-op boards are not required by law to give the reason for a
rejection, and most lawyers advise them not to offer explanations
because they can be become the basis of litigation. But the boards
must abide by city, state and federal discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corcoran contends there is one underlying reason for most
board rejections _ failure to disclose. ``It's not that they don't
have it, whatever a board is looking for, but that they don't show
it,'' she said. ``And they don't show it because of the common
false belief that `the board will meet me and I'll explain.' Ninety
percent of board turndowns happen without an interview because
something wasn't disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Ms. Shapiro, author of ``The Co-op Bible,'' when asked
what she might include in a Ten Commandments for Hopeful Buyers,
came up with seven:
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out what the board requires, ``and give them what they
are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't submit information in dribs and drabs. ``Be neat and
complete the first time around, otherwise you will rue your errors
when the board engages in a war of attrition, seeking more
documents than the Lewinsky grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't edit out pages on your tax returns that you don't like,
and don't add zeroes to your net worth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many boards require that a net-worth affidavit be signed by an
accountant; get it signed before you submit.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are selling another piece of property, inform the
board. ``That indicates you will have less debt than might be
apparent from a casual glance at your application.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If your application is contingent on financing, first get a
loan commitment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid inconsistency. ``We regularly get applications with one
set of numbers on the loan application, another on the net worth
affidavit, a third on the financial statements. If you do that, the

PARCELLS HAPPY WITH JETS' CHOICES THAT GAVE RAMS PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In a sense, the Jets will confront their recent past
when they face the Rams here on Sunday. And they will get to see
how their present is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   The first major deal of the Bill Parcells era was a trade with
the Rams in which the Jets produced seven players as a byproduct of
trading the No. 1 choice in the draft to St. Louis. The Rams used
that top pick to select Orlando Pace, the tackle from Ohio State,
now the anchor of a solid offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seven players who became Jets, running back Leon
Johnson and wide receiver Dedric Ward, will have an expanded role
on Sunday. The Jets not only have to offset running back Curtis
Martin's thigh injury (he will probably not even get into the
game), but they will also be trying to take the pressure off
quarterback Glenn Foley, who is returning after a two-game layoff
because of a rib injury _ a problem that apparently still bothers
him. Johnson and Ward have become very special specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the team's most versatile performer, running or
catching or returning kicks or making special teams tackles. Ward
is the dangerous third receiver and has averaged more than 18 yards
a reception. He also returns punts.
</P>
<P>
   And Pace? He is the bulwark of a line blocking for runners that
average 4.7 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   But as even Parcells admits, sometimes it takes years for trades
like these to prove themselves one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I right?'' Parcells asked before answering. ``I don't
know. You just felt there was so much to do in getting the Jets
righted.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace was the titanic 6-foot-7-inch, 320-pound product who was
generally considered the finest college player available once
quarterback Peyton Manning opted to remain at Tennessee for his
senior season. Indeed, during the 1996 season, Dick Haley, the
Jets' draft director, suggested that Pace could anchor the position
for 10 years and then go to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Jets coming off a league-worst 1-15 season, neither
Pace nor any other individual was what Parcells was looking for.
``I need volume,'' he explained then.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he began a series of moves. Parcells traded his top pick
for the Rams' first-round choice, which was No. 6 overall, and
third-, fourth- and seventh-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells then took the first-round pick and moved down to the
eighth spot, trading places with Tampa Bay, who also yielded a
fourth-round pick in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells wasn't done yet. The third-round choice he had obtained
from the Rams was exchanged for Denver's lower third-round choice,
with the Broncos including their sixth- and seventh-round picks as
part of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, one choice became seven. And from those seven
picks Parcells found four players who are playing prominent roles
with the Jets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting linebacker James Farrior, the first-rounder. (It is
uncertain that he will return from a knee injury, which kept him
sidelined the last three games, to face the Rams.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Ward, a third-rounder, is the No. 3 receiver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson, a fourth-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jason Ferguson, a starting defensive tackle, who was the
seventh-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   The dealing started because Parcells and Rams Coach Dick Vermeil
trust each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make it quick because I know what he means,'' Vermeil
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells added, ``When we agree on something, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells likes to say, ``We got lucky with Leon Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   He also points out: ``Sometimes you've got it all in place and
there's one player missing. You don't have a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   So Parcells isn't bragging, just yet, about trading away that
No. 1 pick. He knows that Pace could wind up in the Hall of Fame
and those now-flowering Jets could be just a footnote to the team's
history.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells, whose life is filled with superstitions, will not
say publicly what he probably believes _ that, for now, things have
worked out just as he planned.

KEEPING PACE ON PORT DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y., Va., N.J., Md., Pa., Ill., Mich., Minn, Wis.)   (jw) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To ensure the continued growth of commercial maritime
activity, public and private interests have recently undertaken
$278 million in maritime development in the 350-year-old port of
Boston, some of it just completed and the rest under way or in
planning.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, $16 billion has been invested in on-shore
improvement projects such as roads and distribution facilities in
the last decade that are also considered crucial to sustaining
shipping activity through the port.
</P>
<P>
   In August, work started on a publicly financed, $60 million
dredging project to deepen the harbor for large cargo ships. And
last month, a private developer started site demolition for
construction of a $40 million intermodal cargo port to handle
freight shipped by land, air or sea.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's deep-water harbor offers easy access to the city's
downtown financial district as well as to all the major forms of
transportation that surround and support it. The waterfront is
directly linked to New England's major interstate highway by a
truck road and to the airport by a tunnel, both of which opened
last year as part of a $10 billion project to modernize Boston's
downtown transportation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is under way for a project to provide passage into the
port for double-stack freight trains to the Middle West. Still
another project will bring a new rapid-transit line into the
1,000-acre port area, called the South Boston Seaport District.
</P>
<P>
   As these projects go forward, however, critics say that this
waterfront property should instead be used to develop more hotels,
offices and housing in addition to the $700 million convention
center that was recently approved. They also say that Boston has
fallen so far behind the commercial ports of New York/New Jersey
and Halifax, Nova Scotia, that such a large investment in the port
is wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd question the double-stack rail and the intermodal
programs,'' said Leo Donovan, vice president of the consulting firm
Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton Inc. ``Those facilities are more appropriate
for the North Atlantic ports that handle longer-distance cargo like
New York, Halifax and Hampton Roads, Va. I don't see reducing
Boston's port activity, but I'd question expanding it
substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, many commercial ports on the East Coast have
upgraded their facilities. As a result, the volume of containerized
cargo they handle has grown an average of 9 percent a year. In
Boston, the volume of containerized cargo has been fairly stable,
growing from 932,671 tons in 1987 to 1,114,450 tons in 1997,
according to Massport, an independent agency that owns and manages
the 1,000-acre waterfront as well as Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the major East Coast ports are vying to become the one or
two able to handle a new generation of super-large cargo ships,
Donovan said. The major cargo carried through these ports is oil
and its derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the leading contenders are the port of New York/New
Jersey, which this fall will start a $621 million dredging project,
and the ports around Norfolk, Va., where $500 million has been
invested on marine improvements since 1985. The secondary niche
ports will be Halifax, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that even a second-tier niche port is valuable to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the port fell out of use, it would create a tremendous
roadblock that would put us at a great competitive disadvantage,''
said Larry Liebenow, president of Quaker Fabric Corp. of Fall
River, Mass., which expects sales of $280 million this year and has
a work force of 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, this manufacturer of furniture fabric, about 50
miles south of here, has invested $80 million to modernize its
production equipment, mostly with machinery imported from Europe.
It has also begun an international export business, which had sales
of $40 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Without the port of Boston, the company would lose time, money
and its competitive edge, Liebenow said. ``The port has been key in
our ability to globalize,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Another port advocate, Robert Baldwin, deputy director of
industrial development for the Boston Redevelopment Authority,
noted that energy costs for residential as well business customers
in the region were already among the highest in the country. But
they would be even higher, he said, if oil products could not be
shipped here directly by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although containerized cargo volume has remained fairly steady,
Baldwin said, its value has risen almost 38 percent in a decade, to
$6.2 billion in 1997, from $4.5 billion in 1987. Bulk cargo,
particularly salt, jumped from 22,780 tons in 1987 to a million
tons last year, according to Massport, partly because a major New
York terminal went out of service last year. Based on this belief
in the port's future, Massport is overseeing the $278 million
improvement program. The $60 million dredging project, begun with
the Army Corps of Engineers, will make the harbor 40 feet deep. An
additional $18 million is earmarked to build a complex of new
fish-processing facilities, the first of which will open on the
North Jetty in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $110 million has been approved by the state
Legislature to raise bridges for double-stack rail service so that
the port can handle more freight going to the Middle West, said
Michael Leone, Massport's port director.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, $50 million in work was completed to upgrade and
reorganize three terminals. Conley Terminal in South Boston got a
new gatehouse, new unloading equipment and a 10-gate facility for
trucks. Across the channel in Charlestown, a terminal was improved
to process all Audi, Volkswagen and Subaru autos imported for sale
in New England, New Jersey, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and
Wisconsin. In East Boston, a new pier for lobster boats, a marina
for pleasure boats and a park were installed.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure improvements over a decade have used federal,
state, city and Massport funds. Interstate 93, the key regional
access route, is being rebuilt. The new haul road from the
interstate into the port was added and a third tunnel under the
harbor that connects the port area to the airport opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $4 billion has gone into cleaning the harbor
waters for fishing and recreational use. About $2 billion more in
improvements are under way at Logan Airport. A $300 million rapid
transit line and bridge are being developed for the port area,
Leone, the port director, said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Moore, professor of economic development at the University
of Massachusetts, hailed the improvements, saying Boston Harbor was
``an irreplaceable element'' of the region's economic
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   On a 10.7-acre site near Conley Terminal, International Cargo
Port-Boston L.L.C. is developing a new $40 million cargo facility.
Jacob Citrin, vice president, said that when the facility is
completed in the fall of 1999, it will provide 400,000 square feet
of space, with offices atop a modern freight facility designed by
Arrowstreet Inc., a Boston architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   M. John Vickerman, a principal in VZM/Transystems of Reston,
Va., a national transportation consulting concern, said that the
investments that Boston was making were needed if it was to
maintain any working port at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 20 years, growth in international trade could double
or triple the volume of cargo handled by American ports, Vickerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Boston is doing is critically important if it is to
maintain any working waterfront at all,'' he said.

BUYING A HOUSE FROM THE BLUEPRINTS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many buyers of new houses are taking advantage of a builders'
marketing strategy of selling houses from blueprints or scale
models at so-called preconstruction prices before model houses are
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Builders often presell jobs to establish some momentum and are
often willing to sell these houses at lower prices and at very
little profit because they will help fuel sales for the majority of
the job,'' said Michael Dubb, a partner with Lesley A. Lerner of
the Beechwood Organization, builders in Williston Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchasers who have a little bit of imagination and can
visualize what they are getting are often the beneficiaries of good
savings as well as choice locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubb, who is also co-president of the Long Island Builders
Institute, successfully used the strategy at a Melville, N.Y.,
project, Country Pointe, initially starting sales from space he
rented at the Huntington Hilton Hotel, close to the site. He was
able to place 40 houses under contract before building model
houses. ``So instead of building just the models and a sales
pavilion, I started the job by building the models plus 40 homes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Pointe development is now completely sold, and Dubb
has adopted the same marketing tool in a Manorville, N.Y.,
development, Rockhill Woods, where Beechwood is building 51 houses
on lots of one to two-and-a-half acres. Sales began about eight
weeks ago. Even without models, the builders have placed 12 houses
under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The first five buyers got the best deals, paying $215,000 to
$325,000 for the four- and five-bedroom colonial and
Victorian-style houses, which range from 2,400 to 3,300 square
feet. Prices have increased and now range from $225,000 to
$350,000. But once models open in about a month, prices will rise
again, to a range of $250,000 to $400,000, Dubb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a self-education process, but by being the
first ones in, you already have equity because you know the builder
is going to raise his prices,'' said Christopher Rizzi, who with
his wife, Marie, was among the first buyers at Rockhill Woods. They
are paying $242,000 for their four-bedroom colonial. The price on
the same house has gone up $7,000 since they signed their contract
in July.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Preconstruction prices are also being offered at a Selden, N.Y.,
development called the Meadows at Old Town where Meadowood
Properties of Islandia is building 67 houses on quarter-acre lots.
</P>
<P>
   Models are still under construction. But that did not stop
Stephen Rubbo from signing a contract recently on a three-bedroom,
2,000-square-foot colonial priced at $199,990, even though he and
his girlfriend, Heather Rippe, had to visualize what it would look
like from blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd done a lot of looking at previously owned homes, the
neighborhood looked nice, the location was good and the
preconstruction prices they were offering we felt were pretty
good,'' said Rubbo, who works as a supervisor at a Hauppauge
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Neisloss, a principal of Meadowood Properties with his
partner, Douglas S. Partrick, said he expected to raise prices 5
percent around Nov. 1, when the models open. Prices now range from
$199,990 to $244,990.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of preconstruction sales, Neisloss said, is
``getting an immediate cash inflow while you are setting up shop,
so to speak.'' He added that ``it also becomes a real sales
incentive when buyers see that others have committed money and that
the builder is going forward with the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Early buyers at a development of 57 houses in Huntington called
Timber Ridge at Huntington, which opened last March, saved up to
$25,000 by purchasing from blueprints. Twenty of the 57 houses were
placed in contract before models opened.
</P>
<P>
   Preconstruction prices on the four- to five-bedroom colonials,
which range from 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, were from $245,000 to
$310,000. With all but 11 of the 57 houses sold, prices are now
$270,000 to $330,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to visualize a house from blueprints, and it's
a leap of faith for people, but we have been building in this area
for a long time, so that gives them a degree of confidence,'' said
Donald M. Eversoll of Klein &AMP; Eversoll of Commack, the project's
developer. ``The real point is, in a tough market a builder is not
going to sell from blueprints because people have lots of choices
and their position is, `I want to see what I'm going to buy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market, where there aren't a lot of choices, and
particularly if you're in a prime area, you're able to say to the
buyer, `Show a little faith, and you'll be able to save some
money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Josephine DeStefano, who with her husband, John, were the first
buyers in the Huntington development, signed a contract last March
to purchase one of the 2,800-square-foot colonials for $275,000.
The same house is now selling for $288,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before making the commitment, they did a lot of research on the
builder, Mrs. DeStefano said. They also drove through other
developments built by Klein &AMP; Eversoll to see what they were like.
``We trusted, based on what we saw and based on their reputation,
and so far we are very pleased,'' Mrs. DeStefano said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though they only had drawings to work with, they were
able to customize the house for themselves and their three
children, Mrs. DeStefano said. For example, they enlarged the
kitchen, adding extra cabinets, added an office at the back of the
house and enlarged the den, expanding the house by 350 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers today are usually quite sophisticated, said Dennis
Esposito, owner of Realty Group Marketing in Smithtown, N.Y., which
is handling the marketing on several new projects where builders
are selling from blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing today is that many jobs open with just a
sales trailer,'' he said. ``We sit down with people and walk them
through the blueprints, and if they want to make changes we can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost, depending on how much time it takes the architect to
revise the plan, is usually minimal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, should a development fail to materialize, buyers are
protected because deposits made at the time a contract is signed _
typically 10 percent of the purchase price _ either go into an
escrow account or the builder is bonded by an insurance company, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of the payment is due when the house is completed
and the closing takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who purchase their houses from blueprints obviously take
more of a risk. Memories of bankrupt builders leaving behind
partly-developed projects during the recession of the early 90's
still linger.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, buyers all said they took common-sense
precautions such as checking out the builder's track record. ``If
you worry about everything, you're not going to have anything,''
said Rubbo, the Meadows at Old Town buyer. ``We made the decision,
`We've seen everything out there, it's a good price, so let's go
for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a 23-acre Dix Hills subdivision called the Estates at Half
Hollow, where the Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., is
building 20 houses on lots of an acre or more, five houses have
been placed under contract based on blueprints only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be putting up a model, but those who purchase prior to
the model are saving thousands of dollars,'' said Kim Mancini, the
marketing director for Park Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the Estates start at $639,000 for a four-bedroom
4,000-square-foot Victorian and go up to $784,000 for one with
4,500 square feet. By the time the final houses are sold, prices
will probably have risen $30,000 to $40,000, Ms. Mancini said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying from blueprints is not for everyone, said Marilyn Larsen
of Lane Realty in Great Neck, marketing consultants to builders.
``Some people need the ability to walk through a house and are
willing to take the risk that prices will be higher when the model
is open,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among her customers to benefit from a preconstruction deal,
however, were Michelle and Thomas Runfola, who signed a contract in
February 1997 to buy a four-bedroom colonial at a Melville
development called the Villages at Huntington after looking at a
plexiglass model. The project is being developed by
McGovern-Barbash of Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   The Runfolas, who moved into the house in August, paid $325,000.
The same house now sells for $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard to judge, but it looked like it would be a
beautiful home,'' Mrs. Runfola said. ``And if anything, it turned
out to be better than we expected.''

CONGRESS HITS SNAG ON EDUCATION SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aiming to turn the protracted budget talks into a
campaign advantage, President Clinton and Democratic leaders
Saturday insisted that Congress not leave town until it approves
new money to build schools, create after-school programs, and
decrease class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have sought the money all year, but they decided to
escalate the theme Friday during a White House meeting on strategy
for 11th-hour budget talks that are now under way. Republicans said
Clinton and his colleagues were merely creating an issue to carry
into the Nov. 3 elections, and that the president had failed to
negotiate seriously for his proposals until now, when Congress is
trying to wrap up its work for the year so that members can return
home for the fall election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has missed several deadlines for approving a spending
plan for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. It is now
working under a temporary plan that keeps the government running
until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As budget negotiations continued in meetings around the Capitol,
Democrats highlighted their push for education money in several
speeches and press conferences, previewing a message they will
carry into an election campaign dominated by news of Clinton's
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are selling our children short. Republicans are ready to
walk away without doing anything. But we won't let them,'' House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt said in a press conference that
featured teachers talking about the importance of small class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton used his weekly radio address to call on
Republicans to back his education plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were visibly irritated by the education campaign.
They said that if Clinton was serious about negotiating for his
proposals, he long ago would have provided a list of ``offsets,''
or proposed cuts to existing programs that could fund the
president's new plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president appears to be more interested in solidifying his
liberal base than in working with Congress on bipartisan solutions
to our problems,'' said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas
Republican who leads the House tax-writing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott said Clinton had chosen to
``demagogue'' the education issue rather than negotiate with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the late Democratic campaign had undermined the spirit
of cooperation needed to reach deals on a range of other remaining
issues, such as spending levels for hundreds of federal programs, a
possible tax cut, terms for carrying out the next census, and new
money for the International Monetary Fund, the agency arranging
emergency loans for nations hurt by the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Progress on talks over those issues appeared modest Saturday.
``We've still got a lot of issues that we're far apart on,'' White
House Chief of Staff Erskine B. Bowles said when leaving a meeting
with Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pessimistic about our ability to come to closure on a lot
of these things by Monday night, at the pace we're going,'' said
South Dakota's Thomas Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate.
Most government operations will end early Tuesday morning unless a
budget deal is signed or Congress and the president agree to
another short-term funding measure.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers seized on the education theme as a way to
energize them through the budget talks and into election season.
Smaller classes, more teachers, and new schools ``are all things
that, frankly, poll well in communities around the country,'' said
a top aide to a Democratic senator. ``If they go in the omnibus''
spending bill, ``it's clear that Democrats are responsible for
that. And if they don't, it's clear that Republicans dropped the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Saturday noted that Clinton in recent weeks helped
kill a five-year, $80 billion tax cut passed by House Republicans,
to be funded by future federal budget surpluses. His main weapon
against the tax cut was his argument that the money should instead
be set aside until a plan is found to shore up the Social Security
program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton wants ``to squander the surplus with a bunch of new
federal spending,'' said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said they had proved their commitment to
education by passing the Higher Education Act, which cut the
interest rate on new student loans and set spending for a host of
student-aid and teacher-training programs. Republicans said they
had also passed laws this year to improve vocational education and
Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing angry at times, Lott took to the Senate floor to rail
against ``pampered people who went to private schools'' and are now
pushing more federal control of public classrooms. Lott later told
reporters that ``of course, the president and vice president never
spent a day in public school in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans are proud to give more money to schools,
but they wanted decisions on how to use it to be made by local
officials rather than the federal government. ``Who do you trust on
education: the local officials, the parents, or Washington
bureaucrats?'' Lott asked.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the education spending and other programs has
been complicated by the lack of a sweeping settlement of lawsuits
against tobacco companies, which would have provided billions of
dollars to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Details of a tax cut were still being negotiated. The package is
expected to total about $9 billion over 10 years, with most of the
benefits going to businesses and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement seemed near on funding for the International
Monetary Fund. The White House is seeking $18 billion, which would
trigger other nations to give several times that amount to shore up
the IMF's reserves, now depleted by various rescue packages for
nations during the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been a champion of
the new education programs. His office said the president and
Democratic lawmakers are seeking:
</P>
<P>
   -- $1 billion this year to hire more teachers, the first step in
a $12 billion, seven-year plan to put 100,000 more teachers in
classrooms. Democrats say this would cut average class size in
kindergarten through third grade to 18, down from between 25 and 26
today.
</P>
<P>
   -- $3.3 billion over five years to help local and state
governments issue $22 billion in bonds for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   -- $200 million next year and in following years to create and
run after-school programs. Current annual funding for the program
is $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Additional money for literacy programs, which have been
promoted by Kennedy.

TEXAS ANSWERS OU'S DARE TO PASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Texas running back Ricky Williams can run.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that. Oklahoma knows that. They had nine men
waiting for him on every down, and he still had 139 yards on 31
carries with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   What many seemed to have forgotten is that the Longhorns can
pass, too.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite and receiver Wane McGarity combined
on the longest touchdown reception in Longhorns history _ a 97-yard
completion on a post route with 11:46 remaining in the third
quarter for a 24-3 lead. The touchdown eliminated the swooning
Sooners' hopes of coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach \Roffensive coordinator Greg\S Davis has always had the
mentality of not being passive on the goal line,'' Applewhite, a
redshirt freshman, said of the second-and-nine situation from the
Longhorns' 3. ``Their game plan was to stop Ricky, and I felt that
if they did that, we'd take it as a challenge to open it up. ...
Coach Davis said if they walk their safeties up, cut their
throat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners had been walking their safeties up to the line all
day to little avail. Williams gained 113 of his yards on 18 carries
in the first half, to which Applewhite added nine completions in 14
attempts for 129 yards and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Applewhite was not necessarily ``The Bomb,''
but he threw one: On third-and-six at the Texas 44, the Longhorns
lined up with a fullhouse backfield with Kwame Cavil in the middle.
Cavil went in motion, came out of the backfield and curled over the
middle, where Applewhite placed a perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-yard touchdown was, until McGarity's 97-yard reception,
the longest Longhorns touchdown catch since McGarity's 66-yarder
against Nebraska in the 1996 Big 12 Championship.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Longhorns hadn't exactly been known for
throwing deep. Before Cavil's reception, the longest Applewhite had
managed was a 42-yard pass against Kansas State and another against
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity had 153 yards receiving on six catches. Cavil had three
receptions for 93 yards. Applewhite amassed 293 yards on 14-of-27
passing, surrendering only the one first-half interception.
</P>
<P>
   Williams added three catches for 27 yards, a telling footnote to
his running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They literally played nine men in the box the whole game,''
Williams said. ``The receivers took advantage of that and had a
great game. I think we showed people we'll beat them with passing,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooners defensive coordinator Rex Ryan maintained the Sooners'
focus wasn't entirely on stopping the run, but OU's strategy belied
the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to spend so much attention in stopping him
\RWilliams\S that you're vulnerable in other areas,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Like, oh, maybe, the Longhorns' rejuvenated offensive threat _
the deep passing game.

A RITE OF NON-PASSAGE COMES TO END FOR 105TH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 105th Congress began with the reprimand of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and ended with launching an impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton. In between, lawmakers enacted the
smallest number of laws in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the two-year session made Harry S.
Truman's original ``do nothing'' 80th Congress 50 years ago look
hyperactive in comparison. Clinton had signed 241 bills into law by
late last week, 39 percent of the average of 612 laws per session
of Congress over the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, Newt Gingrich's Republicans shut down the government.
In 1998, Newt Gingrich and the Republicans shut down the
Congress,'' said House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, who
declared the 105th as ``the worst Congress that has ever sat in
this building.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to passage of the landmark balanced-budget
agreement of 1997 that included substantial tax cuts, the largest
highway-funding bill in history, and a higher-education measure
that will lower the costs of college for students as key
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But even GOP leaders acknowledge that making new laws was not
necessarily a priority for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy being so good, most Americans just checked
out of keeping a close eye on Washington,'' Ohio Representative
John Boehner, chairman of the Republican conference, said Friday.
``When the public is not engaged, things are going to flounder a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When Repubicans in 1995 took control of the House for the first
time in 40 years, Gingrich vowed to use congressional oversight to
ride herd on the Democratic White House. A recent Democratic report
found that 50 separate investigations of the Clinton administration
were under way in the House alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Congress has been one of investigation rather
than legislation,'' said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   This has not damaged the public's view of Congress, however.
Public opinion polls have consistently shown the public giving high
marks to Congress and high favorability ratings to their individual
representatives and senators.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner blames Clinton for much of the legislative inactivity,
particularly this year when the accelerated pace of independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation distracted the White
House. ``The president has just been AWOL,'' he said. ``Lots of
issues require presidential leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative priorities of both Republicans and Democrats
failed to become law. Republicans were unable to get an $80 billion
tax cut through the Senate, where GOP moderates balked at its size.
The Republican educational priorities, vouchers and educational
savings accounts, went down because of presidential vetoes. As the
session was ending, many measures pushed by social conservatives
that affected abortion rights and birth control had to be
jettisoned to get spending bills approved.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Democratic wish list landed in what Daschle called
``the GOP legislative landfill,'' including restrictions on
managed-care plans, campaign-finance reform, a minimum wage
increase, legsilation to regulate the tobacco industry, and money
for public school construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been one of the great unaccomplished sessions under the
Republican stewardship,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``It has been
marked by disorganization and avoidance.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Republicans became victims of their own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historic agreement last year on the balanced-budget plan
culminated three years of work,'' said Boehner, who said he
predicted in December that the pace would be slow this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Gingrich ``all the big issues have been dealt
with and the next phase is not ready yet.'' The next phase would
include long-term solutions to Social Security and Medicare and a
fairer tax code, issues that require broad bipartisan and public
consensus that can take years to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, the key architect of the House GOP majority, survived
his reprimand but was weakened enough that some rebellious
Republicans mounted an unsuccessful coup in the summer of 1997 to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the investigation into Clinton's relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky so dominated Washington that the languid
lawmaking barely attracted public notice. House members typically
flew into town for votes after 5 p.m. on Tuesdays and left late on
Thursdays for most of the year. The Congress met for the least
number of work days in decades, about five weeks less than the
average over the last 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the balanced-budget deal, congressional Republicans
clearly made a conscious decision to ratchet down sharply,'' said
Norman Ornstein, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
``Public sentiment that had been fairly clear for a while was, the
country is on a roll, we are very happy, so don't screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been frustrated by the way the Lewinsky story
dominated news coverage. They hope to make their unfinished agenda
a campaign issue in the final weeks up to the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy pushed this year for a
``Patient Bill of Rights'' that would have imposed new rules on
managed-care plans and allowed patients to sue their health care
providers. In a last-minute ploy on Friday, Senate Democrats
brought to the floor the Republican version of that bill, which had
been approved earlier by the House, to test if the GOP wanted a
managed-care bill to pass, but the measure as defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue now goes to the voters,'' Kennedy said after the
vote.

PENN IS VICTORIOUS OVER FORDHAM
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through the season's first four games, Fordham had
compensated for its suspect defense and rushing game with an
aggressive passing attack. On Saturday, Steve O'Hare and his
receivers provided a spectacular comeback, but no victory.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, displaying two potent weapons in quarterback Matt Rader
and running back Jim Finn, built a 20-point lead in the third
quarter and hung on to defeat the Rams, 34-31, at Jack Coffey
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you invested what our players invested, it's difficult
for people to comprehend what it might feel like after a defeat
like this,'' Fordham coach Ken O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Quakers (3-1) avoided becoming Fordham's third upset victim
by exploiting the Rams' weaknesses. The Fordham defense had allowed
350 yards a game. The Quakers gained 480. Fordham (2-3) had
averaged a paltry 88.8 yards a game rushing. Penn stuffed the Rams
into a measly 73.
</P>
<P>
   The Quakers, despite a shaky fourth quarter, are emerging as an
Ivy League favorite. Their only defeat came against Richmond, a
school with a scholarship program. Their victory prospects will
rely heavily on the health of Rader and Finn. Rader left the game
early in the third quarter with a gash on his right shoulder _
apparently caused by a defender's face mask _ and the quarterback
platoon of Reed Warner and Edward Mebs did not produce a point
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That let Fordham concentrate on stopping Finn. The Rams were
successful for a while, but in the game's waning moments they were
not. Finn, a 6-foot-1-inch, 240-pounder, helped the Quakers run the
clock out on the final drive by converting on a third-and-6 and a
fourth-and-1 as Fordham used up its timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Finn carried 29 times for 198 yards and 2 touchdowns, including
a 69-yard sprint in the first half. Rader, who need stitches for
the cut on his shoulder, completed 19 of 25 pass attempts for 256
yards and 3 touchdowns, including a 39-yard fluttering heave to
David O'Neill with four seconds left in the first half. The
touchdown made the score 27-14 just after the Rams had sprung to
life on O'Hare's 2-yard touchdown loft to Gerry McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, breaking tackles and outjumping the Quakers' shorter
defensive backs, caught nine passes for 125 yards and 3 touchdowns.
He played the fourth quarter with a sprained shoulder. When he
plucked his third scoring reception to make the score 34-20 in the
third quarter, one Penn assistant coach screamed, ``I can't believe
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare was even more unbelievable. Hobbled by a sprained right
ankle and harassed by Penn's rush, the senior quarterback still had
a career day. He connected on 23 of 37 passes for 323 yards and 4
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' O'Hare said. `'My dad came up to me and
said I played a good game. It wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost was. O'Hare's 24-yard touchdown pass to Chris Auferio
brought the Rams within 34-28 with 11 minutes 43 seconds left.
Meanwhile, the Rader-less Quakers could not advance the ball.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rams' final scoring march, O'Hare's third-down pass in
the end zone trickled off McDermott's fingertips, and the Rams
settled for Brian Colsant's 25-yard field goal, making the score
34-31 with 6:52 to go. The Rams went nowhere on their next drive,
and Finn ran 7 straight times to chew up the final 3:48.

NFC EAST: FROM BEAST TO LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cowboys, the only winning team in the once legendary NFC
East, are being heralded for having ``taken charge'' of the
division.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Cowboys are in charge of nothing. At 3-2, they are
a game up on the field with 11 to play, and the NFC East represents
the NFL's version of nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL's six divisions each are fraternities, then the NFC
East is ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to a division that produced five of six Super
Bowl champions from 1990 to 1995; that once featured powerful
coaches such as Joe Gibbs, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells and Buddy
Ryan matching wits; that once had participants boasting was so
intense, so physical, so bitter, that it steeled its members
against playoff pressure?
</P>
<P>
   It's been nine years since the New York Giants advanced beyond
the wild-card round of the postseason, and seven years since the
Washington Redskins made the playoffs. The Philadelphia Eagles have
won two playoff games since 1981. The Arizona Cardinals have won no
playoff games in this half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Says Eagles receiver Irving Fryar: ``In this division this year,
8-8 gets you into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? What happened?
</P>
<P>
   There are the usual suspects: Bad drafts, bad financial
decisions, bad breaks. But look deeper: The Cowboys' four foes in
the NFC East _ with its dearth of Pro Bowl types at quarterback,
its four losing teams, and its two coaches in job jeopardy _ can
each pinpoint one event that caused their present travails.
</P>
<P>
   Where to place specific blame with each of the four losers, in
order of their NFC East standing:
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants
</P>
<P>
   Maybe getting off to a slow start will become a trademark of Jim
Fassel's Giants. The rookie coach started 1-3 last year before the
Giants' domination of East foes (New York was 7-0-1 in the
division) drove New York to a 10-5-1 record and a title.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a difference this season. While the '97 Giants faced
only two playoff teams after a 1-3 start (wild-cards Detroit and
Tampa Bay), these 2-3 Giants are looking down the barrel of a
schedule that includes meetings with 3-1 Atlanta, 3-2 Dallas, 4-1
Green Bay, 3-1 San Francisco, 5-0 Denver and 4-1 Kansas City _ five
first-place teams, and all six playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants raised expectations last season, causing observers to
forget that maybe a fifth-place schedule produced a first-place
team. And this year? A first-place schedule has been foisted on a
Giants club that, if not for the East's ineptitude, might be a
fifth-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   You want instability?
</P>
<P>
   They've changed their geographic name four times in 40 years
(from Chicago to St. Louis to Phoenix to Arizona).
</P>
<P>
   Including the 1996 hiring of Vince Tobin, they changed coaches
eight times in 18 years. Including the current No. 1, promising
Jake Plummer, the Arizona media guide recalls 11 ``usual starting
quarterbacks'' in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant? Look for a bow tie (or now, a bolo tie in an
apparent kissup to the Southwest). Look for a padlocked wallet.
Look for that dark cloud that follows the Bidwill family since
1948.
</P>
<P>
   Look for William V. Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   It's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the way it is because of the oppressively bad judgment
of owner Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   True story: Last year, on a long cross-country plane ride home
from New York, Cardinals players were looking forward to an
in-flight movie. The testosterone-driven young athletes voted for
any movie with a little action, a little adventure, a little sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Bidwill let his wife, Nancy, choose the film.
</P>
<P>
   So the Arizona Cardinals spent the flight home watching Bette
Midler's ``Beaches''. Philadelphia Eagles
</P>
<P>
   It's a nightmare,'' coach Ray Rhodes says. ``It's a nightmare
for everybody, from the coaches to the trainers. A nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting that Rhodes would make mention of the vast number of
people affected by the franchise's failure, because there are a
vast number of people whose arm wrestling over decision-making
authority is at the root of the Eagles' illness.
</P>
<P>
   At different times in Rhodes' five seasons, he's been in charge
of personnel decisions. At other times, owner Jeff Lurie _ whose
background is as a movie producer but who says he models himself
after legendary basketball boss Red Auerbach _ has seemed in
charge. This year long-time Steelers personnel man Tom Modrak was
hired to give the front office direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it might take time to recover from the influence of Lurie
pal Joe Banner, who has grown into the job of capologist, but is
limited beyond that by a resume that is highlighted by his
experience as a radio show producer, a clothing manufacturer, and
reportedly, a Fantasy Football nut.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few years there, before Modrak came over, they had three
or four people pulling in three or four different directions,''
says one NFL executive.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes produced a 20-12 mark in his first two seasons and made
the playoffs twice. But he is 6-15-1 in his past 22 games, has lost
eight consecutive games, is 0-5 this season and could match the
franchise record for futility established by the 2-11-1 Eagles of
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' Rhodes says. ``How can it be any worse than it is
right now?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it can and will get worse. The Eagles will fire their coach.
And then Lurie and Banner will hire the next man scheduled to
engage them in a divisive power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Redskins
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn from all your experiences,'' Redskins coach Norv
Turner says, managing a weak smile. ``But we've had enough (bad)
experiences. I've learned enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Turner learned everything he needed to know about
Washington's demise shortly after his first draft, in 1994, when he
spent the third overall pick on Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler.
</P>
<P>
   That choice came shortly after late Redskins owner Jack Kent
Cooke predicted Turner woud someday be inducted into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame. Might have come true, too _ had he not
chosen Shuler.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's contract runs through 2001. But he's 0-5 this year with
a career mark of 26-42-1 and, like Rhodes, is in danger of losing
his job. And unlike Rhodes _ who didn't always have control _
Turner's problem is the decision he made when given control.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts say Turner overrated Shuler's intellect, but whatever the
reason, Turner is haunted by not going with other options. What if
he'd waited a year to draft his quarterback and positioned himself
for a first-rounder like Kerry Collins of the Panthers or Steve
McNair of the Oilers? Or a second-rounder like Kordell Stewart of
the Steelers? (And how much more developed might those sometimes
struggling youngsters be under the guidance of QB guru Turner?)
</P>
<P>
   What if the Redskins had taken the other ``blue-chip''
quarterback in the 1994 draft, Trent Dilfer, who went to Tampa Bay
two picks later?
</P>
<P>
   Says Turner, defending his coaching style and philosophy: ``What
we do works.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in this case.

ADAMS EMERGES AS A MONEY PLAYER FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As he normally does with prize rookies, Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones gave second-round pick Flozell Adams a big
signing bonus and some advice last summer about how to safeguard
his money.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to help future millionaires like Adams keep their
hard-earned cash out of the hands of unsavory characters. For some,
who went through college with barely enough spare change to
occasionally buy some new clothes or go out on Friday nights, talk
about mutual funds and certificates of deposits can be
mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case with the 23-year-old Adams. The 6-foot-7,
335-pounder took Jones' $890,000 check and laid out his financial
potential. Oil futures. Money markets. Stock options. Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed, almost taken aback by his knowledge, his
thought process and how sophisticated he was about financial
matters,'' Jones said. ``He whipped out rates, dissected value of
dollars and safety considerations that you'd expect to hear from a
financial advisor. It was a very good indication that he has his
stuff together. It's unusual ... rare for someone that young.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusual. Uncommon. Rare. Adams is all of these. And grand. And
powerful. And ferocious. And he is making his first start today as
the Cowboys' right guard against the Carolina Panthers at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He is here because of the strength of a mother who for five
years never let on how sick she was, fearing that the oldest of her
two children would give up on football if he knew she was dying of
liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He is here because of a doting aunt who would not let him think
about quitting at his lowest emotional moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is here because of high school coaches who had the courage to
stand in the face of a 6-foot-5, 300-pound 16-year-old and tell him
that he'd go nowhere if he didn't strive for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He is here because of college coaches who nurtured his talent
and because the Cowboys had the sense to take him with the 38th
pick in last April's draft after other teams passed on him because
they doubted his desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy developed into a tremendous football player, and made
a commitment to be the best he could be,'' said Nick Saban, Adams'
coach at Michigan State. ``We didn't stand over him with a whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That all came from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before all-state and All-American honors, before the money and
before the fame, Adams was just big.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the middle-class Chicago suburb of Maywood, he grew so
fast it seemed every month he was needing new shoes, some trousers,
a new shirt. He was nearly 6-feet tall in middle school, 6-1 as a
freshman, 6-5 as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   He was too big to wear the clothes of his 6-foot father, Flozell
Sr., who earned his keep working for a steel company.
</P>
<P>
   So his mother, Rachel, a hematology supervisor and later a
sheriff's department inspector, would borrow clothes from relatives
to put on Flozell's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd spurt every two or three weeks,'' said Alice Daniels,
Flozell's aunt. ``My sister would ask if he could wear my husband's
shoes. He outgrew those. Then she came back and asked if he could
wear his coat. A month later, she needed some shirts. He was just
too big for everything. We would shop at the big and tall stores.
But since he had size 15 shoes, we had to get those from shopping
out of a catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he was somewhat embarrassed by his size at first, but
soon got over it. He went out for the wrestling team as a sophomore
and made it to the Illinois state heavyweight finals as a junior.
He only wrestled a few times as a senior because he had trouble
getting down to the state's 275-pound weight limit.
</P>
<P>
   He also threw the shot put. But he didn't go out for the
football team until his junior year when Proviso West coach John
Wilson saw him walking the halls at school. Wilson took one look at
Adams and gave him a position on the offensive and defensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Adams' play frustrated coaches. Wilson recalled
defensive coordinator Tim McAlpin exclaiming, ``I don't care how
big he is but he can't play for me,'' before kicking Adams off the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not give up on Adams as an offensive lineman, but
pulled him into his office on numerous occasions and admonished
Adams not to blow his chance for a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get greatness out of him and he was just a
kid,'' Wilson said. ``He didn't work very hard, and he didn't
realize what sports was all about. He couldn't figure out why
everyone was yelling at him to run faster, to go harder. Because of
his personality, really quiet, he was totally bewildered, baffled
at what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask him, `Do you know what the future holds for you?'
We were trying to explain to him how good he could be. He had the
size, everything. The rest had to come from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said high school was a time when ``I didn't know what I
wanted to be or what I wanted to do with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had plenty of things to keep him occupied. He was in the
German club and the Spanish club. He helped make floats for the
homecoming parades. He loved computers (he owns a personal laptop
to keep track of stocks, bonds and oil futures).
</P>
<P>
   He also played trumpet in the band. To play for the band and the
football team called for some quick action on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before halftime, he'd run off the field, take off his football
stuff, put on his band uniform and perform at the half,'' Daniels
said. ``Then, at the end of the performance, he'd sprint back, take
his band stuff off, put his uniform on, then go out and play
(football).
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so happy doing that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he became excited about playing football. He was a high
school All-American as a senior. As Wilson promised, scholarship
offers poured in, and Adams considered Illinois before deciding to
attend Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   But he struggled early in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here, Flo was 370, maybe more,'' said Saban, who
replaced George Perles as Michigan State's head coach prior to
Adams' sophomore year in 1995. ``He wasn't in very good condition.
He could never sustain anything for more than 10 yards. We saw some
ability. He had good feet. But he was just a young player that had
never played.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Saban added, ``something in him changed. He lost
50 pounds. His body became more defined. He became a really good
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the change came when he was told he'd have a chance
to start. He converted that chance into a second-team All-Big Ten
selection as a sophomore and a junior at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Flozell never knew how sick his mother was. Rachel Adams had
surgery in the fall of 1995 and only told her sister, Alice. She
made Alice swear not to tell another soul about the liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When she missed one of her son's football games the following
fall, Flozell was not aware of how badly his mother felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just told him that she wasn't feeling well,'' Alice said.
``Then she got up and kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I knew she had cancer,'' Flozell said, ``and I was
devastated. She knew it. Then she told me they got rid of it, the
cancer. She was telling me so I wouldn't have to worry about her,
so I wouldn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Flozell knew everything. When her condition worsened, in
January 1997, the family put her in a hospital and called Flozell
home. That was a Saturday. She died on Wednesday. She was 49.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Flozell remained devasted by his mother's
death. He went to his aunt's house and briefly flirted with the
idea of giving up football. Both cried. There were tears and hugs.
Having lost her father, Alice could understand the desperation felt
by young Flozell.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not going to let him stop pursuing his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, you are going to the NFL _ you may as well get
that craziness out of your mind,''' she said. ``I told him that God
gives you people and God takes them away. I said, `You are a young
man with so much going for you _ do you know how many people would
give their right arm to be in your position?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom would not have wanted me to quit and she wouldn't want
me to sit around and sulk,'' Flozell said. ``I could hear her now,
had I quit, telling me not to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he was disappointed about not being selected until
the second round of last April's NFL draft. Scouts wondered how
much Adams, who made things look so easy, wanted to play
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kept calling and asking me how important football was
to Flozell,'' Saban said. ``They were all concerned about his
psychological profile. He's kind of laid back. I think people read
too much into that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It also did not help that Adams played much of his senior season
with an ankle sprain that limited his mobility, and that he had
gone through college with a partial hearing loss in his right ear.
</P>
<P>
   The fear was that Adams would have trouble hearing the snap
count in noisy stadiums. But Adams, who played at Notre Dame and at
Michigan, laughs at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was blown out of proportion because I had a hearing test
which showed I had just a slight hearing loss, 10 percent,'' Adams
said. ``As a freshman, I jumped offsides a lot at left tackle. They
figured I couldn't hear the signals. I jumped offsides a lot
because I was a freshman and didn't know what I was doing. They got
me a hearing aid. But I never wore one and still don't because I
don't need one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys drafted North Carolina's Greg Ellis in the first
round because they needed help on the defensive line. Then they
went after Adams, whom they were all too delighted to see drop into
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Garrett, a team scout, filed this report about Adams:
``Aggressive, and at times nasty.'' The film the Cowboys saw that
best showed Adams' college dominance was the 1997 Michigan
State-Michigan game. Adams completely manhandled All-American Glen
Steele. Another clip from the game showed Adams knocking a defender
to the ground and jumping on top of him. The play drew an
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Senior Bowl, during pass rushing drills, he looked
bored the way he was throwing guys,'' Cowboys scouting director
Larry Lacewell said. ``He made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flozell has the three things you need as offensive tackle.
You've got to have great feet. If you don't, then you are dead in
the water because you are playing more finesse than you'd think
with all the speed rushers you go against. Then you need long arms
to lock guys out. Then you need to be intelligent. He is all those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   And more.

CLINTON URGES MORE MONEY FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs throughout to add details from Saturday's discussions on
Capitol Hill.)  
 (Attn: Ala., Fla., Miss., Mo., Nev., N.Y.)   (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a campaign-style effort to regain their
political footing after last week's impeachment vote, President
Clinton and Congressional Democrats challenged Republicans Saturday
to enact broad education initiatives in the new budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to see this Congress walk away from America's
schoolchildren,'' the president said in his weekly radio address,
delivered as Republicans and White House officials remained far
apart on numerous spending matters that must be resolved before
members of Congress can leave town and fully engage in their
re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   One major issue that did appear headed toward a compromise was
financing for the International Monetary Fund. Republicans said
they were willing to provide the $18 billion requested by the
president to shore up the fund's reserves, but only if the
administration agreed to impose certain conditions on the fund.
Both sides said Saturday night that they were close to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But occupying the front burner was education. Republicans
indicated Saturday evening that they would cede to the president's
request for $1.1 billion next year to hire 100,000 teachers, on
condition that the administration identify cuts of an equal amount
elsewhere in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and top
negotiator on Capitol Hill, emerged from a meeting Saturday night
with Speaker Newt Gingrich, saying: ``I think we have made some
progress. I think they clearly have heard what we were saying on
education and I'm optimistic in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich agreed. ``I don't currently see anything which is
impossible to bridge,'' he said, adding that he hoped negotiations
could be concluded by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Such pushing and pulling marked the nation's 10th day without a
federal budget beyond the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. The
president signed a second stopgap spending bill on Friday night to
keep the government running through midnight Monday. Congress has
cleared only six of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government open and is negotiating with the White House over what
to include in one big omnibus package to present to the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was little chance of action before Monday, because the
Senate and the House have postponed all recorded votes until Monday
afternoon and many members have left town for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have insisted they do not want to
shut down the government and, with the Nov. 3 elections looming,
are eager to set their broad campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted to leave town with the focus on the enduring
image of a wounded president subjected to an impeachment inquiry
over a sex scandal. Democrats demonstrated Saturday that they
wanted additional time to change the subject to education, an issue
that voters have said is of prime importance.
</P>
<P>
   The president's two major education proposals call for hiring
100,000 teachers for hard-to-recruit schools in inner cities and
rural areas, to reduce the size of the average class to 18
students, and for upgrading old schools and making them
Internet-compatible by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have criticized the programs as pork-barrel spending
that offers a big-Government solution to problems that should be
solved locally.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said that
the Democrats' emphasis on education was ``pure politics, pure
demagoguery.'' He said that the White House had not identified
where to find the $4 billion for its education package because that
would cut into other programs sought by liberals.
</P>
<P>
   He also cast doubt on Clinton's engagement in the process,
noting that the president would be out of town on Monday and
Tuesday, when negotiators might be stitching together their final
budget package. Clinton plans to be in New York on Monday to raise
money for Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic Senate candidate,
and Peter Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, who is
running for governor. On Tuesday, Clinton plans to visit Florida
for fund-raising and to join senior citizens and declare that he is
protecting the budget surplus to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans demonstrated that they were just as ``on message''
as the Democrats, returning throughout the day Saturday to the
president's woes. ``Clinton has held just two Cabinet meetings this
year,'' Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., said on the House floor.
``The first one to lie to his Cabinet, and the second one to
apologize to his Cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, spoke
at a news conference packed with Democrats left idle as the
chairmen of various spending committees met with administration
officials to work out dozens of matters, ranging from emergency aid
for farmers to polarizing questions of contraception _ for minors,
for federal employees and for overseas family planning
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having spent four weeks talking about impeachment, surely we
can spend four hours on the president's education initiatives,''
Gephardt said in criticizing House Republicans for spending ``not
one minute, not one second'' debating the president's education
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest items on the table _ how much to give to the
IMF _ appeared close to resolution. Republicans said they would
provide the full $18 billion under conditions that curbed what they
called the fund's profligate lending practices. They want the fund
to stop lending money at below-market rates and to operate more
openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., the
chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the
Appropriations Committee. ``We're in a position to reach some type
of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also sounded optimistic. ``I think it's too
early to tell, but I think there are more hopeful signs than there
have been in quite some time,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's
national economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is major flash point with Congress. Republicans
argue that Clinton is raiding the surplus to pay for his education
and child-care programs. He had expected to pay for them with money
from a settlement with the tobacco companies, which never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   They also say he wants to take billions from the surplus to pay
for ``emergencies'' that are not true emergencies, like the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the year 2000 computer
bug, both of which were foreseen and could recur. Republicans agree
that some of the emergency money the president seeks _ to improve
security at U.S. embassies and to help Americans who were hit by
natural disasters _ are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   After the House voted on Thursday to open an impeachment inquiry
into Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Clinton was eager
to show that he was tending to the people's business. At a news
conference with Democrats in Congress, he presented himself as the
guardian of education and a safety net against Republican
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   His education agenda includes money to make sure all children
can read by second or third grade and to help colleges provide
mentors to students to guide them toward college.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also concerned about some education issues
that have little to do with money. These include a Republican ban
on the president's proposal for national testing of fourth-grade
students in reading and eighth-grade students in math and a
Republican plan to dissolve bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the House passed without dissent a bill that
would require the government to deal with countries that persecute
citizens for religious beliefs by using measures ranging from the
mildest private rebuke to tough economic sanctions. The bill passed
the Senate unanimously on Friday.

LONGHORNS STAMPEDE PAST SOONERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GENE MENEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For those who may have doubts, yesterday's game at the
Cotton Bowl was Texas vs. Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   That was Texas that stonewalled the Sooners to just three
points. That was Texas that featured an air-it-out attack that
rolled up 293 yards and did not depend on Heisman Trophy candidate
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   As if the 11:30 a.m. kickoff and Williams wearing No. 37 weren't
strange enough.
</P>
<P>
   The game might not have ranked near the best in the
Texas-Oklahoma rivalry, but it ranked at the very top of the
Longhorns' performances this season. With the staunch defensive
effort and the newly found deep-passing attack, Texas took another
step on its quest for improvement with a 34-3 victory against the
Sooners before 75,587 at the Cotton Bowl.

   ``We've been improving each week and coming together more and
more, and we really played as one heartbeat today,'' Texas
linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``The biggest statement \Rfrom the
game\S is the 'Horns are back in town.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclaimed return for Texas (4-2 overall, 2-1 Big 12) came
against a bumbling Oklahoma (2-3, 0-2) team that committed 14
penalties for 109 yards, turned the ball over four times, fumbled
six times, including two on one play, and had a punt partially
blocked. The outcome _ Texas' biggest victory in the series since a
41-9 rout in 1970 _ was as much about Oklahoma's ineptitude as it
was Texas' aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come down here and lose like this,'' said
Sooners senior defensive tackle Kelly Gregg, whose team allowed 34
unanswered points. ``This is terrible. It was just a terrible
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a banner game for the Longhorns' passing attack. With
Oklahoma sending up to nine men near the line of scrimmage to stop
Williams, Texas burned the Sooners' defense with touchdown passes
of 97 yards _ the longest in Texas history _ and 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the 56-yarder, Texas quarterback Major Applewhite dumped a
pass to Kwame Cavil, who came out of the backfield, and Cavil raced
untouched through the Oklahoma secondary to give the Longhorns a
14-3 lead. On the 97-yarder, Texas receiver Wane McGarity ran past
Sooners defensive backs Corey Ivy and Mike Woods and caught a
perfectly thrown ball from Applewhite, who finished 14-of-27.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity also scored untouched, giving Texas a comfortable 24-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two-deep coverage,'' Oklahoma defensive coordinator Rex
Ryan said, ``but I guess it was not deep enough.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity's touchdown came two plays after Sooners quarterback
Brandon Daniels fumbled the snap while trying a quarterback sneak
from the Texas 1-yard line. Longhorns defensive tackle Casey
Hampton recovered the fumble, and instead of Oklahoma possibly
making the score 17-10 early in the third quarter, the Sooners
found themselves trailing by three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance there in the second half,'' Sooners coach John
Blake said, ``but that fumble on the goal line really hurt us and
took a lot out of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas defense, which entered the game allowing 444.4 yards
of total offense per game, allowed only 197. Oklahoma running back
De'Mond Parker rushed for 93 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've ever seen our defense play since I've
been here,'' said Renfro, a senior from Alvarado. ``It was really
great.
</P>
<P>
   Donning the No. 37 in tribute to SMU great and Heisman Trophy
winner Doak Walker, who died on Sept. 27, Williams gained 139 yards
and two touchdowns on 31 carries. On both touchdowns, he pointed to
the sky, and 5tGv .2C &QR; 2

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The continuation of negotiations Saturday
by the U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, with both the ethnic Albanian
leadership in Kosovo and the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, suggested that enough common ground was being found to
avert NATO air strikes, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke spent about an hour and a half with Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian political leader, in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, and returned for seven hours of talks with Milosevic, which
ended after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the official news agency Tanjug said that ``all the
conditions are there'' for a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately after the end of the session, Holbrooke returned
to the U.S. Embassy here to consult by telephone with Washington.
He had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official travelling with Holbrooke dismissed the
statement calling it ``old wine in an old bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer talks go on and the more exchanges that take place
between the two sides in the Kosovo conflict, the greater the
chances for a peaceful resolution, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic backs down, however, many Serbs in this
frightened capital say the mere threat of air strikes has enabled
the Yugoslav leader to strengthen rather than weaken control of his
economically depressed country.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a high likelihood, the diplomats said, that NATO
would formally declare an activation order, the last step necessary
to authorize air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana, said Saturday in
Brussels that the alliance had completed all the necessary
decisions before declaring the order.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have consistently said they believe that it would
take the final authorization of air strikes to push Milosevic to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Saturday in Belgrade that Milosevic had decided
that taking NATO air strikes was not the most profitable route to
his political survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, an independent newspaper that in a crisis
like this is considered to reflect a sense of what the secretive
Milosevic is mulling, reported Saturday that the Yugoslav leader
``objects to some parts of the proposed agreement'' but that a deal
was in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Milosevic was against NATO soldiers being
part of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Senior Clinton
administration officials have said in the last several days that an
``international presence'' would be necessary in Kosovo to verify
the withdrawal of Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have also suggested that the ``presence'' would be
used to help the international aid effort that will be needed over
the winter to assist about 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
were forced to flee their homes during a three-month offensive by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not been specific about the composition of
the ``presence'' that is being contemplated. Holbrooke has noted
the opposition in Congress to sending American soldiers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph also reported that Milosevic had asked for
all economic sanctions to be lifted against Yugoslavia, including
the ban on loans from the International Monetary Fund and financing
from the World Bank. The newspaper said that Holbrooke had offered
a gradual lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holbrooke was characteristically tight-lipped about his
discussions Saturday in Pristina. The situation was ``just as
serious'' as some days ago, he said, before taking the 40-minute
flight back to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He met with a three-man negotiating team for the ethnic
Albanians in Pristina but spent the bulk of his time with Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has led the ethnic Albanian policy calling for the
independence of Kosovo rather than some kind of enhanced autonomy
within a Yugoslav framework. His peaceful pursuit of independence
has earned him Western backing over the violent guerrilla tactics
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian group trying to
win independence on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Holbrooke was the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia,
Christopher Hill, the main author of an interim political plan for
the status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's plan would restore to Kosovo some degree of autonomy,
stripped away by Milosevic in 1989, but postpone for several years
the question of independence. It also lays out details of much
greater representation of ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs
nine to one _ in the province, in the police force, the courts, a
legislature and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Holbrooke is armed with six points of negotiation
that he brought with him from a meeting with the so-called contact
group in London Friday. The group consists of Russia, the United
States and European countries that monitor events in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The points include the withdrawal of the Yugoslav national army
and the Serbian police in Kosovo to the levels that pertained
before March, when the crackdown against the guerrillas began, and
the storage of heavy weapons, the freedom for the 250,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees to return to their homes without intimidation
from Serbian police, and the start of talks based on the Hill plan.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the talks, according to U.S. officials, have
been the Serbian and Yugoslav military issues _ an immediate end to
hostilities and the withdrawal of troops and weaponry. Unless these
forces are reduced and the reductions can be verified, those ethnic
Albanians whose homes have not been destroyed in the summer
offensive will lack the confidence to return to their villages, the
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, which after a series of car bombs and similar
attacks in the past two years have fought openly since the spring
for Kosovo's independence, said Saturday that they would continue
to respect a cease-fire they announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a well-informed daily news report, VIP, which is
read closely in Western embassies, said in its latest issue that
preparations by the Yugoslav Army against possible NATO air strikes
had not gone well.

 &HT;    Petit Le Mans notebook
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even before he knew Road Atlanta would have a
monumental mob attending Saturday's inaugural Petit Le Mans, Don
Panoz was already at work expanding the concept.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the American Le Mans Series announced an agreement in
principle with the Automobile Club de l'Ouest to expand the series
over three continents.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will establish a Le Mans Series in Europe and Asia
as well as the American Series, which debuts next year.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, the presence of the world's top drivers, beautiful
weather and the sounds of racing created an electricity not seen in
more than a decade at Road Atlanta and got Panoz driver Doc Bundy
so excited he exclaimed: ``There's the Daytona 500 for stock cars
and the Indy 500. America has needed a sports car race like that
and this might be it. Don Panoz brought a piece of the biggest
sports car race in the world, Le Mans, to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he's right, only it will be bigger with the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement, when finalized, will support Don Panoz' global
visition for sports car racing in the future,'' said Michel Cosson,
president of ACO. ``It's important that the Le Mans name will be at
the forefront of this aggressive reorganization of sports car
racing worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, one or two endurance events (minimum of
1,000 kilometers) will be held on each continent as part of an
Endurance Cup Challenge with $2 million (U.S.) in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The series could have enormous implications for sports car
racing, especially in the U.S. where it has been a fragmented
affair, dwindling in competition and fans until Panoz stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are already looking at Panoz as a Moses of sorts,
leading sports car racing out of the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panoz is a man with a vision,'' said Wayne Taylor driver of
the Atlanta-sponsored Lease Plan Ferrari 333SP. ``Sports car racing
has been up and down over the years. Hopefully, this (Petit Le
Mans) will turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Yannick Dalmas, driver of the 24 Hours of Le Mans-winning No. 26
Porsche that crashed on Saturday said, ``This weekend is the start
of something different in the way sports car racing has been done.
It has taken a lot of committment, initially by Panoz, to get this
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Petite Le Mans was the star of the weekend at Road Atlanta,
but there was some excitement in the supporting races, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like the good old days, a fan came to the rescue of a racer who
needed parts that weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Supra of owner/driver Ahmed Sabban, Saudi Arabia,
co-driven by Peter Tonelli of Westboro, Mass., was having some
suspension problems and could have missed Sunday's Speedvision Cup
race.
</P>
<P>
   Fan Ivy Johnson III heard about the problem while mingling in
the pits area and offered his own Supra as a parts car. It is
sitting on blocks until after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a little problem finding transportation,'' Johnson
joked, ``but it's fun.''

 &HT;    Superspeedway dishes up bevy of surprises
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ If Mark Martin had his druthers today, odds
are he would have the Winston Cup circuit running at Texas,
California or Bristol, three of the seven sites where he has
celebrated in victory lane in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Talladega and the Winston 500, the first of
back-to-back restrictor plate races. And for Martin it's like
taking a dose of medicine in his pursuit of Jeff Gordon and his
174-point lead for the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another race on the schedule and it's what's coming
up,'' said Martin, who qualified eighth Friday. ``I said before, I
look at the two restrictor plate races back-to-back as some
medicine that you need to take and you may as well take it all at
once because when you're finished, you're through. We've gotta run
'em, and if you spread 'em out ... this way we'll do it and it'll
be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's restrictor plate record at Talladega is a mixed bag.
He's won twice in 25 events, once in the Winston 500, once in the
DieHard. His last six finishes here are 23rd, first, 30th, 34th,
third and first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we can finish anywere,'' Martin said. ``We've won
Talladega twice and we could certainly do it again. We could go to
Daytona next week and handle right and run up front. The realist I
am, I say a two-dollar part will break any momentum there's ever
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor plates or not, overall there's little to choose from
between Gordon and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has a string of 15 consecutive finishes of fifth or
better, including seven victories and four seconds. His worst are a
pair of fifths, at Bristol and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those places where anything can happen,'' said
Gordon, who won in 1996, but has finished 24th or worse five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't come down to the way the chassis handles. It can
come down to a pit stop. Mark is running good everywhere we go.
They're a strong, strong team, and right now they're certainly one
of the cars to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to finish close to him or in front of him, if we
can. But I think what it comes down to, especially the next couple
of weeks, is staying out of trouble and not have anything break. It
doesn't have anything to do with Mark and the six car. It has
everything to do with the 24 car and our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's run is almost as impressive as Gordon's. Four
victories, five seconds in six consecutive starts and eight other
finishes of seventh or better. The only blemish came at Darlington
where a blown motor left him 40th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are going to happen,'' Martin said. ``If you call
the car we have a good car, which it is by our standards, we don't
have another one. If we tear this one up, we'll just be a lame duck
at Daytona. We've got a good starting spot here, and we're going to
do everything we can to hold up and do the best we can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Bodine, whose contract with owner Jim Mattei ends this
season, is ride-hunting for 1999. It doesn't mean, however, he
won't be back in the No. 7 Ford. ``I wish I knew what my plans
are,'' Bodine said. ``Right now I've been talking to several team
owners. Hopefully I'll know something in the near future.'' Mattei
is expected to announce his plans in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Flock honored
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flock's widow, Frances, was presented a check for $67,584.96
last week at Darrell Waltrip's race shop in Harrisburg, N.C. Funds
were raised through the sale of commemorative diecast race cars, as
well as through Winston Cup teams and fans. Flock died of cancer
earlier this year. ``I wanted to pay tribute to one of our sport's
former champions,'' Waltrip said. ``Tim helped make this sport what
it is today. He was a dear friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   No bull
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup series moves to Talladega with five drivers
eligible for the No Bull 5 program _ Jeff Gordon, Jeff Burton, Dale
Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt and Jeremy Mayfield. Should one of them
win, he'll pick up the $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly: The Richard Petty Driving Experience will open a fourth
permanent location by Jan. 1. The Atlanta office will be
self-sufficient with its own staff, mechanics and fleet of cars. It
will be a year-round operation . . . With Mark Martin's victory
last Sunday, Ford and Chevrolet are even in the manufacturers
points standings with 201 each. Pontiac has 130.
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH
</P>
<P>
   Allen &AMP; Sawyer
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Allen Jr. will drive the No. 38 Barbasol car in 1999,
joining Elton Sawyer on the Atkins/Suton Motorsports team. Allen
moved from J&AMP;J Racing to join. ``I wanted to go somewhere that was
established and successful,'' said Allen, who is winless in 83
events. ``I feel like I have something to give Elton and he has
something to give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarity for Cope
</P>
<P>
   Derrike Cope will make his first Busch start in more than a year
when he comes to Atlanta Motor Speedway to run in the Stihl 300,
which was rained out in March. Cope will run a limited schedule in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week
</P>
<P>
   Mike McLauglin's margin of victory last week at Charlotte was
24.074 seconds over Matt Kenseth, the largest in a Busch race since
Kenny Wallace beat Chuck Bown by 27.15 seconds on July 14, 1991, at
Loudon. McLaughlin's victory was the first for a Busch regular at
Charlotte since Chad Little in 1995.

<P>
   CRAFTSMAN TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Baffling Biffle
</P>
<P>
   Greg Biffle is on one of those streaks that few rookies can
believe. He's won three straight poles and leads the Rookie of the
Year standings by 18 points over Andy Houston heading into the
Sears Point race today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope I can continue this string, but I rather
doubt it,'' Biffle said. ``We have some really good experienced
road racers. Ron Hornaday and Joe Ruttman will be tough on the road
course. But, then, they're tough everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Road courses haven't been Biffle's strength this season. He
finished 27th at Watkins Glen and 21st at Heartland Park. The first
time he ran a road course at Watkins Glen, he was seven seconds off
the pace of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   New course
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will see a new track configuration at Sears Point,
shortened to 1.949 miles from the previous 2.52-mile layout with
the construction of a chute that links turns 4 and 11. The change
added nearly five mph to the Bud Pole speed for this summer's
Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter to return
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sauter will return next year as the driver for Richard
Childress Racing. Sauter, Childress's choice since 1997, is the
only driver on the truck series who hasn't posted a DNF. ... The
Craftsman trucks made quite an entrance on their way to Sears
Point, crossing the Golden Gate Bridge with a California Highway
Patrol escort . . . Three different drivers have won at Sears Point
_ Ron Hornaday in1995, followed by Dave Rezendes and Joe Ruttman .
. . Ruttman has won three of the past five series road courses.
Like Hornaday, he has won on each venue _ Sears Point, Watkins Glen
and Heartland Park Topeka.

 &HT;    Counting down to victory

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Nine. That's how many peanuts Kevin Towers lined up
on the hotel bar that fateful night of October 14, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now San Diego's general manager, Towers was a scout then for the
Pirates and in Toronto, scouting the AL Championship Series. That
night, the ALCS done, Towers sat in the bar at the Toronto Hilton
with Pirates assistant general manager Cam Bonifay and head scout
Lenny Yochim. They were watching Game 7 of the NLCS from Atlanta,
where Towers lived. With Pittsburgh ahead 2-0 after six innings and
Doug Drabek pitching, Towers lined up nine peanuts on the bar. One
for each out the Pirates needed to record to reach the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Game 6, had an off day,'' said Towers, who lived
then in the Club Tower at 16th and West Peachtree. ``I could watch
Nomar Garciaparra and Jay Payton play at Tech from my window. I ate
at the Varsity.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Towers was in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium
when Tim Wakefield's knuckler and three Bucs homers ripped Atlanta
13-4. Once Pittsburgh took that 2-0 lead in Game 7, Towers thought
Pittsburgh was a lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably one of the greatest feelings I ever had,'' Towers
said Saturday before Game 3 of the NLCS. ``We're up 2-0, Game 7,
Drabek on the mound and we're going to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the peanuts were disappearing. Towers tossed one
away with each ensuing out. The steady stream of flying nuts
suddenly sputtered in the ninth inning, especially after Stan
Belinda relieved Drabek. ``I think I was down to two,'' said
Towers. No. One peanut remained when Francisco Cabrera came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw a bunch of guys jumping on each other at the
plate,'' Towers recalled. ``And I called out, 'We didn't lose, did
we?'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Sid Bream slid home with the winning run. Braves won, 3-2.
And that last peanut left on the bar? ``Threw it at the
bartender,'' said Towers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when San Diego sought to take a commanding 3-0 lead
in the NLCS, Towers assumed nothing. ``We're up 2-0,'' Towers said.
``But we realize we're facing Greg Maddux.'' Bottom line: There
were no peanuts lined up in the San Diego general manager's private
box.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch, that hurts
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dodged a pregame disaster when Kevin Millwood took a
batting practice line drive to the head and was able to walk away
from it. Millwood was stationed behind a screen in shallow center
field and had just poked his head around it to pick up a ball when
Ryan Klesko sent a liner up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The ball nearly hit Greg Colbrunn, who was running from first to
second and caught Millwood flush on the right side of the head near
the ear. He went down for approximately a minute before leaving the
field under his own power. He was able to run out during pregame
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a macabre Braves NLCS tradition. In 1995, Javy
Lopez drilled David Justice with a batting-practice line drive that
knocked him out of Game 4. Mike Devereaux, who started in his
place, wound up the series MVP. Last year, Greg Colbrunn hit
Chipper Jones in the head with a shot before Game 5 at Florida.
Jones was able to start, but went hitless the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Old No. 27
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Maddux's blue batting practice jersey was discovered
missing, the Braves starter borrowed an extra shirt from Gerald
Williams and prompted all sorts of conspiracy angles while two
Williams were on the field during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually Jimy Williams','' said Maddux, recalling the
departed third base coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A psychological advantage,'' Williams said. ``They're going to
think I'm all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads up
</P>
<P>
   Braves team officials are sitting in two new rows of seats
installed up the third- and first-base lines, less than 90 feet
from the plate and in dangerous position for foul balls. When
Braves general manager John Schuerholz discovered his seat was the
first exposed to the plate, he was presented with a batting helmet
by traveling secretary Bill Acree and was modeling it in the dugout
before the game.

 &HT;    What's on deck for Game 4
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   -- When: 7:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where: Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -- Radio/TV: Channel 5, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   -- Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (16-11, 3.55
ERA; 4-2, 2.73 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Joey Hamilton (13-13,
4.27; 2-8, 5.68 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   -- Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 272-216 and
won the season series for an eighth straight year, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   -- Past meetings: The Braves were 1-2 at Qualcomm Stadium in the
regular season, the first losing record the club has accumulated
there since going 4-5 in 1991. Since the Padres joined the league,
Atlanta has a 130-115 record in San Diego, going 36-30 the past 10
years. In the Braves' only visit to Qualcomm this season, the
Padres beat Denny Neagle and Greg Maddux on successive nights (Aug.
11-12). Tom Glavine averted the sweep on Aug. 13 in a 5-0 victory
over Mark Langston. Atlanta managed to outscore the Padres 33-29
and out-homer San Diego 11-6 during the season.
</P>
<P>
   -- Padres leaders: Avg. _ Tony Gwynn (.321); HR _ Greg Vaughn
(50); RBI _ Vaughn (119); SB_ Quilvio Veras (24). W _ Kevin Brown
(18); ERA _ Trevor Hoffman (1.48). Saves _ Hoffman (53). Strikeouts
_ Brown (257).
</P>
<P>
   -- Neagle update: Neagle finally gets a chance after going two
weeks since throwing his last live pitch and 23 days since his last
start. The layoff was both beneficial and troubling. The down time
has allowed him to recover almost completely from a bout of
left-shoulder bursitis, which limited him to just two September
starts. But Neagle lives with the breaking ball and change-up, both
touch pitches that require regular maintenance. ``I don't think the
time off has hurt me at all,'' he said. ``I think it's helped me.''
Neagle was 0-1 against the Padres in two starts this year. He drew
no decision in Atlanta on May 10, after being knocked out after
five innings (four runs on nine hits).
</P>
<P>
   -- Hamilton update: Born in Statesboro, schooled at Georgia
Southern and now an Atlanta resident, Hamilton has been pounded by
the Braves like no other team in his five major league seasons. He
has given up 73 hits in 62 1/3 career innings, and his eight career
losses to the Braves are more than any other opponent. That does
not detract from his 1998 season, when he set career highs in
innings pitched (217 1/3) and starts (34). Despite a 4.27 ERA, he
kept the Padres in almost all his starts, and the team went 10-2
when Hamilton was given three or more runs in support. He was 1-2
against the Braves, the victory coming on Aug. 11, when he beat
Neagle, holding the Braves to a run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's hot: Chipper Jones has a career .370 average against
Hamilton and is 3-for-7 against him in 1998. Andres Galarraga has
two homers against Hamilton in nine at-bats this season. Chris
Gomez has a .500 career average against Neagle and was 3-for-5
against him this year. Finley is a .318 hitter against Neagle,
while catcher Carlos Hernandez hits .350.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's not: Michael Tucker has just two hits in 13 career
at-bats (.154) against Hamilton. Keith Lockhart has a .111 career
average against him. Gwynn hasn't figured out Neagle, going
5-for-39 (.167) lifetime against him. Second baseman Quilvio Veras
is a .182 career hitter versus Neagle.

 &HT;    47-24 romp over 'Pack puts Tech in title hunt
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ North Carolina State was supposed to be Georgia
Tech's first tough test of the season. The Wolfpack was supposed to
have one of the best offenses in the ACC. The ACC title path was
supposed to pass through Carter-Finley Stadium, with the Wolfpack's
win over Florida State a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Georgia Tech's 47-24 whipping of N.C. State on
Saturday, Tech had aced its latest test, put on a one-sided
offensive show and brought the ACC title chase to Bobby Dodd
Stadium, where visits from Virginia and Florida State in the next
two weeks should reshape the conference picture.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (5-0, 3-0 ACC) and Georgia Tech (4-1, 3-0) will square
off Saturday tied for first in the ACC. Georgia Tech likely
stripped the Wolfpack of its No. 23 ranking and any warm, fuzzy
feelings it might have had left from the FSU win. The Yellow
Jackets made a case for a Top 25 ranking and should feel better
about theirchances against the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, Tech needed only a half to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 30 minutes, the Yellow Jackets took out N.C. State
running back Rahshon Spikes (shoulder stinger), the Carter-Finley
crowd of 48,600, quarterback Jamie Barnette (concussion) and
embarrassed long-snapper Grant Dorn.
</P>
<P>
   The only man they couldn't touch was All-American candidate
Torry Holt, whose first three chances on offense led to 133 yards,
a field goal and a touchdown. But those 10 points, next to Tech's
33 at halftime, didn't amount to much. Tech couldn't stop Holt on
the big plays but made the rest of the big plays themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tech got 16 first-half points from its defense and special
teams, including a pair of touchdowns from Jason Bostic, one on a
blocked punt he returned for a touchdown and the other on yet
another fumble on a sack. The other two points came compliments of
N.C. State's Dorn, who sent a long snap through the Wolfpack end
zone for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Holt gained 48 yards on his first catch on a slant on N.C.
State's first play, which set up a Dan Deskovich field goal. His
second touchdown came on another crossing route for a 40-yard gain.
That was when Tech could have panicked. On the next play, Holt took
a hand-off on a reverse, dropped back and launched a 45-yard
touchdown pass to Chris Coleman, cutting Tech's early lead to
12-10.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yellow Jackets answered with 21 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving the first quarter with a 5-3 lead, Tech
outscored the Wolfpack 28-7 in the second quarter.

 &HT;    Just another ESPN game of the week
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. _ Depending on who's talking, when the
Atlanta Falcons play the New York Giants tonight on national TV, it
will be either just another game, a big game or a bigger game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, who coached the Giants from 1993-'96,
has downplayed his return to Giants Stadium all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of memories,'' Reeves said. ``But
am I going to make it a big thing? No, because I don't think I can
get that across to my players.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith seems to be approaching this game like
the others. And he doesn't seem to care that the 8:20 p.m. game is
the team's only appearance this season on prime-time TV (ESPN,
WSB/Channel 2). It's the same to Smith if the Falcons play on
national TV or beside an RV in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is the same whether it's on prime-time or not,''
Smith said. ``It's still one game, whether you win or lose. I don't
care. You probably ought to ask somebody else about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Falcons should pretend like this isn't prime time for
their apparent up-and-coming football team. They've made one
prime-time appearance in each of the last four years and have lost
them all. Atlanta has lost eight of their last nine prime-time
appearances since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying, however, that tonight's game affords the
Falcons a chance to show a lot of people that their 3-1 record is
not a fluke and that they can beat a team with a pulse. Their three
victories have come against 0-4 Carolina (twice) and 0-5
Philadelphia. The Giants are 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prepared the same way, but everybody knows in the back of
their minds that if you have a good game on national TV when
everybody is watching it could be something that helps your career
and the team,'' running back Jamal Anderson said. ``It's in New
York on national TV in the biggest media market in the world. I
think the stars are lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves isn't sure about star alignment, but he admits this game
is different for him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you're playing a game where everybody else in
the league can watch you, the players get excited,'' he said. ``But
the most important thing is (it's a chance to show) where we are
and where we can be. It's a chance to be 4-1 when we play the
Saints (at home) next week. And any time you win a conference game,
your chances of being in the playoffs improve.

THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF BELLS AND WHISTLES IN SAN DIEGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Jung Ho Pak, not to be confused with Chan Ho Park,
threw out the ceremonial first pitch yesterday before Game 3 of the
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pak received this honor simply because he's artistic director of
the San Diego Symphony, which will be located next to the new
ballpark the Padres hope will be approved in November. Some of us
were hoping for Joan Embry, the fabulous San Diego Zoo celebrity
seen on late-night talk shows, but perhaps she was tied up with an
orangutan.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp, a one-time San Diego Chargers quarterback who became
more famous but less successful as a politician, was around and
available yesterday. But Kemp blew the big one in his last
election, and if it's one thing the Padres don't need right now
it's a political loser giving off bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres don't miss a trick in trying to push this ballpark
through, right from the moment you pull up to Qualcomm _ not to be
confused with 3Com _ Stadium and the attendant hands you a parking
stub and artist's rendition of the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame media buffet was especially lavish, featuring
enormous amounts of shrimp, crab legs, omelets and other
delicacies, more than enough to convince reporters from the Kyodo
News Service, El Sol de Tijuana and Agence France-Presse to get
behind the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I was convinced long before that, having been
solicited in the parking lot by two 500-pound Haystack Calhoun
look-alikes who were proclaiming themselves ``The World's Biggest
Padres Fans.'' One look at their blue-and-orange painted faces, No.
19 (Tony Gwynn's number) emblazoned in their hair and the ``Go
Padres'' etched on their massive bellies was convincing enough, as
long as they promise to wear T-shirts over that blubber.
</P>
<P>
   One look at those two is enough to swear off the Qualcomm fish
tacos forever.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the guy parading around Qualcomm in a Union blue
Civil War uniform with a sign saying, ``Burn Atlanta Burn'' and
yelling, ``Go Sherman! Thanks for the Memories!''
</P>
<P>
   How could we let his beloved Padres sneak off to Northern
Virginia? No doubt they'd find him 10 years later wandering the
streets of Tijuana in a daze, clutching his tattered Tony Gwynn
baseball card and muttering obscenities at Padres owner John
Moores.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anybody even think about leaving San Diego when the
lady on the radio announced yesterday morning, ``Today's weather,
pretty much perfect. Blue skies, temperatures in the high and low
70s''? We're told that's pretty much the conditions year round.
</P>
<P>
   The city is magnificent with harbors and bays, golf courses, a
world-famous zoo, Sea World and million-dollar homes sitting high
on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean and U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm Stadium, however, is stuck several miles inland in the
Mission _ not to be confused with Napa, Loire or Great African Rift
_ Valley, wedged between two freeways and a ridiculous-looking
19th-century trolley car operating on a 21st-century elevated
monorail line.
</P>
<P>
   There's nary a yacht, sailboat or aircraft carrier in sight, not
to mention expensive luxury boxes. The new ballpark will have that
and much more (including pittance for rent payments) down on the
city waterfront. Let's hope the trolley car stays in Mission
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is the Padres are putting 62,000 or more people
in Qualcomm Park for every playoff game, which gives ammunition to
those opposing the ballpark initiative.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, even here in plush lush San Diego there are party
poopers who don't want their tax dollars being used to build a
ballpark for a baseball owner who made billions peddling computer
software.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those opponents will also scream bloody murder if the
U.S. Navy decides to cut taxpayer spending and sends some of those
aircraft carriers sailing off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, right now, the people of San Diego are screaming in
delight over the Padres. They can smell a World Series coming and
the stadium issue is looking good. The pregame surf-and-turf
tailgaters sported buttons, badges and bumper stickers that urged
``Yes on C.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe they ought to get Joan Embry and her orangutan down
here and let her fire one over the plate _ just to be on the safe
side.
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse would be impressed.

 &HT;    Revisiting the triumph, tragedy of the Alabama Gang
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ These are hard times for stock car drivers who
would like to perpetuate the legend of the Alabama Gang, the
unlikely bunch that roared out of little Hueytown, Ala., three
decades ago to dominate dirt tracks and superspeedways around the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Hut Stricklin, connected to the Gang by marriage, has not done
much in 11 years to earn his place. He hasn't won a race in 267
career starts and no longer has a full-time ride.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grissom, a Gang wannabe by virtue of his Gadsden
birthplace, hasn't won in seven years in Winston Cup and recently
was released from his contract to drive the No. 41 Chevrolet. His
winless streak: 128.
</P>
<P>
   The Gang lives on only in the record book. They will be
remembered Sunday at the Winston 500, when the Labontes can become
the first brothers since the Gang's Bobby and Donnie Allison in
1971 to sweep the two annual races at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Allisons, along with pal Red Farmer, made up the Alabama
Gang. They lived together, traveled with their cars in a caravan
and wiped out the competition at nearly every stop on dirt tracks
in the 1960s and the speedways in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, they certainly could call us a gang,'' Donnie said,
``because we'd come in and take all their money.'' Even if neither
of them won, they'd usually finish second, third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has nine victories at Talladega among them, five by
Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, they were the Miami gang. They had moved up to the
Birmingham suburb after hearing that the tracks in Alabama and
Georgia paid more for the same level of races than the tracks in
Hialeah and West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby recalls taking $95 that he had saved on the road the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left Miami and I was looking at my $95 and it was kind of
going away. I said to Donnie, `Instead of stopping to buy lunch,
let's get a basket of peaches.' We keep passing these stands with
baskets of peaches for 50 cents. We had peaches for lunch Thursday,
peaches for supper Thursday, peaches for midnight snack, peaches
for breakfast Friday and peaches for lunch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally at Dixie Speedway. I ran fifth in the heat race,
fifth in the semi and fifth in the feature. I told Donnie, `I'll go
to the pay window, get out a couple bucks, we'll go get a hamburger
and we'll sleep in the truck on the way back to Montgomery. So I go
to the pay window. The guy counted me out $135. That stack of money
looked that tall. I celebrated with a $1.99 steak dinner and slept
at a motel.''
</P>
<P>
   No circle of friends has ever had more fun or success on race
tracks. Or suffered as much tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie's career was cut short by a 1981 crash at Charlotte.
Bobby's career ended in a 1988 wreck at Pocono, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the torch was being passed to a second generation Gang,
Bobby lost two sons to accidents. Clifford died in a 1992 practice
crash at Michigan International Speedway. His brother, Davey, on
the brink of becoming a star in the No. 28 car, was killed trying
to land his helicopter at Talladega a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Davey was going to watch Neil Bonnett, a family friend, practice
at Talladega that day. In a cruel twist of fate, Bonnett was killed
a year later during practice for the 1994 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to get to Hueytown from Birmingham, you take an exit off
I-20 onto Allison-Bonnett Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Allisons live out their painful pasts doing personal
appearances at racing events and consulting for various race
enterprises. Farmer suffered immensely, too. He was a passenger in
Davey's helicopter that day. His camper has a heart-shaped decal
bearing the car numbers of Davey, Clifford and Bonnett and the
words ``Forever In Our Hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, who will be 67 on Thursday, still races on the
dirt-covered short tracks. But Joan, his wife of 48 years, no
longer goes to the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live with the memories every day,'' she said. ``You have to
pass a room full of trophies to get anywhere in our house. I've had
my fill of going to races. It's ... too painful. Racing's cost us
too many dear friends and hurt two of them so bad they couldn't get
back in a race car.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been young drivers in recent years who've tried
passing themselves off as members of a new Alabama Gang. Not so
fast, Donnie said. The Allisons and Farmer incorporated the Alabama
Gang name two years ago. ``We did it because of the people that
were trying to use the name to solicit sponsors,'' Donnie said.
``We told them, `Yeah, we'll help you solicit sponsors, but the
Alabama Gang corporation's going make their fair share off it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The current crop of Alabama drivers _ including Stricklin,
Donnie's son-in-law _ will never be card-carrying members of the
Gang, Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we was racing, Bobby, Donnie and myself, we lived
together in one apartment, we traveled together, we built cars
together, we helped each other like brothers. They just don't do
that anymore. Everybody's individuals now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Allison
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, Bobby Allison lost his racing career in a
hellish accident, his sons Davey and Clifford in accidents, his
wife to a divorce and most of his money as a race team owner.
Hecannot remember big chunks of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Although he walks with a limp, the result of his legs being
crushed in the June 1988 crash at Pocono, he laughs at the thought
of his daughter signing him up as host of a dance on a cruise in
December. A pilot since 1967, he uses his twin-engine Aerostar
seven-seater like most folks use a car. He is back among his
public.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot forget the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I was enjoying life, but I don't think
that's accurate. Life is a struggle,'' Allison, 60, said. ``I still
hurt every day.'' Allison is in the Talladega garage area, giving
advice to ARCA driver Jimmy Kitchens. He is asked: Do you still
like being around racing?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days that I do and days that I don't,'' he said.
``There were days early on that I didn't want to be around and the
team had my name on it and, of course, a lot of my investment in
it. So they said I had to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would hide out in the team trailer, a contrast to his
approach until 10 years ago. ``I was the ultimate people person, I
thought,'' he said. ``Lots of friends, did lots of things. I was
really busy. I was 50 years old, had won Daytona for the third
time, was doing some experimenting on the airplane and I was doing
the short racing. The eight days building up to the day that I got
hurt at Pocono, I won two short track races and I did some personal
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, I felt healthy, I felt energetic and I was really
enjoying Davey's success. And I was hoping that Clifford would be
able to follow along. Clifford was four years younger than Davey
and had taken a little different route.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles as he remembers his boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey was serious, always serious about racing. He wanted to
race from the time he was a little-bitty guy. And he really pursued
that, to the point that his mother threatened him one day that if
he didn't do something else, have some other kind of enjoyment, she
was going to whip him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clifford, on the other hand, always was looking for whatever
was the fun thing to do. The irony of life to me is Davey worked,
worked, worked and got killed playing (flying a helicopter). And
Clifford played, played, played and got killed working (in a track
practice accident).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their personalities were unique and opposing to the point that
Davey could be innocent when he was little and talk himself into a
whipping. And Clifford would be guilty and talk himself into a
raise in his allowance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he gets choked up, stares out in the distance to regain his
composure and changes the subject.
</P>
<P>
   There have been so many mountains to climb, beginning with the
recovery from the wreck at Pocono that caused brain damage and
serious memory loss. His recovery took years, and he still cannot
recall the Winston Cup races of '88. He said collaborating with
racing writer Ben White on the book about his career, ``Circle of
Triumph,'' brought back some memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I talked quite a bit,'' Allison said. ``It was fairly
early in my recovery and a lot of the conversations with him really
helped me remember things. I had an incredible amount of memory
loss. Doing the book really helped me gain some of that back.'' He
still has two daughters, his plane and his fishing. But he
attributes the loss of his sons to the marriage breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next divorce you see that's friendly, call me collect,''
Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Allison
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Allison learned his lesson a long time ago. Be visible,
and opportunity will come.
</P>
<P>
   So he spends his weekends making personal appearances, working
with a NASCAR truck team, golfing and fishing and hobnobbing in the
garage area at Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, 59, is involved with a group trying to put together a
Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing about our business is speculation,'' he
said. ``So many people want to do something, they've got big plans
and it never materializes.'' Allison is quite familiar what that
sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he suffered a severe concussion, a fractured cheekbone
and a broken leg in a crash. He was well again within six months
but became NASCAR's forgotten man. The downward spiral actually had
begun earlier, when he was driving patchwork cars for obscure
owners on pickup deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got hurt, there was a period of time that I didn't go
around the race tracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like now, looking back, 20-20 hindsight, that probably
was a mistake. Once I got out of racing, I did not stay away. I've
been actively involved one way or another ever since.'' But he
never felt forgotten by the public. ``When I got hurt so bad, I got
letters and cards from eight countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison was perhaps the greatest crossover driver ever between
NASCAR and Indy-car racing. He won 10 Winston Cup races. In 1970,
he finished fourth in the Indianapolis 500 and won the World 600 in
Charlotte on the same weekend. He was NASCAR Rookie of the Year in
1967 and Indy Rookie of the Year in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The moment for which he is most noted came in the 1979 Daytona
500, on the first nationally televised stock car race. He slugged
it out with Cale Yarborough, with help from brother Bobby, after a
race-ending wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Red Farmer
</P>
<P>
   The pit road area at Talladega Short Track is an unmarked patch
of dirt behind a chain-link fence. When a car pulls in, it is not
met by a uniformed pit crew. Drivers have to wave frantically to
get the attention of their helpers. Winston Cup this ain't.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Rutledge has just pulled in with a flat tire on his
beat-up Chevy. His two-man tire team is slow getting the lugnuts
off. To let them know he is in a hurry, Rutledge keeps gunning his
motor, unaware that he is trashing a legend.
</P>
<P>
   The side-door exhaust is making a mess of Farmer, blowing red
dirt in his red head, which is under the rear end of car F97.
Farmer is unscrewing some bolts to change the gearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a rookie driver in the Cruisers, a beginner's class.
He probably doesn't realize what he was doing,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with TV
specials and lots of ceremony. Farmer, 66, is celebrating his 50th
year of racing, too, by playing in the dirt. He still races on dirt
tracks around the South. On this recent afternoon, he is covered in
grime, trying to keep a wounded machine moving in the Alabama Dirt
Track Jamboree.
</P>
<P>
   It's just Red and a volunteer helper, Scott Meadows. One crew
member is home with the flu, another is visiting his mother in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer wrecked the night before in the 30-lap late-model
event.They've changed gears, tires, springs and the entire front
end from the wreck, just to get ready for the 40-lap Championship
race that pays $3,000 to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can we change on it, Scott?'' Farmer asked Meadows.
``We've changed everything but the number and paint job.'' Farmer's
luck was the only thing that didn't change. He wrecked and was out
on the fifth lap of the Championship, finishing his day by being
pushed ingloriously to the pits by a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer is the last member of the Alabama Gang who still crawls
through windows of race cars looking for the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be racing 50 years after I started,'' said
Farmer, who has won nearly 800 features and has been recognized as
one of NASCAR's 50 greatest drivers. ``When I was 15 years old, my
mother figured I'd never live to be 18. And when I got 18, she said
I'd never reach 21, that I'd probably kill myself. I was always
kind of a wild child. If I had known I was going to live this long,
I'd have taken better care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He can still beat drivers half his age. Farmer won a feature
last year at the Talladega track, where on May 4, 1990, he beat
Dale Earnhardt in the Race of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing's a lot more fun,'' Farmer said, ``when you don't have
to do it for groceries and you've got a Social Security check
coming in.

 &HT;    Scuba becoming outdoor pastime everyone can do
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It took a little prodding to get Linda Pazdzinski
underwater. Now it's hard for her to explain her initial
apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (husband) Frank and the boys got certified in scuba, I
told them I wanted nothing to do with it,'' the 48-year-old
Mariettan said. ``I was afraid. It was frightening to me not to
know what was underwater. But after I experienced it, there was
nothing to fear at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to try scuba two years ago in a big tank at the
inaugural Discover Diving Expo at the Cobb Galleria Centre _ where
the show will be held for the third consecutive year this weekend _
was love at first breath. And it has further unified the family.
</P>
<P>
   Now all five members are certified. Frank III, 50, and sons
Frank IV, 17, and Mike, 16, all were certified three years ago as
part of a Boys Scouts high adventure trip to the Florida Keys.
Later, Chrissy, 19, joined the family passion. All have received at
least advanced training.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, it's wonderful when we're all diving,'' said
Linda, who had her checkout dive for certification at Bonaire, in
the Lesser Antilles, as part of an anniversary gift. ``It's a nice
family bonding thing to do, something we all love.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also sort of a holiday tradition. The Pazdzinskis have
spent the last two Thanksgivings diving in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we dive, we go off in teams of three and twos,'' said
Frank III, a corporate manager for Coca-Cola Enterprises. ``We're
down there holding hands. My 17-year-old will even hold my hand.
It's a bonding I just can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pazdzinskis' love of scuba is not all that uncommon, as the
sport _ once reserved only for macho thrill-seekers _ becomes more
popular and family-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only sports activity we know of that everybody in
the family can participate in at the same level,'' said Ron
Gryzelka, president of Atlanta Scuba and Swim Academy in Marietta.
``Mom, Dad and Junior are all equal in scuba diving.''
</P>
<P>
   Gryzelka is part of a scuba-crazy family himself. Wife Barb, son
Brad and daughter Dawn have been certified divers for years; they
frequently spend Christmas and New Year's diving in Bonaire. Their
passion for diving got them into the scuba business, which includes
the academy as well as a travel agency called Caribbean Dive Tours.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has responded to adventurous families, who make up
a large portion of the 2.7 million people the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association estimated went diving at least once in
1997. Family dive packages are numerous, and some resorts even
offer day care or baby-sitting to accommodate families with young
children. There also are family live-aboard programs, in which the
divers eat in, sleep in and dive from a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have crew members there just to take care of the
kids,'' Gryzelka said, adding that the crew will take the children
on short trips to teach them more about the ocean's environment.
``The kids have fun and they learn something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gryzelka learned a thing or two on a family live-aboard trip
that has spurred him to lobby for a change in the minimum age
regulation in the U.S. He had befriended the father of a family of
four, Steven Weinberg, a University of Luxembourg professor and
scuba lover, while on board a 184-foot schooner near Belize, and
their long philosophical discussions frequently centered on the
U.S. minimum of 12 years old to become certified in scuba. That age
was adopted by the Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg was used to the no-minimum in Europe; one of his
children was certified at age 6. He said, ``I don't understand you
Americans. You're so aggressive and progressive on everything you
do, except for scuba diving. ... I love (scuba diving), but if I
didn't have the opportunity of having my family involved, I
wouldn't be doing what I love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That got Gryzelka, as well as others, thinking about changing
the age requirements, and many hope the issue will be discussed at
the RSTC conference next weekend in Scranton, Pa. Gryzelka contends
that 12 years old is an arbitrary age, and that kids much younger
are mature enough to handle diving.
</P>
<P>
   Current RSTC guidelines, which are adhered to by most
certification agencies, allow junior divers between the ages of 12
and 14 to be certified only for diving with an adult; those 15 and
over can be certified in open-water diving. Those supporting a
change want to open the door to younger children, provided they
dive under close supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Christini of Scuba Schools International in Fort Collins,
Colo., said any change would be based on safety. He expects some
changes to be made eventually. ``It's really about setting up
parameters,'' he said. ``It's not so much about lowering the age
for certification, but to find ways to expose (younger kids to
scuba).''
</P>
<P>
   Any proposed change is news to RSTC national coordinator Ken
Brock, who says the issue has not been included on the agenda for
next weekend's conference, although he admits it could come up in
open discussion. Brock says the way to develop young divers is to
expose them to extensive snorkeling, not necessarily strapping
tanks to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always find an 8- or 9-year-old just as mature as a
12- or 13-year-old,'' Brock said, adding that when the minimum of
12 was determined, it was based on how well a child could
understand the instruction and not on physical or maturity traits.
</P>
<P>
   Christini and Gryzelka say the issue will be discussed, and
there's a chance a new guideline will be in place next year.
Opening up the opportunity for more kids to get involved with
diving also strengthens the possibility that more families will
participate.
</P>

   ``Last year, we probably turned down 60 kids that were 10 or
11,'' Gryzelka said. ``And at the same time, we also were turning
down their parents.

 &HT;    Road-weary Munson returning to Georgia
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Larry Munson, Georgia's legendary radio
play-by-play announcer, has decided to come home.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, who moved to Nashville last January to be near his two
sons, said Saturday that he has purchased a home in Atlanta and
will be moving back in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The travel was starting to kill me,'' said Munson, in his 33rd
year of broadcasting Georgia football. ``I was leaving Nashville
early Friday morning and driving back Monday morning after (Georgia
coach Jim) Donnan's call-in show. I was exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson, who is in his early 70s, says he does not know how much
longer he'll broadcast Georgia games, saying he's taking it ``one
year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy lifting
</P>
<P>
   ESPN'S College Game Day Show went off without a hitch Saturday
morning with the set located on top of Georgia's Tate Student
Center. In order to ensure that the roof could hold the multi-ton
set and all the crew and equipment, additional support was brought
in and placed in the Tate Center's game room, which was just
underneath the roof. In order to do that, ESPN had to compensate
Georgia for the revenue lost by shutting down the game room for
several days. It came to around $600.
</P>
<P>
   Early truce
</P>
<P>
   While there are a number of stories this week about a personal
feud between Donnan and his counterpart at Tennessee, Phillip
Fulmer, the two men exchanged pleasantries on the field less than
an hour before the game. Donnan was reportedly upset at Fulmer for
putting Peyton Manning back in the game late in a 38-13 loss last
year in Knoxville. Fulmer supposedly was mad because Donnan hired
his best recruiter, Rodney Garner, last January.
</P>
<P>
   Tough ticket
</P>
<P>
   The largest crowd in the history of Sanford Stadium (86,117
capacity) was expected for Saturday's game. One unidentified
Georgia student wanted some tickets so bad he stole a stack of
about 60 from the ticket window at Stegeman Coliseum on Friday. The
student walked right up to the window where other students were
picking up their tickets and reached in the window and grabbed a
stack from the attendant. UGA police chief Chuck Horton said there
was an arrest in the case Saturday morning but would not release
the name of the student. The tickets had a face value of about
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   National spotlight
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which televised the game, and ESPN, which brought College
Game Day to Athens, were just a small fraction of the national
media in attendance on Saturday. Among the national college
football writers in Georgia press box were: Mark Blaudschun (Boston
Globe), Ivan Maisel (Sports Illustrated), Dick Weiss (New York
Dailey News), Andy Bagnato (Chicago Tribune), Chris Dufresne (Los
Angeles Times), and Steve Weiberg (USA Today).
</P>
<P>
   Stanfill honored
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia All-American lineman Bill Stanfill, the Outland
Trophy winner of 1968, was honored before the game for his
induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. Stanfill will be
formerly inducted in December in New York. Stanfill, from Cairo,
Ga., went on to have an All-Pro career with the Miami Dolphins and
was a member of the undefeated Super Bowl champions of 1972.

L.A.'S RELAXED RULES ALLOW CITY EMPLOYEES TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA ON
THE SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of Los Angeles city workers find time
and energy to moonlight on second jobs after hours or weekends,
according to records obtained by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of moonlighting has expanded since the City Council
eased rules for employees six years ago at the same time elected
officials were being barred from earning outside money.
</P>
<P>
   City employees spend their off hours in private law practices;
in engineering, planning and architectural consulting businesses;
and in real estate. They teach, do other people's taxes and work in
medical offices. They deal rare books, and run photography studios
and boutiques. Some even get extra cash selling tickets or ushering
at Dodger games.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other major cities, there is no central oversight of
moonlighting in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially haphazard supervision and record-keeping does little
to ensure the city is protected from conflicts of interest or that
outside work does not interfere with city employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to imagine how people can spend a
large amount of time on a second job and efficiently do their first
job,'' said Tim Lynch, administrative deputy in the City
Controller's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way people can work full time, live a normal life
and do this. If it's more than a few hours a week, people are going
to be completely distracted from their city functions. It has to
encroach.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 14.7 percent of workers in surveyed city departments
moonlight, according to a review of the two-thirds of the general
city work force for which records could be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than double the 5.9 percent rate at which all
employed Americans moonlighted during 1997, according to U.S.
Department of Labor statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 of the 20,000 workers in the surveyed L.A. city
departments _ police, City Attorney's Office, general services,
information technology agency, and engineering and sanitation
bureaus _ have permission to moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   The number could be even higher because each department sets its
own rules and records often are not kept at a central point.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 3,000 firefighters, who have the most flexibility in
their city schedules to moonlight, aren't kept tabs on through a
master list, for instance, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also exclude the Library, Recreation and Parks,
Utilities, Airports, and Harbor departments.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of the Los Angeles Police Department's 12,600
sworn officers and civilian employees find a way to make money on
the side, records show. That's a rate more than double the national
average for similar ``protective service'' jobs, according to
federal labor statistics.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Attorney's Office, one out of every dozen lawyers,
who commonly make six-figure public salaries, do private legal work
on the side or operate other kinds of businesses, ranging from a
carwash to a fast-food stand.
</P>
<P>
   Even four members of Mayor Richard Riordan's staff moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' rules on moonlighting were rewritten in 1992 as
part of a broad revision of the city's ethics rules, in response to
a suit brought by a group of city employee unions challenging the
constitutionality of financial disclosure requirements, said
Rebecca Avila, the Ethics Commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations banned moonlighting among elected officials, and
required strict disclosures by several thousand bureaucrats in
decision-making posts, but left wide discretion in handling others
who moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics law was to get at the elected official and the
high-level official who might have a conflict, rather than concern
about employees earning outside income,'' said Robert M. Stern,
co-director of the Los Angeles-based Center for Government Studies.
</P>
<P>
   (2nd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   With new discretion on lower-ranking employees, City Attorney
James Hahn, for instance, reversed the office's longstanding
practice of forbidding city attorneys from taking on outside legal
work, concluding the new law mandated a case-by-case review
instead, said Chief Administrative Officer Matt Middlebrook.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty city attorneys now have authorization to work on private
cases, while 11 have received permission to moonlight as outside
arbitrators, according to office records.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and San Francisco are among local governments that
continue to prohibit city attorneys from doing outside legal work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just too much potential for a conflict,'' said
Jennifer Hoyle, spokeswoman for Chicago's Law Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, there are logistic problems. How can you conduct an
outside practice with court hearings between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and
not have it interfere with your city work?''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley has banned moonlighting by his
staff altogether, said John Camper, deputy press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such restriction in Riordan's office, where one
mayoral aide runs a pay phone business after hours, another has a
band, and a couple teach night classes in Los Angeles Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where the government doesn't even demand regular
reviews of its employees' city job performances, there has been no
political will to confront the unions with closer scrutiny of
workers' moonlighting habits.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, San Francisco's city and county charter mandates
strict moonlighting accounting, with all non-emergency employees
required to file requests with the umbrella Department of Human
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in essence, is the check and balance for making sure the
outside work is not in conflict with the scope of their city
work,'' said Alice Villagomez, San Francisco deputy director of
employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Allen, assistant general manager of the city's Personnel
Department, said the issue of moonlighting and how to keep tabs on
it has never been comprehensively addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has never come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of better controls, problems usually aren't
detected until a member of the public complains.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a deputy city attorney was ordered to stop using a
city phone number and fax while working on an outside civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Deborah Breithaupt, declined comment except to say
she is no longer handling the private litigation for a client in a
dispute involving the sale of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Assistant City Attorney Dan Woodard said he ordered
Breithaupt to stop using city equipment, but declined to say
whether she had been disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Her case illustrates what internal audits have shown elsewhere
in the city _ that forms intended to track moonlighting often are
filled out incompletely or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Middlebrook said Breithaupt's request did not state she would be
appearing on behalf of private clients in court, an omission she
was ordered to correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a court appearance has to be in someone's request,
and she made a court appearance without the request,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city controller last year, in response to public concern,
audited the Bureau of Engineering to try to determine whether
customers were being steered to city engineers' private firms.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found record keeping was so lax it was impossible to
determine whether abuses were in fact occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside employment for some of your employees may be in
conflict with their present official duties if fully disclosed as
required in your outside employment policy or the city Ethics
Commission guidelines,'' the audit concluded.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, the bureau's chief management analyst, said
moonlighting is more tightly monitored now to guarantee workers
aren't too fatigued by extracurricular jobs to perform their city
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-four engineering employees have filed outside employment
forms, the majority for consulting businesses. Together, they
reported they would be working up to 750 hours per week, or an
average of about nine hours per week each outside their city jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (3rd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish said the majority of the department's
officers follow the rules. Those restrictions prohibit moonlighting
in certain businesses, like bars, and restrict outside work to 20
hours per week, among other rules intended to prevent conflicts
with officers' city duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be disciplined and there is no reason for
them not to comply,'' Kalish aid.
</P>
<P>
   The department has approved work permits for 1,615 security
jobs, 391 movie set jobs, 119 instruction positions, 82 sales
positions and 511 other kinds of work, LAPD computer-generated
records show. The number of officers with multiple permits could
not be determined, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers like Chris Cortijo say that legitimate off-duty work
helps make up for reductions in city overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of overtime coming out of the city now and
this is a good way to make something extra on my days off,'' said
Cortijo, who for years has done traffic control for movie companies
through the private Hollywood firm, Pacific Production Services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Jan. 1, 1997, nine officers were found to be
working without authorization in connection with more serious
matters, from associating with known felons to running illegal
pyramid schemes for which they were disciplined, LAPD records show.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have been caught using city equipment _ including
phones, faxes, computers, radios and other gear _ in connection
with their outside businesses, disciplinary records reveal.
</P>
<P>
   For many, moonlighting has become an essential part of their
economic lives. Some say they have to supplement city wages, others
hope to make enough on the outside to leave the public sector
someday, while still others say it is the way to a better
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Claudia Summers, a civil engineering
drafting technician has worked 40 hours a week for the city, and 13
or so more in a medical office.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, because she works four 10-hour shifts for the
city, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I do it? I don't know. My husband says I work too much,
but it's just been that way forever. Sometimes you wonder if it's
worth it. You have to pay all those taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney George Garikian helps run the family-owned
California Car Wash in Glendale. It's mostly weekend work, as well
as the handling of minor legal matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just help oversee it after work hours and make sure
everything is running as it should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kalustian, a deputy attorney assigned to a North
Hills-area gang unit, said his photography hobby has turned into a
small business that mostly involves snapping pictures of kids on
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I could make a living doing it. But after
working with the gang unit during the week, spending the weekends
with smiling kids swimming and playing flag football relaxes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus Wong, a bureau of sanitation management assistant, said he
has kept his old college job as an usher for the Dodgers to help
pay off his new home in Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While he loves baseball, Wong, like most city moonlighters, said
there's one overriding consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's financial.''

LOS ANGELES: ``she said.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   She moved her father into her home. But after a month, worrying
that he might tumble down the stairs, she decided to place him in a
retirement home where he could have 24-hour care.
</P>
<P>
   She packed his belongings and put them in storage, hoping that
one day, when he got better, she could move him back on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The process brought a flood of memories of her father as a
young, vibrant man. He had meticulously charted her bottle feedings
as a baby, taken her trick-or-treating every Halloween and taught
her how to bodysurf at the beach in Santa Monica and ski on the
slopes of Mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   He attended her swim meets, tutored her in math and encouraged
her to go to college. She remembered the smell of his aftershave,
his neatly pressed suits and the briefcase he would always carry to
work as an electrical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling preserves her father's mementos, carefully tucking them
away in a storage unit. His amateur radio station license. His
degrees from the University of Texas and Stanford. His published
research projects. A laminated map on which he charted every port
of call during his World War II days in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day in 1994 when Sperling found her father disoriented
in his condo, he lavished attention on his sporty red Nissan 300ZX.
Every Saturday, he washed and polished it. He'd roar off through
the canyons and hills, across Mulholland Highway and to the beach
to catch the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered the retirement home, the car sat silently in his
daughter's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said, ``I kept it for a long time, thinking, maybe
...''
</P>
<P>
   A year after her dad moved to the nursing home, Tyler was born,
and Sperling found herself torn between a father who needed
pampering and a baby in Pampers. She and her husband decided to
sell one of their stores so she could focus on her role as a
caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, son Blake was born. Now her days start at 5
a.m., when Blake wakes the family, and don't end until late at
night, after the pager that links daughter to father sounds for the
last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I wake up, my head is going a mile a minute dealing
with the kids, dealing with my dad,'' Sperling said. ``I always
feel like it's there, hovering over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the day came when it was time to sell her father's
car -- the symbol of his independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really upsetting. I can still cry now just thinking
about it,'' Sperling said. ``It meant that he wasn't getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   She could not muster the courage to tell him for months. When
she did, he accused her of trying to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   ```How dare you sell my car!'' he shouted. ``I'm going to drive
again!''
</P>
<P>
   What could she say?
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand what it's like for me because he
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The party was meant to celebrate Father's Day, her father's
birthday and Blake's first birthday, which all fell on the same
day. Sperling was determined to make her dad happy.
</P>
<P>
   Cheeks flushed, she raced in and out of her house, making sure
her father had his favorite beer, helping to spoon-feed him
watermelon chunks. She dashed to the other end of her patio, trying
to coax Tyler to eat his tortilla, getting a bottle ready for
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Her father sat idly, seeming not to notice, never offering a
thank-you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing to feel good about,'' Sperling said the
day after the party. ``It's not like I can say he's remarkably
better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way she imagined her father living his twilight
years.
</P>
<P>
   He suffers from delusions. ``Is anybody home out there?'' he'll
blurt out. ``I have someone on the other line,'' her father told
her another day, as if still working at Hughes Aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But what keeps her going are her memories of what he once was --
and the memories that sometimes flash back to her father in vivid,
prophetic clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the beach,'' he said one afternoon, recalling his
surfing days. ``You go in and the wave comes along. And if you
catch it right, you ride in on the front of the wave and come in to
shore.''

BABY BOOMERS DIVIDE LIVES BETWEEN KIDS, PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was one of the happiest days of Ellen
Sperling's life.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 hours of labor, she gave birth to her first son, Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later came a phone call that gave a bittersweet tinge to
her day.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Maurice Chernin, was on the phone, flustered.
Suffering from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, he couldn't
remember where he had parked his car.
</P>
<P>
   On a single day, she had become part of a growing phenomenon in
America -- the sandwich generation: baby boomers caught between the
demands of caring for their children and caring for elderly parents
who can no longer fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As Sperling lay in her hospital bed, drained from childbirth,
she talked to her father, retracing his steps. After a few minutes,
she persuaded him to look right outside -- and there was the car.
Then she repeated precise directions from his retirement home to
the hospital, so he could come visit his first grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She was exhausted -- and crushed, as she saw her father slowly
slipping away, never to return as the vibrant man she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you're dealing with a crisis, when it's
so overwhelming it just takes over your life,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a generation driven by love and loyalty, but also by
guilt and anger for having to care for the parents who once cared
for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks that have passed since Tyler's birthday in
1995, the crises have worsened. They tear Sperling, 35, between her
traditional role as a wife and mother and her new duties as
surrogate parent to a 75-year-old father who can no longer care for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   She often wonders if it's worth it for her father to keep living
as he is. ``I think about it all the time,'' she said, tears
filling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, he's not hooked to a machine. But he doesn't know
what's going on; he's on medications. It's not the life that
anybody would want.''
</P>
<P>
   One in four households in America is involved in the daily care
of an elderly parent, tending to people disabled by Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's, strokes and traumatic brain injuries, according to the
Children of Aging Parents organization in Levittown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40 percent of Americans who care for their parents
are in this sandwich generation, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 people in Los Angeles -- 40 percent of the 4,000
clients the Los Angeles Caregiver Resource Center has served in the
1990s -- claim membership in this growing clan, according to the
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``All signs indicate that the issue is going to grow into a
bigger problem,'' said Rigo Saborio, co-director of the center,
part of a statewide network of centers serving families caring for
brain-impaired adults.
</P>
<P>
   Past generations have had to deal with aging parents, but the
sandwich generation is different.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this century, about 75 percent of Americans died before
they reached 65. Today, according to the 1990 census, more than 70
percent of the population lives past that age.
</P>
<P>
   That number is only expected to grow, with one in five Americans
-- 70 million -- projected to be at least 65 by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is you have the population aging, and with
technological advances you have people living longer,'' Saborio
said. ``However, you have a lot more disabilities that people are
living with. In some cases they are life-threatening, but they
don't end a person's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that a majority -- 66 percent -- of people who
care for their loved ones are clinically depressed. In a few
extreme cases, there have been caregivers who committed suicide,
Saborio noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's financially stressful for caregivers, it's emotionally
draining and there are a lot of feelings of guilt,'' Saborio said.
``You feel you can't get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Juggling chaos has become a way of life for Sperling. It means
getting up at 5 a.m. to squeeze in her treadmill workout and then
running nonstop, dealing with Tyler's potty-training tantrums and a
difficult father who erupts when Sperling makes decisions for him
that he can no longer handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real shock to see, especially because people always
said to me, your dad was so brilliant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when her father began to repeatedly ask for
directions to the two Mail Boxes Etc. stores owned by Sperling and
her husband, David, she suspected he was taking a turn for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Maurice Chernin had been able to care for himself,
even after being diagnosed in 1986 with Parkinson's disease, a
brain disorder that impairs muscle control and causes tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day &UR;  &LR; her father failed to answer his phone. Sperling
rushed to his Agoura Hills condominium, where she found him
dehydrated and disoriented. He didn't know when he had last taken
his medicine or eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told her that her father was displaying symptoms of
Alzheimer's disease, another brain disorder. Patients lose their
short-term memory and ability to reason. There is no medical
treatment to cure or halt its slow, steady progression, but
patients often live for years.
</P>
<P>
   So for Sperling, as the only child of a divorced man with few
living relatives, her father's care fell suddenly and squarely on
her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like there's no one else to do it, so there's a sense
of duty,'' she said.

WELDER IS KILLED IN AN EXPLOSION AT THE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An explosion in the hull of an oil barge in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard Saturday killed a welder and injured his
assistant, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred around 4:30 p.m. while the welder was on
a ladder, fire officials said. He was blown out of the hull through
an open hatch. The force of the blast propelled his body over the
starboard side of the ship; it came to rest on the dry dock, about
40 feet from the ship, said Assistant Chief Steven DeRosa of the
Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The welder's cracked and battered helmet was found 100 feet off
the ship's port side. The victim's name was not released Saturday
night because the authorities had not yet notified his next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, who was holding the ladder for the welder, was
burned across his body and had cuts on his arms. He was listed in
stable condition at Kings County Hospital Center Saturday night.
His name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred on the dry dock of Eastern Technical
Services, a company that repairs ships in the Navy Yard, which is
on the East River between the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges.
Telephone calls to the company's office Saturday night were
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in other parts of the ship yard said they saw a flash
and then a rumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole ship vibrated,'' said a stunned Hector Mazara, 32, a
welder at a nearby dry dock. ``Everybody, everything vibrated.
Vibrated. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred in a compartment of the ship that is used
to transport oil, officials said. Investigators said they did not
know the exact cause of the blast, but said they are looking
closely at two possible scenarios: that the man accidentally turned
his welding flame on his own gas tank or, more likely, that he
ignited oil fumes that remained in the compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said that the compartment appeared to have been
cleaned out but that they were uncertain whether the hull had been
tested for lingering gases.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Castro, a ship welder for 18 years, suspected that the
explosion was caused by residual fumes from the oil. ``The reason
that it's so dangerous is that there are gases that remain there,
gases that are explosive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said that another welder had died under similar
circumstances two months ago while working on a boat at an adjacent
dock.

 &HT;    Yankees not quite great
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Memo to the New York Yankees: There is this problem
with trying to rank with the greatest teams of all time. You have
to do more than just tease through September. You actually must do
it through October, and we're talking about more than just once.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Atlanta Braves. No, ask Johnny Bench, the Hall of Fame
catcher for the Cincinnati Reds. He once rolled his eyes after we
asked him if the Braves of the 1990s resembled his Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many world championships have they won?'' said Bench,
knowing the Braves are one shy of the Machine's two.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan shook his head Saturday night at Jacobs Field after
we asked him that same question about the Braves and the Indians,
now playing against what many have called the Greatest Team in the
History of the World.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any of these teams (the Braves or the Yankees) got in front
of the Big Red Machine, they'd get run over like they were a toy
truck. It's a joke to compare them to us,'' said Morgan, another
Hall of Famer from those Reds teams before becoming a TV analyst.
</P>
<P>
   So here we have the Yankees of Williams, Jeter and Wells, not to
be confused with those of Mantle, Berra and Ford, continuing their
search for the gateway to immortality Saturday night at Jacobs
Field in the American League Championship Series against the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for these Yankees is that they've yet to discover
even the hemisphere to immortality. This has much to do with the
Indians, suddenly the worst thing to happen to New Yorkers since
Mayor Guiliani had the nerve to ask them to act civil. After going
meekly in Game 1, the Indians have stuck more than a few arrows
into the puffy hype of these Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way according to those who
anointed these Yankees with the elite in baseball history after
they won 114 games during the regular season. They later swept
Texas out of the Division Series by holding them to only a run.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that Yankees' blowout in the ALCS's opening game
before the Greatest Team in the History of the World quickly looked
as overrated as their Atlanta counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reasons for why both teams are having problems
getting to the next level and staying there,'' Morgan said. ``Every
great team has The Man. You have Michael Jordan for the Bulls. The
49ers had Joe Montana. We had Tony Perez, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench
and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Yankees, Morgan shook his head again, while thinking
of a team filled with nice guys and no leaders. As for the Braves,
Morgan told the truth by saying the Braves' foolishly shipped their
version of The Man to the Indians two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't coincidental,'' Morgan said, ``that they won their
only title (in 1995) when David Justice put the pressure on his
back by getting on the Atlanta fans. Then he hit the (World
Series-winning) homer. They've depended on their pitchers for
leadership, but look back in history. It can't be a pitcher. It has
to come from an everyday player.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who run these Yankees apparently don't get it. The same
goes for the Braves' Designated Geniuses.

 &HT;    Lineup rational out in left field
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ For the biggest game of 1998, the team that
considers itself the class of the National League sent out this
lineup:
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista in left field;
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams in right;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino at second base;
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez catching.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's a rationale. (Isn't there always?) The Braves were
facing a left-hander, and Perez is Maddux's personal catcher. But
this isn't reason enough to bench Javy Lopez and Ryan Klesko and
Keith Lockhart, not when you're down 0-2, not when the lefty in
question is the journeyman Sterling Hitchcock. This is, alas, what
the Atlanta Braves have become: A bully of a club that can be
intimidated by a Hitchcock who's somewhat less scary than Sir
Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Williams set an NLCS record Saturday with four strikeouts. Perez
had two singles. Graffanino walked twice and scored the Braves'
only run. Bautista was 0-for-2. If these irregulars were no more or
less culpable for the Game 3 loss than the everyday Braves _ Andres
Galarraga and Walt Weiss and the Joneses _ it was nonetheless
bewildering to see a team weaken itself by design.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Braves were weakened further, Bobby Cox pulling
Maddux for a pinch-hitter after five innings. (Said pinch-hitter,
Greg Colbrunn, struck out.) It was a panicky move, made because Cox
had seen his offense wither and die. The Braves have scored three
runs in three NLCS games. They've had no extra-base hits since
Lockhart's double in the fourth inning of Game 1. Twice Saturday
they had a runner on third with one out and couldn't deliver him
home.
</P>
<P>
   The great surprise is that this isn't all that surprising. The
Braves are utterly dependant on the home run. They scored 15 runs
in the Division Series _ 11 on homers. But pit the Braves against
pitchers who know how to keep the ball in the yard _ pitchers like
the Braves' own _ and these hitters go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Said Galarraga, 1-for-11 in the NLCS: ``I don't know how to
explain what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not so hard, really. This team is incapable of
manufacturing. Neither Lockhart or Michael Tucker, both brought on
late, could produce a tying sacrifice fly. Neither Colbrunn or
Lopez, unaccountably saved for one pinch-hit turn, could stroke a
two-out hit. With these Braves it's all or nothing; through three
games it has been nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bottom-line business,'' Williams said. ``You can
analyze it until you get tired, but the truth is that we didn't get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves looked tired as dusk fell Saturday, tired and
confused. ``I don't think we've given (the Padres) any momentum,''
said Cox, lapsing into his postseason doublespeak. ``I think we've
stopped ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They stopped themselves Saturday before the game began. They
stopped themselves by deploying a lineup more suited to the
nightcap of a doubleheader. They stopped themselves by yanking
their pitcher too soon and trotting out their better hitters too
late. They acted not at all like the mighty team they're supposed
to be. They acted like a team about to get swept.

 &HT;    Tennessee volunteers nothing
 &HT;    By Bisher Furman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ As the clock wound down and the autumn twilight
closed in on this leafy college town, and the public address
announcer, Brooks Whitmire, switched to exciting bulletins about
Georgia women's basketball and broke the news that the men's
volleyball team would play Clemson Sunday, you gathered the white
flag was being hoisted. The Georgia football team was in arrears of
Tennessee, 22-3, and a steady flow of red and black was crowding
the exits, and the hurt had not yet begun to set in.
</P>
<P>
   What had gone awry here will be no unsolved mystery. But where
had that team gone that had so distressed Louisiana State in its
own dreaded lair?
</P>
<P>
   This one became solvable from the toss of the coin. Georgia had
chosen to start on offense, not the usual style. Most teams choose
to defer. This one backfired on the second play, when the snap was
fumbled, Deon Grant recovered, and Tennessee had the ball on
Georgia's 19-yard line. Champ Bailey got the ball back with an
interception at the 3-yard line, but the Bulldogs were in such a
bind they couldn't escape until Tennessee kicked a field goal, and
things Red and Black never got any better.
</P>
<P>
   There was no element of a contest from that time until the
finale, when Philip Fulmer and Jim Donnan engaged in a traditional
postgame handshake that set a record in its brevity. Then the
exhilarated Fulmer trotted down toward the stands, where delirious
Tennessee fans sat, and flung his sweaty cap into the mass, then
trotted away.
</P>
<P>
   These were the same fans who later gathered beneath the podium
at Tate Student Center, where ESPN's Game Day crew was perched, and
chanted, ``Overrated! Overrated!'' chiding, of course, those who
had gone against form and picked the No. 7 team to upset the No. 4
team, based on those infernal polls. Instead, it was no Georgia
upset, and in the course thereof, they not only saw visions of a
Southeastern Conference championship go a-dwindling, but saw
critical chinks develop in its armor.
</P>
<P>
   The Quincy Carter who had delivered as in fables at Baton Rouge
came across as what he is, a freshman quarterback. He showed the
rust that accumulates from two seasons away from football action.
The line in front of him leaked like a rusty bucket. Tennessee put
a rush on him like he'd never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, his counterpart, Taumaurice Nigel Martin, the
junior from Mobile, turned in a performance Peyton Manning would
have been proud of. Tucked the ball and ran for 83 yards, not
deducting sack losses, and completed 16 of 26 passes for 156 yards
and two touchdowns. You might say he has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Champ Bailey, Georgia's flaming sophomore, was lost in the midst
of the turmoil. Out of it, rarely included in Georgia's scheme.
Tony Small was Carter's designated target, and he and the senior
from Jacksonville connected seven times for 144 yards. Bailey did
catch three passes after the fact and once, when Georgia went for
it on a desperation fourth-down flea-flicker late, threw an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting development of the afternoon dealt
with an absentee. Jamal Lewis, Tennessee's bullish running back
from Atlanta, is out for the season, and custom is to mewl over
such losses. In his stead, Travis Stephens and Travis Henry,
sophomore tailbacks, accumulated 160 yards between them, and ran
with malicious intent. Lewis had been averaging 124 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   So often it happens that an understudy steps out of the wings
and steals the show. It's routine in the theater, and while this
isn't Broadway, it's a steal from the old scheme. Lewis will get
his job back, but not until next year. Until then, Tennessee's
running game will be in good hands, or maybe that should be feet.
</P>
<P>
   This time there were no recriminations, no fuming charges of
running up the score, as in Knoxville last year. Matter of fact,
there would have been no grounds for complaint, for Fulmer was
helpless to do anything about it. Georgia's defense bent and broke,
and when the end came, the Vols were running straight ahead until
the final down, when Tee Martin put his knee to the ground and a
merciless end to it all.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech, N.C. State roundup
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ FIRST-HALF ROUNDUP
</P>
<P>
   FIRST QUARTER: Both teams squandered touchdown chances after
getting big plays and settled instead for offsetting field goals.
Phillip Rogers scooted 29 yards along the sideline to set Tech up
to N.C. State's 29, but the Wolfpack shut down the drive and Brad
Chambers booted a 41-yard field goal, his longest of the season.
Torry Holt took a short pass from Jamie Barnette on State's first
offensive play from scrimmage and turned it into a 48-yard gain,
and the Wolfpack drove to the Tech 12 before calling on Dan
Deskevich, who kicked a 29-yard field goal. Both teams would
sputter after that, with Tech bogged down by penalties and State
having trouble on special teams and with turnovers. Tech led 5-3
after 15 minutes when the N.C. State long snapper shot the ball
over the head of punter Jesse Wade and out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND QUARTER: The Jackets took command in a wild string of
events with a 28-point quarter to claim a 33-10 halftime advantage.
Wade mishandled a snap on his own 25 and the kick was blocked by
Travares Tillman, with Tech's Jason Bostic finally recovering in
the end zone. State tried some fancy maneuvering for its first
touchdown when Holt, on a reverse, planted and threw deep to Chris
Coleman, who beat two Tech defenders and jogged into the end zone
to make the score 12-10. But the Jackets shut down State after
that. Joe Hamilton, working from the Wolfpack 31, faked a handoff,
then a reverse, and threw a touchdown strike to Dez White. Charles
Wiley capped a 48-yard TD drive for Tech to blow the game open at
26-10. Then Tech's defense scored a touchdown for the fourth
straight week when Felipe Claybrooks caused Barnette to fumble, and
Bostic picked up the loose ball and rambled 21 yards for the score.

</P>
<P>
   THIRD QUARTER: A scoreless third quarter was punctuated by
Tech's defensive play to stop a possible Wolfpack touchdown. Backup
QB Charles Berry had engineered a nice drive for State down to the
Tech 2 when he was sacked by Jesse Tarplin and fumbled, the ball
recovered by defensive lineman Tony Robinson. Perhaps the biggest
story of the quarter _ not to mention the game _ for the Jackets
defensively was their ability to keep the ball out of Holt's hands.
State's All-America WR candidate did not touch the ball in the
third quarter, and the only time he was an intended receiver, the
pass was knocked away beautifully by Bostic. Holt had just three
receptions, albeit for 93 yards, and returned two punts for 51
yards after 45 minutes in addition to the TD pass, but the Wolfpack
wasn't able to take advantage of his big-play abilities very often.
</P>
<P>
   FOURTH QUARTER: The teams traded TDs in a contest whose outcome
had been decided long before. Hamilton ran in from 5 yards out, and
the Wolfpack put together a 69-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard TD
catch by Coleman from Berry, who played well in relief of Barnette.
Hamilton finished Tech's fourth straight game with 40 points or
more on a 6-yard run with 3:11 to play. Berry responded with a
3-yard jaunt at the 2:14 mark.

 &HT;    Truth hurts for Carter, fellow UGA players
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ This college football thing had been the world's
longest sustained kiss for Quincy Quarterback. It began as an
open-ended honeymoon, an endless cruise into a pink sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the inevitable Saturday when even the most fortunate
one gets hit by a quarter ton or so of reality. The truth literally
does hurt, and it apparently favors orange.
</P>
<P>
   No, Mr. Carter, you can't win them all. Nor are you allowed to
complete your first 15 passes every time against a top-10 opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, against Tennessee Saturday, Quincy Carter actually did
look like the true freshman they keep insisting he is. This day, he
fumbled the day's second snap, was chased like the only ambulance
in Lawyer Town, and threw two interceptions _ one more than he had
suffered in his first four games. Much of Georgia's 22-3 loss to
the Vols looked like blue sky to Carter, so often was he laid flat.
</P>
<P>
   Downright human he was, unlike just a week ago when he put a
microchip-perfect beating on LSU. Perfectly understandable, said
his coach, who used to quarterback a little in his day. ``(The
Vols) were coming with the house. We didn't do a very good job of
protecting our quarterback. I'd be rattled out there, too,'' said
Jim Donnan.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen Carter only in the complimentary backlighting of
victory. How might he change following the first loss of what will
be a spectacular career? Not all that much, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day is Sunday, the following day is Monday and we'll
just go on,'' said Carter, a quick student of the Zen of football.
``Things like this happen. We'll become a better football team than
we were today.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the first defeat was total. There would be no need for
a single moment of what-iffing. The Vols physically dominated
Georgia, which allowed their estimable quarterback, Tee Martin, the
illusion of bettering Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, there was public concern about the fate of
the Sanford Stadium goal posts, should Georgia win a monumental
one. The fear was quite unfounded. No Bulldog would touch the
endzone during or after the game. Carter's 23rd and last
incompletion _ he connected on 14 _ was a rolling, desperate throw
to Champ Bailey in the general direction of paydirt. That's about
as close to six points as Georgia would come all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the two-sport athlete would have reason to
miss the peace and solitude of center field. In the outfield, you
hardly ever find yourself roto-tilled into the turf, unless, of
course, your last name is Klesko. And, when you are as modest a
hitter as Carter, the game requires surprisingly little running,
sliding or human contact.
</P>
<P>
   And no one lent him a helping hand. These Bulldogs cannot run.
The defense was all out of hunker-down by the second half. The
offensive line was overpowered. While Carter was sacked only twice,
he was chased constantly and knocked down remorselessly. The Vols
invited everyone to rush. I think I saw Jamal Lewis chasing Carter
with a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be said for this one is that Carter proved
that he is tough as he is flashy. The hard way. ``We know we've got
a quarterback who will stand in there for us,'' said senior tackle
Matt Stinchcomb, who was moved to apologize to the freshman after
this loss. ''It's pretty hard for any quarterback to play well when
he's getting his head knocked off.''
</P>
<P>
   No honeymoon ends without a little pain.

 &HT;    Lease Plan car survives Petit Le Mans
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They all said the strategy for Saturday's Petit Le
Mans, 1,000 miles or 10 hours of racing, was to stay on the track
until the final three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the racing starts,'' said Dan Doyle of the
Doyle/Risi Lease Plan Ferrari 333SP.
</P>
<P>
   Ten hours later, Doyle, a big bear of a man with an easy grin,
was in the middle of a champagne shower, courtesy of his winning
drivers, Wayne Taylor and Eric van de Poele.
</P>
<P>
   The Lease Plan survived and conquered in front of an estimated
crowd of 40,000, the largest anyone can remember. They might have
witnessed the rebirth of sports car racing in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect race,'' said van de Poele. ``We didn't have
any trouble all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect for the winners, but hardly anybody else. It was a race
filled with breakdowns, glitches and a spectacular crash courtesy
of the big gun, the No. 26 Porsche, winner of the 24 Hours of Le
Mans. Its day ended with a spectacular crash on Turn 8 at 4:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting another car too closely, No. 26 Porsche driver Yannick
Dalmas got into a vacuum, lost the downforce on the front of the
car and when it went over the rise at Turn 8, the front end kept on
rising and the car back-flipped, landing on its rear end, swerving
left and crashing into the retaining wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dalmas, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, was
uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 4 Panoz GT1 and the No. 7 Lease Plan Le Mans Prototype
Ferrari, two laps behind the No. 26 car, found themselves one and
two respectively in a second.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz, which hasn't had any help at all on the home track in two
outings, was in the hunt temporarily but the hex struck in the form
of an oil leak so bad it couldn't be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 5 was lost during Friday practice when it hit an oil
patch and slammed the wall in front of the press tower.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Jim Downing's team, driving a new version of his Kudzu
Mazda, finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy with the way it's running, it could quit now and
I'd be happy,'' Downing said two hours earlier. He was ecstatic
over the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid No. 07 Q9 Panoz GT1 was the only Panoz survivor,
finishing 12th overall and third in the GT1 class.

ETHICS PANEL CLEARS SLATE FOR GINGRICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House ethics committee dismissed on Saturday
the three remaining ethics charges against Speaker Newt Gingrich,
although it found that he repeatedly violated a rule against using
outside consultants to conduct official House business when he was
the Republican minority whip nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The action, announced in the closing days of the 105th Congress,
concluded an investigation that peaked in January 1997 when
Gingrich was reprimanded by the House and fined $300,000. The House
had found that he used tax-exempt money to promote Republican goals
and then gave the committee untrue information for its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ends a chapter,'' Gingrich said Saturday. ``Let's get onto
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of the remaining charges came just days after
Gingrich presided over the House of Representatives as it voted to
open an impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, setting off a
new round of partisan recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's press secretary, Christina Martin, said in a written
statement that after four years of investigations, ``83 of the 84
charges filed by partisan Democrats have been dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to the president's own troubles, Ms.
Martin added, ``It should be noted that during the review process,
Newt Gingrich waived attorney-client privilege, personally
testified, instructed staff to testify, and voluntarily turned over
a million pages of materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The three complaints under review by the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct, as the ethics committee is formally known,
were filed against Gingrich by six Democrats in January 1996, a
year after he became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints concerned accusations that Gingrich, R-Ga., had
violated a House rule that prohibits the use of unofficial
resources for official purposes. The committee also examined
whether Gopac, a Republican political action committee that
Gingrich once ran, had improperly subsidized Gingrich's 1990
congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released Saturday by Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, head
of the ethics committee, and Rep. Howard Berman of California, the
ranking Democrat, the panel found that in 1990 and 1991, Gingrich
``committed repeated violations'' of House rules by using
consultants whose salaries were paid by Gopac in the operation of
the minority whip's office.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the panel noted that Jeffrey Eisenach, while
serving as a paid consultant to Gopac, ``provided a wide array of
services pertaining to the development and implementation of your
legislative agenda and that he did so at your request.''
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Gingrich has received letters of admonition for the
same offense concerning Joe Gaylord, a Gingrich political
strategist, and Donald Jones, a telecommunications entrepreneur who
worked as a volunteer on Gingrich's staff when the House was
drafting major legislation affecting the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee said it had decided to dismiss the complaints
from 1990 and 1991 because the violations ``occurred so long ago''
and because there was ``no evidence'' that such practices persisted
in his office.
</P>
<P>
   On another charge, the committee found no evidence for the
accusation that Gingrich had received income, and therefore should
have reported it for federal tax purposes, from money that Gopac
allocated for travel and consultant fees in a ``Newt Support''
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also accepted a federal court ruling that
dismissed charges by the Federal Election Commission that Gopac had
improperly subsidized Gingrich's 1990 congressional campaign by
paying consultant salaries, directing Gopac's donors to contribute
to his campaign and calling his re-election a Gopac priority.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said that while the election commission complaint
had been filed against the political action committee and not
against Gingrich personally, ``it appears to us that to the extent
that Gopac was exonerated by the court, you are by implication
exonerated as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The quiet dismissal of these last charges against Gingrich
seemed almost a footnote to the partisan turmoil in the House when
Gingrich was reprimanded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had particular animosity toward Gingrich because in
1987 he brought ethics charges against Jim Wright, D-Texas, the
speaker who was prompted to resign from Congress in 1989. But
Republicans saw the case against Gingrich as an assault on the man
who, more than any other, had engineered the Republican takeover of
the House, after nearly half a century in the minority.

Struggle over power, control of NBA could harm both sides
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
No Basketball Allowed. No, that's not what the acronym NBA stands
for, but it could.
</P>
<P>
   After years of explosive growth that has taken it to a global
market, the NBA is in danger of imploding because of the continuing
labor struggle. The lockout has entered its third month, and with
no progress made on a new collective-bargaining agreement between
the players' union and the owners, it could be a while before
players begin bouncing basketballs in meaningful games.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, once the model pro sports league because of its
incredible growth over the past 15 years, has become one big
sandbox as owners and players try to decide how to split up
billions of dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest topic in the labor war remains the Larry Bird
exception, which allows teams to re-sign their own free agents for
any amount regardless of the salary cap. According to the union,
the Bird exception has allowed the players to reap the rewards from
what has become a multibillion-dollar industry. According to the
owners, the Bird exception has become the root of economic ruin for
a league that has an eye on the financial seismometer because half
the teams lost money last season.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the losses, the owners are willing to miss
regular-season games for the first time in NBA history in an effort
to install what they think is a viable economic system. And
players, who made roughly $1 billion in salaries and benefits last
season, say they are willing to skip the season rather than budge
on the Bird exception.
</P>
<P>
   Which means neither side has learned anything from the fiasco
baseball perpetrated on its fans during the 1994 strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I will say is that if you have a business where
it is costing you more to make the product than you're getting for
selling it, you have to suffer the consequences for putting those
two things in balance, and that is where we are,'' said NBA
commissioner David Stern. ``All we can do is beg for the indulgence
of those who follow us and are associated with us and that we are
trying along with the players to come up with a formula that can
make this a long-term success story where our current failures
might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Failures the league says it is trying to address with the newest
proposal, the centerpiece of which is the attempt to phase out the
Bird exception. But one of the biggest problems in this labor
struggle is the prevailing notion among the players that the league
is not in financial trouble, but rather the owners are trying to
test their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to press the players and the union,'' the
Rockets' Brent Price said of the owners. ``It seems that they want
total concession by the players, to get us to give up all our
freedoms. But we're unified.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means nothing, according to Steve Woods, a player agent
and a professor of sports business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear that all the time from the players, that they are
unified,'' said Woods, who represents former Rocket Kevin Willis,
among other NBA players. ``What does that mean? The problem you
find is that the players don't know what it (the labor struggle) is
about. Very few of them have actually read the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this abstract concept like, `Oh, isn't it good that
we're unified.' But they don't understand that it's an interesting
concept, but what are you unified over? You can be unified while
somebody drives you over a cliff, but that doesn't mean that you're
right. It doesn't mean that you're fundamentally right, and that's
the big flaw I see in this whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods thinks that attitude could wind up killing the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This labor dispute is not so much about money, but about power
and control,'' he said. ``Players think they have the economic
leverage to take more power and control. When you look at most of
the other labor disputes (in other sports), they have been about
compensation. But this dispute is more about power. Who should
control the league? Should it be the players or the owners? The
problem is that the players are not acting like equity partners in
the league. Instead, they're acting like disgruntled employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled employees who aren't about to return to the
workplace soon. Even when the labor problems are hammered out and
the lockout is lifted, it is going to be a while before the NBA
plays regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best guess is that we think you need at least four weeks
to do every thing that has to be done,'' said NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik. ``People have been asking me, `Can you
shave a few days here and there?' Maybe that is possible, but I
don't think much. We definitely need some period of time for teams
to put their rosters together. I mean, we have some teams that have
only four or five players under contract right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rockets, who have Hakeem Olajuwon, Price, Rodrick
Rhodes and Roy Rogers, acquired from Toronto in the Willis trade,
under contract. A situation like that could also have a poisonous
effect on the league, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the regular-season starts, you're going to have 12 guys
on the team and half of them won't even know each others' names,''
he said. ``So the quality of the basketball will suffer. The games
are going to be awful this season, regardless of when this is
decided. The reason this will hurt the league is because licensing,
tickets sales, international TV and international licensing all
flow from the quality of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players will get hurt a second way because they will be
losing out on opportunities they won't even see because less money
will be coming into the league because the quality will have
suffered so much. That is why I hold the union responsible, because
the players don't understand that. They don't understand cause and
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appear to be holding out until John Feerick rules on
the arbitration hearing on whether the owners have to pay
guaranteed contracts to 220 players during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Woods warned players not to hold their breath, one reason he is
considering filing a grievance Monday against the union on behalf
of several players who are concerned about the labor impasse and
the union's negotiating tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guaranteed-contracts (arbitration) is a joke,'' Woods
said. ``They (the owners) negotiated it in good faith, and they
negotiated it with the understanding that if payroll goes above a
certain amount (51.8 percent of the basketball-related income),
they were going to need to reopen this agreement. And the players
agreed to it. They signed it. And payroll went above that amount
(close to 57 percent paid out by the owners). That's why there's no
way the arbitrator is going to rule for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the owners to get that clause, they had to compromise on
other issues. So the owners are not unilaterally imposing some
hardship on the players and hurting the players. So for the players
to say, `Hey, we want to play, the owners are doing something bad
to us,' that is not true.''

A FEW STERN WORDS ON TOUGH ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spiffy new NBA Guide and NBA Register arrived in the mail
last week. One wonders whether we'll need them this season.
</P>
<P>
   The league and its locked-out players will meet again Tuesday,
but there isn't a lot of hope on either side for ending their
stalemate. About the best spin anyone could muster after Thursday's
five-hour session was that no one threw any tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern, in an interview Friday, touched on a
few issues surrounding the lockout. One of the ground rules for the
interview, imposed by yours truly, was that there be no mention of
``hard caps'' or ``Bird exceptions'' or ``basketball-related
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Q&AMP;A:
</P>
<P>
   --Is the NBA intent on declaring an impasse in bargaining and
imposing its new, owner-friendly system, thereby daring the players
to report or strike? ``No, not right now,'' Stern said. ``We're
planning to sit this one out as long as it takes and to use the
lockout as the economic weapon that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   --Is there a group of owners, up to 12, who would just as soon
flush the season down the drain? ``Nobody wants to miss the
season,'' Stern said. ``Not one team. Someone has a new rookie or a
new coach or a new building. Hope springs eternal. We talk to all
the owners. They're all briefed. There's no group which doesn't
want to make a deal. Our mandate is to make a deal, but it has to
be the right deal.'' The owners, he said, were united as one, at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   --Stern did say there were ``a half-dozen'' teams that would do
better economically by not playing this year. ``But that doesn't
mean they don't want to operate,'' he said. ``But how much can you
do when you're paying out more than you're taking in?''
</P>
<P>
   --Would the league be able to stomach the worst-case scenario of
the impending arbitration decision from John Feerick, namely that
players with guaranteed contracts get paid during a lockout? ``In a
word, yes,'' he said. ``We have the television revenues (more than
$20 million per team). But stay tuned, because whatever he decides,
it's only one step in the process. We still have to make a deal.''
The NBA has already challenged Feerick's authority to hear the
dispute and would certainly appeal a decision that goes against it.
``We think in the short and long term that we will be successful
(in this case),'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   --On the gag order that prevents teams from talking not only to
players but also to agents (they can talk among themselves,
however): ``This is not about being shrill or hurting the product.
We don't want to do that. One word here, one comment there. You
won't see us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   --On comparisons to baseball, namely, that the owners do not
want to do what baseball owners did 20 years ago and lose economic
control of the game: ``This is all about economics. It's always
going to be a little out of control, and there are other issues.
The owners are prepared to do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   --On missing games: ``The difference here is that it's the
beginning of the season, not the end. There's hope. We're not
trashing our players. We're arguing. Last time it was with the
agents. This time it's with the union. But we feel that the time to
make a change is now, however painful the adjustment is going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the perfect holiday gift for Celtics
chairman  &UR; Paul Gaston &LR; , you might consider a bull's-eye with a
picture of  &UR; Marc Fleisher &LR;  on it. He's the agent who represents
 &UR; Dino Radja  &LR; and has managed to stick it to the Celtics on at least
three occasions in the last several years. There was, of course,
Radja's ridiculous $21 million extension a few years ago, signed
under the threat that he would go to Europe. There was also a nice
$7.5 million ``settlement'' last summer when Radja realized he
wasn't going to cut it in  &UR; Rick Pitino's  &LR; system. But the latest
may be Fleisher's best. The Celtics went to arbitration this summer
to secure the right to use the NBA's set-off clause against Radja's
Greek contract. (The formula for establishing the set-off is
believed to have been developed by the same people who programmed
the Mir spacecraft.) Suffice it to say that the more Radja made in
Greece, the more he would have to pay the Celtics. Even better,
that amount would cut his salary cap number and give Pitino more
money to burn on free agents. Well, when Radja went to Greece, the
conventional wisdom was that he went for somewhere in the
neighborhood of $2 million-plus a year. But when Fleisher showed up
at the arbitration hearing in June, he produced a document
(presumably accompanied by a laugh track) that showed Radja made
only $500,000 in Greece. The Celtics were incredulous, but try as
they could _ and they certainly did try _ they could produce no
evidence before Feerick to refute Fleisher. The matter went to
arbitration again last week, with the sides agreeing on a figure
that is greater than $500,000 but less than $2 million-plus. The
Celtics will get to adjust Radja's $2.5 million cap slot downward,
but the amount may not make a significant difference. Fleisher said
he could not comment on the settlement because of a confidentiality
agreement other than to say, ``Dino is happy and the Celtics are
happy.'' He got it half-right.

   If you're  &UR; Antoine Walker &LR; , &UR;  &LR; you might want to check residential
listings in the Portland area. Word around the league is that the
Celtics have been calling to check on the health of oft-injured
Trail Blazers forward  &UR; Brian Grant &LR; . The obvious bait is Walker,
who is determined to be the next $100 million player while the
Celtics are every bit as determined not to pay him that because
he's still much too raw. Walker for Grant, even up, would not fit
under the previous cap guidelines, but it might under the new ones.
Grant is slated to earn $6 million this season, the second of a
seven-year, $56 million deal. Walker is to receive a shade more
than $2.1 million. The Celtics could absorb the difference, but it
might hurt them in the free agent market. Or they could try to get
Portland to take on one of their many contract undesirables to make
the deal financially even. Portland could do the same with someone
such as  &UR; Walt Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; for instance. The spat between Walker and
Pitino this summer only served to illuminate what both sides have
been trying to hide: They don't get along. As one executive
familiar with the Boston situation said recently, ``Why do you
think Antoine left Kentucky in the first place?'' Grant is not as
good as Walker, but he doesn't bring as much baggage. He's also
about $40 million cheaper and already signed through 2004. But
injuries are a concern; he has played in just 85 games over the
last two years. Walker and  &UR; Rasheed Wallace  &LR; would make the
All-Hothead front line in addition to taking a chunk out of
billionaire owner  &UR; Paul Allen's  &LR; hefty bank account ... One team
not at all surprised to see  &UR; Tim Floyd  &LR; take over in Chicago was
the Indiana Pacers. They were scheduled to play the Bulls in an
exhibition game in Ames, Iowa, this year at Iowa State, formerly
coached by Floyd. Sometimes exhibitions are booked years in
advance, but this one was scheduled last summer. Maybe the Pacers
thought the Bulls were doing a favor for  &UR; Fred Hoiberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; although
he's a free agent. Then again ...

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Derek Lowe &LR; , the Red Sox reliever who should have stayed in the
game against Cleveland eight days ago, has quite a hoop background.
(He's a  &UR; Craig Ehlo  &LR; lookalike, for starters.) The 6-foot-6-inch
Lowe was an all-state hoopster at Edsel Ford High School in
Dearborn, Mich. He played against the likes of  &UR; Chris Webber &LR; ,
 &UR; Voshon Lenard &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jalen Rose  &LR; in high school and actually
thinks basketball was his best sport. ``But I was 170 pounds, way
too skinny,'' he said. ``Those guys just manhandled me pretty good.
Even at that level, you could tell, especially with Webber, that he
was going to be a good one.'' Lowe said he contemplated signing
with Eastern Michigan, but opted instead to sign out of high school
with the Mariners, who had selected him in the eighth round of the
1991 June draft ... Some leftovers from Hall of Fame weekend.  &UR; Alex
Hannum &LR; , &UR;  &LR; inducted as a coach, said he still keeps tabs on today's
game but could do without a lot of the, er, distractions. ``All
that bickering and talking back to the officials, that's something
we just didn't do,'' said Hannum. ``I think they're making a
mistake. And when I watch the games, I can't believe what I'm
seeing. I wish they followed the rule book. I have to go find the
NBA Guide and check on the rules myself.''  &UR; Bill Walton &LR;  offered
this tidbit: ``The game  &UR; today &LR;  is confined by the time clock and
truly horrible referees.'' Speaking of the refs, they're still
getting paid by the league ... A faithful European spy reports that
 &UR; Gary Grant &LR; , &UR; David Vaughn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Anthony Goldwire  &LR; are among
those ex-NBAers playing in Greece. Another is the rotund  &UR; Oliver
Miller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has already had his first fight with his coach during
a game.

WHEN PUSH FINALLY COMES TO SHOVE, IT'S THE BRAVES WHO GO DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga.)  (js)

<P>
   SAN DIEGO - No matter how much he denied it afterward, Greg
Maddux looked very much like someone trying to deliver a message to
Jim Leyritz and the San Diego Padres Saturday when he hit Leyritz
on the left shoulder with a pitch in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how much they refuse to believe it, the Atlanta
Braves, winners of 106 games in the regular season and three
straight in the first round of the playoffs, are on the brink of
calling it a season. That's because the upstart Padres, perhaps
awakened by Maddux's pitch to Leyritz, sent the Braves to their
third straight defeat in the National League Championship Series,
4-1, and moved within one victory of reaching the World Series for
the first time in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the near-beaning was intentional _ Leyritz and Maddux had
very differing opinions on the matter _ it did not bring anywhere
near the desired effect for Atlanta. An inning after Maddux,
arguably the most precise pitcher of his time, nearly hit Leyritz
with a fastball after Leyritz had asked home plate umpire Tom
Hallion to check the ball for an illegal substance, the Padres
erased a one-run deficit and never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   When Trevor Hoffman came on to strike out pinch-hitter Javy
Lopez with two out in the eighth, the suddenly punchless Braves had
not only left the bases loaded for the third time in five innings,
but also had opened the way for the Padres, who responded by
scoring twice in the bottom of the inning, to put Game 3 away, much
to the delight of 62,779 kerchief-waving fans.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, San Diego had done the unthinkable in taking a
commanding three-games-to-zero lead over the heavily favored
Braves. No baseball team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to
win a series; after Hoffman recorded the final out in the ninth,
there were chants of ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!'' ringing in the balmy
Southern California air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't throwing at him,'' Maddux protested, long after the
fact. ``I haven't thrown at anybody in 10 years. The ball just got
away. I don't care what he said. I'm telling you, we tried to come
in and it just got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz was not so sure. ``He did it on purpose,'' the former
Yankee said, point-blank, arguing that Maddux even shook off his
catcher, Eddie Perez, more than once. But even if the ball just did
get away, it could not overshadow the fact that over the last four
days, the underdog Padres have now overcome, in succession, John
Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Maddux _ the core of the most imposing
starting rotation in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And now Tony Gwynn and his Padres have Joey Hamilton set for the
clincher Sunday night, against Denny Neagle of the Braves, and the
Atlanta-killer Kevin Brown is waiting to pitch a potential Game 6 .
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were playing Atlanta going in,'' said Gwynn, who is
the only player remaining from San Diego's only World Series team
in 1984. ``But I wouldn't have ever imagined getting up, 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way the Braves would have ever have imagined they
would be down the same. But nothing has gone the Braves' way in a
series in which they have scored just three runs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves needed any further proof that this year would not
be theirs, it came Saturday when their ace could not stop the
Padres in a game Atlanta had to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left one ball up to Steve Finley,'' said Maddux. ``And it
ended up costing us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres felt that the pitch that hit Leyritz might have been
just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he had a little intention on that ball,'' said
Finley, whose run-scoring double an inning after the Leyritz
incident had erased a 1-0 Atlanta lead. ``It gave us a little extra
incentive, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux delivered the message pitch with two out and nobody on in
the bottom of the fourth, three innings after he had fanned Leyritz
with the bases loaded to end the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``By striking me out in the first inning, I think he did a
pretty good job of sending me a message there,'' Leyritz said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Leyritz came up again, the Braves had a 1-0 lead. It
could have been more. But after Atlanta opened the scoring in the
third on Walt Weiss' first hit of the series, the Padres left
fielder, John Vander Wal, playing because of Greg Vaughn's
quadriceps injury and because Vander Wal has had some success
against Maddux, ended up throwing Weiss out at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Leyritz's turn to hit again, it was still a 1-0
game. It probably did not help that Leyritz, who serves as the
personal catcher for Sterling Hitchcock and was making his first
start this series, asked Hallion to check the ball after Leyritz
said he saw Maddux go to his cap and then to his mouth before the
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   So when Maddux sent a first-pitch fastball in the direction of
Leyritz's head, hitting Leyritz on the left shoulder, it was clear
to Leyritz that Maddux had thrown the pitch with bad intent.
</P>
<P>
   Perez immediately jumped between the two as Leyritz took a step
toward the mound and Maddux moved toward the plate. But if Maddux,
who then struck out Vander Wal to end the inning, had been trying
to serve the Padres notice that the Braves were not intimidated,
his actions seemed to backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, perhaps rejuvenated by a strong fifth from
Hitchcock, scored a pair of runs off Maddux in the bottom of the
inning to take the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock started the rally with one out with a first-pitch,
opposite-field single between short and third. He took second when
Quilvio Veras hit a chopper back to Maddux. And then Finley lashed
a hanging change up to the gap in left center to tie the game at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux wanted no part of the next batter, Gwynn, who had carried
a .455 batting average into the game against the Atlanta
right-hander. So Gwynn was issued an intentional walk to bring up
Game 1 hero Ken Caminiti with runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-0 count, Caminiti grounded a run-scoring single up the
middle, and the Padres had a 2-1 lead they would not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he hit him on purpose, but the way Leyritz
reacted fired me up,'' Caminiti said. ``Leyritz was screaming in
the dugout for at least two or three innings. I don't think Maddux
heard him.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. That turned out to be the message sent to Atlanta.

DEBARTOLO CASE WILL BE PIVOTAL FOR TAGLIABUE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Tagliabue may not realize it yet, but he is facing
the defining moment of his tenure as NFL commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Tagliabue's employers, the 31 NFL owners, look at him
and think, ``Big TV contracts, big franchise fees, big job well
down.'' On those scores they are right, even though Tagliabue also
presided over the league when it lost the second-largest TV market
in the country (Los Angeles) and put teams in the hinterlands of
Jacksonville and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners have made big money under Tagliabue's stewardship and
professional football has never been more popular, so no one can
complain too loudly. Yet today he faces the crisis that could
define him.
</P>
<P>
   Before long Tagliabue will have to decide the future not only of
49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo but also the future of the San
Francisco franchise and the future power of his own office.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear now why Edward DeBartolo Sr. sent Carmen
Policy out to San Francisco 15 years ago to watch over his son's
handling of the team. Policy was the elder DeBartolo's consigliere,
the trusted lieutenant sent west from Youngstown, Ohio, to keep an
eye on the family's business interest there.
</P>
<P>
   It worked well for a while. Super Bowls followed Super Bowls.
Hall of Fame quarterbacks followed Hall of Fame quarterbacks. Great
coaches followed great coaches. But in 1994 the father died,
leaving the son in charge of his mammoth shopping mall development
company and its diversified interests as well as the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the son began to tire of having Policy advise him on
policy. Eventually DeBartolo stopped listening, and last week he
paid the price. DeBartolo avoided prosecution on federal bribery
charges in Louisiana by pleading guilty to ``misprison of a
felony,'' which is another way of saying he knew of an alleged
scheme by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards to extract payoffs in
exchange for a riverboat casino license because he was one of the
guys making the payoffs and didn't tell anyone about it until he
was threatened with a federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Policy had counseled DeBartolo against going into the gambling
business in Louisiana, a state long known for politcal corruption,
but DeBartolo ignored him and is alleged to have hand-delivered a
briefcase stuffed with $400,000 in cash to Edwards. Barely 24 hours
after the money changed hands, according to federal authorities,
DeBartolo got the last riverboat gaming license the state had, and
barely 12 months after that, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge
that could have landed him in prison for three years. He agreed to
pay a $1 million fine and do something else that must have his
father twisting in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to become a rat.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards called him ``the new Linda Tripp'' after the hearing in
Baton Rouge at which DeBartolo pleaded guilty to concealing what
his lawyers now call an extortion attempt rather than a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd victimized him, I would have done it for a lot more
than $400,000,'' crowed Edwards, who at 71 is facing his third
federal indictment in the last two decades on racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo agreed to testify to get out of a deal Policy told him
stunk to the high heavens in the first place, and when it all came
to light last December, DeBartolo was forced to relinquish
day-to-day control of the 49ers to his sister when he was named as
a target in the federal probe. Now Policy has fled to Cleveland to
help run the expansion Browns organization as a minority partner
while DeBartolo faces a fight for control of the team he loves with
his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who nominally heads it at the
moment and some say is of a mind to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Tagliabue. Because of DeBartolo's admissions, the
commissioner is empowered to ban him from day-to-day operation of
the team for as long as he wants. Some NFL insiders allege that
DeBartolo has the kind of gambling debts that undid onetime Eagles
owner Leonard Tose. Whether he does or not, all Tagliabue is saying
for the moment is that the present arrangement _ in which York is
the controlling partner and DeBartolo loyalist Larry Thrailkill
runs the day-to-day operation _ will continue through this season.
</P>
<P>
   But what then? What does Tagliabue do when one of his 31 bosses
has to testify to paying a former governor in an attempt to land a
casino license? If it was extortion, why didn't he call the FBI
before he delivered the cash? Why did he accept the casino license
and not say something even then? Why did it take the threat of a
federal indictment to suddenly see he was being extorted and why
did he reportedly take the Fifth Amendment the first time he was
called in front of the grand jury?
</P>
<P>
   While Tagliabue is mulling over his options, some voters in San
Francisco have tried to revisit the funding of a new stadium at
Candlestick Point. Originally, DeBartolo wanted to include a mall
and shopping complex with it, but his sister and Policy opposed
that because of the exorbitant costs _ at least $500 million _ and
that end of the development is now in question. Thrailkill said
recently the stadium could include cost overruns of at least $150
million, which was close to the original estimate of the
stadium-mall complex, instead of the present $325 million stadium
price tag. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown went apoplectic, and a
press conference was called to allow Thrailkill to back off that
number, which he dutifully did.
</P>
<P>
   But what are skeptical voters to think now? Who's in charge of
the 49ers today? Who will be tomorrow? Many of the team's present
employees, including director of football operations Dwight Clark
and personnel director Vinny Cerrato, are more than a little
worried that if DeBartolo reassumes control, he will wipe them all
out as perceived Policy loyalists and possibly put Packers coach
Mike Holmgren in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave the commissioner's office if he does
nothing more than slap DeBartolo on the wrist? The NFL has a long
history of taking firm stands against player involvement in illegal
gambling. It has a long history of suspending players involved in
drug abuse. It has a long history of fining and suspending players
involved in on-field violence and now has a policy that addresses
off-the-field violence as well.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, how could Tagliabue allow DeBartolo to walk
away untouched.
</P>
<P>
   If he does ban DeBartolo, Tagliabue knows a lawsuit will likely
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if he does little or nothing, the next time he tries
to discipline a player for gambling or some other illegal action,
he'll find another battery of lawyers waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   So what is he to do?
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo will sell out Edwards to save his own hide and then
hope Tagliabue will sell out future commissioners by bending over
backwards to save his hide again. Tagliabue well might do that
because the NFL is a fraternity of rich men who tend to protect
their own, and DeBartolo was a popular member of that fraternity
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if it gets too hot in Louisiana when the questions
about payoffs and kickbacks and casino licenses and gambling debts
come to light, DeBartolo may suffer the greatest indignity of all.
</P>
<P>
   He may force Tagliabue to prove that the law degree he got from
NYU still stands for something.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The sad story of the dissolution of a quarterback continued in
Charlotte last week when young  &UR; Kerry Collins  &LR; walked into the
office of Panthers coach  &UR; Dom Capers  &LR; Wednesday and basically told
him to take this job and shove it. Dogged by doubts and failures in
a town that apparently was a little too small and a little too
quick to question his lifestyle, his ability, his everything,
Collins simply told Capers he couldn't take it anymore, becoming
the first player in sports history to say, ``Bench me or trade
me.'' Carolina tried to do the latter on Thursday but was asking
for a No. 1 draft choice, which simply isn't going to happen. So
Collins was put on the inactive list and stayed home for Sunday's
game in Dallas. The Panthers will likely release him if he can't be
traded by next Tuesday, although they could simply sit him out for
the year. The biggest stumbling block to a trade is that Collins
becomes a free agent at the end of the season ... It seems a good
 &UR; Dick Vermeil  &LR; story surfaces every week. The latest is that after
the Rams lost their home opener to the Saints, the coach got an
angry letter from a season ticket-holder named  &UR; Jeff Roberts &LR; .
Roberts said he'd worked hard to be able to afford his tickets but
was ``disgusted with the way the team played and more or less the
way you coached.'' He enclosed the rest of his tickets. Vermeil was
so bothered by the letter that he had his wife track down Roberts
and invite him and his 6-year-old son to a team meeting the night
before the next home game. After the meeting, Vermeil talked for a
half-hour with Roberts, then reached in his pocket for the tickets
and said, ``I believe these belong to you, if you want them back.''
Roberts took them and says he'll keep coming back as long as the
Rams are in St. Louis ... The recent rise of Atlanta may not be all
it seems. Under coach  &UR; Dan Reeves &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Falcons have gone 9-3
since opening last season 1-7. But none of those victories have
come against a team with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans coach  &UR; Mike Ditka  &LR; may have been more fun to watch
in the old days, but this is what he learned about his
often-explosive and always-televised sideline demeanor: ``When
you're winning, they call it enthusiasm. When you're losing, they
call it anger.'' ... Asked if it was true that fullback  &UR; Ray
Zellers  &LR; disliked blocking, Ditka replied, ``I don't blame him. Ray
thinks he's a tailback. If he couldn't do it, I'd say fine. He has
done it. I've seen him do it in the past. He'll do it again.'' ...
Ditka also talked last week about his decision not to draft Vikings
wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss &LR; , who is tearing up the pea patch (not to
mention NFL secondaries). ``I anguished for many weeks about
picking Randy Moss,'' said Ditka. ``When it came down to it, if I
would have made the final decision to say we'll take him, we would
have taken him no matter what anybody else said here. They would
have let me do that, but I felt at this point, as good as Randy
was, he couldn't have that much effect on our football team because
we don't have the people around yet to get him the ball to do those
things. I thought we were building the foundation with the line
people. Whether I'm right or wrong, that's the way I believed and
that's the way I went. But he's good. I like him. I'm happy for
him. He's in the right place. He could be in a lot of other places
that wouldn't be the right place. They've got a great offense. They
do the right things for him, got people to get him the football.
He's in with two quality, top-notch receivers, which makes it hard
for you to double-team any one of them. I'm happy for his success.
I hope it continues.'' ... With representatives of Houston and Los
Angeles due to address league owners in Kansas City Oct. 27 on
their efforts to make a run for the next expansion team, another
owner is sitting comfortably despite his own stadium problems.  &UR; Bob
Kraft  &LR; has a troubled stadium situation but also the freedom to
pick up and move whenever he wants, because he is a tenant-at-will
at Foxboro Stadium, which he also owns. He already has been
approached by people willing to buy him out and move the Patriots
to Los Angeles, and he could do it himself without the league
intervening or legal entanglements in Massachusetts stopping him.
It would be a bonanza for him. Broncos owner  &UR; Pat Bowlen  &LR; is
believed to have the same thing in the back of his mind if he loses
a Nov. 3 stadium financing vote in Denver, but he has a lease
binding him to Mile High Stadium for 15 more years and certainly
would face lawsuits and injunctions if he tried to uproot the
Broncos ... The NFL may have a salary cap, but it's soft as a
beret. According to NFL Players Association figures, 22 of 30
teams, by virtue of fancy financing, are over the $52.38 million
``cap.'' In some circles this might be called cooking the books,
but in the NFL it's called creative management. The Patriots, for
example, are on the hook for $63.6 million in real money,
sixth-highest in the NFL. But how'd you like to be the hapless 0-4
Panthers or 0-5 Redskins? Carolina is second in the NFL, laying out
$67.7 million. And the Redskins rank just behind New England in
expenditures for a team that can't stop anyone from scoring. Of the
eight that are below the imaginary $52.38 million cap, only Atlanta
and Miami are winning teams. The Dolphins, in fact, are in the best
shape of any team. Their cap number is $47 million and they are
3-1, tied for first in the AFC East. That shows that  &UR; Jimmy Johnson
 &LR; can not only coach but count.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach  &UR; Tom Coughlin  &LR; said he learned a hard lesson
from his team's 42-17 playoff loss to the Broncos last year.
``Denver has taught a lot of people some lessons,'' Coughlin said.
``Our particular style and our commitment to try and develop the
run and stop the run is a result of the embarrassing loss we had to
them.'' Coughlin also said the blitzing pressure so many teams have
begun to put on the quarterback the last two seasons has become an
irreplaceable factor ... Don't be surprised if Minnesota running
back  &UR; Robert Smith  &LR; declines to celebrate after his next touchdown.
Smith lost three teeth after scoring on a 67-yard pass play against
the Bears two weeks ago when he unbuckled his chin strap just as
352-pound teammate  &UR; David Dixon  &LR; rushed over to hug him. Dixon hit
Smith so hard he knocked Smith's facemask back into his mouth and
shattered his teeth.

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The sky didn't fall, and neither did their
10-ton scoreboard. But the Islanders, the Chicken Little franchise
whose threat to boycott their home games due to unsavory conditions
at Nassau Coliseum landed them in state and federal court last
month, fell into immediate arrears on the 1998-99 season Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Forced by a state Supreme Court ruling to play their home games
at their 26-year-old county-owned home base, the Islanders lost
their season opener against the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-3. The game
was not shown on Fox Sports New York, which blamed its decision on
a dearth of advertisers, but it was seen live here by 11,457 fans
whose mood ranged from hostility toward the new Islander ownership
to embarrassment for the players caught in the web of management's
machinations.
</P>
<P>
   As fans entered the arena, they were handed fringed white towels
to wave if and when their players scored. Other than that meager
touch, there were no welcome, or welcome back, mats laid out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there wasn't even the traditional opening-night
introduction ceremony to honor the players: David Seldin, the
president of New York Sports Ventures, which owns the club,
attributed that oversight to Spectacor Management Group, the
company that runs the facility. Seldin also blamed SMG for the
virtually blank scoreboard, which showed the score but no replays.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seldin, the scoreboard, which is due to be
replaced, sprang a mysterious leak and dripped a small but steady
stream of water onto center ice throughout the opening period:
``The lack of cooperation we're receiving from the building is
profound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Islander faithful, the opening period was a doleful
one. Jaromir Jagr ignited a three-goal scoring spree with his
power-play deflection at 4:50, and in the space of four shots
between 4:50 and 6:02, the Penguins staked themselves to a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 3-0 we're scrambling for some sort of life preserver,''
said Mike Milbury, the coach and general manager, who called a
timeout after the third Penguin goal. As for the added
opening-night distraction caused by the club's off-ice
controversies, Milbury said, ``There's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islander defense, operating somewhere between dismay and
deflation, was culpable on all three goals, with Rich Pilon
providing an inadvertent assist to Jagr on the first one, which
scuttled off his skate and behind goalie Tommy Salo. The second
Pittsburgh goal was scored by Robert Lang at 5:42, and Aleksei
Morozov completed the carnage at 6:02.
</P>
<P>
   When Jagr went to the penalty box on a hooking call, there was a
brief flurry of optimism among the fans, but things quickly turned
vituperative when the Islander power play failed to assert itself.
The crowd, sympathetic at the game's start and stunned into silence
by the Penguins' three-goal outburst, began to boo the home team.
</P>
<P>
   With five minutes left in the period, the crowd began to chant
for Zigmund Palffy, the unsigned superstar and league leader in
power-play goals (17) last season: ``We want Ziggy,'' they
demanded. And when Brad Werenka, parked just inside the blue line,
cranked out the slap shot that put Pittsburgh ahead by 4-0 at
18:04, the fans launched into a sarcastic lament for John Spano,
last year's fraudulent purchaser of the perpetually on-the-block
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Spano,'' they jeered. What they got instead, with just
over 8 seconds left on the clock, was a glimmer of hope from Kenny
Jonsson, who powered the puck behind Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso
at 19:51 and trimmed the deficit to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Trevor Linden, the team captain who
finally accepted the Islanders' take-it-or-leave-it offer of $2.5
million just four days before this opener, made up for the missing
Palffy by contributing two power-play goals of his own. Now
perceived as a hero by the Islander fans, who believe Linden
deserved the $4 million, multi-year deal he sought but exhibited
true professionalism by returning in time to lead his dejected
troops into the season, Linden put the Islanders back into
competitive position with a close range tip-in at 5:03.
</P>
<P>
   Linden made it a 4-3 game at 16:58. The towels twirled merrily,
but with no further heroics on tap for the final period, where
Linden missed a hat trick chance in a goal-side scramble with 3:54
remaining, the Islanders settled for a close loss instead of the
rapid rout.
</P>
<P>
   But the patience of the club's fans, many of whom wore Islander
jerseys emblazoned with the names of stars from the club's past, is
dwindling fast. All one had to do was look at the ice, where white
towels were tossed like garbage.

PATRIOTS TURNING UP INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After a misty Thursday morning walk-through
practice, Patriots coach Pete Carroll gathered his team around the
20-yard line at Foxboro Stadium and lit into them. Walk-throughs
are called that because they aren't very intense; the players
simply ``walk through'' some of the plays and formations in
preparation for real practice later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll detected a tone he didn't like. After waving his
arms and speaking in a very animated voice to his players, he
dismissed them and gathered his coaching staff in the same
semi-circle. Again, Carroll was animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to make sure that we understood the importance
of this game and the commitment to the preparation that we needed
to make,'' said fullback Tony Carter, who is quietly emerging as an
offensive leader.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll acknowledged later, ``I just felt I needed to do
something to get them going.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the week began in preparation for Sunday's game
against the Kansas City Chiefs. The practices, according to players
and coaches, were intense and precise the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Players seemed happy when practice was over Friday afternoon and
they could get on with the task of winning a game that means early
bragging rights among the elite in the American Football
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   A win would be a momentum-builder because the Jets and Dolphins,
division rivals both, are the next two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be one of the biggest tests of the year for us,''
said Carter. ``Everybody's mood is the same: We come out and we
want to work hard each week. Sometimes there's going to be more
emphasis on certain things each week as the season builds up. We're
sticking to our game plan. We're not doing anything noticeably
different, just trying to do certain things a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, who has faced the Chiefs more
than any other Patriot (10 times, dating back to his days with the
San Diego Chargers), said, ``We have a chance to define who we are.
We have a couple of games coming up which are going to test our
will to win. We've got some division games coming up, but I think
we need to focus on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember most about Kansas City teams is they come to
play. We have to be clicking on all cylinders. It's one of those
where you have to find a way. It's going to be one of those
drag-down, knockout games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will have to rectify one lingering problem on
defense: getting off the field. They have allowed opponents to
convert 45.3 percent of third-down chances, which is much too high.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches and players all feel they are one or two plays away
from changing all of that dramatically. Carroll even said, ``We're
on the verge of being a defense that will be very hard to deal
with.'' They won last week in New Orleans, 30-27, but they managed
to stop the Saints on only 9 of 18 third downs. Do that against the
Chiefs and the Patriots will embarrass themselves at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are holes in our zone defense that we need to plug up,''
said linebacker Ted Johnson. ``A lot of guys are asked to do things
on third down and we're not all coming through. Sometimes you play
back on your heels and get tentative in that spot. We can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will have to contend with Donnell Bennett, a halfback in
a fullback's body, who has had some consistent if unspectacular
games since gaining 115 yards on 24 carries against Oakland Sept.
6. He had 62 yards in the rain vs. Seattle last week, and gained 87
in each of the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Law and Chris Canty may have their hands full with wide
receivers Andre Rison and Derrick Alexander. Rison is nearly back
to 100 percent after being plagued with an early-season hamstring
injury that forced him to miss two games.
</P>
<P>
   Also returning for the Chiefs is No. 1 quarterback Elvis Grbac,
who missed four games with a separated shoulder. Former Patriot
Rich Gannon went 3-1 in relief of Grbac.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Patriots must eliminate the turnovers that
nearly ruined their stay in New Orleans last week. A 3-point
victory should have been a 21-point win.

CURRY'S SWIPE LAST OF BIG DEFENSIVE PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ What Nebraska was about to throw at the
Texas A&AMP;M defense on third-and-15 with 59 seconds to play, Aggies
cornerback Sedrick Curry didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   He and the rest of the A&AMP;M defense, which had dominated the
Cornhuskers most of the afternoon until two fourth-quarter scoring
drives, knew only two things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to give up anything easy and we didn't want to
give up the deep ball,'' said Curry, who was in the game while
Jason Webster nursed a freshly sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe broke left out of the
shotgun to throw a pass, and Curry's subsequent interception broke
the Huskers' backs and preserved a monumental 28-21 upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Newcombe was scrambling and it seemed like their
receivers were cutting their routes short,'' Curry said. ``I
noticed his arm come up and I made a great break on the ball and
was able to get there before \Rtight end Sheldon Jackson\S did. It
was the biggest play of my career, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Curry kept his head, sliding to the turf with the
ball safely cradled in his arms at the Nebraska 48 after a 9-yard
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was to take it to the house,'' Curry said.
``But then I said to myself, I believe I'd better get down and let
\Rthe offense\S run out the clock. Then it will be time to
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry's interception put a lid on a day of big defensive plays
by the Wrecking Crew. Included was a series of three consecutive
sacks, the last resulting in outside linebacker Warrick Holdman's
end-zone recovery of a Newcombe fumble that was forced by nose
guard Ron Edwards. That put A&AMP;M up, 21-7, at 9:13 of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Nebraska took a 40-yard kickoff return and drove
toward the goal, the Aggies threw back the scoring threat. Webster
tackled Nebraska wide receiver Shevin Wiggins for a 4-yard loss on
fourth-and-two from the Aggies' 10. A&AMP;M then drove 86 yards for a
28-7 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the big series in the game when they had the
good kick return against us and were coming right down the
defense's throat,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``A big, big series
right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of long passes \Rlate\S that were really
irritating. We were in a situation at the end where we shouldn't
have let them get back into it. But overall, the defense was
spectacular.''

 RANGERS GO NORTH, BUT THE DEFENSE GOES SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In his original travel plan, coach John Muckler
wanted his Rangers to stay after the game Saturday and spend an
extra night here in Quebec. Instead of hurrying for a charter
flight home, they could have enjoyed the bonding process that
sometimes occurs at night on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is better that a lack of available hotel rooms kept
them from crying in their beers after losing their second game in
two tries. They might have discussed the video review on a pivotal
play in the Canadiens' 7-1 victory Saturday night in the Molson
Center. Or they might have acknowledged that some of their early
difficulties stem from their inherent flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: They can't score if they can't shoot and they
aren't putting many pucks on opposing goaltenders. In Friday
night's season opener, they managed 20 shots in a 1-0 loss to
Philadelphia at Madison Square Garden. Saturday, they put only 21
shots on Jocelyn Thibault. Only eight of them came in the first two
periods, when the outcome was still in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter played well for two periods, but seemed tired as
the Canadiens, playing their first game, scored five goals in the
final 20 minutes. Adam Graves scored for the Rangers. Saku Koivu,
Vincent Damphousse, Craig Rivet, Benoit Brunet, Scott Thornton,
Igor Ulanov and Brett Clark scored for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens took the lead, 2-1, at 13:32 of the second period,
on the power play, but the goal didn't count until it was confirmed
by video replay. Vincent Damphousse scored it by beating Richter
from low to the left of the net, but the puck bounced out quickly
and play continued for more than a minute. After a whistle, referee
Lance Roberts consulted with the video judges as the scoreboard
screen showed a replay of the puck seemingly going in the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were shorthanded because Aleksei Kovalev, at the end
of a very long shift, was called for obstruction holding. After the
goal, 1 minute 8 seconds was was restored on the clock. The Rangers
were doubly jinxed because play was stopped when Esa Tikkanen was
penalized for holding. Had the Rangers scored during the phantom
time between the Damphousse shot and the next whistle, the goal
would have been negated. However, a penalty in that time period
would not have been washed out. The Rangers argued long and loudly
that the penalty should have been canceled. The Rangers had an
excellent scoring chance in that time period, but Canadiens
goaltender Jocelyn Thibault stopped rookie Manny Malhotra on a
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, the Rangers were suffering from injuries.
Defenseman Alexsander Karpovtsev and right wing Todd Harvey, both
hurt in Friday night's 1-0 loss to Philadelphia in the season
opener at Madison Square Garden, were sidelined. Both were listed
with the status of day to day, Karpovtsev with a bruised knee,
Harvey with a hip flexor. Scott Fraser, another right wing, missed
his second consecutive game with the effects of a concussion
suffered in the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra was making his first National Hockey League appearance
in a regular-season game. The 18-year-old center was chosen by the
Rangers in the first round of the entry draft last June. Malhotra,
who sat out Friday's game, centered a checking line with Adam
Graves on the left and Mike Knuble on the right. On an early shift,
Malhotra knocked Vladimir Malhokov, Montreal's big defenseman, into
the end boards. Malhotra also got the Rangers' first shot of the
game, after almost 8 minutes of play, but Thibault stopped him from
close range. Malhotra also showed precocious poise on
penalty-killing assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The teams each scored goals in the first period, Saku Koivu at
even strength for Montreal, Adam Graves on the power play for New
York. Koivu created the play by rushing up ice and twirling after
crossing the blue line before making a long shot that beat Richter
at 9:50. Graves tied the score with a power-play goal at 11:13,
knocking Knuble's rebound from the side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' first power-play goal of the season after an
0-for-6 debut on Friday night. The goal might have been aided by
the new dimensions of the goal crease. Last season's wide
semi-circle has been shaved by 2 feet on each side. Graves was
parked in an area that might have been part of the crease last
year. Also assisting was Gretzky, who had many scoring
opportunities in the first 20 minutes. He seemed to show less
energy in the second period.

PADRES STUMP BRAVES AGAIN, 4-1, TAKE 3-0 LEAD IN NLCS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Atlanta Braves have caught the same disease that
afflicted the Rangers, and it might cost them another trip to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' offense has been silenced by the San Diego Padres
just as the Rangers' was by the New York Yankees in the American
League Division Series, and the best starting pitching in baseball
can't make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Braves were pushed to the brink of elimination with
a 4-1 loss to the Padres in Game 3 of the National League
Championship Series yesterday. A crowd of 62,779 rocked and shook
Qualcomm Stadium with thunderous delight as the Padres took a 3-0
lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be our time,'' Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn said.
``We're getting good starting pitching, guys are delivering with
the bat and making defensive plays. But from our standpoint, we
have to think they have a chance they can come back and keep on
doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   History says the Braves are finished. No team in major-league
history has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit and won a postseason
series. In fact, 18 of the 21 teams who took a 3-0 lead went on to
sweep the series. The other three finished it off in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could for ask for a better situation,''
Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``But we still have to be
levelheaded about it and remind ourselves it's a best-of-seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock, who has beaten Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux
in the playoffs, held the Braves to three hits in five innings,
then let relievers Donne Wall, Dan Miceli, Randy Myers and Trevor
Hoffman finish it.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who have scored three runs in three games, had eight
hits and drew seven walks but failed to score in two bases-loaded,
one-out situations in the sixth and eighth innings. A third-inning
rally also died when Walt Weiss was thrown out at home by left
fielder John Vander Waal while trying to score from second on
Chipper Jones' single.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our offense and see we scored three runs in three
games and it's hard to believe,'' Braves outfielder Ryan Klesko
said. ``You see it happen to other teams against our pitching, but
it usually doesn't happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitchers aren't doing too badly, but they're getting
pounded when San Diego pitchers grab a bat. Kevin Brown had two
hits Thursday, and Hitchcock yesterday started a two-run rally in
the fifth against Maddux by grounding a one-out single through the
left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody with a bat in their hand is dangerous,'' Maddux said.
``It doesn't matter if it's the pitcher or Tony Gwynn. Give him
credit. He put the bat on the ball and found a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves led 1-0 at the time, but Hitchcock moved to second on
Quilvio Veras' high chopper back to the mound and scored on Steve
Finley's double to left-center. After Gwynn was intentionally
walked, Ken Caminiti put the Padres ahead for good with a single to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, now 3-6 in LCS play, was finished after five. Manager
Bobby Cox went to the bench in the sixth when the Braves loaded the
bases with one out against Hitchcock and Wall. But Wall came back
to strike out pinch hitters Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario unfolded again in the eighth when the Braves
loaded the bases with one out. This time, Myers got Keith Lockhart
on a short pop to left and Hoffman came in to strike out Javier
Lopez. The Padres then scored two in the eighth to put it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't leave the bases loaded without doing some damage,''
Cox said. ``For some reason, we had won 10 in a row (before this
series); we were hot as a dickens, getting line drives everywhere.
Now they've shut it down completely.''
</P>
<P>
   History says the Braves don't have time to get it going again.
The Rangers never did either.

AGGIES LIGHTEN LOAD WITH BIG VICTORY

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ On afternoons such as yesterday, the
scene at Kyle Field is unmatched in college football, or, for that
matter, unmatched in any sports' venue coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   First, this was a rare big-game atmosphere that had come
floating down the Brazos. When combined with the traditional
hocus-pocus that makes football at Aggieland uniquely one of a
kind, well ...
</P>
<P>
   Call it a magical moment, and then hold on tight as massive
concrete upper decks sway like cottonwood trees, moving to the
frenzied rhythm of a maroon army gone bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard, a large upset occurred here yesterday,
witnessed by an overflow crowd that was limited to just more than
60,000 because of stadium construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Aggies outplayed No. 2-ranked Nebraska for more than
three quarters, built a three-touchdown lead, and then had to
survive potential disaster in an eventual 28-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   They've been playing football at A&AMP;M for more than 100 years.
Maybe it was the biggest win ever. Certainly it was the biggest win
in the R.C. Slocum era. For years, Slocum critics have always had a
good point _ couldn't win the big one. Like hadn't beaten a Top 10
team since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If Slocum had really been prepared, he would have walked into
the postgame media conference with an elephant on a leash. ``I just
removed this thing from my back,'' he could have announced.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a jubilant Slocum did a verbal ramble, before finally
admitting this was a victory that ``takes away some of the things
we keep getting hammered with.'' Later, Slocum added, ``I guess now
it can be said we won a lot of games, and also won one big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up, R.C. Your load just did.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to A&AMP;M senior tight end Dan Campbell to correctly give
the score, and he wasn't necessarily talking about 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of win dearly needed around here,'' Campbell
said. ``All we've ever heard is A&AMP;M can't win the big game and
coach Slocum can't coach the big game. That constant negative
reminder was always there. Now it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, for one blue-skies-up-above afternoon in Maroonland, there
was no more reminder. It had been flushed by the performance of the
18th-ranked Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing part was how A&AMP;M dominated most of the 60 minutes.
They hit Nebraska, coming in with a 19-game winning streak, where
the Cornhuskers had no answer _ a strong defense that stopped the
option, and a running game that blistered the heart of the famed
``Blackshirts'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rest stop against a Nebraska, however. Out of
options, so to speak, the Huskers went upstairs with quarterback
Bobby Newcombe, and caused late panic among the Kyle Field
faithful. It took a midfield interception by nickel-back Sedrick
Curry with 59 seconds left to assure the Aggies of victory.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had come into the game labeled an offensive wasteland, and
rightfully so, based on the season's first five games. For those
suffering such an offensive disease, the Nebraska defense is not
the unit that normally provides a cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   But here came the Aggies, stunning the Huskers with two big-play
strikes in the first half. Quarterback Randy McCown evaded a rush,
tiptoed to the line of scrimmage and then fired a strike to
receiver Chris Taylor, whose pattern had taken him east-west. Once,
however, Taylor made the grab at the A&AMP;M 42, he headed due north
for the end zone. The 81-yard TD play, longest by air of the season
for the Aggies, made it 7-0 on A&AMP;M's second possession.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a 7-7 tie in the second quarter, freshman fullback
Ja'Mar Toombs suddenly bolted 71 yards up the middle, carrying to
the Nebraska 1. That set up a TD, and set up Toombs as the Aggies'
most pleasant surprise of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In need of removing this big load of criticism about big-game
failures, the Aggies turned to a big load. Toombs checks in at 260
pounds. He made good use of bulk, rolling up 110 yards on 10
carries, to bookend the 124 yards on 32 carries by workhorse
tailback Dante Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs, who had carried only nine times all season, also blasted
in from the 3-yard line on third-and-goal on the first play of the
fourth quarter. A&AMP;M not having to settle for a field goal, instead
taking a 28-7 lead, would be critical later, as Nebraska tried to
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, A&AMP;M won without tricks or smoke and mirrors. The
Aggies played their game and then took the Huskers out of their
game.
</P>
<P>
   And to the victors ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, according to Slocum, there has been this one particular
critic bombarding him lately with nasty mail. ``I hope,'' said
R.C., ``that he has to eat himself a bucket-load of crow on Monday
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guy will certainly have plenty of company among the
multitude who thought A&AMP;M had no prayer yesterday.

TEXAS A&AMP;M ROCKS NO. 2 NEBRASKA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jimmy Burch 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Surrounded by a sea of maroon-clad
towel wavers, Texas A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell wept openly as he
watched coach R.C. Slocum ride triumphantly toward the dressing
room on the shoulders of two offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell hugged Donna Watson as he soaked in the significance of
yesterday's 28-21 upset of No. 2 Nebraska, marking the
highest-ranked team A&AMP;M has defeated in the 104-year history of the
school's football program.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, mother of a former A&AMP;M assistant coach who died in a
Sept. 26 car accident, said she wished her late son, Jim, could
have seen yesterday's defining moment of the Slocum era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her he did see this one, only from a better place. And
I knew he was smiling,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles were the order of the day in Kyle Field, where the
18th-ranked Aggies (5-1, 2-0) rocked Nebraska (5-1, 1-1) with a
flurry of big plays and ended the Cornhuskers' 19-game winning
streak, the nation's longest. It marked A&AMP;M's first victory over a
Top 10 opponent in 11 meetings, dating to a 17-13 upset of No. 8
Houston in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you get tired of hearing how we can't get over
the hump and win a big game,'' said tailback Dante Hall, who rushed
for a game-high 113 yards and a touchdown. ``I'm so glad to finally
get a positive after so many negatives. The monkey is finally off
our back, but we've got to keep it off. We can't let it climb back
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M sent the monkey packing with five game-turning plays, all of
them integral to building a 28-7 lead and then holding off a
spirited Nebraska comeback in the final 14:57. The first came when
quarterback Randy McCown connected with reserve receiver Chris
Taylor on an 81-yard touchdown strike. The reception, Taylor's
first of the season, converted a third-and-25 and gave the Aggies a
7-0 lead they would never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal Play No. 2 in the Aggies' five-step program came in the
second quarter when freshman fullback Ja'Mar Toombs (10 carries,
110 yards, one TD) broke a blast off left guard for 71 yards to the
Huskers' 1-yard line. Hall scored on the next snap, sending the
Aggies to the locker room with a 14-7 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense flows so hard, they flow themselves right into
plays and right out of plays,'' Hall said, explaining how the
Aggies managed their longest pass (81 yards), longest run (71
yards) and longest quarterback scramble (33 yards) of the season
against the Nebraska defense. ``When they overpursue, you've got to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown caught the Cornhuskers flowing the wrong way in the third
quarter, ducking the pass rush and scrambling 33 yards to the
Cornhuskers' 7-yard line. Three plays later, Toombs burrowed in
from 3 yards out to give the Aggies a 28-7 advantage and cap an
86-yard march.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of a third-quarter defensive touchdown, when
A&AMP;M's Warrick Holdman recovered a fumble in the Nebraska end zone
after a sack by teammate Ron Edwards, the Aggies seemed destined to
deliver a lopsided knockout punch. But the Cornhuskers rallied
behind quarterback Bobby Newcombe, who threw for 145 of his
career-high 204 passing yards in the final quarter, setting up two
touchdowns in a four-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nebraska took possession for the final time, with
2:00 remaining, A&AMP;M's lead had withered to 28-21 and the Aggies
were in dire need of a defensive stop. They got it with 51 seconds
remaining when cornerback Sedrick Curry hugged a Newcombe pass to
his chest before sliding to the turf at the Nebraska 48.
</P>
<P>
   The game-clinching interception marked the fifth and final big
play that swung the game in the Aggies' direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't so much dominant as we were opportunistic,'' said
A&AMP;M offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe, whose team picked up
185 of its 352 yards on three pivotal snaps. ``We made some big
plays and got the crowd into it. That really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska players concurred after struggling to hear signals in
front of a standing-room only crowd of 60,798 that A&AMP;M safety Rich
Coady described as ``so loud, we had trouble hearing ourselves
think.''
</P>
<P>
   As he headed off the field following his postgame hug with
Watson, Campbell was stopped by Nebraska defensive end Chad Kelsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Y'all are for real at home,''' said Campbell, a
Glen Rose native. ``That was very uplifting. It's the first time
I've felt like we've got some respect from a team like this. We
didn't get lucky. We beat those guys and they acknowledged it. That
meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant enough to bring tears of joy to lots of maroon-clad
folks in Kyle Field.

ARIZONA LOSES KING OF ITS BALD EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was known simply as JD _ and he was the king of bald eagles
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he was the longest-lived male bird of his kind in the
state. He fathered more eaglets than any other Arizona eagle. And
he amazed scientists with his calm regard as they banded his brood
for research.
</P>
<P>
   Now wildlife officials are mourning his death. This unique eagle
died recently, either because of natural causes or from wounds
inflicted by another bird, possibly an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   JD lived nearly twice the average lifespan of desert-nesting
bald eagles in the wild. His twin sister, known simply as the Alamo
Lake female, now reigns as Arizona's longest-lived bald eagle in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
   JD, who lived most of the past two decades near Saguaro Lake,
raised 30 eaglets to fledgling age, helping boost the population of
the national symbol in Arizona from 20 in 1979 to 72 today.
</P>
<P>
   This more than tripling of the population helped enable
biologists in 1995 to upgrade the bald eagles' chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   But JD also experienced the encroachment of people into the
eagles' most successful feeding territories, along the Salt, Verde
and Agua Fria rivers closest to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat eagles have in Arizona is the increasing
human population right in their back yard,'' said Greg Beatty, bald
eagle management coordinator for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department.
</P>
<P>
   JD, for example, moved his nest several years ago from near the
Salt River to a more distant location, probably because of the
increasing number of tubers, boaters and other recreation
enthusiasts, Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, bald eagle nest sites are threatened by proposed
resort developments along the north end of Lake Pleasant and along
the Verde River near the community of Rio Verde, Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of eagle numbers in Arizona is attributed, in part, to
round-the-clock guards posted near many of the state's bald eagle
nests. These ``nest watchers,'' mostly college students, camp for
up to six months in remote areas to prevent eagles from being shot
or harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it's amazing that the young ever hatched,'' said
Bob Witzeman of the Maricopa Audubon Society, which helped fund
some of the first nest-watch positions. The program now is funded
by the Arizona Lottery, federal agencies, tribes and donations from
firms such as the Salt River Project.
</P>
<P>
   JD was found flopping around near a Saguaro Lake cove by a hiker
on Sept. 12. By the time Mark Weise, Game and Fish wildlife
manager, arrived, JD was dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was along the Verde River, north of the Beeline Highway, that
JD hatched in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have expected how many biologists' lives he would
touch or how many boaters and other recreationists would crane
their necks upwards to see him fly overhead,'' Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bald eagles born in Arizona, JD probably migrated
during his first few years to the northern Rockies. Young Arizona
eagles have been traced as far as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But, usually after four to six years, they come home to breed.
</P>
<P>
   JD was a good daddy from the start, taking over the incubation
duties at the nest of another eagle that died near Saguaro Lake.
After that, he paired with several female eagles, raising 30
eaglets to the point where they could fly and survive on their own.
Five of them now have nests of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, bald eagles were reclassified under the federal
Endangered Species Act from ``endangered,'' meaning on the verge of
extinction, to ``threatened,'' meaning their numbers are still low,
but not critically so.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty said researchers learned more from JD than from any other
bald eagle in Arizona, tracing his habits year-round.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers annually invaded JD's nest to band and identify
his young, JD would simply move to a nearby perch, while other
eagles screeched with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a cool cucumber. He was wise. He was hip,'' Beatty
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next-oldest male, which nests along Tonto Creek, north of
Roosevelt Lake, is 15. &QL;

KINGS DEFENSEMAN WILL PLAY IN FINLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Unsigned defenseman Aki Berg played Saturday
in Finland, meaning he is officially out of the Los Angeles Kings'
picture for this season.
</P>
<P>
   League rules stipulate that because he played in the game after
the start of the NHL's regular season, the 21-year-old Berg would
have to clear waivers to rejoin the Kings if the two sides were
agree to contract terms. It is nearly certain Berg, chosen third in
the 1995 draft, would be claimed by another NHL team if the Kings
waived him, which they would not risk doing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are believed to have offered Berg a one-year contract
worth $625,000 and a three-year deal worth an average of $700,000 a
season. Berg's agent, Larry Kelly, said his client would not sign
for less than the $825,000 he earned last season in base salary and
a portion of the $1 million bonus he received when he first signed
with the Kings in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's there for the year,'' Kelly said. ``Probably two years,
at least. I don't understand the (Kings') approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Berg's decision to play in his native country, Kelly said,
``Rather than be typecast as a stay-at-home defenseman (with the
Kings), he's going to play for his club team (TPS, in the Finnish
league) and his national team and develop into the player he feels
he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fiset's sorrow: Kings goalie Stephane Fiset had more on his
mind this week than hockey. He was hit hard by the news of Stephane
Morin's death during a game Tuesday in Germany. Morin, 29, who
apparently died of a heart attack, was a former NHL and Ice Dogs
player and Fiset's roommate when the two were in the Quebec
Nordiques' organization in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned of Morin's death, the 28-year-old Fiset said,
``I was depressed. You don't know what to do. When that happens,
you don't know what to say. He was playing hockey all his life. You
don't expect that. You have to live your life every day. When I
heard about that, I grabbed my daughter (Karolane, 5) and kissed
her. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset said he and his French-Canadian teammates, all of whom
knew Morin, are planning to assist in the formation of a foundation
for Morin's 2-year-old son, Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Kings general manager Dave Taylor said he is
waiting to finalize a contract extension for coach Larry Robinson,
whose current deal expires after the season.... Former Colorado
coach Marc Crawford worked the Kings game for Hockey Night in
Canada. Ex-Kings goalie Kelly Hrudey, who retired after playing in
San Jose, was scheduled to work the game but instead was in Calgary
with his 6-year-old daughter, who is ill.... Even though the Kings
finished seven points ahead of Edmonton in last year's standings,
the Oilers dominated the season series 4-1, outscoring the Kings
14-8, and shutting them out in the last two meetings.... Before
Saturday, the Kings were 12-11-8 in season openers, the Oilers
10-7-2.

2 MILLION MILES TO PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a gravely ill father from Casa Grande was
able to take his children to Disneyland, for free, because of Jim
Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, an ailing woman from Phoenix took the trip
to San Francisco she'd always dreamed about, for free, because of
Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A Mesa family, the mother very sick, traveled to a family
gathering in Michigan, for free, because of Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A Tucson grandmother got to see her grandson; a Phoenix woman
visited relatives in Washington, D.C.; a Scottsdale mother watched
her son play baseball in California.
</P>
<P>
   All for free.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Jim Adameak, a 39-year-old working guy whose
actual vocation, it turned out, was working miracles.
</P>
<P>
   A representative from the Dream Foundation in Santa Barbara,
Calif., put me in touch with Adameak last February. Jim and his
family had only been in Phoenix for about a year. They'd moved from
Michigan after Jim got a job driving a truck. Within a few months,
he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a better chance of winning the lottery than of getting
this,'' he told me. ``The doctors tell me it was bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``Maybe, but a guy like me, with a family
like mine, I figure I've had a lot more good luck than bad.'' &QL; 
DREAM OF 1 LAST TRIP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Foundation helps terminally ill adults with vacations
they can no longer afford. Years earlier, the Adameaks had been to
Hawaii. Their youngest child had been conceived there.
</P>
<P>
   Jim thought of the islands as paradise. He wanted to go back one
last time with his wife, Kathy, his daughter, Sammi Jo, and his
son, Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Foundation (805-564-2131) makes such trips possible by
collecting donated frequent-flier miles for United Airlines. A
family of four needs an average of about 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   After Jim's story appeared in ``The Arizona Republic,'' people
touched by his story quickly donated the miles he needed. And kept
donating, and donating.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, more than 2 million frequent-flier miles had been
contributed. And, because the donated miles don't expire, other
families still are being helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' the foundation's Steven Sharpe told me
Friday. ``Because of Jim, we've been able to help about 20 families
fulfill their dreams. Imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   People offered hotel accommodations, condos, meals, tours,
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed by the generosity of the people out
there,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   A terminally ill Mesa woman was able to take her family to the
beach near Carmel, for free, because of Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Apache Junction was reunited with her son and
daughter, for free, because of Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A Chandler mother and her family went to San Diego's Sea World,
for free, because of Jim Adameak. &QL; 
`I FEEL VERY LUCKY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, the Adameaks went to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful time,'' Kathy Adameak told me Friday. ``It
was difficult, but we loved it. And it's even better knowing other
people were helped. Jim would love to know that. He does know it, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Jim died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky to have been around such a great guy for as
long as we had together,'' Kathy said. ``We got to say everything
we needed to say. To take care of the important things. It wasn't
enough, of course, but I still feel lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim asked that his body be cremated and his remains be scattered
in Hawaii. Not because it's paradise, though. He knows the real
thing by now.
</P>
<P>
   He knew all along.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I spoke with Adameak, I asked about his illness
and his attitude, about Hawaii, about paradise. There was a TV
blaring in the background, a dog barking and a little boy saying,
``Dad. Dad. Dad'' while we tried to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Adameak laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise,'' he said, ``is everyday life.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``I had a better chance of winning the lottery than of getting
this,'' he told me. ``The doctors tell me it was bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``Maybe, but a guy like me, with a family
like mine, I figure I've had a lot more good luck than bad.'' &QL; 
DREAM OF 1 LAST TRIP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Foundation helps terminally ill adults with vacations
they can no longer afford. Years earlier, the Adameaks had been to
Hawaii. Their youngest child had been conceived there.
</P>
<P>
   Jim thought of the islands as paradise. He wanted to go back one
last time with his wife, Kathy, his daughter, Sammi Jo, and his
son, Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Foundation (805-564-2131) makes such trips possible by
collecting donated frequent-flier miles for United Airlines. A
family of four needs an average of about 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   After Jim's story appeared in ``The Arizona Republic,'' people
touched by his story quickly donated the miles he needed. And kept
donating, and donating.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, more than 2 million frequent-flier miles had been
contributed. And, because the donated miles don't expire, other
families still are being helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' the foundation's Steven Sharpe told me
Friday. ``Because of Jim, we've been able to help about 20 families
fulfill their dreams. Imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   People offered hotel accommodations, condos, meals, tours,
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed by the generosity of the people out
there,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   A terminally ill Mesa woman was able to take her family to the
beach near Carmel, for free, because of Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Apache Junction was reunited with her son and
daughter, for free, because of Jim Adameak.
</P>
<P>
   A Chandler mother and her family went to San Diego's Sea World,
for free, because of Jim Adameak. &QL; 
`I FEEL VERY LUCKY' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, the Adameaks went to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful time,'' Kathy Adameak told me Friday. ``It
was difficult, but we loved it. And it's even better knowing other
people were helped. Jim would love to know that. He does know it, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Jim died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky to have been around such a great guy for as
long as we had together,'' Kathy said. ``We got to say everything
we needed to say. To take care of the important things. It wasn't
enough, of course, but I still feel lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim asked that his body be cremated and his remains be scattered
in Hawaii. Not because it's paradise, though. He knows the real
thing by now.
</P>
<P>
   He knew all along.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I spoke with Adameak, I asked about his illness
and his attitude, about Hawaii, about paradise. There was a TV
blaring in the background, a dog barking and a little boy saying,
``Dad. Dad. Dad'' while we tried to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Adameak laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise,'' he said, ``is everyday life.'' &QL;

DODGERS PRIMED FOR ALOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why would the Fox Dodgers want to steal a benevolent father
figure like Felipe Alou away from the lowly Montreal Expos when
they could have a mercenary like Davey Johnson, who wins everywhere
he goes?
</P>
<P>
   Because despite their lofty payroll and unlimited resources, the
Dodgers are the neediest team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the four teams involved in the league championship
series and there is a strength of character the Dodgers have lacked
not just this season but this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Alou changes all that in a hurry _ on the field and in the front
office. He's well-respected as an excellent tactician, but that
isn't why they want him. Like the Giants' Dusty Baker, he makes his
players feel intensely part of something.
</P>
<P>
   With Alou, it's unlikely you will hear Eric Karros ripping bench
players the way he did this past year after one brutal loss. Or
Bobby Bonilla asking out loud, at a critical point in the season,
when the Dodgers will let him shut it down so he can start
rehabbing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   For the organization, Alou represents more than they know. In a
city as ethnically diverse as Los Angeles, a native of the
Dominican Republic would run the most popular team in town.
</P>
<P>
   If you want catchy sound bites, Alou is not your man. His
English isn't great, but his presence speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met a manager who cared so deeply about his players,''
said shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, who played four years for Alou in
Montreal. ``And if that means giving a kick in the butt, then he'll
do it. I can't think of anybody who would be better to manage this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a team that fired Al Campanis almost 12 years ago because
of racially insensitive remarks but one that has done little to
disprove that baseball is still far short in minority
representation.
</P>
<P>
   When Reggie Smith was fired June 24 as hitting instructor, the
Dodgers had a bigger problem. They were left without any minorities
on their coaching staff. Manny Mota hits fungoes and helps young
Latin players adjust but is not technically a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Dodgers had just !ital!one!off! African-American
coach or manager in their entire minor-league system _ John Shelby.
Shelby, considered an outstanding minor-league manager, was named
bullpen coach even though he never warmed up a pitcher in his life.
He still hasn't, finishing the year as a second bench coach to
Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of minorities in baseball is an easy problem to spot, a
difficult one to solve. Major-league coaching staffs are developed
years earlier during playing careers when bonds grow strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone was a minor-league
infielder who studied the game much better than he played it. He
talked to teammates, developed friendships over beers and bus
rides. He went into scouting, met Bill Geivett and Ed Creech in
Montreal and formed relationships that one day would put all three
men in positions of power on the new Dodgers frontier.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story that has been written throughout baseball history.
And like high school lunch tables and corporate cafeterias, the
relationships rarely cross racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   So when someone is given his chance to run a team, he calls on
the people he likes and respects to help. Respect is a big word
here because success doesn't translate from who you chased women
with in Peoria. Who came to the ballpark to work five hours before
game time often does.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Malone got to see the magic in Alou when the two
worked in Montreal. He is ready for prime time, but not as much as
prime time is ready for him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ninth inning only: Bullpens usually decide championships and
this postseason is no different. The playoffs also have exposed
just how fragile relief pitchers can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox loss to Cleveland last weekend did not come down to
using Pete Schourek instead of Pedro Martinez in the deciding Game
4. It came down to using Tom Gordon for two innings for the first
time this year, obviously a role to which he was not accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who entered the game with 43 consecutive saves, lost the
game 2-1. The Red Sox went home without a World Series title for
the 80th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston manager Jimy Williams was vilified for not going with
Martinez. But the bigger blunder might have been using Gordon,
especially since Williams had seen closers melt in this role
before. In 1996, Williams was Bobby Cox's third-base coach during
Game 4 of the World Series between Atlanta and the New York
Yankees. The Braves were six outs from taking a 3-1 lead in the
series with the next game in Atlanta when Cox went with closer Mark
Wohlers in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Wohler had been asked to pitch the eighth
all season and he allowed a game-winning home run to Jim Leyritz.
The fact that Wohler, one of the hardest throwers in the game,
threw a changeup to Leyritz is another issue. All that is
remembered is the Yankees tied the series and won it three days
later in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even Trevor Hoffman, the Padres' master closer, looked shaky
when he entered Game 1 of the National League Championship Series
in the eighth inning on Tuesday. Although San Diego eventually won
in extra innings, Hoffman blew the save for just the second time in
55 attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Home for the playoffs:!off! For the first time since
1992, Fred McGriff is not participating in the postseason. It was
McGriff's hot bat that Atlanta acquired to overtake San Francisco
in 1993, but now he is with expansion Tampa Bay and this season was
not fun.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff finished strong to push his final average to .284, and
his 19 homers and 81 RBI are respectable for a first-year team. But
he had just 79 walks with no one around him. Not exactly Raul
Mondesi numbers but a stat former teammate Gary Sheffield says is
very telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's wrong wrong because they pitched to him,'' said
Sheffield, who played with McGriff in San Diego. Walks say a lot
about whether teams are pitching to you. He taught me everything
about patience at the plate. On a team like that you aren't going
to pitch to the team's best hitter unless he isn't hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who turns 35 at the end of the month, once had seven
consecutive 30-plus home run seasons, but he hasn't done it in the
past four years. Paul Sorrento, another veteran, batted just .225
with 57 RBI. Dave Martinez, before his season-ending leg injury,
was about 40 points below his average of the past three seasons.
Shortstop Kevin Stocker batted .208 before a broken hand ended his
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the veteran players don't perform better in 1999, then
somewhere along the line I have to say we might have chosen several
other veteran players. That maybe I made a mistake in the veteran
players I brought aboard,'' LaMar said. ``But there is no way I'm
going to admit a mistake at this point because I believe in these
guys too much. If I stick with them a year too long, the fans and
the media will let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   One veteran who pleased LaMar was third baseman Wade Boggs, who
batted .288, his lowest average since 1992 but only his third
season under .300 in 17 years. Boggs has 2,992 career hits and
LaMar said he will be back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade Boggs has conducted himself as well as any player I've
been around,'' LaMar said.
</P>
<P>
   __ News and Notes: The Braves' sluggish offense against San
Diego actually began in the three-game divisional series against
the Chicago Cubs. In their first five postseason games, the Braves'
3-4-5 hitters were awful. Chipper Jones was 3 for 18 with one RBI.
Andres Galarraga was 3 for 20 with no RBI and seven strikeouts. He
hasn't had a home run since Sept. 7. Ryan Klesko was 3 for 16 with
no RBI.... San Diego's free-agent right-hander Kevin Brown is 6-0
with a 1.85 ERA in his last eight starts against the Braves,
including three times in the last two NLCS. The Dodgers have beaten
Atlanta just twice since July 1997. ``The guy must really want to
be a Dodger because he has been incredible every time I watch him
pitch,'' said Dodgers GM Kevin Malone, who has said he probably
will pass this winter on Brown's $12 million-per-year asking
price. &QL;

HERNANDEZ CALMLY PULLS THE YANKEES OUT OF A HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.)  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Yankees spent recent years carefully piecing
together the juggernaut that won 114 games this summer, but the
player responsible for winning their most important game to date
washed up on a sliver of island aboard a leaky boat last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, the defector from Cuba, shut out the
Cleveland Indians into the eighth inning Saturday night as the
Yankees won, 4-0, and fought back to even the four-of-seven-game
American League Championship Series with Cleveland at two games
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill hammered a first-inning home run off the Indians'
starter, Dwight Gooden, and set up the other rally for the Yankees,
whose collective slump continued. They scored their four runs on
just four hits, lowering their batting average for the series to
.194. But they nonetheless brightened the mood of their principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, who gave understated pep talks to
several players in the clubhouse before Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are back in control of this series: David Wells,
their ace, will pitch in Game 5 on Sunday afternoon, against the
Indians' Chad Ogea, and then both teams will return to New York for
at least one more game, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando and Livan Hernandez are half brothers, with the same
father and different mothers, but they both got the big-game gene.
Livan, a pitcher with the Florida Marlins, was the World Series'
most valuable player last year, winning two games against the
Indians. Orlando took the ball Saturday night in the most important
game of the Yankees' season: one loss would leave them on the brink
of playoff defeat and probable off-season chaos, as the front
office tried to figure out why a team that played almost perfectly
in the regular season had been beaten by Cleveland once again.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez carried himself this weekend as if there was no
possibility he would lose. Relaxed and smiling perpetually when
speaking with reporters on Friday (he begins all his responses with
the word bueno _ good) Hernandez repeatedly referred to his escape
from Cuba as he put his Game 4 start in perspective: after what he
had survived, a journey on a leaking boat with little food or water
in a sea known to be a favored shark hangout, why would a baseball
game bother him? No big deal. Bueno, no problema.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez marched to the mound for the first inning, then stood
at the rubber and paced off five small steps to locate his landing
area for his front leg. He was ready to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had one great moment of anxiousness, in the first
inning, when the heart of every Yankees' player and fan raced. Omar
Vizquel singled and stole second, and with two out, Manny Ramirez
coaxed a walk from Hernandez, who initially was having trouble
controlling his sidearm slider. Jim Thome was next, 24 hours
removed from his two-homer performance in Game 3, in a situation
that Yankees manager Joe Torre feared. If Hernandez was going to
run into trouble, Torre thought, it would be in the first few
innings, when he was trying to find his command after not pitching
for 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez fell behind Thome, three balls and one strike. The
slugger then swung viciously through a fastball without making
contact, for a full count. Hernandez threw a change-up, but the
pitch drifted into Thome's danger zone. Thome smacked it with an
uppercut, launching the ball toward the right field seats on a
parabolic trajectory, like so many home runs. The 44,981 patrons
stood to follow the flight, roaring.
</P>
<P>
   But Thome had made contact near the end of his bat, and O'Neill
moved back to the warning track and caught the ball just in front
of the wall, the Yankees' slim 1-0 margin intact.
</P>
<P>
   With their offense sputtering, the Yankees had needed a quick
lift from somebody, some early inning propulsion to take pressure
off everybody. Thirteen pitches into the game, O'Neill waited on a
low curveball from Gooden and golfed it into the right field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense did not exactly break out after O'Neill's
home run; they would collect just four hits all night, and have
just 26 in the first four games of the series. But O'Neill's homer
did seem to apply pressure to Gooden, who pitched tentatively
thereafter and set up the Yankees' fourth-inning rally himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden walked O'Neill on six pitches to lead off, then walked
Bernie Williams as Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove changed his
posture uncomfortably in the dugout. Chili Davis then leaned on a
curveball and punched it into the left field corner for what turned
out to be a ground-rule double; O'Neill scored the Yankees' second
run.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez then lifted a high fly to center, of medium depth,
and Williams retreated to third to tag up. But Kenny Lofton,
Cleveland's center fielder, fumbled the ball as he removed it from
his glove, and the second base umpire, Jim McKean, ruled no catch.
Williams trotted home, uncontested, the Yankees' lead increasing to
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   As Torre had predicted, Hernandez's command improved as the
night went along. In a loss to Cleveland in July, Hernandez had
stubbornly refused to pitch inside to left-handed hitters, but
Saturday evening he jammed them repeatedly, knocking them back off
the plate before finishing them by flopping change-ups low and
away.
</P>
<P>
   A single and a hit batsmen in the sixth gave Cleveland two on
and one out, with Manny Ramirez and Thome due to bat. But Hernandez
blew a fastball past Ramirez for strike three when Ramirez clearly
was anticipating a breaking ball. Then, with a full count on Thome,
Hernandez flipped a changeup and Thome swung over the top, ending
the inning. Hernandez left the game in the eighth, having allowed
just three hits and two walks, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's performance gives Torre some options to ponder if
this series extends to seven games. Andy Pettitte, who gave up four
home runs in four and two-thirds innings in Game 3, is scheduled to
pitch in Game 7, but Torre has said in the past that he is
comfortable using Hernandez on three days of rest because he is in
such great condition.

NEWS COPTERS CROWD SKY, ZOOM IN ON TRAGEDY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News helicopters are standard scenery in Phoenix skies, battling
for airspace over tragedies, their high-tech eyes offering
close-ups of carnage to television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the choppers have flown in Arizona for decades, they've
never done so in such numbers or with such fervor. There are now
five choppers in Phoenix, up from three as little as three years
ago, and they are in the air more now than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of news helicopters, the crews looked for
beautiful views of canyons, wildlife and sunsets to offset the
day's edgier coverage. Now the helicopters speed through the skies
to capture excitement for the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the playthings of a few big-city stations, the copters
have whup-whupped into TV markets across the country. Tucson, the
No. 78 market, just got its first helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   And Phoenix, the nation's No. 17 market, is rivaling No. 2 Los
Angeles, which has seven media choppers.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures helicopters capture are ratings gold. The pilots
become local celebrities and folk heroes, rescuing motorists from
flooded washes and plucking people off mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   But all that hardware in the sky is a bit unsettling for police
and fire crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine, it looked like ``Apocalypse Now'' when you
had these five helicopters coming in on you,'' said Bob Kahn,
battalion chief for the Phoenix Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   One news pilot has already died in this decade. And police
departments worry that the squadron of helicopters over a touchy
scene will one day get an officer killed.
</P>
<P>
   There are other questions about copter coverage, too. While
debate rages on television content, news choppers allow stations to
air live close-up dramas whose unscripted endings can be brutally
violent.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters also tempt stations to cover marginal news stories,
often with threadbare information.
</P>
<P>
   And it tempts them to turn an all-too-common tragedy, such as a
child drowning or fatal car wreck, into the top story on the
evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the questions about news by copter, TV managers _
and TV viewers _ seem to love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fascination with live news events,'' said Doug
Barnard, the news director at Channel 10 (KSAZ), Phoenix's Fox
network affiliate. ``There is no better way to capture a lot of
those things than by helicopter.'' &QL; 
6 MINUTES TILL AIR TIME
</P>
<P>
   It's 4:54 p.m. on a warm monsoon day and a baby girl has fallen
into a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 3's Bruce Haffner is flying 300 feet in the air when he
hears about the drowning from his station's assignment desk.
</P>
<P>
   It's six minutes before the start of ``Good Evening Arizona,''
the city's most popular 5 p.m. newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner's headset, as familiar to viewers as his array of
baseball caps, is crackling with chatter. He monitors police
scanners, airport tower traffic, the voices of his directors at the
station, and other TV and radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As Haffner heads to the drowning, a familiar voice cuts through
the chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here,'' says Rick Crabbs, the pilot of SkyFox 10, who
has made it to the north Phoenix house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it good?'' Haffner asks, meaning, is it a real drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Crabbs says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner gets to the scene and finds room to hover west of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Cameraman Hilton Metzner cranks open the helicopter door,
letting in a blast of hot air. He hoists a large camera and gets
tight shots of the glistening pool in the back yard and the
rescuers in front.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters from Channel 3 and 10 are soon joined by those
from Channel 5, Channel 12 and Channel 15. Channel 12's helicopter
circles around the other four. It's an older helicopter and doesn't
have enough power to hover.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers don't bother to look up. Five helicopters flying in a
3-square-mile area is a sight to which they're accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5:07 p.m., Channel 3 anchor Patti Kirkpatrick tells
viewers about the drowning, using the phrase, ``This just in . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Haffner, who uses the casual Chuck Yeager tones of a
pilot to say what he knows by looking out his window and
deciphering the scanner traffic: A 19-month-old girl has fallen
into a backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, paramedics are about to transport her,''
Haffner says.
</P>
<P>
   Off the air, Haffner considers the implications of what he's
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I look at us and think we're a bunch of sharks,''
Haffner says, ``but think of that one family watching that and it
makes them get a pool fence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your shot is live,'' someone says in Haffner's headphones as
the girl is wheeled out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The medical helicopter takes off, flying below the five news
choppers. One follows it to the hospital. &QL; 
FIGHTING TO BE 1ST
</P>
<P>
   The five stations in Phoenix are vying for viewers. And they'll
try anything and everything.
</P>
<P>
   One station is warm and fuzzy. Another offers ``Extreme Video.''
One station cut its 10 p.m. newscast to five minutes so it could
run ``Seinfeld.'' Another dumped its 6 p.m. show for ``Judge
Judy.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition extends skyward. Each of the five helicopters
fights to be first and to maneuver into the best vantage point at
police and fire scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, to a layperson it would look like an accident waiting
to happen,'' said Colin Williams, public information officer with
the Rural/Metro Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot has already lost his life covering the news, though it
wasn't due to the number of helicopters in the sky. On July 5,
1991, Mike Nuetzman, a helicopter pilot for radio station KTAR-AM,
was apparently spooked by a bottle rocket that flashed by him as he
flew low. He lost control and crashed just before he was to deliver
a traffic report.
</P>
<P>
   KTAR has since ditched its helicopter and uses a fixed-wing
airplane, flying at high altitude, for its traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, newspapers also take to the skies, but mostly
for extraordinary events or aerial shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots don't forget the danger they face clipping through the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very respectful of Mother Nature,'' Haffner said.
</P>
<P>
   That respect has caused the pilots to sacrifice some of their
competitive instincts so they don't crash into each other.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots share a radio frequency and information, letting each
other know where they're going and which way they're approaching a
scene. They also tell the same to the officers and paramedics in
the air and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive atmosphere until we get to the
scene,'' said Jerry Clifton, pilot for NewsHawk 5 (KPHO). ``Then,
everybody's life depends on everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   An incident in Tucson shows the potential for disaster when
communication between TV stations and authorities breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson station's KOLD-TV had had a helicopter just weeks when it
was sent to a June school bus accident and landed on a dirt road,
blocking the path of an ambulance carrying injured students. The
ambulance was delayed for about two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot received only indirect messages from authorities on
the ground and thought he had permission to land on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no malice on anyone's behalf,'' said Capt. George
Heaney of the Tucson Fire Department.``It was strictly a
miscommunication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson station is working with the Fire Department to create
a way to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   But even when pilots and officials on the ground are talking to
each other, situations can get sticky. If authorities feel the
need, they'll close airspace over a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fire departments will do so around some hazardous fires, fear
ing the pilot will inhale noxious fumes or be blinded. But that's
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems pop up more often at police scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It's dramatic television when police in SWAT gear surround a
building, weapons drawn. Problem is, the person inside the building
might also be riveted to the live television drama.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Portland, Ore., officer was killed as he and two
other officers forced their way into a home and faced an immediate
barrage of bullets from the man inside. Police said the man was
monitoring officers' movements on the television news and therefore
knew exactly when to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario has almost happened in Phoenix, said Sgt. Mike
Torres, the Police Department's public information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had officers compromised,'' Torres said, ``but luckily,
the guy wasn't watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV pilots say they would not want to be responsible for
getting an officer hurt or killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to show on TV, where everybody live can see,
where SWAT team members are hiding,'' said Fritz Holly, pilot for
Chopper 15 (KNXV). ``I think it's something that all of us take
into consideration now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haffner said he wouldn't let a police request keep him from
getting a shot for his station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to hinder (my job), I'm going to split the
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has helped. High-tech cameras mean the choppers don't
have to be as intrusive as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cameras in this town that can stay out of (any)
legal limits and still show the pimple on the end of your nose,''
said Phil Monahan, the cameraman who flies in Sky 12 (KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   When Torres and Detective Mike McCullough, another department
spokesman, ask for the media to back off, which happens at least
several times a year, they usually get compliance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been so competitive that they're not listening to
reason,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   But the police spokesmen worry that pilots' reasoning might be
clouded by the drive for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to use (helicopters) as an enforcement tool and they
try to use it for its marketing value,'' McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   The news pilots generally get along better with fire and rescue
agencies than with police. And they can offer more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm at a scene and I see a helicopter from a news agency,
I'll ask them if they can assist us,'' said Williams, of
Rural/Metro.
</P>
<P>
   Media helicopter pilots are often glad to help.
</P>
<P>
   They often give firefighters aerial views of brush fires,
letting commanders plan strategies to fight the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton took a Rural/Metro commander up in Channel 5's helicop
ter during the 1996 Rio fire and credits himself with keeping that
blaze from charring hundreds more acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he (the commander) been driving out there, it would have
been another hour until he realized the magnitude of that thing,''
Clifton said.
</P>
<P>
   Media helicopters can also aid search and rescue missions, fire
agencies say.
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots like helping out with those missions. Others don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feather in my cap if I find the person,'' said Crabbs,
who recently located the body of a Florida hiker in the
Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner said he would do a rescue only in a life-and-death
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do rescues. We show people doing rescues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, someday he would like to be responsible for
saving someone's life. &QL; 
THE BIG STORY?
</P>
<P>
   A drunk, delirious man is pulled from a canal on a hot August
day and tells paramedics he was trying to rescue a 4-year-old girl
who sank beneath the water.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers have no choice but to believe him and start combing the
canal looking for the 4-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings at the Scottsdale Airpark where Mike McDonald,
pilot for Sky 12, waits every weekday for news to call him to his
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end is Colin Williams of Rural/Metro, who tells
McDonald rescuers could use ``an extra pair of eyes in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 4:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald and photographer Phil Monahan dash to the helicopter
and are in the air in less than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes later, McDonald is over the scene and live on
Channel 12, giving the story to thousands of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know for sure if the person he was trying to rescue
was in the water or out of the water,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the rest of the helicopters converge, drawn by
the words uttered by the drunk, delirious man.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Crabbs goes live on Channel 10 at 5 p.m. He's covering that
night's Big Story. He tells viewers there is confusion about
whether the drowned person is a child or adult.
</P>
<P>
   Crabbs ends his report saying he typically sees kids swimming in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   By 5:10 p.m., the story gets more detailed. Haffner tells
Channel 3 viewers, ``There's a 4-year-old wearing a rainbow-colored
swimsuit.'' He says officials are bringing in equipment to drag the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Crabbs wraps up his second live report with some quick banter
with anchor John Hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder what a 4-year-old is doing near a canal,'' Hook
says disapprovingly.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of rescuers' radio chatter starts changing.
</P>
<P>
   They start to doubt the story about the 4-year-old in the canal.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 p.m., all the pilots go live telling viewers it appears
the call is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, most rescue units are sent off the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear it was an erroneous call?'' Haffner says, over the
pilots' common radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing,'' McDonald says. ``But it's a shame we
wasted all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, someone puts a note on the bulletin board of
Channel 12 giving kudos to McDonald for being the first to beam the
bogus story to Phoenix television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you spend big bucks for the helicopter. You want to
be first,'' McDonald says that day. &QL; 
CARTOONS TO SUICIDE
</P>
<P>
   In several instances in other markets, helicopters have shown up
in the middle of a drama and started beaming back a live show that
ended with a violent death.
</P>
<P>
   It happened that way in California this summer when a man drove
along a Los Angeles freeway, threw firebombs at passing cars, set
his car and himself on fire, displayed a banner protesting HMOs,
and then killed himself with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Some LA stations interrupted cartoons to broadcast the suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Petty was flying for KNBC, Channel 4 in LA, that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said he yelled at his cameraman to zoom out when he realized
the man was going to shoot himself. But he was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way we could tell he was progressing into killing
himself,'' Petty said. ``As soon as that man did kill himself, we
never went back to the body, never went anywhere near it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story then became focused on the traffic backup, with the
man's death mentioned in passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll be more sensitive in the future,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident caused debate in television newsrooms. Some
wondered whether news shows should be broadcast with a seven-second
delay. Others said viewers can decide for themselves whether to
watch news with violent potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy on the freeway was very sobering for us,'' said
Jeanine L'Ecuyer, news director for Channel 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could very easily happen to us. A coverable situation
that can get out of hand very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Neill, news director for Channel 3, said he wouldn't
have turned his cameras from the suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are beginning to sense that (tragedy) is going to
happen, folks have already got the choice of turning off the
television or switching it to another channel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people won't change the channel, however.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, a 10-year-old autistic child climbed a
120-foot electrical tower in Mesa. Five channels beamed his
precarious predicament for nearly 90 full minutes. From his narrow
perch, he waved at the helicopters that captured his peril from
every angle.
</P>
<P>
   He was fingertips away from 230,000 volts of electricity, one
grip from a fatal plummet towards earth.
</P>
<P>
   And he was being watched by about 416,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Stations said they had their hands on the switches, ready to
toggle back to the news anchors or go to an alternate camera shot
if the boy had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   But balancing sensitivity and ratings success means this kind of
situation is a close call.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner said that with four competitors, all armed with
high-tech gadgets, it's in the stations' interest to provide the
best, most compelling video possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you're walking through the living room,'' Haffner said,
``it's the shot that stops you cold in your tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffner goes to great lengths to get what he hopes will be the
perfect shot. Sometimes he barks orders to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon lightning. Lightning now,'' Haffner said as he got a
shot of an approaching storm.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shot Channel 3 used for the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chopper, thanks for taking us home,'' said a voice in
Haffner's headset. Haffner was done for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It's 6:30, and Haffner was the last pilot to leave the sky,
until the next morning, when the five helicopters would be back in
the air and on the air again.  &QL;

NORTHRIDGE GIRL FALLS FROM STANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A 4-year-old girl was knocked unconscious when she
fell 18 feet from the North Campus Stadium bleachers Saturday
during the third quarter of Cal State Northridge's 21-7 win against
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN spokesman Ryan Finney said the girl, a Northridge resident
whose name was not available, was transported to Northridge
Hospital Medical Center but is not in critical condition. No other
details were available.
</P>
<P>
   First-aid personnel were quick on the scene and said the girl
lost consciousness for approximately two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear to be anything critical,'' Finney said.
``She came to quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was in the visitors section of bleachers when she fell
off the north side and landed on the ground. She apparently slipped
between the few feet of space between the floor of the bleachers
and the first bar of the railing.
</P>
<P>
   Three ambulances were called to the scene before she was taken
away.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ah (Yat), my achin' back: The screenwriters for ``Conspiracy
Theory'' should have talked to Montana regarding a plot.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Brian Ah Yat, second in Division I-AA in total
offense, didn't dress for the game despite being labeled as
probable throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, backup Seth Davis got the start.
</P>
<P>
   Ah Yat injured his back a week ago against Portland State and
was termed probable to face CSUN by the media-relations staff
throughout the week. Earlier in the week Montana spokespersons said
Ah Yat had returned to practice, which, in their interpretation,
meant he was on the practice field throwing balls on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things when you watch him throw the ball he
can do it, but we would never play someone who can't protect
himself,'' Montana coach Mick Dennehy said. ``He's at the point
where he can't protect himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-time Walter Payton Award candidate, Ah Yat's status, as
you can guess, is unknown for next week's game against Northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __ Special duty: Montana junior Di-Onte Smith, a Grant High
graduate, can play either cornerback or safety, but he's more
valuable to the Grizzlies in another role. Smith is their best
special-teams player.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a year ago he was voted Montana's special-teams player
of the year. And against CSUN, that's where he got his action.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, from Van Nuys, didn't figure in any tackles against the
Matadors but does have five this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short yardage: Punter Ethan Beck fell five yards shy of the
school record for longest punt but only because the Matadors were
on their own 28. His 72-yard punt in the first quarter one-hopped
into the end zone. Later in the game he booted a 66-yarder....
Montana's Kris Heppner's 60-yard field goal attempt to end the
first half fell short, glancing off the crossbar.... CSUN's men's
basketball team will be at the Northridge Fashion Center Sears
signing autographs today from noon to 3 p.m. Posters and free
Polaroid photos are available, as well as the chance to win $5,000.

TENNESSEE WINS VICTORY OVER GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It has been a long time since Georgia was a
national powerhouse in college football. The school last earned a
national championship in 1980, with a freshman named Herschel
Walker in the backfield. Behind a heady freshman quarterback,
Quincy Carter, the Bulldogs were again getting that prominent
feeling this season.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere and opponent were right for the Bulldogs to test
themselves Saturday _ an electrified sellout crowd of 86,117 at
Sanford Stadium and and undefeated Tennessee on the field. It took
just 6 minutes into the third quarter, though, for Georgia to find
out that it still has some building to do if it wants to step into
the elite class.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers (5-0) ripped off two touchdowns _ both 3-yard
passes by quarterback Tee Martin _ to break open a close game and
sink the Bulldogs' hopes for grander things. Tennessee's 22-3
victory pointed out two things for Georgia (4-1): the Bulldogs are
still building and they still need a great running back. Can't be a
powerhouse rushing for only 59 yards in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably jumped up there a little quicker than we
deserved,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``We had a shot at these
guys. They had the opportunity there at the start of the second
half and they took the ball game over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee made it eight victories in a row against Georgia _ a
mastery that dates to 1988 and the Vince Dooley era _ but the
Volunteers took no special pleasure in putting Georgia in its
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be focused on our season and focused on
ourselves as a team,'' running back Travis Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens was just half of an equation that solved the problem
plaguing Tennessee heading into this game. The Vols lost their
leading rusher, Jamal Lewis, with a season-ending knee injury last
week against Auburn. Lewis had been averaging 124.3 yards a game
and many did not believe that Tennessee would muster enough
firepower without Lewis in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer went to his lab and came up
with the Travis solution _ Travis Stephens and Travis Henry.
Stephens rushed for 107 yards on 20 carries and Henry rushed for 53
yards on 16 carries. And quarterback Martin rushed for 45 yards on
15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we could do, but we never got the opportunity to
show anyone,'' Stephens said. ``It's just too bad that we didn't
get a chance to do it until Jamal got hurt. We like Jamal. We'd
like to do it with Jamal in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a scary thought. Almost as frightening as what
Tennessee's defense did to Georgia's Carter, who had been
sensational in the first four games but was brought down to earth,
literally. He entered this game having completed 71 percent of his
passes and having thrown just 1 interception in 93 pass attempts.
With relentless pressure from defensive end Shaun Ellis and
linebacker Al Wilson, Carter completed only 14 of 38 attempts for
195 yards with 2 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked six times officially. Unofficially, he had to pick
himself up after almost every pass play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a lot of pressure on us and we couldn't pick up the
blitzes,'' Carter said. ``I knew they were going to be coming, but
we didn't handle it. We couldn't figure out what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter wasn't the only one taking his lumps from a brutal
Tennessee defensive assault. The Georgia receivers were getting
knocked around like pinballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have an offense play well when they're getting
their heads knocked off,'' said Georgia left tackle Matt
Stinchcomb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite only 15 yards rushing and 3 first downs, the Bulldogs
trailed by only 9-3 at the half. They also hurt themselves with
foolish penalties (9 for 86 yards for the game). But Tennessee
wiped out all hope in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Martin set up Tennessee for a touchdown on a 29-yard run that
gave the Vols a first-and-goal at the 3 on Tennessee's first
possession of the second half. Three plays later he threw a 3-yard
touchdown to Cedrick Wilson that made it 15-3. A 2-point conversion
run was stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bulldogs' first possession of the second half, Carter
overthrew Tony Small, and cornerback Dwayne Goodrich intercepted at
the Tennessee 30 and ran 11 yards to the 41. Nine plays later,
Martin zipped a pass to Peerless Price and he dived into the end
zone on a 3-yard play that helped make it 22-3 with 6:06 left in
the third quarter.

LOTTERY SUPPORT LOOKS SOLID IN ARIZONA POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't bet on the Arizona Lottery disappearing anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Arizona Republic'' poll shows a solid majority of voters
_ 60 percent _ aren't ready to bury Windfall Willy, the Lottery's
plucky prospector, or any other state-sponsored game of chance.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows 55 percent of Arizona voters believe
Lottery dollars are a financial boon to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide Nov. 3 whether to extend of the life of the
Arizona Lottery to July 1, 2003. If Proposition 304 fails, the
Lottery will expire after June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 percent of the respondents in ``The Republic'' survey
said they're ready to let the Lottery die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lottery is doing good,'' Pam Blanche of Glendale said.
``It's free choice, and nobody has to buy the tickets, so I would
vote to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bill Reid of Sun City West: ``It's an advantage to the
state. As a result of the state benefiting financially, I think the
people benefit financially from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The statewide poll of 811 registered voters, taken Oct. 3-6 for
``The Republic'' by Precision Research Inc., has an error margin of
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Other major findings:
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent of Arizona voters support Proposition 200,
dubbed the Clean Elections Act by supporters. Designed to reduce
the role of special interests in Arizona politics, the measure
provides public funding to candidates who agree to strict
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Public frustration with lobbyists' influence at the Legislature
apparently is fueling support for the measure. Sixty-eight percent
of Arizona voters polled said lobbyists have too much influence
with state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent support Proposition 300, which requires
authorization of the Food and Drug Administration or Congress
before doctors could prescribe drugs like marijuana and heroin to
seriously or terminally ill patients in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's findings suggest that House Speaker Jeff Groscost,
the state's leading Lottery critic, faces an uphill struggle in
persuading voters to kill the games.
</P>
<P>
   It found support for the Lottery crosses party lines, with 55
percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Democrats saying they will
vote to extend the Lottery's life.
</P>
<P>
   And support for the Lottery comes from those who rarely, if
ever, buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one percent of the respondents said they never play the
Arizona Lottery but would vote to extend it, and 56 percent of
those who rarely play the game would also vote to support it. Fully
81 percent of those who play at least once a week said they will
vote to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lotto and the Fantasy Five and Pick 3 are like playing
bingo at the Catholic Church,'' said poll respondent Dorothy Skeen
of Peoria. ``I don't have a problem with those. I think the
Powerball is a waste of our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost said Friday he's prepared for a major fight for public
opinion. `We've always known that this is a David and Goliath
struggle,'' he said. ``If we do win, it's with underdog status.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost is relying heavily on churches, whose leaders view the
Lottery as state-sponsored gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mormon leaders reminded the state's 275,000 members
of the church's opposition to all forms of gambling, including the
Lottery, and urged them to voice their views at the polls on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strictly a grass-roots campaign. There's no organized
campaign buying radio or television time,'' Groscost said. ``The
other side has a lot of money. If they perceive there's a threat,
they'll dump that money in.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those opposed to the Lottery is Helen Gephart of Peoria,
who participated in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the Lottery every week, but I think there's a lot of
people who can't afford it who are playing and should not, so maybe
it's better that they do away with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 percent in the Arizona Poll said the Lottery has a
negative financial impact on the state, 14 percent said it had no
impact and 18 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mundell, chairman of ``Yes on 304,'' said the results show
voters know Lottery proceeds provide a windfall for state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Lottery raised $79 million, including nearly $25
million that went to the state's general fund. Other programs
funded by the Lottery include the Heritage Fund, which received $20
million for historic preservation, state parks and wildlife
projects.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they thought casino gambling should be banned
in Arizona, 55 percent said no, compared to 37 percent yes. The
remainder were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Most respondents, 60 percent, said they do not think casino
gambling should be extended statewide, beyond Indian reservations.
Thirty-three percent said it should, and 7 percent had no opinion. &QL;

ALCALA CAN`T COMPLETELY ENJOY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe in a month or two, center Julio Alcala will
have a clear enough mind to understand the magnitude of what Cal
State Northridge accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but it seems so trite.
</P>
<P>
   His 45-year-old mother, Consuelo, has been given little time to
live.
</P>
<P>
   So while most of the 23rd-ranked Matadors basked in the
excitement of a 21-7 triumph against No. 18 Montana that will give
the program unmatched national exposure, Alcala went home. Not to
his dorm but back to San Diego to be with his mom, who is in the
terminal stage of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not doing real good,'' Alcala, 21, said. ``The doctors,
there's not really too much they can do. She's just at home. It's
hard to concentrate on something, even this big game, when you have
something bigger slipping away back at home.''
</P>
<P>
   You want emotion, Alcala's situation offers it. Just not the
kind that should be associated with a football win. This is grief
and sadness and shock that seems to zap that strength of a
6-foot-4, 285-pound giant.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN left guard Mike Barnes could sense it. Of course, he
knows what to look for in such a situation. Barnes' mother, Cyndi,
suffers from chronic pancreatitis and has spent the past five years
facing death while checking in and out of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both struggling and trying to keep our minds on the task
at hand,'' Barnes said. ``It's a real battle for both of us, just
knowing the condition that our families are in right now. I told
him to keep focus on this game. This game was big. I said, `Let's
do this for our moms.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it in his eyes. He's there, but he's not there. He's got
that distant look. It's hard not having your family here supporting
you when you know they're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on what could be one of the happiest days of his
athletic life, Alcala is hurting deeply. A few days ago Alcala was
uncertain if he would play against Montana, having missed some
practice time to spend precious time with his mom. It seems so
insignificant to wonder about such a thing, but playing a football
game had the potential to offer Alcala a few hours of solace and
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real-life stuff going on in Julio's life,'' CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``It's a pain no one knows unless they've
gone through it, and I haven't. The only thing important is his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Alcala's plight is not new. At this time last
year doctors told Consuelo she had a month or two to live. A final,
desperate treatment prolonged her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good year and I'm happy for it,'' Alcala said.
``She's always been real positive about it. We've always tried to
support her, and her decisions to get treatment or not, and I think
right now the best thing for her is to live it out. It's her time
to rest, I guess. She's been through a lot.''

TEXAS TECH TAKES NEW FOOTPATH TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ It was an increasingly familiar story in front
of 47,589 at Jones Stadium last night _ another opponent ground
underfoot by Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the evening's key moment featured a fleet red-shirted
hero dashing downfield to ice a 24-17 victory over Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams, the nation's No. 2 rusher? No, it was Red
Raiders linebacker Dorian Pitts.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, who had set up an earlier touchdown with a blocked punt,
raced 53 yards with a Tony Lindsay fumble with 2:53 remaining to
give Tech (6-0, 3-0 Big 12) a 14-point lead that proved
insurmountable _ barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (2-3, 1-2) weren't finished. Just 33 seconds later,
they had traveled 58 yards and scored on a pass from Lindsay to
Terrance Richardson to make it a seven-point game again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they held a command meeting and came up with an odd plan.
Disdaining an onside kick, they kicked deep and turned to their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Cowboys got the ball back _ at their 35 _ they
had 25 seconds, no timeouts, and no hope.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on a night when their fifth-ranked rushing game managed
131 yards _ exactly half their usual total, the Raiders were saved
by Pitts and a variety of OSU mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among those were 11 penalties for 132 yards.
Additionally, Tech's three touchdowns came off the blocked punt and
two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   The last of these came with the Cowboys trailing, 17-10, and
facing fourth-and-11 at the Tech 41. As Lindsay scrambled,
desperately looking for a receiver, he was hit by Montae Reagor and
fumbled. Pitts scooped it off the ground and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montae made the play and the ball popped right _ I just had no
choice but to take it in,'' Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of those deals where it gets late, and you check
your hole card,'' said Tech coach Spike Dykes, whose team played
without several injured starters. ``Fortunately, we had one we
could use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win from stem to stern, but it wasn't always
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   This was especially true during Tech's fourth-quarter field-goal
drive, which was kept alive by two flagrant OSU penalties _ a punch
thrown by Raymond Cato at Tech tight end Kyle Allamon, and a
face-mask tackle of quarterback Rob Peters by linebacker Troy West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Tech receiver Donnie Hart, who caught
two touchdown passes. ``I've never been 6-0 before in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams was held to 97 yards on 25 carries, he now has
1,026 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders led, 14-10, at the half despite averaging less than
2 yards per snap and trailing in total yards, 144-53.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys broke from the gate quickly, converting their first
two possessions into 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   A short Tech punt into the wind left OSU needing to march just
51 yards, which it did in 12 plays, with fullback Brian Aikins
scoring from the 1. Another punt gave the Cowboys the ball at the
Tech 48, but the drive was stalled by a penalty and OSU settled for
a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   For the Raiders, matters improved midway through the second
period. Tim Duffie's fumble recovery at the OSU 37 set up a 14-yard
scoring pass from Peters to Hart, and Pitts' blocked kick set up
another collaboration between the pair for 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tech is now 6-0 for the first time since 1976, and the third
time in the school's history. It was Dykes' 75th victory at Tech,
second in school history to Pete Cawthon (1930-1940), who had 76.

`UNDECIDEDS' MAY BE PIVOTAL IN STATEWIDE RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 and CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Jane Hull has a 25-point lead over Democrat Paul
Johnson in a new ``Arizona Republic'' poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the point spread in other statewide races is not as big, and
their outcomes rest with a sizable number of undecided voters, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month to go before the Nov. 3 election, Hull
leads Johnson, 52 percent to 27 percent, in the governor's race,
according to the statewide poll of 811 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian Kat Gallant registered 2 percent, and Reform Party
candidate Scott Malcomson garnered 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who put an additional $100,000 of his own money into
the campaign Friday, remains confident he can win. The poll was
taken as Johnson attacked Hull at a Sunday night debate for
reputedly trading Arizona water rights for Las Vegas campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   The charge backfired when key elements were proved false. But
Johnson says voters are uncomfortable with the broader implications
of the fact that Hull accepted $31,000 from Las Vegas gaming and
development interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I figured out anything this week, it's that this campaign
began in earnest last Sunday,'' Johnson said. ``This week, good and
bad, is a thousand times different than the last (campaign). The
reality is, it is engaged now. There are a lot of dynamics that
will happen between now and election day.''
</P>
<P>
   With the focus on the governor's race, Johnson said, he will be
able to raise additional issues and force Hull to respond.
</P>
<P>
   And ``my guess is that's not in Mrs. Hull's advantage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Poll, taken Saturday through Tuesday by Precision
Research Inc. for ``The Republic,'' has an error margin of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   It found that Sen. John McCain has a virtually insurmountable
lead over Democratic challenger Ed Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two percent of those surveyed said they would vote for
McCain, compared to 11 percent for Ranger, a political newcomer.
Reform Party candidate Bob Park and Libertarian John Zajac
registered 3 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hull has a commanding lead over Johnson, the poll's
findings suggest the outcome of other statewide races rests on a
large contingent of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for attorney general, Republican Tom McGovern leads
Democrat Janet Napolitano, 36 percent to 28 percent. Libertarian
Thomas Eblen brought up the rear with 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a third of the voters surveyed said they have not made up
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   That large voting bloc will be the obvious target of both
candidates in the coming weeks, as voters begin to focus on the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is going to be a close race,'' McGovern predicted.
``It will get tighter before it gets wider.''
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano supporters were encouraged by the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the amount of personal money McGovern has put into his
campaign, his high exposure in the primary and his support from
political insiders, Napolitano is in great shape,'' said Mario
Diaz, her campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he noted, Napolitano still had about half of her
$500,000 campaign war chest to spend on media when the latest
campaign finance reports were filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's $485,000 campaign included $156,000 of his own money
and was running about $30,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano launched a major TV blitz last week. McGovern
apparently is awaiting results of a GOP fund-raiser on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable number of undecided voters could sway the outcome of
other races, the Arizona Poll found:
</P>
<P>
   In the race for Secretary of State, Republican Betsey Bayless
leads Democrat Art Hamilton, 40 percent to 26 percent. But about a
third of the vote, 34 percent, is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the Corporation Commission race, 44 percent of the poll
respondents were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Among those with an opinion, Republican Tony West led Democrat
Paul Newman, 33 percent to 22 percent. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The continuation of negotiations Saturday
by the U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, with both the ethnic Albanian
leadership in Kosovo and the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, suggested that enough common ground was being found to
avert NATO air strikes, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke spent about an hour and a half with Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian political leader, in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, and returned for seven hours of talks with Milosevic, which
ended after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the official news agency Tanjug said that ``all the
conditions are there'' for a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official travelling with Holbrooke dismissed the
statement calling it ``old wine in an old bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he planned to meet again Sunday with Milosevic.
``Nothing has changed,'' he said. ``The situation is very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer talks go on and the more exchanges that take place
between the two sides in the Kosovo conflict, the greater the
chances for a peaceful resolution, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened air strikes unless Milosevic ends all
military operations in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, and
begins negotiations with the ethnic Albanians who make upare about
90 percent of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic backs down, however, many Serbs in this
frightened capital say the mere threat of air strikes has enabled
the Yugoslav leader to strengthen rather than weaken control of his
economically depressed country.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a high likelihood, the diplomats said, that NATO
would formally declare an activation order, the last step necessary
to authorize air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana, said Saturday in
Brussels that the alliance had completed all the necessary
decisions before declaring the order.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have consistently said they believe that it would
take the final authorization of air strikes to push Milosevic to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Saturday in Belgrade that Milosevic had decided
that taking NATO air strikes was not the most profitable route to
his political survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, an independent newspaper that in a crisis
like this is considered to reflect a sense of what the secretive
Milosevic is mulling, reported Saturday that the Yugoslav leader
``objects to some parts of the proposed agreement'' but that a deal
was in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Milosevic was against NATO soldiers being
part of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Senior Clinton
administration officials have said in the last several days that an
``international presence'' would be necessary in Kosovo to verify
the withdrawal of Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have also suggested that the ``presence'' would be
used to help the international aid effort that will be needed over
the winter to assist about 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
were forced to flee their homes during a three-month offensive by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not been specific about the composition of
the ``presence'' that is being contemplated. Holbrooke has noted
the opposition in Congress to sending American soldiers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph also reported that Milosevic had asked for
all economic sanctions to be lifted against Yugoslavia, including
the ban on loans from the International Monetary Fund and financing
from the World Bank. The newspaper said that Holbrooke had offered
a gradual lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holbrooke was characteristically tight-lipped about his
discussions Saturday in Pristina. The situation was ``just as
serious'' as some days ago, he said, before taking the 40-minute
flight back to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He met with a three-man negotiating team for the ethnic
Albanians in Pristina but spent the bulk of his time with Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has led the ethnic Albanian policy calling for the
independence of Kosovo rather than some kind of enhanced autonomy
within a Yugoslav framework. His peaceful pursuit of independence
has earned him Western backing over the violent guerrilla tactics
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian group trying to
win independence on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Holbrooke was the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia,
Christopher Hill, the main author of an interim political plan for
the status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's plan would restore to Kosovo some degree of autonomy,
stripped away by Milosevic in 1989, but postpone for several years
the question of independence. It also lays out details of much
greater representation of ethnic Albanians _ who outnumber Serbs
nine to one _ in the province, in the police force, the courts, a
legislature and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Holbrooke is armed with six points of negotiation
that he brought with him from a meeting with the so-called contact
group in London Friday. The group consists of Russia, the United
States and European countries that monitor events in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The points include the withdrawal of the Yugoslav national army
and the Serbian police in Kosovo to the levels that pertained
before March, when the crackdown against the guerrillas began, and
the storage of heavy weapons, the freedom for the 250,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees to return to their homes without intimidation
from Serbian police, and the start of talks based on the Hill plan.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the talks, according to U.S. officials, have
been the Serbian and Yugoslav military issues _ an immediate end to
hostilities and the withdrawal of troops and weaponry. Unless these
forces are reduced and the reductions can be verified, those ethnic
Albanians whose homes have not been destroyed in the summer
offensive will lack the confidence to return to their villages, the
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, which after a series of car bombs and similar
attacks in the past two years have fought openly since the spring
for Kosovo's independence, said Saturday that they would continue
to respect a cease-fire they announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a well-informed daily news report, VIP, which is
read closely in Western embassies, said in its latest issue that
preparations by the Yugoslav Army against possible NATO air strikes
had not gone well.
