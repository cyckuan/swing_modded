Hijacker Killed After Plane Robbery
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A crying man tried to hijack a Philippine
Airlines jet carrying 291 people Thursday, then robbed everyone and jumped out
of the plane wearing a homemade parachute. His body was found later in the day.
The hijacker moved from bathroom to bathroom toward the front of the Airbus 330,
complaining of a stomachache, finally reaching the cockpit, where he announced
the hijacking minutes before the scheduled landing, passengers said. Armed with
a grenade and a pistol, the man -- who had donned a ski mask and swimming
goggles -- ordered the pilot of PAL Flight PR812 to return to Davao City in the
southern Philippines.

Energy Dept. Nuke Contractors Fined

<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Energy on Thursday fined two
contractors at nuclear sites in Washington and Colorado a total of $123,750 for
failing to adequately protect workers exposed to radioactivity. The agency also
cited a contractor at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
Laboratory, but levied no fine. Bechtel Hanford, Inc. was fined $82,500 over a
June 1999 incident in which three workers were exposed to airborne radioactivity
after they unwrapped a ''highly contaminated'' piece of equipment, the DOE said.

Fed Probers Breach Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials said today that congressional investigators,
posing as law enforcement officers with fake IDs, were waved unchallenged
through the entrances of Washington's most secure government buildings and even
into some Cabinet secretaries' offices. Over the past three months, the General
Accounting Office investigators faked their way into 19 federal agencies and two
airports -- including the FBI, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Justice Department and
the State Department. The exercise exposed how age-old cop-to-cop courtesies
could be a security breach.

New Plan To Protect Fragile Water

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans broad new protections for
fragile stretches of sea, beach and reef -- a system of ocean preserves that
could eventually mirror the system of protected forest and parks on land,
environmental groups said today. On Friday, President Clinton plans to direct
federal agencies to come up with a quick plan for protecting Hawaiian coral
reefs and a longer-term plan for addressing threats to other marine areas,
private organizations involved in the effort said. His plans do not require
action by Congress, but could be undone by the next president.

Ethiopia Celebrates Lands Victory

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia's capital erupted in a singing,
dancing, horn-honking celebration Thursday at word the military had broken
Eritrea's army in a border showdown that could prove the most pivotal battle of
the 2-year-old Horn of Africa war. But what Ethiopia called a rout, Eritrea
called a withdrawal -- not a surrender, and probably not yet an end to the
fighting that is consuming lives and resources of two of the world's most
impoverished nations. ''Eritrea has decided, for the sake of peace, to accept
the appeal ... for de-escalation,'' Eritrea announced early Thursday after a
punishing 2-day Ethiopian attack on its central front.

Ontario town of Walkerton have been sickened by the potentially deadly germ,
which was first detected in municipal well water last week. More than 50 people
showed up for treatment or follow-up visits for E coli infection today, and six
patients remained hospitalized here.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. (AP) -- The soft music that greets visitors to the
St. Therese Carmelite chapel creates an atmosphere of tranquility.
Devotional candles burn under statues of the saints, and kneeling
benches offer an open invitation for the sorrowful to shed their
burdens.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, but this place of quiet reflection lies in
the midst of a world of bustling commerce -- a short distance from
many crowded retail shops, one floor down from Joe's American Bar
and Grill, across the hall from a Friendly's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   St. Therese is located on the lower level of the North Shore
Shopping Center.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel claims to be the first in the nation built in a mall;
it has been a spiritual oasis for shoppers for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   With three Masses per day and frequent opportunities for
confession, the chapel, visitors say, is a place to find God where
people don't usually look.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got Capitalism with a capital 'C' upstairs, and
Religion with a capital 'R' downstairs,'' said chapel visitor Jack
Richards, 70, of Hamilton. ''In some ways, they never mix. But they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   The chapel was founded in 1960 by Cardinal Richard Cushing
during a move to ''bring God into the marketplace.'' Today, similar
chapels are scattered around the country, including a Carmelite
chapel in the Prudential Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The North Shore chapel is staffed by six retired friars; the
prior, the Rev. Charlie Countie, is, at age 66, the youngest by
far.
</P>
<P>
   Countie said the chapel's unusual location is one of its key
strengths, offering people who are looking for the material a path
to the eternal. ''We're a witness to something else,'' he said.
''The upstairs is full of glitz. Down here is the presence of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at chapel ranges from 50 to 100 for the daily Mass to
a full house of 360 on the weekends. Convenience is a big draw,
because many parishes don't hold daily Masses or are closed during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is putting God in our lives in an everyday capacity,''
said Martin Monahan, 75, of Peabody. ''It's a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity is appealing for some, Countie said. People who park
their cars in the crowded mall lot when they come to reveal their
sins during confession know they could be mistaken for eager
shoppers. Not once, Countie said with a laugh, has anyone confessed
to overspending upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmelite chapel has survived the various transformations of
the mall, which started as an outdoor shopping center, was later
covered and then, in 1993, redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   A petition drive helped save the chapel that year when the new
owners considered shutting it down. The chapel pays its lease with
donations and profits from an adjacent gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel's existence still comes as a surprise to many
shoppers, Countie said. Its plain-lettered sign is easily lost in
the bright lights and buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come here a lot. I've never heard of it. I've never seen
it,'' said Ann Stanley, 59, of Ipswich. ''All I see is kids running
around without their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people find their way to the mall chapel. ''Sinners,
saints, the prayerful, the curious, they all come down,'' Countie
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never been a target audience,'' said business manager
Tom Tighe. ''It's really open to anyone and everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryellen McGee, who worked at Orange Julius at the North Shore
mall, remembered visiting the chapel during hectic times at the
frozen juice-drink vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tremendous contrast in pace,'' McGee, 52, of
Topsfield, said after a recent visit to the chapel with her two
daughters. ''It was just a place to catch your breath and think
about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Many chapel attendees don't know each other, but regulars
sometimes meet for coffee in the food court after Mass. To them, a
mall chapel doesn't seem unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Said Marie Brown, 76, who has attended the chapel for 38 years:
''To me, there is no mall.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nation To Help Poor  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton used a visit to two ethnic
groups Thursday night to urge Americans to help those who have not
benefitted from the country's economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ''What are we going to do with this great fortune?'' Clinton
asked at a dinner of the Sons of Italy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Those of you in this audience who are over 30, can all
remember at least one time in their lives, when you made a mistake,
a personal mistake, or a professional or business mistake, or if
you're in politics, a political mistake, not because things were
going so poorly, but because things were going so well,'' Clinton
said, possibly with the Monica Lewinsky scandal in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   ''You thought there were no consequences to a lapse in judgment,
to taking the immediate path rather than the long view.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president said that similarly, with the country at the top
its game, it needs to look beyond the short term. He urged Congress
to pass legislation that would provide incentives to invest in poor
neighborhoods and Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I have decided that I will try to devote myself this year to
getting the American people to take the long view,'' Clinton said
earlier, at a dinner of the Asian Pacific American Institute for
Congressional Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We ought to say, 'OK, we can do things now we couldn't do
seven or eight years ago,''' he said. ''In spite of our growing
prosperity, there are still people in places untouched by it. We
ought to take this opportunity to give them a chance to become a
part of the American dream.''

<HEADLINE> New Plan To Protect Fragile Water  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans broad new
protections for fragile stretches of sea, beach and reef -- a system
of ocean preserves that could eventually mirror the system of
protected forest and parks on land, White House officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton plans to direct federal agencies to
come up with a quick plan for protecting Hawaiian coral reefs and a
longer-term plan for addressing threats to other marine areas.
</P>
<P>
   His plans do not require action by Congress, but could be undone
by the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is saying that it's time we do for our oceans
what we've done on land -- establish a comprehensive conservation
network that preserves these unique resources for future
generations,'' said George Frampton, acting chairman of the White
House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans live near a coastline, and pressures from
development, pollution, fishing and oil and gas drilling are
increasing yearly, environmental advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've set aside more than 200 million acres of wilderness and
national parks to provide sanctuaries for wildlife and ourselves,
but we have until now neglected our oceans,'' said John Adams,
president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a federal proposal in 90 days that would
permanently protect reefs along a 1,200-mile string of islands in
far northwest Hawaii. The coral reef system there represents 70
percent of all reefs in U.S. waters, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The reefs, threatened by pollution and overfishing, support
threatened sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other
marine life found nowhere else, a White House fact sheet said. The
White House said the reef conservation plan will be developed in
cooperation with Hawaiian authorities and a regional fisheries
management board.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Interior Department and the Commerce Department
would draw up lists of threatened areas and weigh how best to
protect them -- through total bans on fishing, drilling or other
activities, or through milder measures. A new federal office would
administer the process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to do those things by executive order, or
presidential prerogative. His announcement is to be part of a visit
to the Assateague Island National Seashore off the Maryland and
Virginia coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan is likely from commercial fishing
interests and other businesses that use open ocean. But Sarah
Chasis, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said
some fishermen have become allies of protection plans in Florida
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''The protection means new spawning grounds, and that ultimately
benefits fishing elsewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has administrative power to
impose protections on federal waters and coastline, but it is not
often invoked. Those powers do not extend to private waters.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 square miles of ocean is now afforded the kind of
blanket protection from human activity accorded true wilderness
areas on land, said Jack Sobel, a specialist in marine ecosystems
and coral reefs at the nonprofit Center for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think the executive order by itself is going to make
sure that (proper) protection happens,'' Sobel said. ''But we do
think a lot can get done in eight months,'' before Clinton leaves
office. ''We think a committed administration can leave a lasting
legacy in a relatively short time.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Lab Warned Fire Officials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The head of fire management at the Los
Alamos nuclear laboratory said he made an unprecedented plea to
National Park Service officials not to start the prescribed burn
that later raged out of control and destroyed hundreds of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe New Mexican reported Thursday that Gene Darling,
the lab's fire management officer, said he met May 4 -- the day the
fire was set -- with two members of the prescribed burn team at
nearby Bandelier National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'You know I'd really prefer you didn't do this,'''
Darling told the newspaper. ''It's the first time that I've ever
said that, 'I wish you wouldn't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy lab security chief Gene Tucker backed up Darling's
account of the meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Darling said he told the members of the burn team, whom he would
not identify, that the lab had revised its fire-danger rating from
very high to extreme that day. Darling told the newspaper that the
Bandelier officials said they would pass his warning along to
higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   A crew ignited the fire that evening, intending to burn
underbrush on about 1,000 acres to reduce the threat of a
catastrophic fire. High winds and dry weather soon pushed the blaze
out of control toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 people in the area were evacuated and more than 220
homes burned in what became the largest wildfire in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear weapons research lab said it lost 32 temporary
buildings used for storage and office space. Officials said the
fire never posed a serious threat to hazardous materials housed in
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Bandelier Superintendent Roy Weaver has taken responsibility for
the decision to start the burn and has been placed on
administrative leave. A preliminary investigation released last
week also blamed the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said Darling's
comments were unavailable to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
before he released the preliminary report. She said such
supplemental information will be considered by another panel of
experts who are providing an analysis of the fire Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was contained but remained active inside the fireline
Thursday, with high winds up to 40 mph helping some hot spots flare
up, fire information officer Debbie Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother Nature is not cooperating with us.'' Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had hoped to have the fire under control by Sunday
but said that because of the high winds they now expect it to take
until July 9.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Royals 3  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro caught Rocky Colavito
for 45th place on the career homer list with 374, driving in three
runs Thursday night and leading Texas past Kansas City 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez was 3-for-5, raising his average to .381 and
moving ahead of Anaheim's Darin Erstad for the AL lead. The Rangers
won for the 11th time in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza (3-2) went 6 2-3 innings for the victory, giving
up three runs on 10 hits, with a walk and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 12th save. He has
recorded saves in nine straight appearances, breaking the Rangers
record set by Mike Henneman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who broke the Rangers' seven-game winning streak the
night before, had shut them out for 13 straight innings before
Palmeiro led off the second with a home run to match Colavito's
total.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, a 13-year veteran, added a tiebreaking, two-run single
off Jose Santiago in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   After Luis Alicea tied it 3-all with an RBI single in the
seventh off Jose Santiago (4-2), Rodriguez sliced a line drive down
the right-field line with two out. A spectator appeared to reach
over the railing and touch the ball, and Texas manager Johnny Oates
argued for about 10 minutes when umpires decided it was a
ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea was sent back to third, but Palmeiro followed with a
single.
</P>
<P>
   After Palmeiro's homer in the second, David Segui hit starter
Mac Suzuki's next pitch for his sixth home run, the first time this
season the Rangers hit consecutive homers. The Royals have now
given up a major league-leading 80 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Johnson, who had a two-run double in the fourth, put the
Royals ahead 3-2 in the sixth with a sacrifice fly that Scarborough
Green made a great play on.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a last-minute replacement for Ruben Mateo in center
field, saved a second run with his back-to-the-infield catch of a
ball that appeared to be going over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's two-run double in the fourth hooked down the
left-field line just an inch or so above third baseman Mike Lamb's
outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
Notes:  The Rangers scratched Mateo from the lineup after he
developed tightness around the right side of his rib cage in
batting practice. He was not believed seriously hurt. ... Texas SS
Royce Clayton, in an 0-for-14 skid which has dropped his average
from .259 to .239, was given the night off. ... Next on the home
run list ahead of Palmeiro is Carlton Fisk with 376. ... Although
they've stolen only one base in their last six games, the Royals
still lead the league with 49 thefts.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Fan Files Lawsuit After Brawl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A Chicago Cubs fan arrested in last week's brawl
with the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field filed a lawsuit
Thursday against Dodgers' players and both teams, claiming that he
sustained neck and shoulder strains.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Camacho, a 32-year-old construction supervisor, was one
of three men arrested on disorderly conduct charges following the
May 16 melee that was sparked when a fan allegedly struck Dodgers
catcher Chad Kreuter in the back of his head and snatched his cap
as Kreuter sat in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho said Kreuter choked him while other Dodgers struck him.
Camacho said he was then carted off by security guards, held for
three hours at the park and turned over to police. He noted that no
criminal charges were filed against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed late Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court,
names all 19 suspended Dodgers players and coaches. It also accuses
the Cubs organization of failing to provide adequate security, of
falsely imprisoning Camacho and of failing to provide him with
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unprecedented for major league baseball players to go
into the stands of a baseball park, acting in concert and with the
intent to injure spectators,'' the suit said. The players ''acted
as if they were common thugs and goons.''
</P>
<P>
   Camacho's lawyer, Karen Conti, said her client is seeking
damages in excess of $50,000 and a public apology from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really believe a settlement is in the best interest of both
parties,'' Conti said. ''We tried very hard to settle this case
with the Cubs and Dodgers. I'm very excited about trying this case,
especially in Cook County, where the Cubs are adored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers said they would have no comment on pending
litigation. Calls made to the Cubs were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have sent a letter to season ticket holders announcing
that beer sales at Wrigley will be curtailed and security increased
in response to the fight.

taking a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic because it's Game 2 I got hurt in last year,''
Ewing said. ''Hopefully it won't be the case that I'll have to sit
out the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lost Ewing to a torn Achilles' tendon after Game 2 of
last year's Eastern Conference finals against the Pacers. He missed
the rest of the series, but New York still managed to eliminate
Indiana in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing hurt his foot in Game 1 on Tuesday night, but said the
injuries weren't related. On Tuesday, he had plantar fascitas, an
inflammation of tissue in the sole of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he strained the peroneal tendon, located on the top
of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really know what happened,'' Ewing said. ''I tried to
make a play, to go to the basket and I just felt something pull.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing pulled himself out of the game with 5:29 left in the first
quarter. He had four points and one rebound in seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Thomas replaced Ewing, scoring 10 points and grabbing eight
rebounds. But he also fouled out, sending Dale Davis to the line
with 5.8 seconds left and the Knicks trailing 86-84.
</P>
<P>
   Davis missed both free throws, but was able to grab his own
rebound and dish to a wide-open Jalen Rose, who dunked with 2.4
seconds left to seal Indiana's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the big fellow, we don't have any serious inside
presence,'' Thomas said. ''Without him in there, it's really
difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana coach Larry Bird said Ewing's absence wasn't really
a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played last year without Patrick, and they beat us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the playoffs from the sideline has become something of
a ritual for Ewing the last three years. There was his Game 2
injury last year. He felt a ''ripping sensation'' before that game,
but played anyway, limping throughout most of the game. Tests the
next day showed the tear in his Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he made a surprise return from a broken wrist in Game 2
of the second-round against the Pacers. Indiana won that series
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   He has missed 88 games over last three seasons with injuries,
including the first 20 of this season because of Achilles'
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this latest injury even more painful is that Ewing
had been playing some of his best basketball in years. At 37 and in
his 15th season, he averaged 15.4 points and 10.3 rebounds in the
first 11 games of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 15 points and 9.7 rebounds during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's painful,'' Ewing said. ''I thought we had our
opportunities to win this game. We didn't make plays down the
stretch to secure the victory. It's frustrating to have to watch
from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed this game more than they did. We just have to
regroup and come ready to play this Saturday. I'm going to try to
come back on Saturday and help my team win.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Rebounds But Knicks Fall  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Johnson showed up Thursday night.
Unfortunately, he left a little early.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson rebounded from one of the worst playoff games of his
career and came up big after Patrick Ewing went out with a foot
injury, scoring 25 points against the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 of
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks faded in the final minute, watching helplessly as
the Pacers scored the last six points for an 88-84 victory and a
2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson blamed himself on the game's deciding play with Indiana
holding an 86-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis, who outplayed Johnson badly in Game 1, grabbed an
offensive rebound after missing a free row with 5.8 seconds
remaining. His New York counterpart wasn't around, having taken off
down the court in hopes of getting in position for a tying or
winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who had 16 rebounds in all, tipped the ball away from the
shorter Charlie Ward and found Jalen Rose wide open under the
basket while the rest of the Knicks scrambled futilely to get back
in position.
</P>
<P>
   Rose dunked home the clincher with 2.4 seconds to go and the
clock ran out on the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have stayed at the line,'' Johnson said. ''I was
figuring he would miss and we would get the rebound, so I wanted to
get down court for the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He was only following the orders of coach Jeff Van Gundy, who
wanted to have his best 3-point shooters in position in case Davis
made one of his two free throws. The Knicks had no timeouts
remaining to set up a play, and it didn't matter when Davis hustled
for the rebound after missing both foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have stayed there,'' Johnson said again.
</P>
<P>
   He was invisible in Game 1 on Tuesday night, scoring just three
points, managing only five rebounds and losing miserably in the
head-to-head battle with Davis, who had 14 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knew he couldn't have another game like that when Ewing
went down after only seven minutes with a strained tendon in his
right foot. He didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   ''LJ stepped up for us,'' said Kurt Thomas, who filled in for
Ewing. ''That's what we needed from him. He came up huge for us.
When he wasn't scoring, he was dishing off to the open man. That's
what he's been doing all year and he's got to keep doing it for us
the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a history of rebounding for poor showings in the
playoffs. In 1997 against Miami, he managed only three points and
one rebound in Game 5, but came back with 20 points and nine
rebounds the next time out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he failed to score in a clinching victory over
Atlanta in the second round. When the conference finals against
Indiana opened six days later, Johnson was back on track with 15
points and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, he came through with 14 points and six
rebounds in the first half, pushing the Knicks to a 43-42 lead at
the break. He added seven points in the third, sending New York to
the final period up 66-61.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Patrick went out, I got more touches,'' Johnson said. ''I
got an opportunity to score more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks couldn't finish. Johnson hit only 1-of-3 shots in
the fourth quarter and New York managed a 7-of-20 performance in
the final period. In the meantime, Rose and Rik Smits scored 10
points apiece for the Pacers, who stepped up to shoot 10-of-18 with
the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, some of the Knicks thought Davis broke off the line
before the ball hit the rim, which would have given possession to
New York. Johnson wasn't sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was down the court,'' he said. ''I couldn't really see it. I
should have stayed at the line.''

<HEADLINE> Astros' Cedeno Out 6-8 Weeks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Roger Cedeno broke two
bones in his right hand sliding into first base during Thursday
night's game against Philadelphia and will be sidelined
six-to-eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, trying to beat out a slow grounder to first in the
fourth inning, fractured the fourth and fifth metacarpels on his
left hand and also ruptured a tendon on his ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   He will not need surgery, but his hand was placed in a temporary
splint and will be put in a cast Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very disappointed,'' Cedeno said. ''But at least we scored
two runs on the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was hitting .258 overall but .345 in the previous 13
games. He is second in the National League with 17 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Last season with the New York Mets, he hit .314 and stole 66
bases, second in the majors. He was acquired along with pitcher
Octavio Dotel as part of the December trade that sent pitcher Mike
Hampton and outfielder Derek Bell to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Houston will recall outfielder Lance Berkman from Triple-A New
Orleans. Berkman was hitting .336 with six homers and 27 RBIs at
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-game stint with the Astros earlier this season, Berkman
hit .222 with one home run and four RBIs while starting seven
games.

<HEADLINE> Breaks Go Pacer's Way in 4th  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird was perfectly honest in his
assessment of the Indiana Pacers' victory over the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really felt we were lucky,'' the Indiana coach said after
the Pacers beat the Knicks 88-84 on Thursday night to take a 2-0
lead in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very fortunate. I really felt they outplayed us. We just
got lucky at the end. The ball went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, selected the NBA's most improved player Wednesday,
came up with a key defensive effort in the final seconds, and
scored 10 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it was the biggest game in franchise history,'' said
Rose, who was 3-for-13 in the first three quarters and had missed
seven consecutive shots until he hit a jumper to cut New York's
advantage to 69-67 with 9:16 left in the third
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to sit here and take the credit for stopping
Latrell Sprewell. It takes a team effort to shut down someone like
him. But, I did want to play good defense against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was 3-of-14 from the field and scored 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was big. Jalen played a phenomenal game on defense
against one of the league's top offensive players,'' Pacers guard
Mark Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to feel really good because we didn't play well. That
was probably as ugly as we can play,'' Jackson said. ''We came out
with a win just on effort, made big plays in the stretch, went to
the glass. Rik Smits came up big when we needed him. It was a big
effort from everyone to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's jumper tied it at 84 with 55.5 seconds left. The basket
came just as the 24-second clock was expiring after Larry Johnson
missed knocking the pass away from the Indiana forward. Sprewell
also nearly came up with the loose ball on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Rose played all 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good to be out there with the situation in hand,''
Rose said. ''We were just trying to be consistent and do what we
have to do to get to the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We came up with stops when we had to and we made shots when we
had to,'' said Reggie Miller, who scored 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won despite shooting only 36 percent (28-of-77) from
the field, but Dale Davis had 16 rebounds for the second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis grabbed three rebounds in the final 50 seconds. The last
came when he missed a free throw with 5.8 seconds to go, but
hustled to the rebound and fed the ball to Rose for an uncontested
dunk to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had two guys down there and they didn't really have
anybody covering the shooter,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You definitely don't want to miss on purpose, but I saw if I
did I miss I knew I had a clear shot at getting it. They were
trying to box out on the block, but I knew if it was high enough I
could jump over them because the guys they had were smaller than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was close all the way. New York's biggest lead was
eight and Indiana's biggest lead was five. There were seven lead
changes and 12 ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rushed a little bit, but we had looks that didn't go in,''
Jackson said. ''But we can live with it. There were times when we
were tentative. There were times when we didn't take a shot that we
should have taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we are going to New York with a 2-0
advantage, but this series is far from over. I always say a series
doesn't get serious until a home team loses a game.''

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an effort to halt the use of child soldiers, the
General Assembly Thursday approved an amendment calling for governments to take
''all feasible measures'' to prevent troops under the age of 18 from taking part
in combat. The new language in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child

The hijacker moved from bathroom to bathroom toward the front of the Airbus 330,
complaining of a stomachache, finally reaching the cockpit, where he announced
the hijacking minutes before the scheduled landing, passengers said. Armed with
a grenade and a pistol, the man -- who had donned a ski mask and swimming

<HEADLINE> Ex-GI Says He Wasn't At No Gun Ri  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- One of the Korean War veterans who
described the U.S. Army killing of refugees at No Gun Ri says he
now recognizes he could not have been at the scene and instead
learned of it second-hand from soldiers who were there.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime documents found in government archives by The Associated
Press show that the ex-soldier, Edward L. Daily, 69, of
Clarksville, was in another unit elsewhere in Korea when 7th
Cavalry Regiment companies fired on the South Korean civilians in
late July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility had come under fire in recent news reports,
seven months after an AP article cited Daily among a dozen
ex-soldiers supporting the allegations of two dozen survivors that
U.S. troops killed a large number of refugees at No Gun Ri, a
hamlet in central South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to agree with your records. I can't dispute them,''
Daily said in an AP interview after reviewing the relevant
documents. Asked whether he agreed the records showed he could not
have been at No Gun Ri, he replied simply, ''Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   His accounts of what happened at No Gun Ri, given to the AP in
1998 and other news organizations later, may have stemmed from
years of veterans' reunions and hearing from men who participated
in or witnessed the killings, Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel as though I was at No Gun Ri,'' he said, his
voice haggard and slow. ''I did not intend to be deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The archival documents show that Daily did join a 7th Cavalry
combat unit in March 1951, months after No Gun Ri. In fact, he is a
past president of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Association -- a veterans'
group -- and has written two published histories of the regiment in
Korea, in which he mentions himself as a front-line soldier, both
in 1950 and 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Daily has been a Veterans Administration
hospital outpatient under treatment for post-traumatic stress
disorder -- that is, psychological problems related to his wartime
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Last September's AP report prompted the U.S. and South Korean
governments to launch investigations. Thus far, Defense Department
investigators have interviewed more than 100 veterans and others,
including Daily, and senior Pentagon officials told The New York
Times on May 12 they had determined that U.S. troops killed a large
number of civilians at No Gun Ri. A source close to the South
Korean investigation said it had reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen later said no conclusions could
be reached until a final report, which is not expected for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred at a time when American commanders, in
retreat before the North Korean army, feared that enemy
infiltrators were disguised among such refugee groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean survivors say about 300 villagers, mostly women and
children, were killed by U.S. ground troops under and around the No
Gun Ri railroad trestle, and about 100 in an earlier U.S. air
attack. Veterans generally spoke of 100, 200 or ''hundreds''
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Daily was the seventh of nine veterans quoted in the original AP
story.
</P>
<P>
   His description of what happened at No Gun Ri was generally
consistent with that of other veterans and Korean survivors. He was
one of 10 who have told the AP that orders were issued at the scene
to fire on refugees. Daily also spoke of still hearing, a
half-century later, ''the little kids screaming'' from under the
trestle.
</P>
<P>
   His accounts became more prominent in other news organizations'
reports following up on the AP story.
</P>
<P>
   While investigating the No Gun Ri allegations in 1998, AP was
referred to Daily by another veteran because of his detailed
knowledge of the 1st Cavalry Division's operations in the Korean
War. On the 7th Cavalry Association's roster of veterans, Daily had
long been listed as a member of the regiment's H Company in July
1950.
</P>
<P>
   But reports earlier this month on a privately owned veterans'
Web site, ''Stripes.com,'' and in U.S. News &AMP; World Report magazine
noted that a sketchy reconstructed Army personnel record said he
actually belonged to another 1st Cavalry Division unit at the time,
the 27th Ordnance Maintenance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The record had to be reconstructed because a 1973 fire destroyed
millions of Army personnel files, including Daily's.
</P>
<P>
   In their original AP interviews, some 7th Cavalry veterans
referred to Daily's presence at No Gun Ri; one described Daily's
machine-gun position at the trestle. But veterans recently have
told reporters their ''recollections'' of Daily may have stemmed
from conversations with him at reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor Jonathan Wolman issued a statement on May 15
saying the AP ''stands behind its carefully researched report,''
which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Wolman said: ''While we remain confident of the
central findings of our coverage, AP is dismayed that Ed Daily
cannot authenticate his account of the events at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Daily is obviously haunted by his service in the Korean
War even as he struggles to understand and explain the version of
events he provided to AP, to the Army and to other news
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP conducted exhaustive research at the National Personnel
Records Center in St. Louis to find still more material relating to
Daily's military service.
</P>
<P>
   The documents it has found include company rosters, morning
reports and special orders from 1949-51 bearing repeated personnel
notations for Daily within the 27th Ordnance Maintenance Company,
complete with his unique military service number.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the 12 documents show him assigned to the
company in March 1949 in Japan, sent on temporary duty to another
Japanese location, returning from temporary duty, having his
enlistment period extended, having his military specialty changed
from clerk to mechanic, and finally being assigned to the 7th
Cavalry's H Company in March 1951, seven months after No Gun Ri.
Until then, H Company morning reports and rosters include no
mention of Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Ordnance Maintenance, a rear-area unit responsible for
maintaining everything from howitzers to binoculars, was deployed
to Korea with the 7th Cavalry and the rest of the division in July
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Its morning reports show it was headquartered 18 miles from No
Gun Ri during the shootings there, although the possibility remains
that individual soldiers may have been near No Gun Ri, which was
beside a main road. The reports generally do not locate specific
soldiers, but one indicated a 27th Ordnance Maintenance man was
wounded a few miles from No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only remember being with Company H, 7th Cavalry Regiment,''
Daily said after being shown the newly uncovered documents. ''But I
have reviewed your records that you have obtained, and I cannot
dispute them.''
</P>
<P>
   That would also raise doubts about Daily's descriptions of two
other incidents reported in last year's AP stories: the killing of
several dozen refugees in an encounter days after No Gun Ri, and
the death of hundreds of refugees when the U.S. Army deliberately
blew up a large bridge. Other ex-GIs also described those incidents
to the AP, and the general who ordered the bridge blown confirmed
those refugee deaths in an official history.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also have arisen about Daily's claims, some reported
by other news organizations, to have received a battlefield
promotion to lieutenant and several medals for valor, and to have
been held prisoner by the North Koreans for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether some of those claims might be untrue, he said,
''Maybe it could be. Whatever records they come up with I can't
dispute them.''
</P>
<P>
   One recently traced document is a special order noting his
discharge in 1952 as a sergeant, not a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Daily had offered some documents and other material, including
an Army driver's license, to support his contention he was in H
Company in 1950. In the future, he said, he will show those
unauthenticated documents only to Pentagon investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, a tall, curly-haired man who in the past looked fit and
young for his age, appeared drawn and thinner during the interview.
He said he had suffered a ''mini-stroke'' earlier this month, and
blamed it on the stress of the renewed public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Daily said he began attending annual reunions of the 7th U.S.
Cavalry Association and two other ''Cav'' groups in 1986. He said
fellow war veterans would sometimes, in brief conversations,
discuss the 1950 killings, without knowing the village's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''No Gun Ri was not known, at that bridge site, there was only
the mention of a large number of civilians killed under the bridge
site,'' Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he decided to respond to media queries about No Gun Ri
in 1998, Daily said he felt compassion for the Korean survivors who
were seeking the truth in the face of Pentagon denials that the No
Gun Ri killings could have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sympathetic with those people and what they had gone
through over their many years of suffering and pain,'' he told a
reporter. ''I thought it would be appropriate to talk to you about
No Gun Ri.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon investigators interviewed Daily about No Gun Ri in
early April. After his credibility then came under public
suspicion, a Pentagon spokesman said it would not affect the
overall investigation. ''Ed Daily is just one guy of many we've
been talking to,'' Maj. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday, Collins said the Army would have no comment
beyond saying that the inspector general's office remains
interested in re-interviewing Daily.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have been grappling with discrepancies in
fragmentary 50-year-old memories. Documents from the time also can
be fragmentary and ambiguous; none that has come to light mentions
the events at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's research in 1998 uncovered standing orders at the
warfront for U.S. troops to fire on civilian-clad Koreans, to guard
against disguised infiltrators. Investigators are trying to
determine which officers may have issued on-scene orders to fire on
refugees.

<HEADLINE> ABC Jumps From Third to First  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Led by ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC
has become the first network to bounce from third place to first in
the television ratings in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire'' supplanted NBC's ''ER'' as the most popular
program on television in the 1999-2000 season, even though it
didn't join ABC's regular lineup until January.
</P>
<P>
   The TV industry considered Wednesday the end of the season, with
the long summer rerun season beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had an average of 14.27 million viewers in prime-time this
year, a 20 percent increase over last year. CBS, last year's top
network, averaged 12.42 million viewers, down 6 percent. NBC's
12.34 million average was down 4 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had the biggest decline of the four major networks. Its
average prime-time audience of 8.97 million was down 17 percent
from the year before, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of professional wrestling, UPN saw a 36 percent
increase to 3.92 million prime-time viewers. The WB network,
suffering from the fickleness of teen-age viewers, was down 22
percent to 3.64 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''Millionaire'' clearly turned everyone's expectations
upside down, ABC executives tried to downplay the notion that their
schedule had little depth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking nothing away from 'Millionaire,' there are a lot of
other shows that helped get us to that position,'' said Lloyd
Braun, ABC entertainment co-chairman. ''We all look at this as a
really terrific and stable schedule that without question has been
enhanced by 'Millionaire.'''
</P>
<P>
   The three ''Millionaire'' editions were the three most popular
shows of the season. ''ER,'' which has won the season crown three
out of the last four years, finished fourth.

<HEADLINE> Govt. to Help Kids Avoid Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Government researchers said they expect more than
a million new skin cancer cases to be diagnosed this year and
announced a new campaign designed to keep children out of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the most
serious form of skin cancer, melanoma, could result in as many as
7,700 deaths this year.
</P>
<P>
   Public campaigns increasing awareness of skin cancer risks have
been effective in Australia, where extremely high skin cancer rates
have been falling, the CDC said Thursday. It hopes its new campaign
of upbeat, youth-oriented TV, radio and print ads will have the
same effect. The ads tell children and teens to use sunscreen, wear
wide-brim hats and avoid the midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people need to know that the risk of getting skin cancer
later can be greatly reduced if they start protecting their skin
from the sun now,'' CDC Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said. ''What you
do when you are eight, 10, 15 and 20 can make a big difference when
you're 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United
States. Unprotected skin can be harmed by ultraviolet rays in as
little as 15 minutes, yet it can take up to 12 hours for skin to
show the full effects of sun exposure, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Americans are aware of the dangers of sun
exposure, it is estimated that only one third take steps to protect
their skin.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Understands Skepticism  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton insisted she
wouldn't use a U.S. Senate seat as a steppingstone to the
presidency in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't blame people for being skeptical,'' the Democratic
Senate candidate said during a voter forum Thursday. ''I feel I owe
it to the people of New York to serve a six-year term.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have repeatedly charged that the first lady wants to
use the Senate as a springboard for a presidential run, if not in
2004, then in 2008. When pressed on what she would do if Democrats
pleaded with her to run in 2004, she said: ''That is not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also answered questions about how she would campaign
against her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, and about her
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would try to link Lazio to former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Clinton said ''I cannot speak for all my
supporters because certainly the facts are that he was closely
allied during those years ... with that leadership in the Congress,
and I think New Yorkers need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign aides have already branded the Long Island
congressman as a Gingrich lieutenant who embraced the former
speaker's ''Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who stepped into the race last week after New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani bowed out, has said he supported only those
parts of the contract he felt were good for New York, such as lower
taxes and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said she already has shown she can work with people
in Congress, even those who don't particularly like her.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing in the Senate is not ever to be insulted
by whatever anybody says about you ... (and) after what I've been
through for the last seven years, nothing they can say can possibly
hurt my feelings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the forum, a Republican asked Clinton: ''If
you were to die tonight, would you know if you would spend eternity
in heaven or hell?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was taken aback by the question but responded: ''I
consider myself like any person of faith to be doing the very best
I can. ... I cannot tell you where I will be. I can only hope and
pray that I will find favor in God's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady went on to say she did not believe ''that we
should be, in public life, be putting people in a position of
responding to questions that really focus more on one's personal
faith.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Nuke Contractors Fined  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The Energy Department has fined two
contractors at nuclear sites in Washington and Colorado a total of
$123,750 for failing to adequately protect workers exposed to
radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also cited a contractor at the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, but levied no fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtel Hanford, Inc., a contractor at the Hanford reservation
in south-central Washington, was fined $82,500 over a June 1999
incident in which three workers were exposed to airborne
radioactivity after they unwrapped a ''highly contaminated'' piece
of equipment, the DOE said.
</P>
<P>
   No signs were posted to warn of the hazard, and employees
continued to work in the area for about 13 days without protective
gear, though none appeared to have suffered any ill health effects,
the DOE said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released Thursday by Bechtel Hanford said the
company ''takes responsibility for this incident ... and agrees
with the conclusions from the DOE.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOE also ordered a fine of $41,250 against Kaiser-Hill Co.,
LLC, the main cleanup contractor at the former Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant outside Denver.
</P>
<P>
   It involved a February 1999 incident in which an employee
performing decontamination work received a dose of radioactivity
that entered his body through a cut on his finger, the DOE said. An
investigation revealed shortcomings in safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Greta Thomsen said the company would not contest the
fine. ''As a result of our corrective actions, we've greatly
improved our work controls and procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both fines were reduced because the companies took corrective
steps, the DOE said.
</P>
<P>
   International Isotopes Idaho, Inc., a subcontractor at INEEL in
southeastern Idaho, was cited but not fined after two workers were
exposed to a small amount of radioactivity while they were
replacing ventilation filters last July, the DOE said. They were
not harmed. Investigators determined the subcontractor failed to
adequately plan how to protect the workers.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Woman To Graduate H.S.  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Ky. (AP) -- Jacqui Fausz can't sit at a desk, write
her name or open a textbook. Her lungs depend on a ventilator and
her current home is a hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Fausz, who suffered a spinal aneurysm and
was paralyzed from the neck down four years ago, is set to graduate
with honors Saturday from Rockcastle County High School -- a school
she has never entered.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting,'' Fausz said Thursday, moments before heading
to school for graduation practice. ''I've never been there before,
so I don't really know what to expect. I can't wait to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, her lessons have been videotaped and she
does her homework with the help of a teacher's aide, Cindy Johnson,
who writes down every letter, number and punctuation mark that
comes from Fausz's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The two spent Thursday morning studying for her last exam, an
algebra final. As the two went over the problems, Johnson held up a
clipboard for Fausz, who told her what numbers to write down to
solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really remarkable,'' Johnson said. ''What most people
learn by scratching out on paper, she does in her mind and relays
to me. I'm not sure many people realize just how difficult that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about Fausz's life has been simple since the aneurysm
dislodged from the spinal wall as she prepared for classes at
Campbell County High School in Alexandria. At the time, she was a
sophomore honors student and played alto sax in the school's
marching band.
</P>
<P>
   As Fausz was getting ready to leave the house, she sneezed,
letting out a scream as pain shot down her neck. She managed to
make it to school and take a test before slumping on a drinking
fountain, unable to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awful, probably the worst day of my life,'' said
Fausz's mother, Joan, who plans to attend the graduation with
Jacqui's 10-year-old brother, Sean. ''She was struggling to breathe
and losing control of all her motor skills, and there was nothing I
could do for her. It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Fausz realized she would do no more
marching with the band or sitting at lunch giggling with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really hard to deal with at first,'' Fausz said. ''I've
always been very independent and had to have things my own way. Now
I'm having to rely on someone else, and that's been hard to get
used to. Learning to depend on and trust others has been the
toughest thing I've had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is in a hospital, her room is that of a typical
teen.
</P>
<P>
   Above her bed is a shelf packed with stuffed animals and a
Boston Red Sox baseball cap. Across from the bed hangs a poster of
two beagle puppies in a wicker basket near her ruby red graduation
gown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to write poetry and I love music, all kinds,'' she said
with a smile. Johnson laughs as she reminds Fausz that she also
likes pizza, Chinese food and PayDay candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   Her teachers, many of whom she's seen only on videotape, marvel
at her tenacity and intelligence. Her writing portfolio done for a
senior English class was one of only three in the school honored as
''distinguished.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a brilliant, brilliant writer,'' said Cathy Short, a
special needs teacher at the school. ''Her vocabulary is extremely
advanced, and she has a way of making you really feel what she is
trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she isn't sure what lies ahead of her, Fausz says she's
determined to follow her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people that are handicapped don't expect much out of
life, and I don't understand that,'' she said. ''Just because you
are different on the outside doesn't mean you are different on the
inside. I'm still the same person I was before. I just do things a
little differently now.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Elections Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Prolonging a bitter campaign that has
pitted rich against poor, Venezuela's highest court suspended this
weekend's presidential, congressional and regional elections,
citing glitches in the electronic balloting system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's delay gives President Hugo Chavez's main challenger,
a former state governor named Francisco Arias Cardenas, more time
to try to reduce the president's 15- to 20-point lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Tribunal of Justice suspended the balloting, citing
a lack of ''credibility and transparency'' because of the technical
difficulties. The court instructed the legislature to set a new
election date and prohibited campaigning until it is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans had been expected to elect more than 6,200 public
offices including president, congressmen, governors, mayors and
local councilmen. But problems with computer software needed to
tabulate votes and register more than 36,000 candidates jeopardized
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Thursday's decision was immediately felt in the
capital, Caracas, where dozens of protesters stood outside the
National Election Council chanting, ''We want to vote!'' and
''Gringos get out!'' -- a reference to U.S. election observers and a
U.S. company officials had blamed for the technical glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision touched off calls for investigations and
accusations of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I join the chorus of Venezuelans who ask for an inquiry to
find those responsible,'' Chavez said in a nationally televised
speech late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president called the court's decision ''wise'' and asked for
''calm and unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the congress, Luis Miquilena, was less
conciliatory. He said a special congressional commission would be
formed because ''someone is responsible for this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Attorney General Javier Elechiguerra told The Associated
Press an investigation was already under way. ''I believe this
isn't a casual act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tense electoral climate has divided the South American
nation like seldom before. Polls show the poor majority of
Venezuela's 23 million people support Chavez. The middle and upper
classes have flocked to Arias, a former army officer who helped
Chavez stage a failed 1992 coup attempt but who has broken away
from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials sought to place blame for the technical
difficulties in the so-called ''mega-elections.'' But international
monitors and civil rights groups welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a win-win because if the elections had gone forward it
would have been a 'mega-disaster,''' said Elias Santana, a member
of Queremos Eligir, one of the two groups that asked the high court
to stop Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Carter Center in Atlanta said the suspension
would result in greater transparency because it would allow for
voter education and testing of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement came a day after the U.S. Embassy in Caracas
protested the Venezuelan secret police's treatment of two Americans
trying to assist Venezuela in solving the technical problems. The
two, who work for Election System &AMP; Software, were forced to seek
refuge in the embassy after being subjected to verbal abuse and
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez and the head of the electoral council had earlier blamed
the Omaha, Neb.-based company for the technical problems, saying it
was part of an overall plan to ''destabilize'' the country's
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   ES&AMP;S denied that, saying changes by election authorities in
posting thousands of candidates were hindering the firm's work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Chavez took a less combative tone, saying there
would be time to ''determine responsibilities.'' He told foreign
reporters the balloting must be ''crystalline.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is apparently seeking to avoid the predicament of his
Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori, whose credibility has been
called into question by his refusal to delay this Sunday's
presidential runoff despite technical glitches and fraud
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   International observers said that while both South American
countries had experienced technical problems, Venezuelan officials
had restored credibility by postponing the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''One major difference is Peruvian officials decided to keep the
election date despite the call for delays from international
monitors,'' said Jennifer McCoy, director of the Carter Center's
Latin American center.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are required by a new constitution Chavez pushed
through last year that calls for most public offices to be
''re-legitimized.''

<HEADLINE> Virus has not turned up in bug, bird testing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The West Nile-like strain of
encephalitis has not yet left the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Experts just don't know where it's hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The virus carried by house mosquitoes that touched off a scare
last fall after killing seven New Yorkers and infecting birds in
Connecticut has made itself scarce so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, the virus, which in rare cases can cause deadly
inflammation of the brain, has been found in only a single hawk
that died in Westchester County, N.Y., and in a small number of
mosquitoes trapped at a single location in Queens, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is that we don't know where the virus is,'' Antonio
Garmendia, a veterinarian and associate professor in the department
of pathobiology at the University of Connecticut, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tests of 1,300 dead birds up and down the Atlantic
seaboard and expanded mosquito trapping throughout Connecticut and
the New York metropolitan area, there has been no trace of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   When the virus first appeared in the Western Hemisphere, it
felled hundreds of crows in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the exception of a single hawk, the virus has not been
detected in any bird anywhere in the United States'' this year,
said Theodore Andreadis, chief entomologist at the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, who oversees Connecticut's
mosquito-trapping program.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at a conference Wednesday at the experiment station,
said they were concerned about West Nile because of the apparent
new strain of it showed up in Queens, N.Y., last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Seven residents of the New York borough died of encephalitis,
and dozens more were infected. In Connecticut, the virus showed up
in mosquitoes and crows.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut and New York, several state agencies and
institutions are working together to find and test mosquitoes,
birds, and animals for the virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   The state Agriculture Department is working with veterinarians
to monitor sick farm animals. The mosquito and bird testing also
reveals presence of the more deadly but very rare Eastern equine
encephalitis, a virus documented in Stonington, Westerly, and other
Eastern Connecticut towns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a wonderful surveillance system. If that virus is
here, we are going to find it,'' said John Anderson, director of
the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.
</P>
<P>
   Richard French, a pathobiologist at UConn who directs infected
bird necropsies, said the virus hasn't acted the way scientists
feared it would.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last fall, it was predicted it would spread in migratory bird
populations,'' French said, ''and there's been no indication of
that. What we're waiting for now is to see where cases show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the experiment station is undergoing additional
security measures that will allow advanced research related to West
Nile and similar viruses.
</P>
<P>
   The station expects to receive approval shortly from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to boost its level 2 laboratory to an
even more secure level 3 facility.
</P>
<P>
   The additional security measures will virtually eliminate the
possibility of the virus escaping from the lab on Huntington
Avenue, station Director John F. Anderson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lab's first goals will be devising a test to detect
the virus in horses.
</P>
<P>
   The upgraded lab will be able to receive shipped samples
containing the virus and conduct advanced research using techniques
that require secure containment.

<HEADLINE> Five Die From E. Coli in Canada  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario (AP) -- An outbreak of E. coli caused by
contamination of the water supply has killed five people, and some
residents say a slow response from the local water utility worsened
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people in this southern Ontario town have been
sickened in the outbreak, Canada's worst ever, with more than 50
people showing up for treatment or follow-up visits for E coli
infection on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly victim died Thursday, said Dr. Murray McQuigge,
health officer of the Grey-Bruce region west of Toronto. The deaths
of a baby and three elderly adults were reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Signs on government buildings warned the 5,000 residents of this
town set in farm country 90 miles west of Toronto to boil water.
Cases of bottled water were distributed for free at the community
center.
</P>
<P>
   McQuigge and Mayor David Thomson of the Brockton municipality
that includes Walkerton said the situation might not have been so
bad had the local water utility notified health authorities after
detecting the potentially deadly germ in well water last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said the Public Utility Commission knew of the
contamination as early as May 18 but neglected to immediately
notify health authorities as it should have, delaying the municipal
response.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kieffer, chairman of the utility commission, said utility
workers may have been unaware of how dangerous E. coli could be.
The utility's general manager, Stan Koebelm could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Local school worker John Louther, said his family began boiling
its water after his 6-year-old son got sick on May 16, days before
the contamination became known publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had already heard some mumbling about the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McQuigge said the crisis evoked memories of an E. coli poisoning
from tainted hamburger meat at Jack-in-the-Box fast food
restaurants in Washington state. The 1993 outbreak killed four
people and sickened hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspect recent flooding caused by heavy rain may have
contaminated the town's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thomson said the chlorinating unit on one of the
two main wells pumping water had only been working sporadically. He
said a new unit that officials had ordered weeks earlier finally
arrived last week and was installed over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> SLA Soldiers Feel Betrayed by Israel  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Like many of his comrades, Jiryis
Faris feels betrayed by Israel's sudden withdrawal that left him
and other pro-Israeli militiamen at the mercy of their guerrilla
enemies and a government that considers them traitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis used us like human sandbags and dumped us once
they had no use for us,'' Faris, a Christian, said after
surrendering to Lebanese police. ''The Israelis are cowards. If I
could, I would join the Islamic resistance and fight the traitorous
Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, this kind of rhetoric would have been unheard
of. The Christian-led South Lebanon Army militia and the Islamic
Hezbollah have been bitter enemies since the Shiite Muslim militia
was formed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with south Lebanon free of Israeli troops and their militia
allies for the first time in 22 years, a new reality is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA collapsed early this week. Its leader, Antoine Lahd, was
in Paris. By the time Israel's last soldier left Lebanon on
Wednesday morning, the militia of 2,500 men had disintegrated.
Hundreds of militiamen surrendered to Lebanese authorities to stand
trial, while others fled to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and other guerrillas were quick to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Marjayoun residents woke up Wednesday to find the Israelis
gone, yellow Hezbollah flags already were fluttering over rooftops
and cars carrying women in Islamic veils were speeding down their
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas then began eradicating all traces of the Israeli
and SLA presence: taking down yellow road signs in Hebrew and
red-and-white traffic signs pointing to the militia's border
crossing, appropriating arms, ammunition and weapons the SLA left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas encouraged civilians to join in the looting. A
Hezbollah member said that apart from weapons, people were welcome
to take anything they could use.
</P>
<P>
   Jinan Fadel, a 15-year-old student, skipped school Wednesday to
do just that. She and her family drove six miles from the village
of Yohmor to Marjayoun and right up to the SLA barracks, hidden in
a dense circle of eucalyptus trees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Fadel said she ''hates to touch anything the
collaborators have touched,'' in a couple of hours the family van
was loaded with gray chairs, Formica desks and filing cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a Hezbollah fighter on crutches watched as fellow
guerrillas checked tanks, examined mortars and donned vests and
helmets abandoned by the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   While Marjayoun's Christian residents publicly welcome the
guerrillas, many say privately they want the government to both
convince the SLA militiamen who fled to Israel to return and show
leniency to those who have surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband is like the prodigal son who's returning to his
father,'' said Hilweh Shamoun, whose husband, Gaby, and father,
Youssef, surrendered to Lebanese police Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faris said that, like many SLA fighters, he joined the militia
four years ago because, after Israel set up its buffer zone, ''the
government abandoned us, didn't send us money, didn't help us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought out of hunger,'' said Faris, who could not find a
well-paying job in Marjayoun to support his wife and daughter. ''We
were forced to join Lahd in order to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no regrets,'' Faris said. ''I made a mistake and
learned a lesson: One shouldn't join the Zionists.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Eternity uncertain, but trying to live good life  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
says that while she is not certain where she will spend eternity,
she is trying to live a good life and hopes that ''will find favor
in God's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   A wide-ranging ''Voice of the Voter'' forum Thursday saw the
first lady facing questions about everything from whether she was
using her Senate run as a stepping stone for her own White House
bid to the appropriateness of linking new Senate rival Rick Lazio
to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the one about eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you were to die tonight, would you know if you would spend
eternity in heaven or hell?'' asked a Republican in the audience of
about 85 people in WXXI-TV's studio.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily taken aback, Clinton finally responded: ''I consider
myself a person of faith. I consider myself like any person of
faith to be doing the very best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that I will be someone who will live a life that is
worthy of my strong Methodism and my Christian faith and my
commitment to doing the very best I can as a human being to live up
to the example of our Lord and savior,'' she added. ''But I cannot
tell you where I will be. I can only hope and pray that I will find
favor in God's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the audience in silence, the first lady went on to say she
did not believe ''that we should be, in public life, putting people
in a position of responding to questions that really focus more on
one's personal faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions were more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to one, Clinton said she will not use the Senate seat
from New York, if she is elected, as a stepping stone to run for
president in 2004 -- even if party leaders ask her to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel I owe it to the people of New York to serve a six-year
term,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for the first time, Clinton said she understood
''there are skeptics. I don't blame people for being skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People will have to judge me and draw whatever conclusions
they want ... I'm committed to serving my six-year term,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on what she would do if Democrats pleaded with her to
run in 2004 if they lost the White House this year, she said:
''That is not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have repeatedly charged that the first lady wants to
use the New York Senate seat as a stepping stone for a presidential
run, if not in 2004, then in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Clinton said that while she wouldn't
personally try to link Lazio to Gingrich, ''I cannot speak for all
my supporters because certainly the facts are that he was closely
allied during those years ... with that leadership in the Congress,
and I think New Yorkers need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, campaign aides to the first lady have already been
bashing the Long Island congressman as a Gingrich lieutenant who
embraced the former speaker's ''Contract with America.'' Lazio, who
stepped into the race last Friday after New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani bowed out, has said he supported only those parts of the
contract he felt were good for New York such as lower taxes and a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one self-described conservative at the forum about how
she could work in the Senate given that she is such a polarizing
figure, Clinton said she has already shown she can work with people
in Congress who don't particularly like her. She cited her work
last year with Texas' Tom Delay -- ''someone who has never said a
good word in public about me or my husband'' -- on legislation
dealing with children aging out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing in the Senate is not ever to be insulted
by whatever anybody says about you ... (and) after what I've been
through for the last seven years, nothing they can say can possibly
hurt my feelings,'' she said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The questioners in the 1{-hour forum were part of a voter
awareness project sponsored by Rochester's WXXI Public
Broadcasting, WOKR-TV and the Rochester Democrat &AMP; Chronicle. The
questions were selected at random.

<HEADLINE> Pataki vetoes fire-safe cigarette bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki has vetoed a bill
mandating tobacco companies sell only self-extinguishing cigarettes
in New York starting in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message Thursday, the governor said it was ''highly
uncertain'' whether smokers would accept fire-safe versions of
their favorite brands.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the legislation had ''serious defects,'' including
no requirement that cigarettes meeting fire-safety standards not be
more dangerous to the health of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of federal fire safety standards for cigarettes also
creates ''significant, additional financial incentives for
cigarette bootleggers,'' but the bill does not provide money or the
legal tools like increased penalties to fight heightened
bootlegging activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature, which approved the Cigarette Fire Safety
Act in April, can either override the veto or work out an
alternative agreement with Pataki before it concludes its regular
2000 session next month. The governor urged the Legislature to try
drafting and passing an ''effective and comprehensive'' new bill
before the session ends.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican and his chamber's
sponsor of the legislation, said ''we have already begun
discussions on a new bill which we hope can be before the
Legislature in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly sponsor, Alexander Grannis of Manhattan, said an
override or a new deal are both ''real possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill vetoed by Pataki had called for the marketing of safer
cigarettes according to performance standards set by the state
Office of Fire Prevention and Control. Among the considerations in
those standards would be a cigarette's propensity to ignite
household furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure had argued that the long, continuous
burn of most American cigarettes too often leads to deadly fires
when they are left burning unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said Thursday the veto was ''concocted and contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   He said legislators had ''virtually signed off on alleged
technicalities'' with Pataki's office by noon Wednesday but were
later told to also accept the governor's proposed legislation for
tougher penalties against cigarette bootlegging.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis contended that legislators were not notified of the
''take-it-or-leave-it'' proposal until the last minute. He said
there was just no time to consider the enforcement provisions and
added that it was ''complicated'' and ''not related'' to the
fire-safe cigarette bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had given us no clue,'' Grannis said. ''I don't oppose
philosophically to the idea, but it didn't need to be linked to
fire-safe cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor told the
Legislature on Tuesday, not Wednesday, that he considered the
enforcement provisions crucial to his support of the fire-safe
cigarette bill and suggested that Grannis had not been kept
informed of the negotiations by state Assembly officials.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco groups also said they were disappointed by Pataki's
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision means the industry has dodged a big bullet once
again,'' said Russell Sciandra of the Center for Tobacco-Free New
York. ''Basically the governor has handed the tobacco industry a
license to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group
called Pataki's bootlegging measure a ''tangential'' issue that
made his veto more ''about legislative horse-trading and not about
the technical stuff of the (fire-safe cigarettes) bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the
company prefers to ''deal with this at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that a uniform standard is better than 50 potentially
conflicting state standards,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   He had said that there is no such thing as fire-safe cigarettes.
Rather, cigarettes were evaluated based on their ''reduced ignition
propensity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Philip Morris would continue to work on products
that are less likely to burn when left unattended. The company is
currently testing a new kind of banded cigarette paper that has
compounds at regular intervals that would induce a cigarette to
stop burning.

<HEADLINE> Bragman says he's still McCall's friend, but no longer his political backer </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall at
his side, deposed Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman said
Thursday he could not for the moment renew his support for McCall's
expected run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to be his friend, I will always be his friend ...
but after the events of last week Carl and I need to talk.''
Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman failed in his attempt that began last week to oust
Manhattan Democrat Sheldon Silver as state Assembly Speaker.
Bragman and his supporters hoped McCall would aid their effort, but
the comptroller stayed out of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have disappointed Mike Bragman. I have disappointed many of
his followers,'' McCall told a news conference at Bragman's annual
fund-raising clambake.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said, ''Now we must move on from that ... I hope people
are willing to continue to support me. Those who were disappointed,
I hope they will forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman refused to gloss over his differences with McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're all too smart for Carl and I to stand here tonight and
have us say to you everything is as it was before,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bragman did turn out supporters at his clambake
including at least a dozen Assembly members who backed his
attempted coup. Even one assembly member who had voted against
Bragman in the leadership fight, state assemblyman Edward Sullivan
of Manhattan, showed up. Sullivan refused to discuss why he had
come to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Also showing up for the clambake was state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer, who called McCall ''a great leader for all of New
York state. I'm proud to be a friend of his, proud to be associated
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton was also at the
event, giving Bragman a kiss on the cheek as she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been hearing about this clambake since I first laid
oyes on Mike Bragman,'' Clinton told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's 14th annual fund-raiser has become a must-attend event
in recent years for New York politicians, and spokesman Dan Weiler
had predicted that the unsuccessful coup attempt wouldn't affect
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything, more people might come. It's certainly not going
to be negative.'' Weiler said before the event.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver, who attended last year's clambake, would not be on
hand this year ''for obvious reasons,'' spokeswoman Patricia Lynch
said before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Silver stripped Bragman of his majority leader's position when
Bragman went public on May 17 with his challenge to Silver.
Democrats voted overwhelmingly five days later to stay with Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the event attracted ''thousands'' of people and raked
in ''well over $300,000'' for Bragman, Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to invited political guests, more than 3,000 tickets
priced at $175 apiece were sold this year, with parties of 10
people getting a discount at $1,500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 clams were prepared for the event, and dishes
included steamed clams, raw clams served on half shells, fried
clams and clam chowder, said Vicky Hinerwadel, president of
Hinerwadel's Grove, where the fund-raiser was held.

<HEADLINE> Fiscal group says state could do more to lighten prison load  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State prison officials say they are doing as
much as they legally can to curtail prison terms through parole,
shock camps and drug treatment while still protecting public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Correctional Services was responding to a
report out Thursday from fiscal watchdog group Citizens Budget
Commission saying the state could trim $96 million -- 4 percent --
from its $2.3 billion prison budget and improve public safety if it
eliminated ''unnecessary and sometimes counterproductive''
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to say you can run the prison system smarter by
offering alternatives,'' Citizens Budget Commission spokesman
Charles Brecher said.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimated potential savings in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
   --$65 million if nonviolent drug offenders were offered prison
alternatives like drug treatment or shock camp after one year. Many
are in prisons at least two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   --$20 million if electronically monitored house arrests were
substituted for prison for the last six months of sentencing for
nonviolent property crimes like burglary without intent to harm and
cemetery desecration.
</P>
<P>
   --$11 million by cutting by two months prison time served by
parolees convicted of violent crimes, and employing electronically
monitored house arrest and stricter parole supervision. Citizens
Budget Commission also said this could improve public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said inmates 50 years or older may be good
candidates for alternate sanctions like home confinement or
intensive parole since studies suggest criminal activity declines
with age.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission admitted its cost calculations
are ''necessarily highly speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau noted that 26,000
inmates are already in shock or alternate treatment programs or
have had their sentences shortened for participating in them. He
said corrections officials believe trustworthy nonviolent inmates
in the system are already taking advantage of programs to shorten
sentences and that the Citizens Budget Commission is advocating
that prisoners who would pose a risk to the public inappropriately
now be included.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who are the inmates they are talking about?'' he asked.
''Violent inmates ... people who already flunked out (of
treatment)?''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that there is $20 million available in savings
involving the nonviolent property crimes described by the group
because virtually all of those offenders are sent to local jails,
not state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau also said that the department would have to be directed
by Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature to make some of the
changes the group suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''There certainly is some expansion (Corrections) can do without
authority,'' Brecher said. ''But it certainly would be better to
have everybody on board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission also recommended expanding what
it said was a 19-person agency with a $1 million budget in
Corrections and directing it to come up with new alternatives to
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau, however, said the Division of Program Planning,
Research and Development is sufficient, though he could not confirm
how many people work there.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the 68-year-old Citizens Budget
Commission, which has criticized the state budget process in the
past, has analyzed criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The report adds a new argument -- cost -- to growing complaints
about the Rockefeller Drug Laws. Often those laws have been called
too harsh on moral or philosophical grounds by groups as diverse as
the state's Roman Catholic bishops to the top judges in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Budget Commission blamed a rise in imprisonment on
policies like the Rockefeller Drug Laws and Jenna's Law, which
effectively ended parole for a person convicted of one violent
crime. The report suggested those laws are based on emotional or
political reasoning instead of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Grieshaber, whose daughter's murder by a parolee spurred
Jenna's Law, was not impressed with the Citizens Budget
Commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to weigh dollars and people, in my opinion people
win,'' she said. ''Nicholas Pryor saw his parole officer at 3 and
murdered my daughter at 6 p.m. so I don't know how you can use cost
in this particular case.''

<HEADLINE> Law enforcement agencies unite to take on ''cybercriminals'' By CAROLYN THOMPSON </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Law enforcement agencies are taking a
''fight fire with fire'' approach to cybercrime with the creation
of a comprehensive Web site through which they can share experts,
compare notes and learn the tricks of the newest criminal trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question the Internet can be an invaluable
positive force in our economy, education and community,'' Debra
Cohn, bureau chief of the state Attorney General's criminal
division, said Thursday. ''At the same time, it provides a new
forum for those who prey on our citizens and our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The new CyberCrime Initiative pools the resources of federal,
state and local law enforcement agencies to focus on four major
areas of Internet crime: child pornography, harassment/hate mail,
hackers and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Open to any law enforcement agency in the 18 westernmost
counties of New York, southern Ontario and beyond, participation
gives members access to a Web site unavailable to the general
public. There, they will find local experts, investigative
techniques for specific crimes, applicable statutes, forms which
can be downloaded to speed the process of obtaining court orders
and definitions of computer terms.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 agencies have been invited to join.
</P>
<P>
   ''This provides human resources behind the information as
opposed to just a raw database to collect information,'' said
assistant U.S. Attorney Martin Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet offering criminals an inexpensive and
potentially anonymous way to commit crime, cybercrime presents the
biggest challenge to the FBI today, said Bernard Tolbert,
special-agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo office.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a different type of crime and it's fast moving,''
Tolbert said. ''If we start an investigation at nine o'clock this
morning, by three o'clock this afternoon a lot of the circumstances
have changed. This type of effort gives us the opportunity to
immediately reach out to people across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing resources allowed agencies around the world to spread
word of the recent ''Love Bug,'' Tolbert said, and has already
helped in local cases involving child pornography, the theft of
computer software and the illegal programming of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web site is secure, law enforcement officials said
they will be careful about posting extremely sensitive information,
such as suspects' names.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they can hack into the FBI site and the White House site,
which we've seen over the last year, we're certainly not going to
tell you that it cannot possibly be hacked,'' Littlefield said.
''On the other hand, it's as secure as we deem necessary.''

<HEADLINE> China's Human Rights Record Eyed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If China gains permanent normal trading status
with the United States, it could come at a price for Beijing:
closer scrutiny of its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill as sent to the Senate would end annual review of
China's trade status but would set up a new combined congressional
and executive branch commission to pass yearly judgment on China's
performance on such issues as abortion, religious freedom and
treatment of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say it would operate much like the U.S. Helsinki
Commission, which has no legislative power and has had little
impact in recent years but has claimed success since the mid-1970s
in helping improve human rights in the former Soviet bloc nations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chairman of the Helsinki panel, who opposes the
China trade bill, insists a China commission would be far less
effective than his panel ever was.
</P>
<P>
   China, while praising House passage of the trade bill this week,
rejected the idea of a commission, saying Americans should stick to
building strong economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese government strongly opposes any use of human
rights and other issues as an excuse to interfere in China's
internal affairs or to damage China's interests,'' Foreign Trade
Ministry spokesmen Hu Chusheng said in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China has had a similar reaction to other U.S. efforts to change
its behavior, including strong criticism in the State Department's
annual reports on human rights abuses around the world and recent
condemnation by the new U.S. Commission on International Religious
Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those efforts, the new commission would be focused solely
on abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected easily to approve China's permanent trade
status following a 237-197 House vote Wednesday. But the commission
provision so far is not in the Senate bill. If the Senate doesn't
approve it, the final details would have to be negotiated between
the House and Senate before the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The China commission would include 18 members of Congress from
both parties and five high-level representatives of the State
Department and other agencies. The Helsinki Commission has the same
number of senators and representatives but only three
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., proposed
the China commission as a way of attracting more votes from House
members, mostly Democrats, who did not want to lose the leverage
provided by an annual review of Beijing's trading status.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional review invariably resulted in approval of
normal trading status one year at a time, but it provided a
high-profile, annual forum for congressional criticism of China's
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the China commission, which would be required to make
annual reports to Congress, would go even further, recommending
legislation or punitive actions to be taken against China, possibly
including U.S. votes against loans before the International
Monetary Fund or the World Bank or direct controls on exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will add external pressure to the internal pressures'' from
Chinese dissidents, said Levin. Bereuter said the commission would
be preferable to the annual ''ineffective harangue'' against
Beijing that has dominated the China trade debate for the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents have maintained that freer trade will itself improve
China's performance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Chinese membership in the World Trade
Organization and normalized trade ''will strengthen those who fight
for the environment, for labor standards, for human rights, for the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations against the communist regime have ranged from
general suppression of democracy to fostering trade in human
organs. Other issues that could come before the new commission, if
it is formed, include religious persecution, political and
religious suppression of Tibet, jailing of political dissidents,
mistreatment of labor, forced abortions and denial of basic
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics believe that another powerless commission will do
little and it will now be harder to press China on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., chairman of the Helsinki Commission,
said a China panel would be ineffective because it would have no
participation and no commitment from China or any other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a strong proponent of
open trade with China, said a China commission might be useful
because it would closely track expected improvements in China's
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope over time to see a major improvement in trade, in
relations,'' Tom Donahue, chamber president, said.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions added to the House bill that are not yet in the
Senate version would provide $99 million to boost U.S. government
broadcasts into China and to provide protection to U.S. companies
against surges in Chinese exports.

<HEADLINE> Suriname Hits Polls Amid Confusion  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Hoping to improve their shattered
economy, Surinamese voted in early elections that went peacefully
despite confusion that left hundreds of names off voting lists.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who waited in long lines were allowed to continue
entering the polls Thursday if they were at the stations by closing
time.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition headed by President Jules Wijdenbosch, a
Dutch-trained political scientist, had been trailing former
president Ronald Venetiaan's New Front coalition in pre-election
polls. Also running was a coalition led by former dictator Desi
Bouterse, 55, convicted in the Netherlands of cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Results were expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Wijdenbosch moved the elections for two national assemblies and
local offices up by one year, amid 1999 street protests that
demanded his resignation over a huge plunge in the value of the
country's currency and high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of dealmaking in Parliament, delegates will select
a president -- a process that could take a month, election officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Wijdenbosch, 60, has pushed to improve the South American
nation's infrastructure. Critics in the New Front coalition argued
those expenditures have come at the expense of health and
education. Suriname's per capita income is about $1,240, and
unemployment runs at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations have identified
Suriname as an increasing transit point for drug trafficking to
European and U.S. markets, gun smuggling and money laundering.
Bouterse denies involvement, and Wijdenbosch refused to extradite
Bouterse to the Netherlands for trial.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Fading Away  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could this really be the end? No more tawdry
testimony from Linda Tripp, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones or
Kathleen Willey? Just Bill Clinton tending to his legacy and trying
to hang onto his law license?
</P>
<P>
   Five years after Lewinsky as a White House intern first caught
the president's eye, two years after an unsuspecting nation awoke
to news of their affair, 15 months after Clinton shook off
impeachment, The Scandal That Wouldn't Die is fading away.
</P>
<P>
   It is ending as it began, with Tripp and her secretly recorded
tell-all tapes of Lewinsky. The state of Maryland dropped its
wiretapping charges against Tripp on Wednesday, assuring that she
may be remembered as a snitch, but not a felon.
</P>
<P>
   That eliminated any likelihood of Lewinsky being called to
rehash her all-too-intimate story in open court while Clinton still
occupies the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared oblivious to the moment's passing, dancing and
basking in the spotlight at a gala Wednesday night that raised a
record $26.5 million for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he said in 1992 he was the Comeback Kid, little did we
know he was the all-time Comeback Kid,'' said Robert Lichter,
president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonprofit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has settled into a job approval rating of around 60
percent, not bad for just the third president ever to be impeached.
But only about a fourth of Americans say he can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lewinsky is peddling purses on the Internet, Tripp is
suing her employers at the Pentagon and Willey, who accused Clinton
of making an unwanted sexual advance, has filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, booted out as House speaker largely because
Republican troops felt he mishandled their Lewinsky strategy, is
consulting and raising GOP cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr has resigned as independent counsel, although his
successor, Robert Ray, hasn't ruled out the possibility of
indicting Clinton after the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus has largely shifted to another Clinton -- first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her run for a Senate seat in New
York -- and to the contest to determine the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for People and
the Press, predicted Americans will remember the Lewinsky matter as
''a blotch on some very good times'' -- an episode best forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''Watergate had a concluding chapter with Nixon leaving town. It
sort of got resolved,'' Kohut said. ''This got resolved in the
sense that Clinton continued in office but there's no basic sense
of coming to terms with what happened and why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no clear-cut ending,'' he said. ''It kind of dribbled
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even comedian Jay Leno managed only one Lewinsky-related joke in
a recent roast of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But a few footnotes remain: the Arkansas legal system is
wrestling with whether to take Clinton's law license away for
denying an affair with Lewinsky under oath. Its disciplinary
committee recommended disbarment this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that will impact on her lawsuit against the Pentagon,
Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized two Pentagon aides who
in 1998 released data from Tripp's personnel file that called her
credibility into question. Tripp's suit claims the release violated
her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tripp's secret tapings will be rewound for another
airing rests largely in the hands of Ray, the career prosecutor who
took over Starr's battle-scarred independent counsel office.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, the country will have moved on with a new
chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Pirates 5  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tony Womack extended his hitting streak to 20
games, the longest in the majors this year, with a go-ahead double
in the sixth inning as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates 7-5 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona swept the three-game series and extended hits
franchise-record home winning streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (2-5) won for the first time in four starts since May
8 despite allowing three runs, six hits, four walks and a hit
batter in six innings. He gave up a three-run homer to Bruce Aven
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei pitched the ninth for his first save this year. He
has spent most of the year on the disabled list with biceps
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-all in the sixth, Damian Miller and
pinch-hitter Hanley Frias singled off Kris Benson (4-5), and Womack
doubled down the right-field line. A throwing error by Aven in
right made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young had an RBI single in the seventh, but Arizona added
a pair of runs in the bottom half on Steve Finley's second
run-scoring single, which tied him with Sammy Sosa for the NL RBIs
lead at 48, and Andy Fox's run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Giles had a run-scoring double in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Daal survived bases-loaded situations in the first and fourth,
retiring Aven and Mike Benjamin on inning-ending flyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Arizona's right fielder, also robbed Benjamin in the first,
racing to right center and sliding into the fence as he caught the
ball for the first out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who had allowed just one earned run in 22 innings coming
in, fell behind 2-0 in the first when Luis Gonzalez hit an RBI
single and Finley doubled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo's RBI single made it 3-0 in the third, but the
Pirates tied it in the fifth on Aven's homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Players from Texas, the No. 2 seed in an NCAA regional that
begins Friday at Arizona State, watched the Diamondbacks take
batting practice and toured their locker room as guests of reliever
Greg Swindell, who helped Texas reach the College World Series
twice. ... The Diamondbacks are 11-3-1 in series this season; the
Pirates 5-10. ... Kendall has reached base in 41 of his 42 starts
at catcher.

<HEADLINE> Five Slain at NYC Restaurant  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police with bloodhounds searched Thursday for
two gunmen who walked into a Wendy's at closing time, forced seven
workers into a walk-in refrigerator and shot each in the head
before robbing the restaurant. Five of the workers died.
</P>
<P>
   Police want to question a former Wendy's employee arrested for a
robbery at another fast-food restaurant last year, a police
investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press. The investigator said a woman at a nearby bus
stop told police she saw two men leaving the Wendy's, and she
picked the former employee's picture out of a photo line-up.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, it was closing time Wednesday when the
gunmen walked into the restaurant in a retail area not far from
Shea Stadium, where the Mets play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The two men asked for the manager by name, then went to his
basement office. The manager then used an intercom to summon six
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen ordered the six men and one woman into a walk-in
refrigerator, then bound and gagged them, told them to lie face
down, and shot them, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. Four
died at the scene, the other died on the way to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most callous, worst crime that I've seen in a long
time,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors -- identified by police as Patrick Castro, 23,
and Joaquione Johnson, 18 -- were able to partially free themselves
and get to a basement telephone to call police. Castro, who was
shot through both cheeks, helped Johnson upstairs as police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was released and was to be placed under police
protection. Johnson remained hospitalized in critical condition
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's brother said the shooters' intention was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''They killed them all execution style,'' Kevin Johnson said.
''Everybody that was there got shot in the face, or shot in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe robbery was the motive, and Safir said one or
more of the employees knew the suspects. The police investigator
said police believe up to $2,000 in cash was stolen, along with a
videotape from the restaurant's security equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Choe, senior vice president for Wendy's operations, said the
restaurant had never been robbed in its two years at that location.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, hundreds of people jammed sidewalks
opposite the Wendy's restaurant on Main Street in the borough of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt sorry. It's my co-workers. I just left them last
night,'' said Olga Purdie. ''We work together as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed were identified by police as Ramon
Nazario, 44; Anita C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Mele Ryan, 18; Ali Ibadat,
40; and Jean Aguste, 27.

<HEADLINE> Bush Appeals For Minority Support  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under a sweltering Texas sun, George W. Bush
posed with South African President Thabo Mbeki and, an hour later,
former Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   As camera shutters clicked, the GOP presidential contender
promoted U.S.-South Africa relations and volunteerism, while
getting an added visual political payoff by rubbing shoulders with
two prominent black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Al Gore among black voters, Bush and his campaign are
making a concerted effort to court minorities by surrounding the
governor with a sea of brown and black faces. In Detroit this week,
it was a row of inner-city school children.
</P>
<P>
   Often the appeal is put into words, such as when the Texas
governor says he wants to improve schools so minority and immigrant
children can lead a prosperous life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I reject the soft bigotry of low expectations,'' Bush tells
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the appeal is reinforced with imagery, usually by
having Bush photographed with blacks or other minorities at
campaign events. In many cases, they end up positioned near the
candidate, in full view of the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fairly common. My wife used to be a photographer for a
school district, and she always tried to get a full representation
of the population into the frame,'' said Charles Bullock, an expert
on minority politics who teaches political science at the
University of Georgia. Analysts have said Bush's outreach to
minorities makes him a more appealing figure to moderates, white
suburban voters -- especially women -- and independents he will need
to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Republicans in the past probably paid less attention
to it, but both George Bush and his brother (Florida Gov. Jeb Bush)
have emphasized their interest and ability to bring minorities into
the coalition, something Republicans have not been able to do,''
Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman acknowledged the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush does believe it's important that he send a
signal that he wants to lead an inclusive Republican Party, a party
that does nationally what he does in Texas, where he welcomed
Hispanics and other minorities and new Americans into the party,''
said campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Bush first ran for governor, he ended up defeating
the Democratic incumbent, Ann Richards, with support from 15
percent of black voters and 28 percent of Hispanic voters, based on
exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Bush defeated Democrat Gary Mauro for re-election,
exit polls showed Bush was supported by 27 percent of black voters
-- an improvement of 12 percentage points. Among Hispanics, he got
almost half of the vote -- an improvement of 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls taken during the primary season showed Gore doing
especially well among black voters, as is common for Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gore flavors his audiences and backdrops with
minorities, a subtle attempt to shore up his political base. The
vice president also named a black campaign manager, Donna Brazile,
which some analysts described as another appeal to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, the political science professor, said Bush's minority
outreach is a necessity not only for today, but the future of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking on down the road, with the growth of the Hispanic
population, if the Republicans were to become the white-Anglo
party, they would have a slim chance of winning nationally. They
can't let the Democrats claim all that vote for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's effort to court minorities -- and stand among them -- has
been a constant throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In February, during the height of the controversy over Bush's
speech at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a school that
until recently banned interracial dating, 17-year-old Shannon
McClary was plucked out of the crowd and given a seat behind the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   One of only two blacks on the stage that night in Gaffney, S.C.,
McClary said later that she had been waiting for friends to arrive
when a Bush aide approached and offered her the prime seat.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the images have continued: Bush in Detroit, sitting
with a row of black school children, a day later in Texas, standing
beside Mbeki and Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The South African president stopped by the Texas Governor's
Mansion as part of an official visit to the United States. Powell
came a short time later to witness Bush pledge his state's support
for volunteerism, a pet issue of Powell.
</P>
<P>
   As the general spoke, two Hispanic children stood next to Bush.
All the while, the shutters clicked and the videocameras rolled.

<HEADLINE> Dem Leaders Unfazed by Gore Polls  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore met with Democratic leaders from
around the country and reassured them his campaign has a winning
strategy against George W. Bush. Several of the Democrats said they
were comfortable after their pep rally and strategy session that
Gore's lagging poll numbers aren't a serious problem -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   The likely presidential nominee told supporters at a $1 million
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser Thursday night that he
expects ''a good healthy, hard fight ahead of us and we're going to
win it. And we're going to win it solidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party,
made an analogy that Democratic women use from time to time when
talking about Bush, the likely Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush is so new (to the national audience) and he's a nice guy,
but he's one of those guys you want to go out and date in
college,'' said Malcolm, a former Republican. ''You know you'll
have a good time, but he's not who anybody wants to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   She was one of 72 party leaders from 34 states, Puerto Rico and
''Democrats abroad'' who spent Thursday in Nashville for a pep
rally/strategy meeting with the campaign staff of Gore, who trails
Bush in key states and by 5 to 10 points in national polls. Party
officials say the meeting was planned long before Gore dropped
behind in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer said Gore was
relaxed and joked with them, appearing to be satisfied with the
low-key campaign since he sealed the nomination in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing was said about ramping it up. Nobody is unhappy with
the pace of the campaign. He's happy with the pace of the
campaign,'' Brewer said. ''Anything we do now is just background
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were echoed by the four party leaders from other
key states -- Florida, Texas, Tennessee and Washington -- Gore's
campaign staff brought to reporters, who were not allowed to attend
the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter whether he gets (his message) across or not
now. It will matter after the convention. It will matter after
Labor Day,'' said Paul Berendt, Washington's party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
said: ''We're going to be moving ahead in these polls, and the most
important poll is in November. We're right on the issues. We've got
the best candidate. If we can get our message across, we're going
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He then flew to Memphis to spend the night with science teacher
Sylvestre Spann before heading to Cordova School today. There he
was expected to participate in the school's field day -- where
children compete in athletic contests.
</P>
<P>
   During Gore's Nashville visit, he proposed a tax credit to help
enroll young people in after-school programs. He also said he wants
every school to stay open late and for the government to
''dramatically'' increase funding for the school-based 21st Century
Learning Centers that help communities provide programs after
school and during summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schools shouldn't close their doors when children need them
the most,'' Gore told about 100 parents, children and employees
gathered in a gym at the Donelson-Hermitage YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of 10 households, he said, both parents work all day.
At least 5 million children are left unsupervised at home after
school each week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president repeated a Justice Department finding that
youngsters are most at risk of being victimized by crime or drugs
after school -- between the hours of 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''No policy proposal can teach a child right from wrong,'' Gore
said. ''But we can make it easier, not harder, to be a strong
family.''

Kennedy Assassin Demands New Trial
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawyers for convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan demanded a
new trial in federal court Thursday, one day after the California Supreme Court
rejected a similar request. In a petition nearly 300 pages long, Sirhan's
attorney said his client was innocent of the 1968 slaying of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, who was fatally shot moments after declaring victory in the California
presidential primary. The petition, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks a new
evidentiary hearing and ultimately a new trial. It contends police substituted
another bullet for the one recovered from Kennedy's neck.

<HEADLINE> Gore Facing Third Party Challenger  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore was once seen as the clear beneficiary
of a third-party candidate entering the presidential race, but not
any more.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is considerably murkier now that Gore faces a
challenge from the left.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who bolted the Republican Party last year, has yet
to demonstrate he will seriously hamper George W. Bush's
presidential chances. And there's scattered evidence that Ralph
Nader, the veteran consumer advocate, could be troublesome for
Gore, especially in Western states the Democrat will need to put
together a winning electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   Recent poll numbers suggest Nader getting as much support as
Buchanan nationally, and slightly better in some Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking anybody's vote for granted, but we're not
quaking in our boots at the prospects of Ralph Nader's candidacy,''
said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists say they have embraced the Green Party
candidate as a protest against the Clinton-Gore administration for
being too quick to compromise on environmental issues. And some of
the biggest environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters, though leaning toward Gore, haven't
officially declared. Democratic-leaning critics of the China trade
deal also have mentioned Nader as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   An Oregon poll showed Gore and Bush essentially tied for the
lead, with Nader at 7 percent and Buchanan at 2 percent. Gore and
Bush are close in Washington state, too, where a strong showing by
Nader could tip the balance. California polls haven't tested Nader
recently, but he was in low single digits prior to the primary and
got the support of just over 1 percent in the open voting.
</P>
<P>
   All three of those states voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs the states of the far West and Northeast to build up
enough electoral votes to counter Bush's strength in the Southern
and Rocky Mountain states. Then they would battle for the
presidency in the Midwest and competitive Eastern states like
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   National polls have shown Nader at 4 percent to 5 percent, about
the same as Buchanan. National pollsters say Nader's support comes
from those who would back Gore and from those who wouldn't vote.
Buchanan's support has been harder to track, though evidence is
that much of it comes from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nader nor Buchanan is close to the 15 percent threshold
set by the Commission on Presidential Debates for inclusion in the
televised face-offs this fall. Gore has said he has ''an open
mind'' about including Buchanan, who might create problems for
Bush. Including Nader might be another story.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a longtime conservative voice in the GOP, lost some of
his conservative base when he left the party to run for the Reform
Party nomination. And that could reduce the threat to Bush. Ross
Perot won 19 percent of the general election vote in 1992 and 8
percent in 1996, showings generally seen as damaging to the
Republican candidates, President Bush and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ''At about this time in a campaign, candidates like (Nader) get
higher ratings than later in the game,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press.
''People aren't really serious about casting their ballot. They're
toying with choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran pollsters aren't yet convinced Nader will be the
cause of big problems for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore could benefit from the contrast with the liberal Nader,
making Gore seem more centrist, suggested ABC News pollster Gary
Langer.
</P>
<P>
   -- If Gore is endangered by Nader in the far West, chances are
his campaign is in trouble elsewhere in the nation like the crucial
Midwest, suggested Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who does the
NBC-Wall Street Journal poll with Republican Bob Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Colorado pollster Paul Talmey says he doesn't detect Nader
catching on there yet.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential is there for Nader to cause mischief for Gore
in the West, said former New Mexico Democratic chairman Earl
Potter, who adds he thinks that won't happen because Gore has a
strong environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's legitimate to raise the question in New Mexico,'' Potter
said. ''The Green Party was a major factor in the governor's race
six years ago, and in a special congressional election (in 1998)
when they pulled over 10 percent. It cost us both those races.''

<HEADLINE> Monitoring of Los Alamos Lab Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Environmentalists are demanding an
independent analysis and regular monitoring of radiation levels on
the fire-ravaged land around Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A federal air-monitoring team last week reported elevated
background radiation levels, which it said would be normal when
vegetation burns. But the levels, in some cases 2 to 10 times
higher than normal, triggered concern among some New Mexico
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're calling for an independent citizens review board to
assess the monitoring data and risks, and we want a long-term
health study of people exposed to the smoke,'' Suzanne Westerly,
director of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety in Santa Fe, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear and atmospheric scientist Sergei Pashchenko, a
consultant to a non-governmental group which works to ban weapons
containing depleted uranium, said he analyzed the limited data
available on the lab's Internet site and determined it could not be
discounted as naturally occurring effects of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Lab spokesman Kevin Roark had no comment on the claims but said
he wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time we put out data, the activist groups dispute it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfires burned more than 48,000 acres and destroyed more
than 200 homes near the labs in northern New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Abortion rights group endorses Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio's Senate campaign defended him
against accusations that he is not a dependable supporter of
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is, has been, and will continue to be solidly pro-choice,''
Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said Thursday. ''However, like
most New Yorkers, including former Mayor Ed Koch and Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, Lazio opposes partial birth abortion. This is a
mainstream New York position.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a Republican from Long Island, is running against Hillary
Rodham Clinton to fill Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Clinton won an important endorsement from the
National Abortion Rights Action League of New York, which accused
Lazio of falsely portraying himself as pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is appalling. He's running around this state calling
himself pro-choice. Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said
Kelli Conlin, director of NARAL-NY.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opposing partial-birth abortion, Lazio has
routinely voted against government funding for abortions. Public
funding can affect the choices available to poor women who rely on
Medicaid, women in prison and women in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you examine Rick Lazio's voting record, you will see a
consistent pattern of voting against reproductive rights,'' Conlin
said Thursday at a morning news conference with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   McLagan insisted Lazio has a good record on abortion, and added,
''The votes tell the story.'' But of the seven votes the Lazio
campaign chose to highlight, four of them concerned contraception
or RU-486, an abortion-inducing drug.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters, meanwhile, released their own lists
highlighting anti-abortion votes Lazio has made, including a vote
to ban abortions at overseas military hospitals even if the patient
pays for the procedure herself.
</P>
<P>
   But while NARAL accused the congressman of being anti-abortion,
the Right to Life Party said his position isn't nearly good enough
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio is pro-abortion -- he can't get around it, it
doesn't matter what NARAL says,'' said Ken Diem, chairman of the
Right to Life Party, which intends to run its own Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL had refused to make an endorsement in the race until now
because the previous GOP candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was as
strong on abortion rights as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''NARAL-NY is passionately nonpartisan,'' Conlin said. ''We will
promote and defend pro-choice Republican candidates everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she ''respected and appreciated'' NARAL's refusal
to endorse her before.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes it even more gratifying to me that, now that the
issue contrast could not be clearer ... you would give me such
strong support,'' Clinton said. ''I intend to be a vote and a voice
and an advocate. This is an issue I care deeply about.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will be able to trust me to always stand up for a woman's
right to choose,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reiterated a pledge she made back in February to
withhold support from any Supreme Court nominee who opposes
abortion. Several vacancies are expected on the high court during
the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Conlin said NARAL had not yet decided what to spend on behalf of
Clinton's campaign, but she noted that NARAL spent ''hundreds of
thousands'' of dollars supporting Chuck Schumer's Senate campaign
in 1998 against the incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion was a pivotal issue in that race, with Schumer accusing
D'Amato of trying to conceal his anti-abortion views. Just days
before the election, a Buffalo abortion doctor was murdered by an
anti-abortion sniper. Voter exit polls showed women preferred
Schumer by a 3 to 2 margin.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Repeal Phone Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may amount to a tax cut of only $24 a year
for the average phone user, but Congress is rushing to repeal a
102-year-old tax that supporters call an outdated and unnecessary
hindrance to Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not only outlived its purpose, it's a classic example of
bad tax policy,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 420-2 Thursday to repeal the 3 percent federal
excise tax, which traces its origins to an 1898 law enacted to
finance the Spanish-American War when telephones were a novel
luxury enjoyed by fewer than 1,500 households.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling another vintage tax Thursday, the House Ways and Means
Committee approved a bill to phase out inheritance taxes, which
date to 1916. That bill is expected to reach the House floor in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the phone tax affects approximately 252 million telephone
lines, including those connected to cellular phones, fax machines
and computer modems. Democrats and Republicans who are jockeying to
be viewed as technology-friendly agreed it was time to use a
portion of the projected budget surplus to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   A person who spends $69 a month on local and long-distance calls
-- the average for residential service according to one consumer
survey -- pays about $24 a year for this tax. If that person also
has a $30 monthly wireless bill, the total tax is around $34 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would phase out the tax in three steps, with full
repeal coming Oct. 1, 2002, at a cost to the government of $20
billion over five years. Reps. Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.,
and John Murtha, D-Pa., voted against the measure, which now goes
to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said the
Senate version currently has 29 co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports the concept of a repeal but
has expressed reservations about its cost. President Clinton has
not threatened a veto, though.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1-cent telephone tax imposed in 1898 was repealed
in 1902, brought back to pay for World War I, repealed again in
1924 and then resurrected during the Depression in 1932. The tax
rate has gone up and down over the years, been targeted for
phase-out and then made permanent in 1990 to help reduce the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican-led Congress has made tax cuts a
priority this election year, the phone tax repeal gained bipartisan
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of this year's major tax cuts have passed the
Senate, but House Republicans say they're accomplishing their main
election-year purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a lot of good things to talk to our
constituents about,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   That bill on inheritance taxes would gradually repeal them by
2010. The bill has 240 co-sponsors, including 45 Democrats, but
Clinton is promising a veto because it would cost $104 billion over
the phase-out period and some $50 billion a year after that.
Estates under $675,000 are already exempt this year.
</P>
<P>
   That high cost would jeopardize critical government spending and
threaten efforts to ensure that Social Security and Medicare gain
sound financial footing, opponents said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't just disregard our obligations,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said estate taxes frequently force family farms and
small businesses to be sold or split up by heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The telephone tax repeal bill is H.R. 3916.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Labor To Rethink Alliances  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local union officials and workers will decide
whether to pull their political support from Democratic allies who
defected on the China trade vote, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will mount the biggest effort ever to engage working men
and women in judging the records of every single candidate,'' said
Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   The labor chief described his mood after this week's House
passage of union-opposed legislation to increase trade with China
in one word: ''Angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this fall, Sweeney said the AFL-CIO will start grooming
candidates to challenge lawmakers who don't support labor's agenda
-- without regard to their party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to take a look at encouraging more progressive
candidates in primary races, looking to 2002,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade defeat put unions in an awkward position: The AFL-CIO
has been pouring millions of dollars into a campaign to win
Congress and the White House for its friends in November --
traditionally Democrats who champion union causes, from supporting
minimum wage increases to opposing Social Security privatization.
Yet many of those friends -- 73 Democrats -- voted in favor of the
trade Clinton administration-backed trade legislation, and Vice
President Al Gore offered his muted support.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, local Teamsters have already notified several
Democratic lawmakers they are pulling back support previously
offered. Among them are Reps. Lois Capps of California, Thomas
Sawyer of Ohio and Dennis Moore of Kansas, according to the union's
government affairs director, Mike Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that we'll be working for anyone who has voted
wrong on this issue,'' said Mathis, adding ''There may even be
places where we actively go against someone.''
</P>
<P>
   If that leaves some lawmakers who have been longtime labor
allies out in the cold, Sweeney said he doesn't think it will be a
serious blow to the unions' overall goal of winning back Democratic
control of Congress this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have to be six good candidates out there to achieve
majority in the House of Representatives,'' Sweeney said, referring
to the number of seats Democrats must take from Republicans to win
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton tried to smooth over the rift; at a White
House event on Thursday, he stressed Democratic party unity on
other issues, such as adding prescription drug benefits to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's much more that unites us then divides us,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney nevertheless scolded the administration for the trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply angry that the president, (who) working families
elected, chose to divide progressive elected officials and their
core constituencies,'' Sweeney said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he stressed that the AFL-CIO's endorsement of Gore's
presidential bid is unwavering -- despite dissension by the
Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, two of the federation's
largest unions.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney predicted ranks will ultimately close. ''I'm confident
... that we'll have all the affiliates united in the political
campaign in the fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mathis said of the Teamsters, ''At this point we're not
very comfortable with any of our choices.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis Defense Attacks Testimony  </HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Prosecutors in the Ray Lewis murder trial
appeared to lose ground as the defense sought to poke holes in the
testimony of their star witness and the judge reprimanded them for
not sharing evidence with the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Under zealous cross examination, Duane Fassett, the driver of
Lewis' rented stretch limousine, admitted Thursday he isn't sure of

led to the deaths of two men after a post-Super Bowl party.

   The defense also highlighted inconsistencies in Fassett's
statements and played on his admission that his hearing is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett was considered the most important state witness because
he told investigators that he saw Lewis and his two codefendants
fighting with the two victims, that he heard the two codefendants
admit that they stabbed the men and that Lewis told him to lie to
police.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Fassett said he saw Lewis raise his hand
during the brawl, but never saw him strike anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see him throw a punch,'' he said. ''I didn't see it
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett also testified that Lewis told his friends several times
to stop fighting and get in the limousine -- bolstering the defense
claim that Lewis acted as a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' attorney, Ed Garland, cross examined Fassett only for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ray Lewis didn't do anything to cause or encourage anyone to
stab anyone with a knife, did he?'' Garland asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, sir, not that I could see,'' Fassett replied.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL's
leading tackler last season, faces murder and other charges with
his friends Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting. They could be
sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar, both of suburban Decatur, died
of multiple stab wounds Jan. 31 after a post-Super Bowl party.
Lewis, 25, was in Atlanta with friends to take part in Super Bowl
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by District Attorney Paul Howard, Fassett
testified that he liked Lewis a great deal. Fassett seemed pained
when forced to admit that after the brawl, Lewis told everyone in
the limousine to ''just keep your mouth shut and don't say
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Ray said his NFL career wasn't going to end because of
this or like this,'' Fassett said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said that after Lewis and the others left the nightclub,
Lewis, Oakley and Sweeting -- whom Fassett knew by their nicknames,
Derby and Shorty, respectively -- got into a fight with the two
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he saw Oakley go after Baker in one direction, flip
him to the ground and then punch him several times in the chest.
Sweeting and Lewis went in another direction after Lollar, Fassett
said, where Sweeting pinned him against a tree and punched him.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he saw Lewis raise him arm and cock his fist, as if
to strike, but never saw Lewis actually hit anyone. He also said he
didn't see anyone with a knife, but did hear a bottle break and
believed someone had been hit over the head.
</P>
<P>
   Even before defense attorneys began to cross-examine Fassett,
the judge allowed them to point out that Fassett told investigators
that he had bad hearing and sometimes had trouble understanding the
speech of black males, something he denied in his testimony
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, attorney for Oakley, played on Fassett's hearing
problem by cupping his hands and shouting when Fassett said he
didn't hear a question. Later, Harvey asked Fassett, ''Can you hear
me all right, my friend?''
</P>
<P>
   The defense hammered Fassett on inconsistencies in his
statements to police and his testimony Thursday and argued that
Fassett, who stands about 5-foot-8, couldn't have seen over the
limo to witness the events he later described to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Judge Alice D. Bonner scolded prosecutors for
not turning over evidence that could have helped the defense case.
Bonner warned Howard not to let such a lapse happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued Wednesday that prosecutors should have
informed them that Jeff Gwen, a friend of the two victims, had
corrected a mistake he made in initial statements to police.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen first told police that Lewis struck one of the victims. He
later told investigators the earlier statement was a mistake, and
that he had seen Lewis only ''tussle'' with one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued that the corrected statement showed
Lewis was not actively participating in the street fight that
preceded the stabbings and that Gwen is an unreliable witness whose
statements are riddles with contradictions.

<HEADLINE> Mi Hyun Kim Shoots Sizzling 65  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- Mi Hyun Kim apparently didn't like her
doctor's orders. So far, the strategy has produced some exciting
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Advised to rest her sore left shoulder this week, Kim instead
decided to play in the LPGA Corning Classic. And despite gusty
winds, a soggy course and chilly temperatures that caused the
shoulder to stiffen some more, Kim shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday
to take the first-round lead by two strokes over Penny Hammel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made one mistake with the driver, but I recovered it well,''
said Kim, who sat out nearly a month before returning to the tour
last week. ''I think that was the key.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old South Korean, who won twice in 1999 and was
named rookie of the year, birdied three par-5s and did not have a
bogey as her parents watched nervously from the gallery. Not even
wind gusts to nearly 30 mph and temperatures that struggled to
reach into the 60s could slow her down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used a lot of punch shots out there, and during the practice
round I practiced them because I thought the wind might be a
factor,'' said Kim, who shot a 9-under-par 63 last week in the
opening round of the Firstar Classic. ''I had a good feeling about
things out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Hammel, who at age 38 has been struggling since the
death of her mother last September. Hammel, who has won four times
in 15 years on tour, started superbly with four birdies on the
front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good start for me,'' said Hammel, who missed three
straight cuts before finishing in a tie for 30th last week. ''I
just kept it in play. I could have birdied every hole on the front
nine, but I'm pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammel sank a 35-foot birdie putt on the 412-yard, par-4 No. 13
to move within one shot of the lead, but she bogeyed the 304-yard,
par-4 No. 16 and then finished with two pars to finish alone in
second.
</P>
<P>
   Another stroke back at 68 were Emilee Klein, Vicki
Goetze-Ackerman, Dana Dormann, Pam Kometani and A.J. Eathorne of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Kelli Kuehne had a 69 and was tied with Patti
Liscio and Betsy King.
</P>
<P>
   The only top-10 money-winners in the field weren't far behind.
Sherri Steinhauer, seventh on the list, finished at 71, and Pat
Hurst, the Electrolux winner two weeks ago who is sixth on the
list, had a 72. Two-time Corning champion Rosie Jones, who lost to
Kuehne by one stroke last year, also had a 72.
</P>
<P>
   Rain soaked the 6,062-yard Corning Country Club course all week,
and because of the wet conditions, tournament officials put the
preferred-lie rule into effect. That allowed players to lift their
balls on the fairways, clean them and place them back down within a
club's length of the original position.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the conditions, the players were very appreciative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even with the drying out (caused by the wind), the mud's going
to remain throughout the weekend,'' said Klein, who had four
straight birdies on the front nine. ''But being able to play it up
and not have the mud on your ball helped. If you have mud on your
ball, you don't know where it's going to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetze-Ackerman moved into contention with a late flurry of four
birdies and credited her caddy for making the difference. But she
was hoping to avoid being paired with Klein because Klein's
husband, Kenny, was that caddy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good. That was the best I have hit the ball all
year,'' said Goetze-Ackerman, who has not made the cut in her last
four tournaments. ''If I have Kenny to read the putts, I'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the pairings don't complicate matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he (Kenny) would never try to sabotage me, but his
heart would be with Emilee,'' Goetze-Ackerman said. ''We'll see.
This could get interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Stars 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Off his knee, nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Drury's deflection late in the third period kept Colorado
alive in the Western Conference finals as the Avalanche beat the
Dallas Stars 2-1 Thursday night, forcing a decisive Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque assisted on Drury's goal and scored Colorado's other
goal, helping the Avalanche tie the best-of-seven series at 3-3.
Game 7 is set for Saturday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche were desperate for a break, having outshot the
Stars 110-56 in the previous three games, but winning only once.
Drury's goal could only be described as fortuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to redirect Bourque's waist-high shot with his stick,
Drury instead deflected the puck off his knee for the game-winner
with 3:51 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ray made an unbelievable shot to get it through,'' Drury said.
''Initially, I felt something. I think it might have hit my stick a
little bit. It hit square on my knee and went right in.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the shots we've been throwing at them, it's certainly
nice to get one like that, off the knee. I'll definitely take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Bob Hartley said his team ''finally got a lucky
break. This could be the start of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley praised Bourque, saying, ''What a great performance! He
was the general on the blue line and did an outstanding job. Ray
was very dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy had 26 saves, extending his NHL record for career
playoff victories to 121. Ed Belfour made 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's goal early in the second period put the Avalanche
ahead, but Brett Hull tied it with a power-play goal later in the
period. It was Hull's ninth goal of the playoffs and fourth goal in
the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas defeated Colorado in last year's conference finals,
rallying from a 3-2 deficit en route to capturing its first Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like our position,'' Hartley said. ''With tonight's win, we
generate some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if one team has the momentum because our team is
not down at all,'' Hitchcock said. ''We're playing our way --
gritty, grindy, in-your-face hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had them bogged down for most of the third period. We made
one mistake, and it was in our net. It got tipped off some guy's
knee or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said the Stars ''wanted it to
end tonight, but we aren't disheartened. It was just one of those
goals. If we give the same effort Saturday, we will be all right.
Now we have one game on our ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outshot Dallas 9-6 in a scoreless first period that saw
the Avalanche continue to flounder on the power play, failing to
capitalize on two man-advantage situations.
</P>
<P>
   Each team lost a defenseman in the period. Dallas' Richard
Matvichuk, elbowed in the head by Dave Andreychuk, went down on the
ice behind the Dallas net, apparently losing consciousness
momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Colorado's Aaron Miller was high-sticked by Scott
Thornton and collapsed in pain. Both players had to be assisted
from the ice, but no penalties were called.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, who suffered a mild concussion, did not return, but
Miller was back for the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, seeking his first Stanley Cup title in his 21st NHL
season, scored his first goal of the playoffs early in the second
period. Joe Sakic intercepted a pass and, after putting a spin move
on Sylvain Cote, fed Bourque in the slot. Bourque's shot went high
on Belfour's glove side at 4:30.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe made a great play, blocking the shot and tracking it
down,'' Bourque said. ''I don't know if Belfour thought I was going
to shoot it when I did. I just kind of chipped it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we still have our best game in us. I'm expecting us to
play it in Game 7. This is why I came here (in a trade from Boston
on March 6), to be in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Penalties against Drury and Adam Foote gave Dallas a 5-on-3
advantage for 1:14 later in the period, and the Stars capitalized
on Hull's goal at 12:37.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Mike Modano had to be assisted from the ice after being
stunned by Foote's hit that drew a high-sticking penalty, but
Modano returned late in the period.

<HEADLINE> Cohen, Spokesman Clash Over Tripp  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized his
chief spokesman for ''a serious lapse of judgment'' in releasing
information from Linda Tripp's personnel file in 1998, but critics
say Cohen let Kenneth Bacon off the hook for what amounted to a
''smear campaign'' against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon on Thursday released an inspector general's report
which found that Bacon and Clifford H. Bernath -- who at the time
was Bacon's chief deputy -- had violated Tripp's privacy rights by
providing information from Tripp's security clearance records to a
reporter for The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The IG report recommended that Cohen take ''appropriate
corrective action,'' but was not more specific.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cohen sent letters to Bacon, the assistant
secretary for public affairs, and to Bernath, ''to express my
disappointment'' in their judgment. Cohen said their actions were
''hasty and ill-considered,'' but added: ''This was a departure
from the very high quality of performance that you have otherwise
exhibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the inspector general found that neither Bacon
nor Bernath had acted under influence from the White House, and
that neither man had intended to harm Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said Cohen considers the
matter closed and will take no further action.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, worked for Bacon in the Pentagon's
public affairs office, as did Lewinsky. Tripp remains a Defense
Department employee but works in a public affairs office outside
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's secret taping of conversations with Lewinsky gave
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr the starting point for his
perjury and obstruction probe of President Clinton that resulted in
the president's impeachment in the House and acquittal in a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon and Bernath were involved in revealing in March 1998 that
Tripp stated on a security clearance form she never had been
arrested. In fact, Tripp was arrested for grand larceny as a
teen-ager, a charge later reduced to loitering.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has filed a civil suit against the Defense Department over
the release of the information from her personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, who has called for Bacon's resignation,
denounced Cohen's response as a ''whitewash and cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The law was broken and nothing is being done about it,'' said
Inhofe, R-Okla., adding that Bacon and Bernath should be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department in April declined to seek prosecution,
saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that Bacon and
Bernath knowingly violated the Privacy Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawyers, in a statement, accused Bacon of having
participated knowingly in a ''public relations smear campaign''
orchestrated by the White House to undermine Tripp's credibility.
They urged Clinton to overturn Cohen's action and ''order proper
punishment and remedial actions'' against Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the IG report found that Bacon should have
consulted with the department's general counsel -- but did not --
before releasing any information about Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure to follow established procedures must be
considered a serious lapse in judgment,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said Cohen chose not to make his letters a part of
either Bacon's or Bernath's permanent personnel file. Cohen ordered
more training on the Privacy Act for all Pentagon public affairs
employees.

<HEADLINE> Frazar Leads Golf's Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus is responsible for the changes
on three of the par 5s, rough that is as gnarly as it has ever been
and greens that are smaller and more contoured at Muirfield
Village.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what made the first round of the Memorial the
toughest scoring day in 10 years. Not even the tournament founder
can take credit for the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Only three players broke 70, and 18 broke par. The scoring
average was 74.35, the highest it has been for an opening round
since it was 78.79 in 1990. Swirling breezes and gusts up to 20 mph
seemed to effect just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Except Harrison Frazar.
</P>
<P>
   The West Texas native felt right at home Thursday with a
bogey-free round of 6-under 66 that gave him a 3-stroke lead over
Kenny Perry and Tom Scherrer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't get to the golf course and hope that it blows 20
mph,'' Frazar said. ''If it does, I feel like I've got a pretty
good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, and he does.
</P>
<P>
   Frazar, whose best tournaments have come in May, birdied all the
par 5s and got off to a good start in search of his first PGA Tour
victory. Sunday is a long way off, and plenty of people are chasing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman, back from a five-week hiatus during which he swam
with sharks, looked sharp in a round of 70. He was joined by Justin
Leonard, who won a U.S. Amateur at Muirfield and is trying to
emerge from the deepest slump of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, trying to successfully defend his first title in a
tournament where no champion has ever repeated, played it safe and
had no regrets. He had two birdies, a bogey on the par-5 fifth hole
and had a 71, along with Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you play the first round, you don't want to put
yourself out of it,'' Woods said. ''Under these conditions, it's
very easy to go out and shoot a whole bunch over par.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven players knew the feeling by failing to break 80.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus was not among them. One day after an emotional
ceremony in which he was honored by the Memorial, Nicklaus looked
ragged on the course he built until finishing in style with birdies
on three of the last four holes for a 75.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't the only Nicklaus making some noise.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nicklaus, his 31-year-old son who used to romp around
Muirfield as a kid, made his Memorial debut by taking a share of
the lead early in the day before 3-putting two of the last three
holes for a 72.
</P>
<P>
   The wind blew only about 20 mph on Thursday under gorgeous,
sunny skies. Still, it was enough to cause players to stare at the
tree tops and fiddle through their irons looking -- hoping -- for the
right one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit some solid shots that looked like I didn't know what I
was doing,'' said David Duval, who often was well short of the pin
and wound up with a 73.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, after holing an 8-foot birdie putt on No. 15 that put
him in the lead, hit his approach right at the flag on the 215-yard
16th. It caught a blast of wind and sailed into the bunker. One
hole later, he stood in the fairway staring at the trees, then left
his approach 40 feet short.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy with the way I played,'' Norman said. ''I hit a
lot of solid shots, and given the conditions of the swirling wind,
you had to hit the ball solid.''
</P>
<P>
   This made Frazar's round that much more impressive. He missed
only one fairway, three greens and saved par the two times he was
in a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   What wind? Frazar grew up in Abilene, Texas, where, reporters
surmised, he used to hear the wind rattle through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, that's not true. In Abilene, there aren't any trees,''
Frazar said. ''A calm day is 30 (mph). Then in high school I moved
to Dallas, where a calm day is 20. If I'm playing well, I'm
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Frazar plays his best golf in May is because he takes
the last three months of the year off to hunt and fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes me a couple of months to knock the rust off,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazar is coming off a serious disappointment in New Orleans,
where he was in the lead until making a double bogey on the 71st
hole with an aggressive play at the pin. He missed the playoff by
one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm going down, I want to go down in flames,'' he said.
''That's the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wins this week, or goes down in flames, he probably won't
blame the wind.

<P>
   New Jersey at Philadelphia (7 p.m. EDT). The Devils can become
the first team to rally from a 3-1 deficit in the conference finals
and reach the Stanley Cup finals.
STAR:
Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ray Bourque, Avalanche, scored a goal and assisted on the
game-winner as Colorado defeated Dallas 2-1 to stave off
elimination and tie the Western Conference finals at three games
apiece.
SAVES:
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy had 26 saves in helping Colorado post a 2-1 win over
Dallas in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals Thursday night.
The victory extended Roy's NHL record for career playoff victories
to 121. Grant Fuhr is second with 92 victories.
SWAPS:
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim traded center Espen Knutsen to the expansion Columbus
Blue Jackets on Thursday for a fourth-round pick in the 2001 NHL
entry draft. Knutsen last played for the Mighty Ducks during the
1997-98 season, scoring three goals in 19 games. He has played the
past two seasons in Sweden with Djurgardens, collecting 18 goals
and 35 assists in 48 games last season.
SERIES COMEBACK:
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's 2-1 win over Philadelphia on Wednesday night pulled
the Devils closer to becoming the first team to rally from a 3-1
deficit in a conference finals to reach the Stanley Cup finals.
Teams have come back from the 3-1 margin on 13 previous occasions,
the last time by St. Louis against Phoenix in last year's Western
Conference quarterfinals.
SEVENTH GAME:
</P>
<P>
   History in Game 7s won't be anything new for the Flyers and
Devils when they meet in Philadelphia for the deciding game of the
Eastern Conference finals, tied 3-3. The Flyers are 4-2 at home in
seventh game history, 5-4 overall. The last home one was a 1987
victory over the New York Islanders that propelled Philadelphia
into the Stanley Cup finals. The Devils have played in seven Game
7s since 1988, posting a 2-5 record, including 1-4 on the road. New
Jersey dropped a 4-2 decision to Pittsburgh in the opening round
last year.
SCOUTING:
</P>
<P>
   Peoria scored two first-period power-play goals en route to a
4-2 victory over Louisiana in Game 4 of the East Coast Hockey
League's Kelly Cup championship on Thursday night. The victory
evened the series 2-2. The team that has won Game 4 has gone on to
win 24 of 26 seven-game series, and 10 of 11 league finals.
SPEAKING:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we still have our best game in us. I'm expecting us to
play it in Game 7. This is why I came here (in a trade from Boston
on March 6), to be in this situation.'' -- Colorado defenseman Ray
Bourque, who had a goal and an assist, after the Avalanche's 2-1
victory over Dallas in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Brodeur-Boucher On Spot in Game 7  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a trip to the Stanley Cup finals on the
line tonight, no one is more on the spot in Game 7 of the Eastern
Conference finals than goalies Martin Brodeur and Brian Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur has faced the spotlight of a Game 7 before for the New
Jersey Devils. He has known the joy of winning hockey's most
cherished trophy. He also has twice known the disappointment of
losing a Game 7, including once in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher has never faced a do-or-die game at this level, although
twice in the minors the rookie played a deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage New Jersey?
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur isn't sure despite winning the last two games, allowing
two goals and seeing Boucher give up six.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies are just the last line of defense, Brodeur said. If the
Devils start skating all over the ice like they did in losing Games
2, 3 and 4, the Flyers have a good chance of getting to the Cup
finals for the second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been playing unbelievable and given them a chance to
win the last two games,'' Brodeur said of Boucher. ''Now it's a
Game 7, and it's a lot of pressure for me and a lot of pressure for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of pressure for everyone,'' said Brodeur, who led
the Devils to a Stanley Cup in 1995. ''If he keeps playing the same
way he has been playing, he'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher seemed more worried about the team on Thursday than his
own play.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 3-1 lead in the series, the Flyers have been on
cruise control the last two games. New Jersey dominated Game 5 on
Monday, and it seemed that only Boucher and Eric Lindros, returning
to the lineup after a 10-week absence, played with passion in the
2-1 loss in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we had a false sense of security,'' Boucher said. ''You
know that you have a couple of cracks at it. You tell yourself that
you want to be desperate, sometimes you just don't do it. I think
now we're forced in the situation and we're going to have to play
our best game. And if not, we're going to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur remembers that feeling from 1994, when the Devils lost
the final two games to the New York Rangers in a seven-game
conference final.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 years old at the time, Brodeur had an outstanding series
and an outstanding Game 7. However, he will forever be linked with
Stephane Matteau, whose wraparound goal in the second overtime
eliminated New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, a lot of people talk about it,'' Brodeur said with a
mild sense of disbelief. ''Every time I go to New York, I still
hear that guy's name. I don't know where he is playing, I think
it's San Jose now. That's just the way it is. That's what a Game 7
brings to the hockey world, history.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens tonight, this series between the New Jersey
Turnpike rivals has had everything. There have been momentum
swings, physical play, outstanding hockey and even a circus
atmosphere that surrounded the return of Lindros for Game 6 after
he was sidelined 10 weeks because of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter how you got there,'' Flyers coach Craig
Ramsay said. ''This is a tremendous opportunity. There will be
tremendous excitement in that building.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a chance to play in a Game 7, in this case to go to
the Stanley Cup finals, is one of the greatest experiences you will
ever have as a hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey coach Larry Robinson played in a number of deciding
games with the Montreal and each was thrilling, although he quipped
he preferred series sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the young kids, this is something they are going to
remember for the rest of their lives,'' said Robinson, who has
turned the team around since replacing Robbie Ftorek late in the
season. ''A lot of times it takes players from one level to another
level because of the intensity and the importance of the game and
the things that have to be done in pressure-filled situations. It's
a great teaching tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Flyers played in a Game 7 was in 1989, when
they beat Pittsburgh in the Patrick Division finals. The Devils
have played in seven Game 7s since 1988 with a 2-5 record. They
dropped a 4-2 decision to Pittsburgh in the opening round last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow is going to be up to the goalies, I think,'' Devils
forward Petr Sykora said, ''and both goalies are playing great.''

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs $15 Billion in Farm Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers say their $15 billion farm bailout
should help producers survive this year and make them less
dependent on government aid in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving farmers direct payments this year, the
measure would pour $8.2 billion into the federally subsidized crop
insurance program, starting with next year's crops. That money will
make the insurance much cheaper and available for more crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''By providing producers more affordable levels of coverage,
there should be less need for Congress to pass emergency assistance
on a year to year basis,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance can cover revenue losses as well as
weather-related crop failures.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave final approval to the aid package Thursday and
sent it to President Clinton for his expected signature. The Senate
passed the legislation 91-4 after the House had passed it on a
voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation includes $5.5 billion in cash payments that are
expected to be sent to growers in late August or September, USDA
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The payments would mean an estimated $16,000 this year for a
500-acre corn farm, while a typical wheat grower would get about
$19,000 more. A farmer growing 300 acres of cotton would receive an
additional $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman praised the insurance
overhaul, but he said Congress also should have done something
about the 1996 farm law, which ended a Depression-era system of
price supports and production controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bleeding continues, and we're getting ready to apply yet
another very expensive tourniquet when the situation actually calls
for a blood transfusion,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third straight year that Congress has passed a
multibillion dollar package of farm-income assistance to compensate
for low commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   The money has stabilized farm income and land values, said Alan
Barkeep, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Now, with cattle and hog prices on the rebound, ''things are a bit
brighter than they were 18 months ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say the extra money for crop insurance will pay
for itself by making farmers less dependent on other forms of
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reducing premiums, coverage will be expanded to
fruit, vegetables and other commodities for which insurance hasn't
been available before. The federal subsidy for the most popular
level of insurance will rise from 42 percent to 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 billion in direct farm payments would go to grain and
cotton producers who have annual ''market-transition'' contracts
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $1.6 billion in the legislation is earmarked for
special commodities, including:
</P>
<P>
   --$500 million for soybean and sunflower growers.
</P>
<P>
   --$340 million for tobacco growers, to compensate for falling
cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   --$200 million for the government to buy surplus commodities,
including apples, black-eyed peas, cherries, citrus, cranberries,
onions, melons, peaches and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   --$100 million for cottonseed producers.
</P>
<P>
   --$25 million to fruit growers in the Northeast who have been
hurt by plum pox virus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major victory in as many days for farm
organizations, who on Wednesday were celebrating the House's
approval of permanent normal trade relations for China.
</P>
<P>
   The farm lobby also is pushing Congress to allow sales of food
to Cuba and won a small victory Thursday. The House GOP leadership,
which wants to preserve the embargo on Cuba, had planned to force a
vote on the issue Thursday but abruptly put it off until after the
congressional Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll come back and hopefully come to some agreement,'' said
George Nethercutt, R-Wash., who is leading the effort in the House
to ease the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Annan May Add Lebanon Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Planning to call for 3,500 more troops to
secure peace along the Israeli-Lebanese border, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told a class of foreign affairs
graduates that future international peacekeepers may have to use
more force.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, in a one-day visit to Washington, also sharply criticized
a Republican senator who has single-handedly blocked U.S. funding
for U.N. peacekeepers, saying the action by Sen. Judd Gregg ''is
only going to make matters worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking to reporters before his commencement address at
Johns Hopkins University's international studies school, challenged
Gregg to come up with a better peacekeeping plan if he doesn't like
U.N. actions. Gregg, who did not meet with Annan, has said he
disagrees with the way the United Nations is conducting its
operation in Sierra Leone, where 279 peacekeepers are being held
hostage by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told reporters he is awaiting a formal confirmation of
Israel's total withdrawal from southern Lebanon before recommending
an increase in an interim U.N. force of 4,500.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to announce ''within days'' plans to boost the force to
8,000 troops in the wake of Israel's hasty retreat this week from
its border security zone in Lebanon. No U.S. troops are being
offered for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Annan forecast a tougher approach. His remarks
related to the work of a special panel he has appointed to study
U.N. peacekeeping and report back to him in July.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has agonized over U.N. peacekeeping failures in Rwanda in
1994 and Bosnia in 1995. The United Nations was accused of ignoring
evidence that a genocide was being planned in Rwanda and of failing
to help save thousands of Bosnian Muslims from a Serb mass murder
in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where a peace agreement is signed but one or more of the
parties are tempted to violate it, the U.N. needs a credible and
robust presence in order to deter and discourage potential
violators,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers cannot be expected only to ''keep peace
between angels,'' he said, adding that combatants in modern wars
are often ''warlords and militia leaders whose only aim is power
and personal enrichment.'' He said the threat of international
isolation may have no meaning for people like Sierra Leone rebel
leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to consider some of the most basic assumptions about
neutrality, the good faith of the parties and the nonuse of force
that were the basis of the successful operations of the cold War
era,'' Annan said. He said future U.N. peacekeepers need ''robust
mandates'' and the willingness of richer countries to provide
first-rate military and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the hold Gregg placed last week on $368 million owed
by the United States for U.N. peacekeeping in Congo, Kosovo, East
Timor and Sierra Leone, Annan said, ''Let me say it is not
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's spokesman, Edmund Amorosi, said the senator was issuing
no immediate statement in response to Annan and already had agreed
to release $40 million for Kosovo. He was discussing the other
operations with State Department officials, Amorosi said.

<HEADLINE> Six CIA Senior Officials Rebuked  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six senior CIA officials involved in the
agency's handling of home computer security breaches by former
director John Deutch have been officially rebuked by the agency for
their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Among those reprimanded for not acting promptly once the matter
came to their attention is former CIA General Counsel Michael
O'Neil. Three of the six officials still work at the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet was not included, but he received
stern words about his own role in a recent face-to-face meeting
with President Clinton, according to officials familiar with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''During that conversation, the director acknowledged that he
shared in the responsibility for shortcomings identified in the
report,'' CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, the agency announced the disciplinary
actions and said it had improved its own procedures to better
safeguard sensitive computer files -- and to more promptly report
transgressions to the Justice Department and congressional
oversight committees.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said the reprimands do not go far enough,
calling them ''a mild, if not weak, gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody else had done this besides senior CIA officials,
they would have received much harsher punishment,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his panel continues to investigate the matter, as does
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us on the committee are still troubled by the whole
episode, especially the large volume of mishandled classified
documents,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the CIA's discovery that Deutch had worked on some
of the nation's most sensitive secrets on unsecured home computers
that also had Internet access and were used by other members of his
household.
</P>
<P>
   The security violations were discovered by the CIA when Deutch
left his post in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was done about it by the agency until 1999, when the
case was referred to the Justice Department for review and when
Tenet, Deutch's former deputy and successor, stripped his former
boss of his security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has admitted violating security rules but said he did
so unintentionally and did not mean to put the nation's secrets at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department initially declined to prosecute Deutch.
But its criminal division recently reopened its investigation both
into Deutch's conduct and into the follow-up by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The actions against the six, administered this week by Air Force
Gen. John A. Gordon, the agency's deputy director, followed a
sharply critical report of the agency's behavior by a presidential
advisory panel and by the CIA's own inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA statement said that three officials involved in the
followup investigation, including one still at the agency, were
''formally reprimanded in writing.'' Gordon ''formally admonished
in writing'' two others, one of them still at the agency; and
''orally admonished'' still another who is still at the agency, the
CIA said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA declined to identify any of the six, citing ''reasons of
personal privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence and congressional officials familiar with the
case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that O'Neil and
former CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin were the most senior of
those receiving formal written reprimands -- the sharpest category
of criticism of the six individuals involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also among those to receive either reprimands or admonishments,
the officials said, were the agency's former inspector general,
Frederick Hitz, and Richard Calder, currently the deputy director
for administration.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Spaeder, O'Neil's lawyer, confirmed that his client had
received a written reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sincerely regret and vigorously disagree with Gen. Gordon's
decision to reprimand Mr. O'Neil in connection with the Deutch
matter,'' Spaeder said. ''While working at the CIA, Mr. O'Neil at
all times conducted himself with the best interests of the agency
in mind and in complete good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil earlier this year declined to testify before the Senate
Intelligence Committee, citing Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination. A Washington lawyer now in private practice, he
left the CIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has said it has no evidence that the classified computer
files Deutch worked on at home were accessed by others or
compromised -- but also could not rule out the possibility.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Lebanon Settle Into Border  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- A farmer tended trees by the border with
a pistol in his belt, soldiers barricaded roads leading north and
Prime Minister Ehud Barak told Israelis to get Lebanon out of their
system.
</P>
<P>
   Israel declared its withdrawal from Lebanon complete on Thursday
-- and Israelis began settling into their new border.
</P>
<P>
   Though the situation was tense, events along the frontier have
so far disproved the dire predictions of renewed warfare beginning
the morning after Hezbollah guerillas reached Israel's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah activists -- who
had long struggled against the Israeli presence in southern Lebanon
-- faced each other down separated by barbed wire fences. In others,
fruit orchards provided a buffer.
</P>
<P>
   At a strip of frontier between the border town of Metulla and
the Lebanese village of Kfar Kila, only a coil of barbed wire a
yard high separated the two countries, which technically remain at
war.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese Christian trying to join his parents and two siblings
who had fled to Israel awaited permission to step over it. ''I
can't live alone,'' Joseph Aoun said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israelis abruptly accelerated their withdrawal this
week, militiamen who had helped Israel protect its security zone in
southern Lebanon deserted by the hundreds -- some surrendering to
Lebanese authorities, others fleeing across the border to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Israelis had to get used to separation between Israel
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than two decades, Lebanon was part of the routine of
our lives as a scene of army activity,'' he told a special session
of parliament held in northern Israel. ''The army is no longer on
Lebanese territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's aides confirmed Thursday that the army had finished
dismantling border outposts that jut into Lebanon, clearing the way
for the United Nations to verify the withdrawal. Israel hopes U.N.
troops will deploy along the border and prevent the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah from attacking.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, who as defense minister in 1982 sent Israel's
troops into Lebanon, criticized the way the government brought them
home as chaotic and panicked. He charged that mistakes by Barak's
government allowed military equipment to fall into guerrilla hands
and predicted renewed attacks against Israel from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am afraid we will pay for this in the future,'' he told the
Parliament session in Kiryat Shemona -- a town hit by 4,000 rockets
fired from Lebanon over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dovish members of Parliament heckled Sharon, the leader of the
parliamentary opposition. ''It was your audacity that caused this
in the first place,'' shouted Ilan Gilon of the Meretz party.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, offered Israel
assurances. Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa said in Lisbon,
Portugal, that his country sought peace with Israel and will not
provoke hostilities in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Along the frontier, soldiers set up blockades of barbed wire and
concrete barriers and stood guard in apple orchards to keep
civilians away from the border -- yards from where Hezbollah
supporters held demonstrations and threatened to kill Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers are under orders not to shoot unless their lives
are in danger, and Hezbollah guerrillas on the other side warned
demonstrators not to throw stones.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli tour guide Daniel Avraham took a group of American and
Australian tourists to see a Hezbollah demonstration where men
fired automatic rifles into the air and held up a mortar shell.
</P>
<P>
   He said he always brings groups to the so-called Good Fence, a
gate where Lebanese workers used to cross into Israel. The army
closed the gate for good Wednesday, as the last of its troops left
Lebanon, so Avraham took his group to the border fence via a back
road. He stopped yards from the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is close enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Aviad Belsky, the border is a little too close, but he
doesn't have a choice -- almost an acre of his apple orchard borders
Lebanon. On Thursday, he made the rounds in his orchard with a
pistol stuck in his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Belsky said Lebanese demonstrators just across the fence
brandished automatic weapons in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the frontier would remain peaceful, now that
Israel's occupation of Lebanon -- and along with the casualties it
claimed among young Israeli soldiers -- had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got what they wanted, and we got what we wanted, too,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Patients' Bill May Be Elusive  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican and Democratic negotiators vowed to
press ahead to craft legislation giving patients more protections
against HMOs but acknowledged that, with major disagreements yet to
be resolved, reaching a compromise may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may not be doable,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., after
meeting Thursday with a small group of lawmakers who are key
members of the compromise committee he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks break down, Republicans who side with Democrats
vowed to bypass the committee and bring an agreement to the floor
of both houses of Congress for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles disputed Democratic complaints that little progress had
been made and said Republicans had essentially given in to a
Democratic provision that all 191 million privately insured
Americans would be covered by the protections.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Republicans had discussed a compromise on the most
serious sticking point -- whether patients should get expanded
rights to sue health plans if they are hurt when denied care.
Republicans oppose such a provision and Democrats insist on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's anyone moving, anybody having any flexibility, it's
been on our side, it hasn't been on the Democrats' side,'' said
Nickles. He declined to elaborate on where Republicans are willing
to compromise. Meetings were planned for the Memorial Day weekend,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said ''painfully little progress''
had been made in Thursday's meeting and other gatherings over the
last three months. He said Democrats had offered some concessions
to GOP concerns about giving the federal government more regulatory
power over health plans at the expense of state patient protection
laws. ''We're open to other kinds of enforcement mechanisms,'' said
Kennedy. ''They can come back with a different proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   But unless a deal could be struck in the week following Memorial
Day, Democrats may give up on negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it, in terms of breaking out on some common ground,''
said Kennedy. Part of the problem appears to be that Republicans
are trying to find consensus among themselves. As negotiators were
meeting, a leading GOP proponent of HMO reform lashed out at his
own party for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., a former dentist, accused Senate
Republicans of plotting with insurance lobbyists to delay the talks
in hopes of killing legislation that polls show is popular with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to say time's up,'' Norwood said, vowing to look for
ways to bypass the committee, which is working to combine
legislation passed by the Senate and House. Norwood co-authored the
bipartisan House bill.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate-passed version favored by Republicans doesn't expand
lawsuits. Like the House bill, it would guarantee patients other
rights when dealing with their HMOs, such as easier access to
specialists and using out-of-plan hospitals in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version also would apply only to Americans in health
plans exempt from state law, about 56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and insurers say lawsuits will cause premiums
to soar and prompt businesses to drop health plans for workers
rather than face expensive lawsuits. Democrats say HMOs must be
held legally accountable for their care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said Senate Republicans won't budge on the lawsuit
issue, and warned time is running out before Congress' summer
recess.

   ''If we don't get a bill, or at least a tentative agreement in
writing by the week we come back from Memorial Day, we must move
past'' the committee, Norwood said.

and try to get like-minded senators to introduce a version of his

<HEADLINE> New Plan To Protect Fragile Water  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to begin work on a
system of ocean preserves that eventually could mirror the system
of protected forests and parks on land, White House officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was outlining broad new protections for fragile
stretches of sea, beach and reef today at the Assateague Island
National Seashore, a windblown barrier island off the Maryland and
Virginia shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton plans to direct federal agencies to
come up with a quick plan for protecting Hawaiian coral reefs. He
also wants the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt tougher
water pollution standards in some areas to protect beaches and
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans do not require action by Congress, but could be
undone by the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is saying that it's time we do for our oceans
what we've done on land -- establish a comprehensive conservation
network that preserves these unique resources for future
generations,'' said George Frampton, acting chair of the White
House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has set aside more than 200 million acres
of wilderness and national parks to provide sanctuaries for
wildlife and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 square miles of ocean is now afforded the kind of
blanket protection from human activity accorded true wilderness
areas on land, said Jack Sobel, a specialist in marine ecosystems
and coral reefs at the Center for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for Democratic presidents creating new marine
reserves late in their tenure, Sobel and other said. Jimmy Carter
did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do think a lot can get done in eight months'' before
Clinton leaves office, Sobel said. ''We think a committed
administration can leave a lasting legacy in a relatively short
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans live near a coastline, and pressures from
development, pollution, fishing, and oil and gas drilling are
increasing yearly, environmental advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a federal proposal in 90 days that would
permanently protect reefs along a 1,200-mile string of islands in
far northwest Hawaii. The coral reef system there represents 70
percent of all reefs in U.S. waters, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The reefs support threatened sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian
monk seals and other marine life found nowhere else, a White House
fact sheet said. The White House said the reef conservation plan
will be developed in cooperation with Hawaiian authorities and a
regional fisheries management board.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Interior and Commerce departments would draw up
lists of threatened areas and weigh how best to protect them --
through total bans on fishing, drilling or other activities, or
through milder measures. A new federal office would administer the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to do those things by presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan is likely from commercial fishing
interests and other businesses that use the open ocean. But Sarah
Chasis, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said
some fishermen have become allies of protection plans in Florida
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''The protection means new spawning grounds, and that ultimately
benefits fishing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has administrative power to
impose protections on federal waters and coastline, but it is not
often invoked. Those powers do not extend to private waters.

Venezuela Elections Suspended
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Prolonging a bitter campaign that has pitted rich
against poor, Venezuela's highest court suspended this weekend's presidential,
congressional and regional elections, citing glitches in the electronic
balloting system. Thursday's delay gives President Hugo Chavez's main
challenger, a former state governor named Francisco Arias Cardenas, more time to
try to reduce the president's 15- to 20-point lead in the polls. The Supreme
Tribunal of Justice suspended the balloting, citing a lack of "credibility and
transparency" because of the technical difficulties.

Monitoring of Los Alamos Lab Sought

	   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Environmentalists are demanding an independent
analysis and regular monitoring of radiation levels on the fire-ravaged land
around Los Alamos National Laboratory. A federal air-monitoring team last week
reported elevated background radiation levels, which it said would be normal
when vegetation burns. But the levels, in some cases 2 to 10 times higher than
normal, triggered concern among some New Mexico residents. "We're calling for an
independent citizens review board to assess the monitoring data and risks, and
we want a long-term health study of people exposed to the smoke," the director
of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety in Santa Fe, said Thursday.

attorney said his client was innocent of the 1968 slaying of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, who was fatally shot moments after declaring victory in the California
presidential primary. The petition, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks a new

attackers fired about 30 machine gun rounds into the Russian camp at Kijevo,
about 20 miles south of the capital, Pristina, NATO said. No one was injured in

The hijacker moved from bathroom to bathroom toward the front of the Airbus 330,
complaining of a stomachache, finally reaching the cockpit, where he announced

<HEADLINE> Trinity, Wesleyan blasted by National Association of Scholars  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A national education group is blasting Trinity
College and
Wesleyan University, accusing the schools of becoming too trendy in
the teaching of English and literature.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a 77-page report, the National Association of Scholars cited
the schools as examples of the decline in the teaching of classic
authors.
</P>
<P>
   Of 25 schools reviewed, those that have the most watered down
their English programs are Trinity, Wesleyan, Swarthmore College,
Haverford College and Amherst College, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rely on English programs, particularly at major colleges,
to produce writers, critics, cultural leaders, scholars, teachers.
. . . It carries our civilization to have these folks absorb the
great authors,'' said Stephen H. Balch, the association's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''While some institutions take this civilizing mission
seriously,'' he said, ''most, including Trinity, strangely, now
think they have better things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, based in New Jersey, consists of about 4,000
college professors, graduate students and college administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at Trinity, in Hartford, and Wesleyan, in Middletown,
disputed the conclusions of the association's report, which was
based on a review of college catalogs and course descriptions at 25
campuses between 1964 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we think we have better things to do. I think we
have more things to do,'' said Ronald R. Thomas, an English
professor and former English department chairman at Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We foster a view of literature as a dynamic enterprise, not as
something that is eternally unchanging.''
</P>
<P>
   In its course descriptions, Trinity lists Toni Morrison 10
times, only one fewer than it lists Shakespeare, according to the
report. Morrison is the author of a number of books, including
''Beloved,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning tale of slavery and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Wesleyan, the report said, offered a ''substantial amount of
serious courses,'' but its English major also was ''liberally
studded with titles like 'Space, Place and Literature'; 'History of
Sex'; and 'Reading Television.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the Trinity professor, said the report left a false
impression that the classics are being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only two authors who have a complete course
dedicated to them in our curriculum every year -- and those are
Shakespeare and Chaucer.''
</P>
<P>
   The college also offered single courses this year on William
Blake, William Faulkner, Jane Austen and Toni Morrison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, only Morrison is a contemporary writer, but ''she
could hardly be recognized as overly trendy,'' Thomas said. ''She
has won the Nobel Prize, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wesleyan, Bill Stowe, head of the English department, also
disputed the report's conclusions. Stowe told the Chronicle for
Higher Education that the survey courses praised in the report
''tend to be superficial samples'' -- Beowulf to Thomas Pynchon in
two semesters, he said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Receives Security Advice  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Almost anybody can walk through the front door
of the State Department, but with security concerns on the rise
that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been studying a report
that would require visitors to be screened outside the department
for the first time since the two-square block building opened in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   The report was submitted to Albright last Friday by the
department's top official for diplomatic security, David Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Albright asked for the report months ago following a series of
lapses, including the disappearance last February of a laptop
computer containing top-secret information.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Russian spies were caught tuned in to a listening
device installed in a seventh-floor conference room.
</P>
<P>
   There were 43 recommendations in Carpenter's report. Among them,
according to a State Department official, were:
</P>
<P>
   --Limiting traffic in surrounding streets to people with proper
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring daily trunk searches all vehicles that enter the
State Department parking garage, capacity 900.
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing the State Department security force, which now
numbers 400.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Albright's decisions on the recommendations, one
street adjacent to the department will be closed while renovations
are carried out on the building.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official, asking not to be identified, said the closure
could become permanent because of security needs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was disclosed Thursday that two agents
representing the investigative arm of Congress posed as New York
City police officers last week and wandered the State Department
unescorted for 15 minutes. Under department rules, the two should
have been under escort at all times.
</P>
<P>
   They were testing State Department security arrangements as part
of a congressionally mandated investigation to review security at
19 government installations and two commercial airports. In each
case, the General Accounting Office agents used fake credentials to
get past security guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they were not escorted out of here was a
mistake,'' Carpenter said, referring to the security violation at
State. But another official said there were mitigating
circumstances, pointing out that the two, without warning, bolted
the 7th floor office where they were having a meeting arranged
under false pretenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the State Department, the GAO agents faked their
way into the FBI, the Pentagon, the CIA and the Justice Department,
among other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, conducted at the request of Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary crime subcommittee, exposed
how age-old cop-to-cop courtesies could be a security breach.
</P>
<P>
   Federal security guards never challenged any of the badges of
the men they thought were fellow officers and the agents'
briefcases were never checked, GAO Assistant Controller General
Robert Hast said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've just never looked at this possibility,'' Hast said.
''I think what we found was a unique hole in the system that can be
plugged up.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents were even able to videotape their penetration of
several of the agencies without the guards noticing, said Ronald
Malfi, one of the GAO agents who got inside eight federal buildings
in one day using fake badges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have caused a lot of damage,'' he said before showing
the videotape to a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Red-faced agencies scrambled to prove they had plugged their
security. At the Pentagon, federal officers will no longer be
allowed to walk around unescorted and will have to check their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, police and law
enforcement officers from outside the bureau will have to surrender
their weapons before entering, unless they have been given
permanent building passes.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, only federal law enforcement agents on
official business will be allowed to enter the building with guns.

<HEADLINE> Reno Fla. Visit Draws Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno's first
trip to Florida since she ordered the seizure of Elian Gonzalez
drew hundreds of protesters angry about the return of the
6-year-old to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was in her hometown Thursday to deliver the keynote address
at a dinner honoring Florida's first 150 female lawyers. The nearly
900 people who attended the dinner gave her a warm welcome, though
a handful walked out on her speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so wonderful to be home,'' Reno said. ''People have
touched my life in so many ways with love and kindness, with joy
and support and sometimes with anger and rejection. My skin has
thickened a bit but I still long to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel, Cuban-Americans angry
about last month's raid faced off with Reno supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has nothing to do with Cuban problems. It's about the
violation of the law,'' said Julio Villa, 53, who wore a photo of
Reno marked with a red slash across her face.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter, Bob Kunst, said it was important to give Reno
''support and love and welcome her back and let her know not to be
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time, we are sending a message to the Cuban right
wing that we've had enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of demonstrators grew to about 600 but thinned to less
than 100 by the end of Reno's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who survived the November sinking of a boat carrying
Cuban refugees, has been living in the Washington area with his
father since the April 22 raid in Little Havana. A federal court
has been asked to decide if he is eligible for a political asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno did not directly mention Elian's case during her remarks.
But in an interview in today's Miami Herald, she said that she
favored a meeting between Elian's Miami relatives and mental health
care workers to discuss how to set up a reconciliation meeting with
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first step is to get the adults reconciled with each
other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was troubled by a scarf that Elian was
recently seen wearing, she told the newspaper: ''I just think it
was a dumb thing.'' The scarf denotes membership in the Communist
Party Youth organization, the Pioneers, and is worn to school by
children each day.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had told Florida Bar officials that she would step aside if
they felt her presence would detract from Thursday's ceremony. The
Cuban American Bar Association withdrew its support of the event to
protest the raid and the Clinton administration's position that his
father should be allowed to take the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Bar spokeswoman Francine Walker said there was never any
question that Reno should speak because she is the first woman to
serve as attorney general and Florida's most famous female lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is a pioneer,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who passed the bar exam in 1963, is not part of the
honored group. The last of the first 150 women joined the Florida
Bar in 1943. Only 13 are still living.

<HEADLINE> Ex-INS Espionage Case Goes to Jury  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- It's up to a jury to decide whether a U.S.
immigration official accused of espionage ''made a mistake'' or
broke the law when he passed secret information to a friend with
ties to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, 54, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Cuba, could
get 10 years in prison if convicted of charges including violating
the Espionage Act. Jurors began deliberating the case Thursday and
will return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, a 34-year veteran with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, was the target of a videotaped FBI sting,
set up to see what he would do with classified information,
prosecutors said. Investigators gave him a phony story that a
certain Cuban official planned to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Faget was caught on tape telling his friend and
business partner Pedro Font over the phone about the impending
defection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mariano Faget was a government employee willing to betray the
trust of people he was sworn to serve,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Curtis Miner told jurors. ''He disclosed classified information for
no better purpose than his own personal reasons, his own personal
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget testified that he tipped off his friend because Font was
meeting with a Cuban diplomat that day. Faget said he feared Font
would be harmed if Cuban officials thought he was involved with the
defection.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an honest government servant who made a mistake, but
he did not violate the law,'' defense attorney Edward O'Donnell
said. ''It was never his intent to hurt this country ... his intent
was to warn his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor ridiculed Faget's assertion that he didn't
think telling Font about the defection would hurt national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took it out of the realm of control of the United States
government and gave it to someone else, to use however they
wanted,'' Miner said.

<HEADLINE> CNN Celebrates 20th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thinking back on CNN's 20 years, we might recall
its live video of President Reagan walking into a hospital after
surviving a would-be assassin's assault; its shocking pictures of
the Challenger explosion; its scenes of the Berlin Wall coming
down; its hours devoted to the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can leave such reminiscences to CNN, which will pat its
own back in a pair of anniversary specials. Next Thursday and
Friday (June 1 and 2) from 9 to 11 p.m. Eastern, the network will
present a sort of ''Greatest Hits -- 1980-2000,'' with Larry King as
host.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. With more than 175,000 hours under its belt (and that's
just counting the original cable network; by now there are six
bearing the CNN name), the Atlanta-based Cable News Network has
amassed a record worth crowing about since Ted Turner flicked the
switch at 6 p.m. on June 1, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's big, crazy dream came true. And then some.
</P>
<P>
   ''CNN has provided the world with news and information whenever
and wherever it occurs,'' says Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN
News Group. ''And at a time that viewers and listeners wished to
get it, rather than when producers decided that it should be made
available.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that incontestable fact, what has CNN meant to the
information age it fostered? How, in a larger sense, has it
transformed television? Our lives? Us?
</P>
<P>
   Think back to 1980. There were three broadcast networks and PBS.
Nationally available cable channels were few. And on basic cable,
original programming, other than live sportscasts, was almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TV news came to us in isolated helpings. We could
catch the headlines at dinner time with ''Uncle Walter'' Cronkite.
If that half-hour didn't satisfy us, we could skip Johnny Carson at
bedtime for a brand-new ABC program called ''Nightline.'' And back
in May 1980, there was a total of three weekly magazine shows: CBS'
''60 Minutes,'' ABC's ''20/20'' and, for a couple more months,
NBC's shortlived ''Prime Time Saturday'' with Tom Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't seem sufficient to Turner, a young Atlanta media
magnate and emerging Southern folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   Already he was enjoying success after turning his ragtag Channel
17 (with its ''Andy Griffith Show'' reruns and Atlanta Braves
games) into a national ''super station'' by beaming it from sea to
shining sea by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Now he meant to shower news on Americans by satellite around the
clock, and with his typical messianic bombast, he declared, ''We
won't sign off until the end of the world -- and we'll cover that
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Turner makes good on that pledge remains to be seen. But
20 years ago, everyone (or, at least, the 1.7 million viewers it
originally reached) could see that CNN had, against all odds,
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CNN was viewed with skepticism and bemusement as it flew
by the seat of its pants.
</P>
<P>
   How could this bargain-basement venture (originating from the
basement of a social organization's converted clubhouse) find
enough viewers, money or even news to keep going?
</P>
<P>
   Radically different from the broadcast networks' neatly
distilled newscasts, the nonstop CNN ''was widely castigated for
its lack of editing and lack of story selection,'' recalls Porter
Bibb, a media specialist for Technology Partners and author of a
book on Turner.
</P>
<P>
   But what CNN was doing, Bibb says, was nothing less than
reinventing TV news. ''It changed the definition of news from what
has happened to what is happening. CNN took the news out of the
newsroom and put the viewer in the middle of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Johnson looks back at CNN's first 20 years (and his own
first decade running it), he can chart its penetration through the
United States, then, increasingly, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''And now we're into the era of the World Wide Web and new
on-demand services,'' he says. ''We will be able to provide you
with live, real-time information in your home, in your office, in
your car; on your beeper and on your cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping drive these innovations is the imminent merger of
Internet provider America Online with Time Warner, CNN's owner
since it gobbled up Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Ted Turner's baby anymore, the super-charged CNN
today competes in a TV universe that includes MSNBC, CNBC and Fox
News Channel -- all-news rivals that it made possible.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, CNN paved the way for channels as different
as the Weather Channel is from MTV. CNN gave us a new relationship
with our TV, transforming it from our living-room program dispenser
to a multi-channel window; a nonstop sensation device; an
intravenous media drip.
</P>
<P>
   And -- go figure! -- it fulfilled these musings of Marshall
McLuhan:
</P>
<P>
   '''Time' has ceased, 'space' has vanished,'' the famed
philosopher wrote in his book ''The Medium is the Massage'' 13
years before CNN signed on. ''Instant communication insures that
all factors of the environment and of experience co-exist in a
state of active interplay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now live in a global village.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Told To Replace Insulation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have ordered that
insulation blankets suspected in the fatal crash of a Swissair jet
be removed from 719 Boeing airplanes as a possible fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk of fire aboard these aircraft is very low, but this
is a prudent action to take to raise the bar on safety,'' Jane F.
Garvey, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said
Thursday in a statement announcing the directive.
</P>
<P>
   The order applies to MD-80, MD-88, MD-90, DC-10 and MD-11 planes
designed by McDonnell Douglas, which Boeing bought in 1997. Boeing
spokesman John Thom said the company will work with aircraft
operators to help them comply with the FAA order.
</P>
<P>
   The directive is aimed at Mylar-covered blankets that insulate
the planes from noise, heat and cold. The FAA said the metalized
Mylar falls far below a new standard for testing insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, the 719 Boeing MD-80, MD-88, MD-90, DC-10 and
MD-11 jets will have to be refitted with new insulation blankets
that meet the tougher flame-propagation standard. The FAA said it
plans to issue a proposal for all new aircraft soon.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11, was equipped with Mylar-covered
insulation when it crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia on Sept. 2,
1998, killing all 229 people aboard. Although the cause of the
crash has never been pinpointed, investigators say there may have
been an electrical fire near the cockpit that spread through the
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities say the insulation was implicated in fires
on at least four other jetliners before the Swissair crash.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas recommended in 1997, a year before the crash,
that Mylar-covered insulation be replaced with a
more-fire-retardant insulation at ''the earliest possible
maintenance period.'' The plane that crashed had undergone a major
overhaul two months before that recommendation and thus was not due
for another.
</P>
<P>
   The new FAA order, which was first proposed last August, affects
719 U.S.-registered aircraft operated by Alaska Airlines, American
Airlines, Boeing, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Federal
Express, Frontier Airlines, Midwest Express, Northwest Airlines,
Spirit Airlines, Trans World Airlines, US Airways and World
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The operators have five years to replace the insulation
blankets, a process that will cost about $368 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 of the planes operate worldwide, but the FAA can
only require changes by U.S. carriers. Other countries normally
follow the U.S. lead in such orders.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 45; Nasdaq Is Up 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 45 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead ten points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index is up three points.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing too alarming in the latest batch of economic
numbers, investors can focus more on recovering some of yesterday's
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The popular averages posted big losses on Thursday, wiping out
their gains from the day before.
</P>
<P>
   One feature of today's trading should be very light volume,
since today is the final session before the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the thin trading, we could see a bit of added
volatility in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Bond markets will be closing early today, ahead of the Memorial

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Fading Away  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could this really be the end? No more tawdry
testimony from Linda Tripp, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones or
Kathleen Willey? Just Bill Clinton tending to his legacy and trying
to hang onto his law license?
</P>
<P>
   Five years after Lewinsky as a White House intern first caught
the president's eye, two years after an unsuspecting nation awoke
to news of their affair, 15 months after Clinton shook off
impeachment, The Scandal That Wouldn't Die is fading away.
</P>
<P>
   It is ending as it began, with Tripp and her secretly recorded
tell-all tapes of Lewinsky. The state of Maryland dropped its
wiretapping charges against Tripp on Wednesday, assuring that she
may be remembered as a snitch, but not a felon.
</P>
<P>
   That eliminated any likelihood of Lewinsky being called to
rehash her all-too-intimate story in open court while Clinton still
occupies the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared oblivious to the moment's passing, dancing and
basking in the spotlight at a gala Wednesday night that raised a
record $26.5 million for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he said in 1992 he was the Comeback Kid, little did we
know he was the all-time Comeback Kid,'' said Robert Lichter,
president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonprofit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has settled into a job approval rating of around 60
percent, not bad for just the second president ever impeached. But
only about a fourth of Americans say he can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lewinsky is peddling purses on the Internet, Tripp is
suing her employers at the Pentagon and Willey, who accused Clinton
of making an unwanted sexual advance, has filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, booted out as House speaker largely because
Republican troops felt he mishandled their Lewinsky strategy, is
consulting and raising GOP cash.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has resigned as independent counsel, although his
successor, Robert Ray, hasn't ruled out the possibility of
indicting Clinton after the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus has largely shifted to another Clinton -- first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her run for a Senate seat in New
York -- and to the contest to determine the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for People and
the Press, predicted Americans will remember the Lewinsky matter as
''a blotch on some very good times'' -- an episode best forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''Watergate had a concluding chapter with Nixon leaving town. It
sort of got resolved,'' Kohut said. ''This got resolved in the
sense that Clinton continued in office but there's no basic sense
of coming to terms with what happened and why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no clear-cut ending,'' he said. ''It kind of dribbled
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even comedian Jay Leno managed only one Lewinsky-related joke in
a recent roast of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But a few footnotes remain: the Arkansas legal system is
wrestling with whether to take Clinton's law license away for
denying an affair with Lewinsky under oath. Its disciplinary
committee recommended disbarment this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that will impact on her lawsuit against the Pentagon,
Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized two Pentagon aides who
in 1998 released data from Tripp's personnel file that called her
credibility into question. Tripp's suit claims the release violated
her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tripp's secret tapings will be rewound for another
airing rests largely in the hands of Ray, the career prosecutor who
took over Starr's battle-scarred independent counsel office.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, the country will have moved on with a new
chief executive.

<HEADLINE> FAA Updates Emergency Procedures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal air traffic controllers will be
receiving new briefings on handling aircraft emergencies following
an incident in which a plane with a dying passenger was delayed
when trying to land, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A note was sent to air traffic control facility managers
asking them to provide controllers with a mandatory briefing on
assisting aircraft that are in an emergency situation,'' FAA
spokesman Fraser Jones said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The step was prompted by an incident last week in Baltimore
involving a US Airways flight.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways followed all on-board procedures, including the use
of a heart defibrillator, The Washington Post quoted an airline
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our sympathy certainly goes out to the family of the
passenger,'' said US Airways spokesman Richard Weintraub. ''The
passenger was also under the care of three nurses on the flight who
were in touch with our medical consultants at Medlink by the
plane's phone system.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old woman did not respond and the delayed landing
probably was not a factor in her death, the newspaper said, quoting
an unidentified source close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted that both the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board are reviewing the incident. The FAA is asking all
controllers to review the procedures for helping aircraft that
declare an emergency. Spokesman Eliot Brenner said the goal is to
see if a better job could have been done in getting the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, US Airways Flight 278 from Charlotte, N.C., to
Newark, N.J., declared a medical emergency about 50 miles east of
Baltimore, the Post quoted unidentified sources as saying. The
plane was turned toward Baltimore-Washington International Airport,
but 15 miles later was told to circle while waiting for other
traffic in the area to get out of the way.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 9; Nasdaq Down 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks seesawed in early trading today, despite
new data that indicated that U.S. economic growth may be
moderating.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 9.00 at 10,314.92. The blue-chip index
had risen more than 63 points in early trading before pulling back.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 1.02 at 1,380.50, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 6.08 at 3,199.27.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose in the first minutes of trading, but then retreated.
Analysts said thin volume ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend
was exaggerating moves in the market. U.S. financial markets will
be closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in stocks came despite two economic reports from the
Commerce Department that should have eased worries about rising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus was on the report showing orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, its biggest plunge since December 1991. The decline was
mostly attributed to a steep slump in orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the government reported that Americans' incomes rose
in April even faster than spending for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the point that bad news is good news for this
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Everyone wants to see signs of the economy slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflationary
pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hikes are designed to boost borrowing costs and try to
cool consumer spending, something that would help keep inflation in
check.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been under pressure in recent weeks as
investors fail to find any signs of a slowing economy, which could
convince the Fed to soon end its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks plummeted for the second straight day,
following a report from a Merrill Lynch analyst that Goldman Sachs
is likely to miss second-quarter earnings estimates. Goldman was
down 1 3/16 at 71 13/16, Lehman Brothers was off 2} at 69} and
Merrill Lynch was down 2 15/16 at 91].
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 100.18 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index 2.12 at 454.05.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.47 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.20 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.106 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 1.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Queens neighborhood rocked by five deaths at Wendy's  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Main Street in Flushing, Queens is a melting pot
of working families from all over the world. But the relatively
safe neighborhood is now forever scarred by the deaths of five
hard-working Wendy's restaurant employees, all shot in the head
execution-style during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Police are scouring the city today for a former Wendy's
employee, arrested in connection with a McDonald's robbery last
year, said a police investigator speaking on condition of
anonymity. Published reports said the man had missed a court date
and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The man is now wanted for questioning in the Wendy's shootings,
in which two gunmen conned their way into the restaurant late
Wednesday, killed the employees, and took about two thousand
dollars. Two employees survived and were able to call 911 for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most callous, worst crime that I've seen in a long
time,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Thursday, adding that
one or more of the employees knew the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   It was closing time when the killers walked into the fast-food
restaurant in a section of New York not far from Shea Stadium, home
of the New York Mets, and the USTA National Tennis Center, which
hosts the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The two men asked for the manager by name, then went to his
basement office. The manager then used an intercom to summon the
six employees left in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen ordered the six men and one woman into a walk-in
refrigerator, bound, gagged and shot them around 11:30 p.m.
Wednesday, Safir said. Four died at the scene, one on the way to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic bags were placed over all the victims' heads before they
were forced to lie face down. Then they were shot with a
.380-caliber handgun.
</P>
<P>
   The two wounded men -- identified by police as Joaquione Johnson,
18, and Patrick Castro, 23 -- were able to partially free themselves
and get to a basement telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the basement. We're locked in,'' Castro told the 911
operator, adding that his manager and other employees had been
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who was shot through both cheeks, helped Johnson
upstairs as police arrived. The cops saw the two wounded men
through the windows. But the door was locked, so they had to break
in.
</P>
<P>
   They found the other five employees in the basement
refrigerator. The five dead were identified by police as Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Queens; Anita C. Smith, 23, of Queens; Jeremy Ryan
Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Queens; and the
manager, Jean Aguste, 27, of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of Queens, was in critical condition at New York
Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Kevin, said the shooters' intention was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''They killed them all execution style,'' Kevin Johnson said.
''Everybody that was there got shot in the face, or shot in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was seen sitting up in his bed in the emergency room, his
head heavily swathed in bandages. He was released Thursday
afternoon and returned to his Queens apartment, but was placed
under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe robbery was the motive, saying up to $2,000 in
cash was stolen, along with a videotape from the restaurant's
security equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The former Wendy's employee arrested last June for a robbery at
a McDonald's in Queens last year was wanted for questioning, said
the police investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity. A
witness -- a woman at a bus stop near the Wendy's -- told police she
saw two men leave the restaurant around the time of the shooting,
and picked the former employee's picture out of a photo lineup, the
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's offered a $50,000 reward and the city $10,000 for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the people
responsible. Ed Choe, senior vice president for Wendy's operations,
said this was the first robbery at the restaurant in its two years
at that location.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most horrendous crime scene I've ever witnessed in
my nine years as district attorney of this county,'' said Richard
A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Although citywide crime rates have steeply declined in recent
years, New York's murder rate is on the rise so far this year, up
8.4 percent compared to the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, hundreds of people jammed sidewalks
opposite the Wendy's on Main Street in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt sorry. It's my co-workers. I just left them last
night,'' said Olga Purdie, calling the victims nice people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work together as a family. We work together as one,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Flushing is a neighborhood of working class families that is
believed to have the second largest Asian population in the nation
outside of San Francisco. Main Street, the neighborhood's hub, runs
under the No. 7 train, which spills crowds into a neighborhood that
bustles well into the evening.

Public funeral set for Sealy today

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Malik Sealy's family, teammates and friends
planned to gather today for the funeral of the Minnesota
Timberwolves player killed last weekend in a head-on crash in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A public service was scheduled for 10 a.m. EDT at Riverside
Church, an interdenominational Christian church in Manhattan. A
plane carrying Timberwolves players, staff members and their
families left Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport about 5
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   At a private service Thursday at St. James Church, Timberwolves
forward Kevin Garnett spoke publicly for the first time since
Sealy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, who spent most of the two-hour service hunched over in
a front-row pew, his head clasped in his hands, crying, broke into
a grin when he got up near the end of the service to address the
hundreds of mourners, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I'm smiling is because this is how I last remember
my man ... hundreds and hundreds of times,'' Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The smile soon vanished. Garnett broke down again and covered
his face with one of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to cry, you know?'' he said after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Souksangouane Phengsene, charged with three counts of vehicular
homicide in Sealy's death had his first court appearance postponed
Thursday because he was still hospitalized. It was rescheduled for
today.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Phengsene, 43, of Minneapolis, was
driving the wrong way on Minnesota Highway 100 in St. Louis Park
early Saturday morning when his pickup smashed into Sealy's sport
utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old player who helped the Timberwolves to their best
season in franchise history this year was returning from a birthday
celebration for Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Phengsene had a blood-alcohol level of nearly
twice the legal limit. Sealy also had been drinking before the
crash, but his blood alcohol level was 0.08 percent, within the
legal limit of 0.10 percent.

Weeks of heavy rains have taken toll throughout upstate
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHROON LAKE, N.Y. -- Wanted: Tents that float.
</P>
<P>
   At least one state campground will be partly closed this holiday
weekend because of high water on Lake Champlain. State Department
of Environmental Conservation officials said Ausable Point
campground will have 40 to 50 campsites available, only about a
third of its total, according to John Stevens, operations
supervisor at DEC's Ray Brook office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to open,'' Stevens said. ''Of course, you never
know about the weather here.'' It was raining Friday morning at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   High water on Great Sacandaga Lake will force the closure of 30
campsites and the day use area at the state campground at
Northampton Beach in Northville, 43 miles northwest of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   And soggy ground problems are being reported throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The water can't drain. It's got no place to go,'' Ed Anderson,
owner of Anderson's Sporting Goods in Schroon Lake, Essex County,
told the Glens Falls Post Star.
</P>
<P>
   Lake levels at Lake Champlain are 3 to 4 feet above normal in
the northern part of the lake and 6 to 7 feet above normal in the
South Bay area, so high that taller boats can't pass under the
bottom of the Route 22 bridge in Whitehall.
</P>
<P>
   High water like this is not uncommon to Adirondack lakes in
spring, with snowmelt annually pushing levels up. But it usually
begins to drop by late April. This year, the southern Adirondack
region has received 2 inches more rain than usual in April, and an
inch-and-a-half above normal so far in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''The watersheds are just full right now,'' said Fred Dunlap, an
environmental programming specialist with the state DEC in Ray
Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Lake George is about a foot above normal, said Jim McEnaney of
the DEC in Northville. ''The beach is nonexistent right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With still a week to go, the National Weather Service at
Binghamton Regional Airport has already declared May 2000 the
wettest May ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hay harvesting and corn planting on Chautauqua County farms have
likewise taken a heavy hit from all the rain, and at a critical
time for such crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has put everything on hold and we're starting to fall
behind,'' said Andrew N. Dufresne, extension educator/farm
management with Cornell Cooperative Extension-Chautauqua County.

<HEADLINE> Cohen, Spokesman Clash Over Tripp  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized his
chief spokesman for ''a serious lapse of judgment'' in releasing
information from Linda Tripp's personnel file in 1998, but critics
say Cohen let Kenneth Bacon off the hook for what amounted to a
''smear campaign'' against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a White House spokesman said President Clinton has full
confidence in Cohen's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has full confidence in the secretary of
defense's management of his staff and the Pentagon and supports the
judgment of the secretary of defense to take the actions
appropriate,'' said P.J. Crowley, a former Bacon aide and now chief
spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon on Thursday released an inspector general's report
which found that Bacon and Clifford H. Bernath -- who at the time
was Bacon's chief deputy -- had violated Tripp's privacy rights by
providing information from Tripp's security clearance records to a
reporter for The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The IG report recommended that Cohen take ''appropriate
corrective action,'' but was not more specific.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cohen sent letters to Bacon, the assistant
secretary for public affairs, and to Bernath, ''to express my
disappointment'' in their judgment. Cohen said their actions were
''hasty and ill-considered,'' but added: ''This was a departure
from the very high quality of performance that you have otherwise
exhibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the inspector general found that neither Bacon
nor Bernath had acted under influence from the White House, and
that neither man had intended to harm Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said Cohen considers the
matter closed and will take no further action.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, worked for Bacon in the Pentagon's
public affairs office, as did Lewinsky. Tripp remains a Defense
Department employee but works in a public affairs office outside
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's secret taping of conversations with Lewinsky gave
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr the starting point for his
perjury and obstruction probe of President Clinton that resulted in
the president's impeachment in the House and acquittal in a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon and Bernath were involved in revealing in March 1998 that
Tripp stated on a security clearance form she never had been
arrested. In fact, Tripp was arrested for grand larceny as a
teen-ager, a charge later reduced to loitering.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has filed a civil suit against the Defense Department over
the release of the information from her personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, who has called for Bacon's resignation,
denounced Cohen's response as a ''whitewash and cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The law was broken and nothing is being done about it,'' said
Inhofe, R-Okla., adding that Bacon and Bernath should be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department in April declined to seek prosecution,
saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that Bacon and
Bernath knowingly violated the Privacy Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawyers, in a statement, accused Bacon of having
participated knowingly in a ''public relations smear campaign''
orchestrated by the White House to undermine Tripp's credibility.
They urged Clinton to overturn Cohen's action and ''order proper
punishment and remedial actions'' against Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted that the IG report found that Bacon should have
consulted with the department's general counsel -- but did not --
before releasing any information about Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure to follow established procedures must be
considered a serious lapse in judgment,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said Cohen chose not to make his letters a part of
either Bacon's or Bernath's permanent personnel file. Cohen ordered
more training on the Privacy Act for all Pentagon public affairs
employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks seesawed today, as investors remained
nervous about continued interest rate hikes despite new data that
indicated that U.S. economic growth may be moderating.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 20.22 at 10,344.14. The blue-chip index rose more
than 63 points in early trading, then dropped 56 points, before
bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.07 at 1,382.59, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 7.65 at 3,197.70.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said thin volume ahead of the Memorial Day holiday
weekend was exaggerating moves in the market. U.S. financial
markets will be closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two economic reports from the Commerce Department should have
eased investors' worries about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus was on the report showing orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, its biggest plunge since December 1991. The decline was
mostly attributed to a steep slump in orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the government reported that Americans' spending
rose in April at its slowest pace in nine months. In addition,
personal income grew at a faster pace than spending for the second
straight month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the point that bad news is good news for this
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Everyone wants to see signs of the economy slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflationary
pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hikes are designed to boost borrowing costs and try to
cool consumer spending, something that would help keep inflation in
check.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been under pressure in recent weeks as
investors fail to find any signs of a slowing economy, which could
convince the Fed to soon end its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks plummeted for the second straight day,
following a report from a Merrill Lynch analyst that Goldman Sachs
is likely to miss second-quarter earnings estimates. Goldman was
down 1 1/16 at 71 15/16, Lehman Brothers was off 1 1/16 at 71 7/16
and Merrill Lynch was down 1 13/16 at 92{.
</P>
<P>
   Interest-rate worries hurt technology shares. Qualcom fell 5{ to
63{ and Dell Computer dropped 1 5/16 at 42 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 254.38 million
shares, down from 307.66 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.38 at 454.78.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Specialist Seymour Perry Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Seymour Perry, a cancer and medical
technology specialist, died of prostate cancer May 19 at his
Washington home. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Perry held cancer-related research positions at the National
Institutes of Health from 1961 to 1980, when he served briefly as
assistant surgeon general. Later that year, he became the first
director of the National Center for Health Care Technology, a
government agency that was later abolished.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Perry was a founder and president of the International
Society for Technology Assessment in Health Care. He was director
of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Health
Technology Assessment for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Perry chaired the department of community and family
medicine and served as director of the Institute for Health Care
Research and Policy at Georgetown University Medical Center, and
was a medical professor at the center.
</P>
<P>
   He published more than 250 papers on technology assessment,
cancer and other health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Perry completed his undergraduate studies at
the University of California at Los Angeles and graduated from the
University of Southern California's medical school.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Judith; sons Grant and
David Perry; daughter Anne Dunlap; sister Jean Mandler; and three
grandsons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Peru Election Delay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today called on Peru to
delay its weekend presidential runoff, saying that without a delay,
there is no way to ensure that the election is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it is regrettable that Peru decided, in spite of
''well-documented concerns'' from international monitors, to
proceed with Sunday's runoff between President Albert Fujimori and
economist Alejandro Toledo, who has refused to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a
democratic society,'' Clinton said. ''Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States was consulting with other nations
''to determine appropriate next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitors from the Organization of American States insisted the
elections be postponed at least 10 days to give their experts time
to evaluate ballot-counting software. The OAS said it would reduce
its mission to an absolute minimum because by international
standards, Peru's electoral process is tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even a relatively brief delay would give the OAS mission an
opportunity to monitor the electoral process with greater
confidence,'' Clinton said. ''As things stand, the OAS mission will
not monitor Sunday's vote. I believe that is the correct decision
under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Fujimori win the runoff -- a virtual certainty since
Toledo refuses to compete -- he would remain in office for a third
five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Parachutist Found Buried in Mud  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Police worked Friday to determine the
identity of a man who robbed people aboard a Philippine Airlines
plane and then jumped 6,000 feet to his death with a homemade
lavender parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and police recovered the man's body -- found Thursday
with only his hands and knees protruding from the mud -- in the
village of Llavac about 40 miles east of Manila, regional police
chief Charlemagne Alejandrino said.
</P>
<P>
   With the body were both a residence certificate identifying him
as Augusto Lakandula and a driver's license identifying him as
Reginald Chua.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed the body, which was sent to Manila for an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fuller picture emerged Friday of the drama for the
277 other passengers and 14 crew members aboard the flight Thursday
from Davao City in the southern Philippines to Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin crew had just served snacks and was seated close to
the cockpit when a man wearing a blue ski mask appeared from behind
crew safety trainer Ida Bernasconi, clutching a grenade in one hand
and a pistol in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a holdup! This is a holdup!'' he said, seizing flight
attendant Meg Bueno from behind, wrapping one arm around her body
and pointing the gun at her neck. He ordered Bueno to open the door
to the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The man showed his grenade to the pilots and told them to return
to Davao City, but they replied the plane did not have enough fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, Emmanuel Generoso, the most senior of the three
pilots on board, took control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker was ''deranged'' and crying, saying that his family
had left him, the pilot said. At one point he fired his gun,
perhaps accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   The distraught man said he wanted money and Generoso offered him
all his cash, but the man wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   He forced the crew to take up a collection from the passengers.
They put the cash in a small plastic bag and gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   When the man said he wanted to jump, he told a crew member to
get his backpack and open the rear door. In his pack was a lavender
homemade parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin was depressurized. The plane circled Manila.
Passengers were told to strap on their seat belts. A powerful gust
of wind blew in the open door, forcing the man back.
</P>
<P>
   Another crew trainer, Francis Cabel, persuaded him to go ahead
and jump.
</P>
<P>
   Generoso said he had instructed the crew to push the man out of
the plane if he hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials reported finding the man's body Thursday night,
but because communist rebels operate in the area the recovery was
delayed until after daylight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His parachute was found about half a mile from the body.
</P>
<P>
   A village leader, Basilio Quismundo, told DZMM Radio that
residents saw a plane circling on Thursday afternoon, and saw
something fall from it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the parachute opened, and they saw a man floating for
about five minutes, but then he separated from the parachute and
fell into the forested mountains, Quismundo said.
</P>
<P>
   The chute, about 10 to 15 yards in diameter, could have saved
the man if he had had time to fasten it to his body better, said
officer Rolando Detabali.
</P>
<P>
   It was made of material like that used in army parachutes, or
even stronger, with tough nylon cords, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered $33 of the man's loot. With his body were two
small-caliber bullets and several photographs.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Leader Tries To End Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's prime minister assured the nation Friday he
did not support the wartime imperial system, trying to reverse the
slide in popularity polls that followed his calling the country a
''divine nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech, Yoshiro Mori took responsibility for the
plummeting public support for his government and declared his
commitment to the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mori prompted controversy when he called
Japan a ''divine nation'' with the emperor at the center --
recalling for many the emperor-worship that drove Japan's wartime
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was educated under the current constitution,'' Mori
explained Friday. ''It is a matter of course for me to think of the
emperor as the symbol of the nation,'' and not the divine emperor
of the previous constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The ''divine nation'' speech was just one of several scandals
that have hit Mori since he took office April 5, after predecessor
Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke. Obuchi died May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Reports have surfaced saying the new leader was caught in a
brothel while he was a college student, and that he attended a 1995
wedding reception where a gangster was among the guests.
</P>
<P>
   He is suing the magazine that first printed the brothel
allegations, and has denied knowing of the gangster's presence at
the reception.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals have hurt the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
chances in advance of the June 25 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has made the most of the scandals, pushing for a
no-confidence vote in parliament. The popularity of Mori's
administration was also flagging, according to polls published this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Polls are one way of judging public feeling,'' he said. ''I
must admit that my remarks played a part in the decline in
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori's comments Friday were unlikely to mollify the opposition,
which has sensed a chance for gains in parliament in the upcoming
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever excuse he makes, the statement itself is a mistake,''
Yukio Hatoyama, head of the opposition Democratic Party, said
Thursday. ''Unless he apologizes, we will not be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how damaging the scandal would turn out to be for
the ruling party, which has maintained its hold on power for most
of the years since World War II. The party currently governs in a
coalition that holds a majority in both houses of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Slain APTN Cameraman Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chechnya, Kosovo, Bosnia, Sierra Leone: He'd go on a moment's
notice, video camera at the ready, documenting the violence that
humans do unto each other and demanding, with image after image,
that the world pay attention. And until this week, Miguel Gil
Moreno de Mora always came back.
</P>
<P>
   His death Wednesday in West Africa -- at the hands of the same
Sierra Leone rebel group that killed his Associated Press
Television News colleague, Myles Tierney, little more than a year
ago -- ended a brief but astonishingly full journalism career that
carried him to the planet's bleakest pockets.
</P>
<P>
   It was something the 32-year-old cameraman saw as a calling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt it was his responsibility to show the world the people
who are suffering. And he suffered if he couldn't show that,'' said
Tim Sullivan, AP's West Africa bureau chief, who was reporting
elsewhere in Sierra Leone when Gil Moreno de Mora was killed. The
two often worked together covering African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues rarely struggled for adjectives -- before or after Gil
Moreno de Mora died. Cool-headed. Deeply religious. Soothing.
Intense. Generous without any reason. ''A big man -- big of heart,''
said Madrid-based AP photographer Santiago Lyon. ''Single-minded,''
said AP Nairobi bureau chief Susan Linnee. ''One of the most
intelligent cameramen of his generation,'' said APTN head of news
Nigel Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ''The corporate lawyer who roared into Sarajevo on a motorbike,
and with it transformed his life and the lives of everybody he
touched thereafter,'' remembered APTN Managing Editor Sandy
MacIntyre in London.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was renowned for his versatility -- no small
matter in an Information Age industry that demands more of it than
ever. At the AP, a news cooperative whose stock-in-trade is not
only words and images and sounds but technology and versatility as
well, Gil Moreno de Mora was that most valuable of employees -- the
guy who could do pretty much everything, and do it well.
</P>
<P>
   ''One time, Miguel said the camera could be his forehead, and he
could just put all his concentration into what he was doing,''
Linnee said. ''He would have said that the story was much more
important than him, that he was a vehicle to get people to pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a cameraman (and initially a radio stringer as well), Gil
Moreno de Mora also loved writing. On Monday, his reporting of
possible U.N. peacekeeper bodies found east of the Sierra Leone
capital earned him a byline on the AP newspaper wires -- a rarity
for a cameraman, but something he had done in Chechnya and the
former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   The story appeared Tuesday in major newspapers around the world.
Gil Moreno de Mora was excited, and asked AP writers in Freetown to
find out where it ran.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora's life was not the kind many would
seek -- or even understand.
</P>
<P>
   He was a young corporate lawyer from Spain who decided, somewhat
abruptly, to become a journalist. One day in late 1994, Gil Moreno
de Mora came to the AP office in Sarajevo on his motorcycle and
asked if there were any videotapes he could ferry out. He stuck
around, and eventually worked with senior producer Mike Sposito and
Sarajevo staff cameraman Eldar Emric to learn the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   He had nowhere to stay and nothing to eat, so AP staffers let
him sleep under a desk. ''Slowly he became something like an
inventory item,'' said Sarajevo AP staffer Aida Cerkez-Robinson.
''We fed him with parts of portions we received. Later I discovered
he shared that food with children in the neighborhood which I had
already fed that day, so the children ended up with more food then
what Miguel and I consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora became the one who crossed the lines, who
worked with Bosnian Muslim TV crews on one side and Bosnian Serb
crews on the other. He went on to follow reports of atrocities in
Srebrenica. He would regularly cross the dangerous Mount Igman pass
that connected Sarajevo with the outside world, shuttling AP
staffers in and out.
</P>
<P>
   One day, toward the end of that war, he hadn't seen MacIntyre
and Sposito for a long time. On a rare day off, he rose early and
drove 14 hours to Tuzla to see them. ''He spent an hour with us,
had a cup of coffee and drove back,'' MacIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   As Gil Moreno de Mora's resume grew, so did his reputation -- for
grace under fire and for thoughtful decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''He exuded a certain calmness that people picked up on, that
made them feel safer,'' Lyon says. ''Even when things were really
ugly, Miguel would always be focused and concentrated, with his
camera up to his eye when it needed to be and down by his side when
it needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He covered Zaire, later Congo, and other African violence. In
Kosovo last year, competitors viewed him as ''the guy who always
came back with the pictures.'' When the NATO bombing began, he
persuaded Serb authorities in Pristina that he should be allowed to
remain. ''What if your television station is bombed and you have no
way to tell your story?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs let him stay. And when other reporters tried to stay
as well, he worried they were in danger -- and offered to share his
footage so they could leave without guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid-based AP writer Adam Brown remembers when he, Gil Moreno
de Mora and a Spanish photographer were heading into a town being
shelled by Serbs. Suddenly, Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
jumped onto the road and began shooting into the vehicle. The
journalists hit the floor; when they came up, hands raised, the
head guerrilla, Abi Berisha, was aiming a rocket launcher at them.
''We were all sure we were going to die,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   But then the guerrillas realized the three were journalists, not
enemies. Berisha, says Brown, was so upset that he broke down in
tears. Gil Moreno de Mora walked over, put his arm around Berisha
and slapped him on the back. ''No problem,'' the cameraman said.
''Just calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That was Miguel,'' Brown says. On Friday, the old KLA command
said it planned to send condolences to Gil Moreno de Mora's family
in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon remembers being pinned in a Kosovo cornfield with Gil
Moreno de Mora, who shot footage that would later win Britain's
Rory Peck Award. And when it came time to accept the award, Gil
Moreno de Mora was reluctant to leave the story. ''But his bosses
wanted him to go,'' Lyon remembers. ''So he put on a tuxedo,
received the prize and then went back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was deeply affected when Tierney, his friend,
colleague and good-natured rival, was killed in Sierra Leone in
January 1999. ''Myles understood people in pain,'' he said at a New
York memorial service. ''He cared for them because each was an
individual to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Though he might never say it in as many words, he felt guilt
at Myles' death,'' MacIntyre said. ''He felt perhaps he should have
been there. There was guilt there. There was no reason for it, but
it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Later last year, Gil Moreno de Mora went to Chechnya and
petitioned Chechen rebels to allow him behind their lines -- again
using his lawyerly skills of persuasion. Again, it worked. His
footage helped shape the world's view of that troubled region's
second war in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after he received the 1999 Royal Television Society's
cameraman of the year award in Britain for his work in Kosovo, Gil
Moreno de Mora was in Sierra Leone. Not surprising: The situation
was getting bad again.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he was with three Reuters journalists --
correspondent Kurt Schork, photographer Yannis Behrakis and
cameraman Mark Chisholm -- when they were ambushed near Rogberi
Junction, 54 miles east of Freetown. Behrakis, in a first-person
account for Reuters, said armed men in T-shirts jumped up from the
roadside and began shooting. He saw Schork get shot in the head,
then saw Gil Moreno de Mora's car being hit before he escaped into
the bush.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schork and Gil Moreno de Mora were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end I find solace in the fact that Miguel was doing the
job he loved and died doing the work he felt ordained for,'' said
Gil Moreno de Mora's mother, Maria de Patrocinio Macian Blaya. ''He
felt his mission was to give voice to those who did not have one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, where Gil Moreno de Mora was something of a celebrity,
the newspaper El Mundo on Friday ran an editorial tribute to him
called ''Death of a Journalist.'' It lauded the efforts of those
who report on human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''One could think that those millions of defenseless beings have
no hope. But the words and the images that journalists in the midst
of the horror bring to us do more than transmit a moving reality.
They elicit a personal and collective solidarity that ... can
alleviate the suffering and save lives,'' El Mundo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where some communications media convert reality
into a spectacle, the editorial said, journalists like Gil Moreno
de Mora ''ennoble the profession and provide a high ethical
example. Miguel Gil has paid very dearly for his vocation of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Kosovo, Koha Ditore, Pristina's most prominent newspaper,
devoted its entire front page Friday to the deaths. ''We found out
about what was happening in the villages around Pristina through
Miguel's camera,'' Koha publisher Veton Surroi said.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his mother, a brother and a sister. Colleagues
were gathering this weekend for a Roman Catholic funeral in
Barcelona, Spain, where he will be buried at a monastery. ''In some
ways,'' MacIntyre said, ''he was a missionary with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Miguel never stopped being a lawyer,'' Cerkez-Robinson said.
''Only now he represented Les Miserables in front of the public,
talking on behalf of them about their misery that was imposed on
them without their will and guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora is the 25th AP journalist to die on
duty since the organization was founded in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't infallible. I think he would have liked to have
been,'' Linnee says. ''He was kind of like this pure essence that
burned. Maybe he just kind of burned himself out. Maybe he was just
consumed.''

<HEADLINE> Students accused of extorting teacher in Internet deception  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Investigators say three high school
seniors posed as a 23-year-old woman on the Internet and tried to
lure a teacher into engaging in cybersex so they could blackmail
him.
</P>
<P>
   The three Cicero-North Syracuse High School students wanted the
teacher to pay them each $50 to keep quiet and not distribute
copies of the e-mails that passed between them.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Mack Jr., 18, was charged Thursday with attempted
grand larceny and coercion, said Onondaga County Sheriff's Deputy
John D'Eredita. Joshua Decker, also 18, and a 17-year-old were
arrested on the same charges Wednesday, D'Eredita said. The
17-year-old was not identified because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   All three students were issued tickets on the misdemeanor
charges and are to appear in Cicero Town Court June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department would not release the teacher's name
because detectives were still investigating the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to D'Eredita, the students obtained the personal
e-mail address of the teacher, whom they knew as a cafeteria
monitor. The students are accused of sending instant e-mail
messages to him last month, posing as a 23-year-old woman. The
teacher, unaware of the senders' identity, responded, trying to
identify the ''woman.''
</P>
<P>
   After corresponding for weeks, the students tried to entice the
teacher into sending sexual messages back and forth by e-mail. When
the teacher didn't participate, the students asked him to enter a
chat room, where messages are accessible to many more Internet
users than in instant e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the chat room, the students revealed their identities to
the teacher, who stopped corresponding with them.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two weeks, the students began teasing the
teacher in the lunchroom. The teacher joked with the students until
they threatened to distribute copies of their correspondence unless
he paid them each $50.
</P>
<P>
   North Syracuse Superintendent Jerome Melvin said the teacher
told school officials about the incident last week. The school
district has begun disciplinary proceedings against the students,
he said. Melvin would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The students did not use school computers in their
correspondence with the teacher, D'Eredita said.
</P>
<P>
   The students are to be in Cicero Town Court June 6.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Undergoes Heart Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet underwent heart
tests at a military hospital Friday for about two hours but results
were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The Santiago Military Hospital said the 84-year-old former
dictator ''has taken a stress echocardiogram and other
complementary tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital visit was not an emergency and had been planned,
the hospital said in a brief communique. The Pinochet Foundation, a
private group of supporters and former aides to Pinochet, confirmed
the hospital account.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet arrived at the hospital in his motorcade under heavy
security.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of hours, he emerged in a wheelchair and
surrounded by bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was released in March after 16 months under house
arrest outside London. The British government ruled he was too ill
to be extradited to Spain to face charges stemming from human
rights abuses during his 1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
   He is known to have diabetes and suffered three mild strokes
during his confinement in London.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Chile, Pinochet is also facing a legal battle stemming
from the abuses under his regime. A court this week stripped him of
his congressional immunity, paving the way for prosecution. He is
appealing to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Panel Finds Torture by Turkish Cops  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A shocking report by a parliamentary human
rights panel documents cases of torture in police stations across
Turkey, contradicting government assertions that abuse is not
systematic.
</P>
<P>
   The six-volume report, obtained Friday by The Associated Press,
includes photographs of torture cells with exposed electrical wires
and bars from which prisoners are suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as Turkey is pressing to improve its human
rights record, a key condition that the European Union has set
before seriously considering the country's admission into the
group.
</P>
<P>
   The government has repeatedly said that while cases of torture
do occur, officers guilty of abuses are prosecuted and torture is
not systematic. The parliamentary report, the result of a two-year
survey by a 25-member commission, gives a far different picture.
</P>
<P>
   It shows pictures of wooden poles placed under prisoners arms
and used to suspend them in the air, metal bars used to beat
suspects on the soles of their feet, and exposed electric cables
found in rooms in which the walls were covered with black leather
for soundproofing.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, led by Sema Piskinsut of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit's Democratic Left Party, said police stations sometimes
appeared to have just been cleaned before its visits.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases they were hiding the evidence and showing us the
wrong rooms,'' Piskinsut said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that in the southeastern town of Batman, evidence of
torture that was found during a 1998 visit was discovered again
during a visit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Piskinsut said she will demand urgent meetings with the
ministers of justice and interior, and a debate in parliament on
the committee's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ecevit launched a campaign against torture that
included surprise searches of police stations and quicker
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the panel's printed report were published Friday
on the front page of Milliyet, a leading Turkish newspaper -- the
first time that the committee's findings have been made public in
detail.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect, who was arrested in 1998 in the southern city of
Sanliurfa for stealing a tractor, said he was given electric shocks
on his genitals during his interrogation at the local police
station. Suphi Dildas also told legislators that he was hung from a
ceiling by his feet and dropped on concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Dildas, who was interviewed in 1998, had bruises
on his ankles, where he said he was tied, and on his head and
forehead. He was also shivering as he spoke and was unable to stand
without the help of friends, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission members spoke with more than 100 torture victims
and said that the accounts of the victims matched evidence in
police stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good morning!'' Husnu Ondul, president of the Istanbul-based
Human Rights Association, said when asked about the committee's
findings. ''We have been saying for years that torture is
widespread and systemic in Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Ondul said that 594 cases of torture, many involving Kurds and
left-wing activists, were reported last year and that nine people
died of torture.
</P>
<P>
   Activists have said that doctors are often pressured not to
report torture cases. Activists are calling for an end to detention
periods in which suspects in most of the country can be held for
four days without access to a lawyer. In the southeast, where
soldiers are battling Kurdish rebels, detainees can be held for
seven days without access to a lawyer.

<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The Azerbaijan parliament on Friday
ratified a package of agreements on construction of an oil pipeline
from the petroleum-rich Caspian Sea state to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Georgia last November
signed an agreement to build the pipeline, and the 95-0
ratification in parliament brings the project a step closer to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The 850-mile pipeline, costing an estimated $2.4 billion, is
planned to be in operation by the end of 2004. The pipeline will
lead from Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, where the oil
can be loaded on ships for transport to world markets.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 6; Nasdaq Down 25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today as investors
remained nervous about interest rates despite indications that U.S.
economic growth may be moderating.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 6.17 at 10,330.09 after changing direction several
times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower after swinging between
positive and negative territory. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 3.66 at 1,377.86, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
25.28 at 3,180.07.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said thin volume ahead of the Memorial Day holiday
weekend was exaggerating moves in the market. U.S. financial
markets will be closed Monday, and many investors were reluctant to
take on any new positions in advance of the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Two economic reports from the Commerce Department helped ease
some investor worries about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus was on the report showing orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, its biggest plunge since December 1991. The decline was
mostly attributed to a steep slump in orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the government reported Americans' spending rose in
April at its slowest pace in nine months. Personal income grew at a
faster pace than spending for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the point that bad news is good news for this
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Everyone wants to see signs of the economy slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflationary
pressures under control. The rate hikes are designed to boost
borrowing costs and try to cool consumer spending, something that
would help contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been under pressure in recent weeks as
investors fail to find any signs of a slowing economy, which could
convince the Fed to soon end its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks fell for the second straight day, following a
report from a Merrill Lynch analyst that Goldman Sachs is likely to
miss second-quarter earnings estimates. Goldman was down 3 7/16 at
69 9/16, Merrill Lynch was off 4 13/16 at 89{ and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter was down 1 5/16 at 63].
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney became the latest Goldman rival to raise
concerns about its earnings. Salomon analyst Guy Moszkowski lowered
his estimate for Goldman's second-quarter earnings to $1.35 a share
from $1.50 a share, citing concerns about the impact of recent
market turmoil on the firm's private equity investments and trading
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate worries hurt technology shares. Qualcomm fell 5
13/16 to 63 3/16 and Dell Computer dropped 1 15/16 to 41 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 515.48 million
shares, down from 625.51 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.91 at 455.26.

<HEADLINE> Malik Sealy mourned at funeral  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Malik Sealy's family, teammates and friends
gathered today for the funeral of the Minnesota Timberwolves player
killed in a crash by a man charged with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Former St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca and current coach Mike
Jarvis were among the strong contingent from Sealy's former
university that attended the service at Riverside Church, not far
from where the 30-year-old swingman grew up in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, wearing dark glasses, Mark Jackson and Chris
Mullin were there from the Indiana Pacers, who are in New York for
playoff games with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Buses and limousines pulled up alongside the stately church
overlooking the Hudson River, and about 3,000 mourners entered to
grieve one of the Timberwolves' most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is one consolation that stands out -- Malik touched many
people,'' Carnesecca said during a ceremony that was more
celebration than mourning. ''Malik was the captain on my last team
and made those last years a real joy by his example and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the man upstairs will have a spot for him on the
starting five.''

<P>
   Sealy, who helped the Timberwolves to their best season in
franchise history this year, was returning from a birthday
celebration for teammate Kevin Garnett when he was killed early
last Saturday in a head-on crash.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, one of the pallbearers Friday, was among dozens of NBA
players, along with league commissioner David Stern, at a nearly
three-hour service in a church where Sealy played youth league
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fitting. It was a classy service for a very classy
individual,'' said Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders, who wore a
black-and-silver lapel pin with Sealy's No. 2. ''We have to do what
Malik would want. The team has to bond together and move on. He may
not be there physically, but he'll always be there spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   At a private service Thursday at St. James Church in Manhattan,
Garnett spoke publicly for the first time since Sealy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, who spent most of the two-hour service hunched over in
a front-row pew, his head clasped in his hands, crying, broke into
a grin when he got up near the end of the service to address the
hundreds of mourners, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I'm smiling is because this is how I last remember
my man ... hundreds and hundreds of times,'' Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The smile soon vanished. Garnett broke down again and covered
his face with one of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to cry, you know?'' he said after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Souksangouane Phengsene, charged with three counts of vehicular
homicide in Sealy's death, had his first court appearance postponed
Thursday because he was still hospitalized. It was rescheduled for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said Phengsene, 43, of Minneapolis, was
driving the wrong way on a highway in suburban St. Louis Park early
Saturday when his pickup smashed into Sealy's sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Phengsene had a blood-alcohol level of nearly
twice the legal limit. Sealy also had been drinking before the
crash, but his blood alcohol level was 0.08 percent, within the
legal limit of 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was the second NBA player killed in a car accident this
year. Charlotte Hornets guard Bobby Phills died Jan. 12, when he
and teammate David Wesley were racing their Porsches after a
morning practice.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Confronts Critics  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The politician crucial to the
restoration of Northern Ireland's joint Protestant-Catholic
administration said Friday he would confront his party critics in a
make-or-break moment for the province's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''We either go forward now, in confidence, or we retreat back
into the failures of the past,'' said Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble, whose badly divided Protestant party will vote Saturday on
whether to resume a historic coalition that includes members of the
Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prevent a disastrous defeat on the issue, Trimble last
week delayed the vote within his party's 860-member grassroots
council. He must persuade a majority to back the resumption of
power-sharing or Britain cannot follow through on its plans to
transfer powers back to local hands on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist activists on both sides of the bitter argument
say the outcome remains too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble prevails, Britain would be free to transfer authority
back to the four-party Cabinet, the intended central pillar of the
Good Friday accord. If he loses, he could be ousted as Ulster
Unionist leader in favor of a hard-liner -- scuttling the whole
power-sharing structure.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member administration was formed last December under
Trimble's fragile leadership. But Britain stripped the Cabinet of
power in February, citing the IRA's refusal to begin discarding its
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Facing international criticism, the IRA dramatically shifted its
position three weeks ago, promising it would gradually put its
hidden weapons stockpiles ''completely and verifiably beyond use''
if the power-sharing government first resumed business.
</P>
<P>
   The British, Irish and U.S. governments welcomed the pledge as a
start down the path to total disarmament, but many Ulster Unionists
remain skeptical about whether ''beyond use'' really means
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should proceed to put the IRA undertaking to put arms
'beyond use' to the test,'' Trimble said, adding, ''We earnestly
hope that that will happen. We think the best way of achieving that
is, indeed, to proceed to reform the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's most dangerous opponent within the Ulster Unionists,
Jeffrey Donaldson, said Friday after a closed-door meeting with the
party leader that he would present voters with a rival
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The Donaldson formula would require the IRA to begin disarming
before Sinn Fein could regain its two Cabinet posts, a long-held
Ulster Unionist position that Trimble abandoned late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that for many of us, the IRA statement does not
provide the clarity and certainty that Ulster Unionists need on the
decommissioning of illegal weapons,'' Donaldson wrote in a letter
sent Friday to all Ulster Unionist Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, a former IRA chief of staff who became Sinn
Fein's education minister in the suspended Cabinet, appealed for
Ulster Unionists to back Trimble and help ''build a new future.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ulster Unionist Party holds the key to that future,''
McGuinness said. ''It will decide if the Good Friday agreement
survives or fails.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki seeks to change Greenway directors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pataki administration has ordered the
chairmen of the state's two Hudson River Greenway groups to fire
their longtime executive directors, officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Sampson and Maggie Vinciguerra have been executive
directors of, respectively, the Greenway Communities Council and
the Greenway Conservancy since the groups' inception in 1991. The
groups help develop tourism along the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sampson, Communities Council Chairman Barnabus
McHenry and Conservancy Chairman Matthew Bender were called this
week into the office of Gov. George Pataki's appointments
secretary, Tom Doherty, and told to fire the two executive
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Bender said he and McHenry were told to either terminate their
directors or have their boards do it when they meet jointly June 7.
</P>
<P>
   But Bender said he will not fire Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see no reason as a responsible chairman to replace her, and
I do not intend to do so,'' he told the Times Union of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said today that the governor has
been a consistent champion of the Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   ''As with any organization, there are times that new leadership
brings new energy and new vitality, and that only works to the
benefit of the Greenway and the communities that it serves,''
McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said the administration would expect the Greenway boards
to follow the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental group, called
the administration's plan to replace the pair ''bizarre,''
''unreasonable'' and ''wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office has already selected a replacement for
Sampson -- Barbara Murphy, a former employee of Scenic Hudson,
according to McKeon. A candidate for the conservancy post now held
by Vinciguerra has been offered the job but has not yet accepted,
McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the jobs pay $100,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> Strategy May Change in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- With federal forces making little progress
against rebel fighters in breakaway Chechnya, a top Russian general
said Friday the military was changing strategy to focus on the
elimination of rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gennady Troshev, who leads the Russian troops in Chechnya,
said Russia would consider initiating peace talks with the rebels
after the field commanders are wiped out. But he ruled out talks
with top rebel leaders, including Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow wants to negotiate ''with those Chechens who understand,
not those with weapons in their hands,'' Troshev said on the NTV
television station. He said the new strategy called for ''the
apprehension or elimination of the bands' leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have had little success ousting rebels from
strongholds in Chechnya's southern mountains since invading the
republic in September, and the conflict shows no sign of ending
soon. Russia relies on air and artillery raids on the rebels, who
strike back with ambushes on Russian convoys, often behind federal
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels also have launched sporadic attacks in Grozny, the
Chechen capital, even though the main rebel contingents fled the
city this winter. Two Russian checkpoints in Grozny were shelled on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city's military commandant, Gen. Vasily Prizmelin, on Friday
denied any full rebel detachments are still in Grozny, but said
individual rebels remain and may have infiltrated the local police
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional calls for negotiations with Chechens have also
brought little result, partly because Moscow's conditions for talks
are not likely to be met. Moscow says the rebels must lay down
their weapons and abandon their drive for independence. It also
says they must turn in suspected hostage-takers who made Chechnya
extremely dangerous for both Russians and foreigners in the years
after it gained de-facto independence in a 1994-96 war with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, federal jets kept up bombing raids near the
border between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan, where rebels have attacked federal troops.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan was the site of several rebel incursions last year
leading to the Russian ground offensive that began in September,
and the federal command has said the militants are planning more
attacks inside the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said they were also bracing for attacks in
Chechnya's largest towns -- Grozny, Gudermes and Argun -- according
to Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some Grozny residents on Friday went about trying to restore
some sense of normalcy to the city, devastated by intense air and
artillery shelling. Teams of women cleared debris from main streets
and applied new coats of paint to the local mayor's office and
several other administrative buildings left standing after the
Russians' months-long siege.
</P>
<P>
   Without electricity, water or gas and a lack of tools or money,
the progress was slow. The women said they received extra
humanitarian aid for their work, but had not been paid anything.

<HEADLINE> Postal officials allegedly let tax returns pile up  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state tax commissioner and postal
officials are working on improvements in certified mail service
after state income tax payments-- including a $10 million check--
were reportedly left unprocessed for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The postal service ''did not provide enough resources to handle
the certified mail, this year in particular,'' said Revenue
Services Commissioner Gene Gavin.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin met this week with postal officials and both sides have
agreed to continue meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They promised to put more resources in this area,'' Gavin
said. ''They have admitted that they fouled up on the process and
we're going to meet again in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Postal service spokeswoman Christine Dugas said an increase this
year in checks sent by certified mail contributed to the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my understanding that we've met with the state department
and worked out plans to work out any problems with certified
mailing,'' she said. ''We have worked out a plan. We're going to
triple the number of folks we have at those posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin said he is waiting for a reply from a letter he sent May
11 to Postmaster General William Henderson asking that the
certified mail process be improved nationally. While Connecticut's
service is sluggish, it is better than other states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen the letter so it's hard to comment,'' said
Dugas, adding that she was not aware any problems or complaints
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The DRS has battled with the post office since 1987 for faster
certified mail processing, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The state received more tax payments this year, likely because
of capital gains. Typically, large checks, like the one for $10
million, are received by certified mail.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tax deadline was April 18, but according to the
president of the Hartford postal workers' union, mail was piling up
weeks before that date.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of April 12, the mail was there, and the postal service
didn't start processing until two weeks later,'' said Stephen R.
Peters, president of Hartford Local 147 of the American Postal
Workers Union, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The DRS received 46,270 pieces of certified mail from May 2-6,
with checks estimated at about $120 million. The extra money was
not discovered until after the Legislature had approved a budget
and agreed on how to spend the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers made provisions in the budget for extra surplus money
to pay off debt and fund school construction projects, rather than
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news in the end is all of a sudden we have more money
than we expected,'' Gavin said.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Rejection Unleashes Debate  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Laura Spence has outstanding grades and is heading
to Harvard on a $25,000-a-year scholarship. The British government
says that's a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Not because the 18-year-old public school graduate is going to
Harvard, but because she was rejected by Oxford University -- a move
that has reignited a long-running debate about elitism in the
British education system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a scandal if a child has to go to Harvard rather
than getting into Oxford, don't you?'' Education Secretary David
Blunkett said Friday in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Spence earned top grades of ''A-star'' in all 10 subjects she
attempted in the General Certificate of Secondary Education exams
taken by some 600,000 students per year -- nearly all British
16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was denied admission to Oxford's Magdalen College.
</P>
<P>
   At fault is ''an interview system that is more reminiscent of
the old-boy network and the old-school tie than genuine justice in
our society,'' Treasury chief Gordon Brown asserted in a speech
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say it is now time that these old universities open their
doors to women and to people from all backgrounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spence, Brown noted, comes from a region of northeastern England
where residents complain they get fewer opportunities than people
in the richer, more populous south.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Smith, Magdalen College president, said that of five
openings for medical students this year, three went to women. In
addition, three of the successful applicants also came from ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''And yet Mr. Brown is complaining that we are not giving enough
space to females and to people from different backgrounds,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spence had 10 A-star grades, ''so, too, did the 22 other
applicants for the five places we had available,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford and Cambridge University now take slightly more than half
their students -- 53 percent -- from publicly funded schools, known
as comprehensives. However, the other 47 percent all come from
elite private schools such as Eton and Harrow, which only serve 7
percent of secondary students.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC said one of its reporters had seen notes of Spence's
admissions interview at Magdalen.
</P>
<P>
   ''As with other comprehensive school pupils, (Spence was) low in
confidence and difficult to draw out of herself despite being able
to manifestly think on her feet,'' the BBC quoted the notes as
saying. Still, the notes concluded that Spence ''will be an
excellent doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears as if some of our institutions have admissions
procedures which, maybe implicitly, and maybe because of absurd
prejudices against children from comprehensive schools ... are not
giving these children a fair crack of the whip,'' Education
Minister Malcolm Wicks told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Jenkins, who chairs the British Medical Association's
committee on students, said his group has long been concerned about
making medical schools more accessible to a wider range of
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not just about students with the right grades. The
medical profession needs doctors from all walks of life,'' Jenkins
said. ''It is much easier for 'Henry from Harrow' to achieve the
necessary grades with all the extra resources at his disposal.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Pinning Hopes on Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Armored buses carried Israeli children to
school in border communities Friday as U.N. teams fanned out in an
operation Israelis hope will protect them from Hezbollah guerrillas
just across the frontier in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Israel's side of the border, U.N. officials set out blue
poles marking the border with Lebanon, using satellite dishes to
determine exact coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would send several
thousand peacekeeping troops to south Lebanon once the United
Nations formally verified that Israel's withdrawn from a border
zone it occupied for 18 years was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants the troops to fill the vacuum left by its
withdrawal Wednesday. Since then, Hezbollah guerrillas and their
supporters have held demonstrations on the border daily, shouting
threats and insults.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, soldiers blocked scores of curious Israelis from
approaching a strip of border between Metulla and the Lebanese
village of Kfar Kila, where demonstrators threw rocks and a
firebomb over the fence. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, Lebanese and Israeli civilians managed to
exchange a few words before Israeli soldiers cleared the area.
</P>
<P>
   Children living along the border went to school Friday in
armored buses borrowed from Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Northern residents fear the withdrawal will mean a return to the
deadly terrorist attacks that preceded Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. In 1972, guerrillas fired shots across the border at a
school bus carrying children from the border town of Avivim,
killing 12.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. teams toured south Lebanon, verifying that Israel's troops
and its allied militia have really gone. On the Israeli side, from
the coastal town of Rosh Hanikra to the communal farm of Malkhia 24
miles east, the U.N. border markings matched Israel's drawing of
the border several weeks ago. The work was to continue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's old border fence, which juts out into Lebanon, has not
been taken down, but workers continued to build the new one, along
the international border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking at U.N. headquarters, said he expected the
U.N.'s verification to take a few days, and that troops would
arrive within the next few weeks to reinforce the 4,500-member
UNIFIL force that has been in south Lebanon since 1978. UNIFIL
troops have not patrolled the border.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general called on Lebanon to send soldiers to the
region, something it has hesitated to do in part because it does
not want to appear to be policing Israel's border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping that once we have certified that Israel has
completely withdrawn, they (the Lebanese) would also begin sending
in some army elements,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Lebanon are still formally at war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli Minister Haim Ramon asked the Red Cross to
help reunite Lebanese families left stranded on opposite sides of
the border. Some 7,000 Lebanese refugees, many of them former
militiamen who helped Israel patrol the border zone, fled to Israel
this week, fearing retaliation by Hezbollah or the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio said a group of former militia officers,
temporarily staying in resorts and transit camps, declared a
government-in-exile that opposed ''Islamic extremism'' and the
presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Ziggy Marley Won't Play in Austria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Reggae star Ziggy Marley canceled a
planned performance in Austria to show his opposition to a
far-right party in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Marley, son of Bob Marley, was to have performed June 17 at the
annual Spring Vibration Festival in Wiesen. Festival spokesman
Alexander Swoboda said Marley's agents informed organizers of his
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Marley ''does not want to play in a country with a Nazi in the
government,'' Swoboda said, citing a statement from the agents.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to Joerg Haider, the former leader
of the Freedom Party, whose past comments in praise of the Nazi era
contributed to a decision by 14 European Union countries to impose
sanctions on Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of musicians and other performers have canceled
participation in Austrian events to show their opposition to the

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Takes More Territory  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZALAMBESSA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia agreed with Eritrea on
Friday to resume peace talks, even as it pressed a punishing
offensive that seized cities and towns miles deep in Eritrean
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, increasingly conciliatory, agreed to surrender two
other towns demanded by Ethiopia as a condition to stopping the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   From a peak along the front line, Ethiopian soldiers surveyed
newly captured ground strewn with ammunition boxes, torn bodies in
uniform and corpses of donkeys that had been herded ahead of the
advancing troops to clear minefields.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the Eritrean army has suffered tremendously. But I
do not think they will go the peaceful way,'' said Col. Mulu
Ayenaw, while his men raised Ethiopia's flag over the retaken town
of Zalambessa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to defeat them some more,'' Mulu said.
</P>
<P>
   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, secured Eritrea's and then
Ethiopia's commitment to take part in indirect peace talks set for
Monday in Algiers to end the 2-year-old war over the poorly
delineated 620 mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea previously had insisted on a cease-fire for talks.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika also secured a written pledge from Eritrean President
Isaias Afewerki to withdraw from the eastern towns of Bada and
Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, while insisting the towns were indisputably part of its
territory, said it retreated from Bada and Bure to deny its much
larger neighbor any further pretext for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea insisted its retreat from the border was no resounding
military defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eritrea has lost territory but Ethiopia has lost most of the
battles,'' presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said in
Asmara.

   Gebremeskel estimated Ethiopia had suffered 60,000 casualties
since it invaded Eritrea. Eritrean casualties ''were not even
slightly comparable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised counterattacks to slowly weaken Ethiopian forces -- a
strategy seemingly more in line with Eritrea's 30-year guerrilla
war for independence from then-communist Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how it's going to go the next two or three days,
but I can tell you that at the end of the day, we are going to push
them back,'' Gebremeskel said.
</P>
<P>
   A previous round of talks in Algiers between the two Horn of
Africa nations broke down May 4, leading to Ethiopia's invasion of
Eritrea -- the latest outbreak of bloodshed. The conflict has cost
the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians from both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   After a punishing two-day battle at the central front, Eritrea
announced Thursday it was withdrawing from all disputed territory
starting with the area around the mountaintop town of Zalambessa.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilant Ethiopian soldiers with AK-47s slung over their
shoulders raised their flag at Zalambessa on Friday morning, while
artillery boomed at the battle for the 20,000-resident city of
Senafe, 7 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia announced later Friday it had taken Senafe, seizing a
community where just two days earlier Eritreans had cheered their
country's soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was Ethiopian trucks rushing past with fresh
troops for a front moving farther north into Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea said Ethiopia had also taken two other towns in the
area, Forte and Tsorena, sending 50,000 residents in the area
fleeing. The evacuees join what Eritrea says is 550,000 people
already displaced in the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia repeatedly has said it will return all undisputed
territory at war's end.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower today as investors,
unconsoled by new signs of a slowing economy, focused instead on
the prospect of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 22.28 at 10,301.64 after changing
direction several times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower after swinging between
positive and negative territory. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 4.29 at 1,377.23, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
18.96 at 3,186.39.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said thin volume ahead of the Memorial Day holiday
weekend was exaggerating moves in the market. U.S. financial
markets will be closed Monday, and many investors were reluctant to
take on any new positions in advance of the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly lower, although losses were fairly
modest. Qualcomm fell 4 7/16 to 64 9/16 and Dell Computer dropped
1} to 42.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft slipped 27/64 to 61 5/64. The Justice Department, in a
filing to a federal judge today, pushed anew to have software giant
Microsoft split into two companies. The new document is the final
version of the government's proposed remedy to curb the company's
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks fell for a second straight day, following a
report from a Merrill Lynch analyst that Goldman Sachs is likely to
miss second-quarter earnings estimates. Goldman was down 3[ at 69~,
Merrill Lynch was off 5 15/16 at 88] and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
was down 1] at 63 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney became the latest Goldman rival to raise
concerns about its earnings. Salomon analyst Guy Moszkowski lowered
his estimate for Goldman's second-quarter earnings to $1.35 a share
from $1.50 a share, citing concerns about the impact of recent
market turmoil on the firm's private equity investments and trading
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in two of the market's leading sectors made it
difficult for stocks to advance, even after two economic reports
from the Commerce Department helped ease some investor worries
about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus was on the report showing orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, its biggest plunge since December 1991. The decline was
mostly attributed to a steep slump in orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the government reported Americans' spending rose in
April at its slowest pace in nine months. Personal income grew at a
faster pace than spending for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the point that bad news is good news for this
market,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ''Everyone wants to see signs of the economy slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflationary
pressures under control. The rate hikes are designed to boost
borrowing costs and try to cool consumer spending, something that
would help contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been under pressure in recent weeks as
investors fail to find any signs of a slowing economy, which could
convince the Fed to soon end its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 598.92 million
shares, down from 752.26 million shares at the same time on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.41 at 454.76.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Intervene in Willey Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court said Friday a judge
acted inappropriately when he found that President Clinton
committed a criminal violation of the privacy law by releasing the
letters of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-member appeals panel, turning down a White House
request, refused to intervene in the lawsuit filed by a
conservative group that spawned the ruling against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was inappropriate'' for U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth,
a Reagan appointee, to invoke ''sweeping pronouncements on alleged
criminal activity,'' but ''the members of the White House Office
are under no real threat of criminal prosecution,'' said the
appeals ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not take seriously'' the White House's argument that the
president and his aides ''are now disabled from functioning because
of an implicit threat,'' the appeals court added. At the same time,
the appeals court said Lamberth had acted ''gratuitously'' and that
his decision about Clinton's alleged criminality was
''superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling means that Clinton's closest adviser,
deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsay, must respond to demands
from the conservative group Judicial Watch to reveal deliberations
that led to the president releasing friendly correspondence from
Willey. Clinton issued the letters the day after Willey, a former
White House volunteer, accused the president on national television
of making an unwelcome sexual advance. Many of Willey's letters to
Clinton were written after the alleged 1993 incident.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court judges, Harry Edwards, a Carter appointee;
David Tatel, a Clinton appointee; and Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan
appointee, said the ruling against Clinton and the question of
whether Privacy Act restrictions apply to the Executive Office of
the President could be dealt with by an appeals court once the case
is over. It is highly unusual for appeals courts to step into
ongoing lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House, as it has done for many years on the advice
and counsel of the Department of Justice, remains free to adhere to
the position that the Privacy Act does not cover members of the
White House Office,'' said the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had argued that Lamberth's ruling would chill
confidential discussions between the president and his top aides
including his White House attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy expressed disappointment that
the appeals court declined to intervene. But he said ''we are very
pleased'' because the court criticized Lamberth's ruling against
Clinton and also ''made clear that we could continue to operate
under the long-established principle that the Privacy Act does not
apply to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch chairman Larry Klayman said the ruling ''affirms
that the President of the United States is not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit concerns the Clinton administration's alleged
violation of the Privacy Act by gathering hundreds of FBI
background files of former Reagan and Bush appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case began with the FBI files issue, Lamberth gave
Judicial Watch latitude to explore whether the White House
routinely gathered and released damaging information about its
political opponents, a decision that led to inclusion of the Willey
letters even though Willey is not a party to the suit.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brazil Finance Boss Is Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A Brazilian federal court has
convicted a former finance minister of corruption, and sentenced
her to more than 13 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Zelia Cardoso de Mello was found guilty Thursday of receiving
money and favors in 1990 from bus company owners, who in turn
benefited by a 17 percent fare increase, granted while a price
freeze was in effect for the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso de Mello is living in New York City, and was not present
at the trial in the 12th federal district court in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in New York, Cardoso de Mello said she was
''saddened'' by the verdict, and denied any wrongdoing. ''My
conscience is absolutely tranquil,'' she said in the television
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Cardoso de Mello said they would appeal; she is
not required to go to prison until her final appeal is denied.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso de Mello was the economic czar of former President
Fernando Collor de Mello, who governed from 1990 until his 1992
impeachment for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The former finance minister, who is no relation to Collor, is
best remembered for her radical plan to curb four-digit inflation
by freezing 80 percent of all bank deposits for 18 months. The
plan, which Brazilians call ''the confiscation,'' plunged Brazil
into recession but failed to keep prices down for long.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso de Mello quit as finance minister in 1991, after a
high-profile romance with a fellow Cabinet member who was married.
She married popular Brazilian comic Chico Anisio and moved to New
York, remaining there when the two separated.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Students Protest Vs. Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of students, outraged by
the impotence of opposition leaders, marched Friday in the capital,
demanding an end to the ''tyranny'' of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The students voiced frustration over the opposition bickering
that has enabled Milosevic to survive politically for the past
decade despite Yugoslavia's disintegration and loss of Kosovo
province last year.
</P>
<P>
   Marching outside Belgrade's City Hall, which is run by the
opposition, the students chanted slogans calling on opposition
leaders to come out and explain their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years is too much out of a lifetime to be spent in the
hell of tyranny,'' the students said in a manifesto. ''We call on
all to end this shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by the Otpor, or Resistance, movement, said
Friday that over 700 of its activists have been detained for
questioning in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 students, chanting ''Kill yourself Slobodan and Save
Serbia!'' outlined their demands at the Belgrade rally.
</P>
<P>
   They included a call to allow a ''peaceful transition of power''
and a demand for those ''responsible for Serbia's demise to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be no silence -- silence is complicity,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The students urged the opposition ''by personal example to give
impetus to a wide national rebellion against state terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has called a mass rally for Saturday in Belgrade
in what will be a major test of strength, but the students were
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the final moment for the opposition to come to its senses
and not waste time,'' said Branko Ilic, an Otpor leader. ''We will
come to the rally to see whether the opposition has any plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rally in the southern Serbian city of Nis, one opposition
leader, Goran Svilanovic, criticized his colleagues, saying they
failed to respond adequately to the government takeover of
Belgrade's Studio B television last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do not resist now, they will come into our houses, burn
them and chase us away,'' Svilanovic told about 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a student uprising, the government has ordered
university classes to end by Friday -- a week early -- and banned all
gatherings on campuses across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church endorsed the
students' demands and called for the release of all detained and an
end to government violence, the independent Beta news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, the independent daily Danas was fined about
$50,000 in a libel suit filed by Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister
Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist leader who has called for even
tougher measures against free media.
</P>
<P>
   An editor in Danas, Rasa Savic, said the daily was given 24
hours to pay the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people attended the ninth consecutive evening
protest against last week's government takeover of Belgrade's
Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, Studio B journalists read their news in an
open-air makeshift studio on the balcony of the Belgrade City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, independent Index radio -- the only
nongovernment radio station still heard in Belgrade -- was
overpowered by a stronger signal playing folk music at the time of
the station's main evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav army, which is controlled by Milosevic,
urged a crackdown on ''external and internal enemies.'' The latter
term is used to describe the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Left, a party led by Milosevic's influential wife
Mirjana Markovic, accused the opposition of trying to split the
country through ''terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police detained and questioned more than a dozen
opposition and Otpor activists in several Serbian cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Milosevic's hometown of Pozarevac, police arrested 11 people,
including a priest, as they attempted to visit an opposition
activist jailed there since May 2.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want To Probe Mails for Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With drug traffickers becoming more savvy in
the use of the post office to smuggle drugs, the U.S. Customs
Service is asking Congress for permission to search mail leaving
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, included in a crime bill in the House, has hit
opposition from the U.S. Postal Service which believes such mail is
protected by the Fourth Amendment's provisions against unlawful
searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers heard from both sides Friday at a hearing of a House
government reform subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''For over two centuries, the American public has had an
expectation of privacy in their mail,'' Kenneth Newman, the Postal
Service's deputy chief inspector for criminal investigations, said
in explaining the agency's views.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, Newman said, has stated that ''when
considering Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless
searches, mail is in a special category of effects and is entitled
to the same protection accorded a person's home.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This requires probable cause and a federal search warrant to
seize and open mail,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said the authority is necessary to help curb
an increase in the use of mail as a way to smuggle drugs. Private
industry companies, such as United Parcel Service and FedEx,
already allow Customs to search mail leaving the United States,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drug traffickers and money launderers are not stupid,'' said
Betsy Durant, director of trade operations for the U.S. Customs
Service. ''They know we do not search outbound mail now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe what is necessary is express authority from
Congress,'' Durant said.
</P>
<P>
   Searching is not a problem in the private mail industry, Durant
said. ''We have tighter controls over the express consignment
industry,'' he said. ''The cooperation with the private carriers is
quite good.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Rep. Criticizes Colleagues  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Rep. Tom Campbell, a maverick
California moderate, accused GOP colleagues on Friday of delaying a
vote on legislation -- a bill letting doctors bargain collectively
with HMOs -- so they could raise campaign money from groups on both
sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also criticized House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
saying he twice backed away from his promise to bring the bill to
the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened yesterday was outrageous, and causes so many
Americans to grow disenchanted with our political system,'' said
Campbell, who is running for the Senate seat now held by Democrat
Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was angered by the House Rules Committee's decision to
postpone indefinitely floor action on his bill that would give
self-employed doctors new rights to bargain collectively with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert first promised to bring the bill up immediately after it
was approved by the Judiciary Committee at the end of March, and
then said it would reach the floor before the Memorial Day recess,
which began Friday, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Promises made in good faith sometimes cannot be fulfilled''
due to outside circumstances, he said, but that ''was not the case
yesterday. What happened was under the control of the speaker, or
should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said individual members told him they wanted to delay a
vote so they could continue to get campaign contributions from both
the insurance and HMO industries that oppose the bill and medical
groups that support it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'Don't force me to choose between two potential
contributors.... Just delay it so we can milk both cows.'''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said his bill has 220 co-sponsors, a majority of the
House, but most are Democrats and many Republicans are leery of
legislation backed by organized labor and opposed by insurance
companies and other traditional GOP donor groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a majority of Republicans at their weekly
conference -- but not the two-thirds needed to set policy -- voted to
delay action on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he moved the bill to the Rules Committee in
preparation for a floor vote Thursday, but the GOP-controlled
panel, which sets procedures for floor debate, rebelled and decided
to set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was late at night and the votes weren't there to move it.
And we didn't want to lose it,'' Hastert said Thursday. He said he
intends to bring it up some time after the House returns from its
Memorial Day recess on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has argued it was important to move the bill early so
it has a better chance in the Senate, where it faces an uphill
fight. Opponents are using delaying tactics to lessen its chances
of passage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is backed by the American Medical Association,
would amend antitrust laws to give health care professionals the
right to bargain collectively with health plans over fees and other
contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says the bill is pro-consumer because it would let
health care professionals join together to fight gag rules, limits
on testing and other restrictions imposed by health maintenance
organizations. Insurance and health plan groups say it would drive
up health care costs and insurance premiums and lead to group
boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, formerly a law professor at Stanford, has a history of
breaking with his party on key issues such as gun control, abortion
rights, tax cuts and an overhaul of campaign finance laws. In 1997,
he voted against Newt Gingrich for speaker because of misleading
statements Gingrich had made to the ethics committee.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Grand jury to investigate pier collapse  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A grand jury will investigate last week's
deadly collapse of a nightclub pier along the Delaware River to
determine whether criminal charges are warranted, city officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were supposed to release preliminary findings
Friday into the cause of the collapse, but District Attorney Lynne
Abraham asked that the report be held up so as not to prejudice the
grand jurors, mayoral spokeswoman Barbara Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been asked by the DA to cooperate with the grand jury
investigation and obviously we're happy to do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three women were killed and dozens of patrons injured May 18
when the pier supporting a new nightclub called Heat broke apart
and plunged into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Engineers Inc., the company hired by the city to
investigate the collapse, sent divers into the murky river again
Friday to look at the twisted wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The company delivered its preliminary report to the city
Licenses and Inspections Department, which in turn will brief Mayor
John F. Street, Grant said. A final report is due in one or two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials speculate that the pilings supporting the 91-year-old
pier had become tilted, weakening the entire structure.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury has the power to compel witnesses to testify
behind closed doors. It will then decide whether there is enough
evidence to warrant criminal indictments against the owner of Pier
34 or the nightclub owner.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe pier owner Michael Asbell and nightclub owner Eli
Karetny knew the pier was unstable days before it collapsed,
according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Construction Corp. President Terry Zettle has said his
company gave the nightclub a written report stating that the
foundation was slanting toward the river and metal supports were
twisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it this way, we were amazed that they had people on
that pier after we told them of what we found,'' Zettle has said.
''We surely didn't think they were going to have people on that
pier.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Asbell and Karetny did not immediately return
phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office would not confirm the existence of a
grand jury, as is customary, but did say it asked the mayor's
office to keep the report under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that to have any of the reports made public at this
time will impair the investigation,'' spokeswoman Cathie Abookire
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Licenses and Inspections Commissioner Edward
McLaughlin said another 20-foot section of the pier is in imminent
danger of collapse because of soil erosion caused by strong
currents.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for the last of the three victims will be held
Saturday. DeAnn White, 25, public relations manager for the New
Jersey State Aquarium in Camden, had gone to the nightclub to
celebrate her 26th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Jean Ferraro, 27, of Cherry Hill, N.J.; and
Monica Rodriguez, 21, also of Cherry Hill. They, too, were
employees of the aquarium.

<HEADLINE> Writer Arthur C. Clarke Is Knighted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Science fiction writer and space age
visionary Arthur C. Clarke was knighted Friday at the home of the
British ambassador to Sri Lanka, more than two years after he was
conferred with the honor.
</P>
<P>
   The investiture was delayed at Sir Arthur's request after he was
accused of being a child molester by a London tabloid. The
allegation was never proved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like a lobster,'' joked Clarke, wearing an ash-colored
suit and a blue tie on a hot, sultry morning.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Stewart Told To Apologize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Stewart has generated huge publicity for
the Broadway show in which he's starring -- by accusing producers of
failing to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   But now he must apologize for the angry speech he gave during
curtain calls of Arthur Miller's play ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   A disciplinary panel of Actors Equity has ruled that Stewart,
known for his role in television's ''Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' must offer a formal apology to the Shubert
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Its producers had filed disciplinary charges against him after
the impromptu tirade at two performances last month. Stewart said
he felt ''frustrated and helpless'' by their failure to promote the
play.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard hours of testimony to determine whether his
behavior was unprofessional. The producers said they had spent $1
million to promote the production, which received good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mt. Morgan'' is the story of a bigamist whose efforts to keep
his two families unaware of each other fail after he is injured in
a car crash.

<HEADLINE> Ontario Cops Probe E. Coli Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO, Ontario (AP) -- Police launched an investigation Friday
into one of North America's worst E. coli outbreaks as residents of
a small Ontario town buried the first of five people killed so far
by the bacteria contaminating the local water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of grief and finger-pointing came a day after
Ontario provincial officials took control of the water supply in
Walkerton, a farm town of 5,000 people some 90 miles west of
Toronto where hundreds have been sickened since last week with the
intestinal bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will focus in part on why the local Public
Utility Commission did not immediately notify health authorities
that water from town wells was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor David Thomson of the Brockton municipality, which includes
Walkerton, said the general manager of the Public Utility
Commission -- which provides water and electricity to the town -- has
acknowledged that the commission was aware of the problem as early
as May 18.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said Thursday that the utility failed to tell his office
or health authorities, even after a local health official issued a
boil order for the water supply Sunday following reports from
doctors of bloody diarrhea. The health officer said he had asked
the utility commission three times if the water was clean, and was
told it was.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kieffer, chairman of the utility commission, said utility
workers may have been unaware of how dangerous E. coli could be.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Richard Kotwa of the Ontario Provincial Police
said a police investigation into the E. coli contamination began
Friday with interviews of officials and gathering of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a criminal investigation at this point. It could be
later,'' Kotwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Premier Mike Harris visited Walkerton on Friday and told
an outdoor news conference that ''every aspect of this, from every
level of government, will be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have one of the safest (public water) systems in
the world,'' Harris said, ignoring a few critical comments shouted
by residents. ''Clearly we found out here in Walkerton it isn't
foolproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris left without answering a question yelled by Veronica
Davidson, a Walkerton resident who said she wanted the premier to
say exactly what would be done to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Thomson put the utility under the control of the
Ontario Clean Water Agency, which will examine the water wells and
recommend how to prevent any future problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thomson said the chlorinating unit on one of the
two main wells pumping water had been working only sporadically. He
said a new unit that officials had ordered weeks earlier arrived
last week and was installed over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspect recent flooding caused by heavy rain may have
contaminated the town's water supply with animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have died and hundreds have been sickened in the E.
coli outbreak, Canada's worst ever.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Waterloo, Ontario, 12 people who recently visited
Walkerton have complained of E. coli infection symptoms and one
case has been confirmed as E. coli, said Bob Hart, manager of
infection control for the Waterloo Community Health Department.
Hart said none of the cases was serious.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony Friday at the Sacred Heart Church in Walkerton,
family and friends gathered for the funeral of Lenore Al, 66, a
librarian who'd just retired with her husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were going to enjoy life together,'' said Beulah
Turnbull, 64, a longtime friend. ''She was an all-round nice
person; she will certainly be in God's garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The first deaths were reported Wednesday -- a baby and three
adults, including Al. Another elderly victim died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from around the region were converging on South
Bruce-Grey Health Center to help the beleaguered staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are children in intensive care who are not getting
better, they are getting worse,'' Dr. Douglas Matsell, a pediatric
kidney specialist, said of patients airlifted to a hospital in
London, Ontario. ''I worry that there will be more deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The contamination caused officials to close all five schools in
the community, along with the daycare center.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has evoked memories of an E. coli poisoning from
tainted hamburger meat at Jack-in-the-Box fast food restaurants in
Washington state. The 1993 outbreak killed four people and sickened
hundreds.

<HEADLINE> Parties Collaborate on Medicare  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House Republican and a Senate Democrat say
congressional compromise is possible on adding prescription drug
benefits to Medicare this year and that they will team up to
negotiate a bipartisan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., an architect of a House GOP proposal
outlined earlier this spring, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has
been working on the issue with moderate Republicans in the Senate,
said they see common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the next few weeks Bill Thomas and I are going to team up
with our colleagues ... to try to defy the odds, the
prognosticators and the talking heads who say you just can't get
this done,'' Wyden said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Friday, held symbolically in a room that
is half on the House side of the Capitol Building and half on the
Senate side, Thomas and Wyden said they have already begun talks
with fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a rogue effort,'' said Thomas. ''Senator Wyden and
I will consult fully and inform fully our respective leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The two said they believe there is general agreement among
Democrats and Republicans that prescription drug coverage supported
by government dollars should be available as an option for all
senior citizens through a program overseen by the Health and Human
Services Department, and that out-of-pocket costs should be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wyden and Thomas said there is emerging consensus that
drug companies should pay a ''return on investment fee'' to help
support the new program when they profit from medicines developed
through government-funded research.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton emphasized differences that remain, however,
at a White House news conference he held with Democratic
congressional leaders just a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their approach simply won't help the millions of seniors who
need help,'' Clinton said of the House Republican plan Thomas has
been helping to craft.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden has introduced Medicare drug legislation in the Senate,
along with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, that is similar to what
House Republicans suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans would have private insurance companies sell drug
policies to retirees and provide government subsidies to help cover
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans say their plan, still being developed, would
offer direct subsidies to low-income senior citizens, as well as
financial support to help insurance companies bear the risk of
offering new drug policies, thereby ensuring affordability for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation has a sliding scale of direct
subsidies for drug insurance for all retirees, with at least 25
percent of everyone's premium paid by Medicare. The bill also calls
for a new Medicare board to set standards for the private drug
plans and oversee enrollment in them.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar proposal has been floated by Sens. John Breaux,
D-La., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders say such
private-sector approaches lack guarantees that affordable, quality
benefits would be available to all senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton and most Democrats want a drug benefit run by
Medicare that any retiree could choose to add to the program's
basic health coverage for an additional monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have criticized that plan as overly bureaucratic and
say it does not do enough to harness market forces that could lower
prices while providing a wider choice of benefit packages.

<HEADLINE> 4-year-old boy organizes lemonade sales for charity  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Like many other businessmen, Jack Tregenza
was busy gearing up Friday for a big Memorial Day weekend sale. But
Jack isn't having the usual start-of-summer sale. No bathing suits
or patio furniture here. He's selling lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old entrepreneur -- with a little help from his mother
-- is organizing a nationwide drive to get kids to set up lemonade
stands for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Jack started selling lemonade last year, at the age of 3, after
he saw pictures of Kosovar refugee children on TV and asked his
mother, Robin, what he could do to help.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested setting up a lemonade stand at their local
Memorial Day parade. So Jack and three of his friends sold lemonade
to thirsty parade-watchers. They made $38 and donated it to the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jack wanted to do it again. His mother suggested they
try to encourage other children across the country to also set up
their own lemonade stands. Robin sent out more than 200 fliers to
friends and acquaintances in various parts of the country, dubbing
the effort, ''Lemonade Stands Across America.''
</P>
<P>
   The profits this year will go to AmeriCares, a New Canaan-based
disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and his friends are putting up two lemonade stands this
weekend -- one in his hometown of Darien, the other in the Rowayton
section of Norwalk. Both will be set up along Memorial Day parade
routes, where the hope is that big crowds will mean big sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really want to do it so I can give the money to children who
don't have any money or clothes,'' Jack said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, who graduated from nursery school Friday, is like most
4-year-olds. He likes T-ball and collects Pokemon cards. His mother
said she didn't need to do much to encourage his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Starting from the moment he could walk, if there was a child
who was crying, he would give them a hug or rub their back,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack, one of the best parts of having a lemonade stand is
making the lemonade. His mother said he insists on making his own
lemonade -- using a powder mix -- and also has volunteered to help
her make brownies, which will be sold along with the lemonade. Jack
says he'll charge 50 cents a glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are so involved in video games and TV. It's nice for kids
to put up a lemonade stand and enjoy a simple pastime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Griffin, a spokeswoman for AmeriCares, said Jack and
his mother have organized the lemonade stand program entirely on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's absolutely wonderful to see someone so young want
to make a difference,'' Griffin said. She said at least 98 cents
out of every dollar donated will go directly to relief efforts. The
agency's administrative costs have averaged about 2 percent since
its founding in 1982, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Tregenza said she has heard from more than 10 friends
whose children plan to sell lemonade this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy James is planning to set up a stand in front of her house
in Englewood, Colo., where she and her husband, and their
2-year-old daughter, Avery, plan to sell lemonade, along with their
neighbors and their two children, ages 5 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   James, who has fond memories of selling lemonade as a child with
her sister and mother, said giving the profits to charity has an
added bonus for children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it teaches them responsibility, and also sharing. What
a great idea to do something that could help other people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets people in an old-time neighborhood mood because they
stop and chat. Nobody just buys a glass of lemonade and walks away.
It's a good way to get to know your neighbors and spend some time
with your friends.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio says he won't give up congressional seat  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio said Friday he has no
intention of giving up his congressional seat to campaign full time
against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an impeccable record in terms of attendance,'' the Long
Island Republican said. ''I think I made every vote except one in
my eight years in Congress, and I think the people of New York
understand I entered this race with only five months to go and
there may be some votes I miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio entered the race a week ago, after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out because of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio campaigned in Republican-friendly Staten Island --
charming morning commuters at the Staten Island Ferry terminal and
making baked ziti at a seniors club in New Dorp -- Clinton was in
Lazio's territory on Long Island, where she picked up the
endorsement of the Long Island Building and Construction Trades
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella organization of trade unions representing 60,000
members had endorsed Lazio in his 1998 Congressional race against
Democratic challenger John Bace.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Kennedy, president of the trades council, said the
group is supporting Clinton because Lazio had opposed a proposal to
increase the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at his record,'' Kennedy said. ''The AFL-CIO sent us
his record and his record as far as voting on labor issues and
working people has not been good. It's been very poor. We think
it's time that we get somebody who's going to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state Conservative Party moved toward giving its
ballot line for the November election to Lazio. The party's
executive committee recommended doing so, and delegates are
expected to approve the slate at a June 3 convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters now have a positive reason to go to the voting booth in
November,'' said party Chairman Michael Long, describing Lazio as
''a man who understands his lifelong neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The party endorsed Lazio as soon as he entered the race. Long
did not back Giuliani because of his support of abortion rights and
ties to the state's Liberal Party. No Republican candidate has won
statewide office in New York since 1974 without Conservative Party
backing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton deflected a question about a poll that shows Lazio
pulling into a statistical dead-heat with the first lady after only
a week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I've always said this is going to be a very close,
very tough race, and I'm just going to do what I've been doing,''
she said. ''I'm going to keep working every single day to earn the
trust and votes and endorsements of New Yorkers from one end of the
state to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the Zogby poll, showing Clinton favored by 46 percent
and him at 44 percent, proved that ''the more people begin to hear
who I am and what I've done, the better I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't want to win the Senate seat with an
anti-Hillary vote. ''I hope most people will support me because of
who I am and what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning with popular local Rep. Vito Fossella by his side,
Lazio shook hands with ferry commuters and later charmed a group of
about 100 card-playing senior citizens at the New Dorp Beach
Friendship Club.
</P>
<P>
   To thunderous applause, Lazio told the seniors he came because
''I wanted to be where the real people are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not lost on many that Lazio was doing what Clinton's
campaign has failed to in nearly a year of campaigning -- meet face
to face with regular Staten Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made two private stops, one with a handful of
Democratic leaders and the other a small, private dinner, but has
yet to hold any public events on Staten Island, a borough which
strongly backed Giuliani in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got it right,'' said Vince DeSanno as he made his way to
a morning ferry. ''She meets with the ones who will pay her bills.
He meets with the ones who will get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Friendship Club, where the seniors were getting ready for
an afternoon sock hop, Lazio made his way into Marie Rubino's
kitchen where he expertly cracked an egg -- one-handed -- and stirred
the ricotta mixture to be used in baked ziti.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're Okay,'' Rubino told him, ''Only thing is, you have to
eat more. You're too skinny!''

<HEADLINE> Elian Has More Options in New Home  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A toy store is two blocks away and the
National Zoo is nearby as well.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez will have more options now that the 6-year-old
from Cuba and his entourage from Cuba have traded their rural
retreat in Maryland for a Revolutionary War-era home on a leafy,
6{-acre plot in an upscale neighborhood here.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches
and a supporter of the Gonzalez family, said the month they spent
in Maryland helped them bond after Elian had been separated from
them for five months. But, she said, they felt that location was
too remote.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the family hopes ''to be a little more engaged
with more people, and see a few more things.'' They hope to visit
with members of Congress and others who have supported them during
Elian's ordeal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Elian's first full day in the city that Fidel Castro likes to
call ''the capital of the empire'' he was keeping a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was seen briefly Thursday night when the four-van caravan
in which he was riding arrived at his new home, known as Rosedale
Farm, after the long drive from Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on his activities Friday. His father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, made a brief appearance on the porch of the
seven-bedroom house during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the father and son are Elian's step-mother, his
half-brother and cousin, a Cuban kindergarten teacher, four
playmates from Cuba and adult family members who are accompanying
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family is awaiting a federal appeals court ruling
on whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service acted
properly in refusing to consider political asylum applications
filed on Elian's behalf by his Miami relatives. A ruling could come
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was the victim of a shipwreck off the Florida coast
during a crossing from Cuba that claimed the life of his mother
last November.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move to Washington also was driven by
convenience. Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's father, has his
office in downtown Washington and can consult with his client more
easily. In addition, Craig's home is just a short distance from
Rosedale.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cuban diplomats can show up at Rosedale without notifying
the State Department. Each time they visited the residence in
Maryland, they had to give 72 hours notice, consistent with a State
Department requirement, because that location is more than 25 miles
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors seem to welcome Elian's presence in the
neighborhood but not necessarily the trappings of his celebrity
status.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Frost, who lives down the street, said neighbors normally
are free to roam the grounds of Rosedale, and he was resentful that
much of the property is now off limits.
</P>
<P>
   He called this ''a stupid, militaristic overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from where he spoke, yellow police tapes with ''Do Not
Cross'' admonitions ringed the house, preventing all but authorized
visitors from getting close. Orange cones at the foot of the
driveway blocked the entry of unauthorized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Beuker, while walking her 8-month old daughter in a
stroller, took note of a gaggle of photographers and television
cameramen lined up along the fence that surrounds the property.
</P>
<P>
   The one irritant about Elian's presence is the press, said
Beuker, 35. ''You guys are a pain in the butt,'' she said. Others
worried about increased competition for scarce street parking and
the possibility of protest demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The house has a long history. The rear section is believed to
have been constructed in 1740; the remainder in 1793 -- when George
Washington was president.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the grounds is the headquarters of Youth for
Understanding International Exchange, which promotes exchanges
involving high school students from the United States and foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Open Fire in Kyrgyzstan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Gunmen opened fire with automatic
weapons on a visiting Chinese delegation Friday, killing one
official and wounding two others and their Kyrgyz driver, a Chinese
Embassy official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese representatives were from the local administration
of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which borders Kyrgyzstan to
the east.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, to help the
embassy investigate an arson attack earlier this month at a Chinese
market, an embassy spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The
victims' names were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was to inspect the remains of a Chinese market
storehouse that was destroyed in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Another fire broke out at the market on Friday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported, citing local firefighters. There was no
immediate word what caused that blaze.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's shooting, the gunmen opened fire on the delegation
as one member stepped out of their car in front of the Dostuk Hotel
in downtown Bishkek. That man died on the pavement, while the men
who remained in the car were wounded, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were reported, and Kyrgyz officials declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyz and Uygurs share the rugged and sparsely inhabited Pamir
Mountains in Central Asia, and are close ethnic cousins who speak
related Turkic languages. Contacts and trade across the remote
border were revived after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> CNN Settles Lawsuit With Producer  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN has settled a lawsuit brought by a former
producer who was fired for her role in reporting a 1998 story that
accused the U.S. military of using nerve gas on Vietnam War-era
defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the settlement with April Oliver were not disclosed
Friday. CNN spokeswoman Sue Binford said the network would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   CNN retracted its June 7, 1998, report on Operation Tailwind
because it could not verify its accuracy. Oliver and colleague Jack
Smith were fired. The on-air reporter, Peter Arnett, was
reprimanded and ultimately left the network.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was a black eye for CNN and its corporate
partner, Time magazine, which printed a story based on CNN's
Tailwind reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's lawyer, Roger Simmons, said her client continued to
believe in her story.
</P>
<P>
   ''She still stands solidly behind the story,'' Simmons said.
''She believes it is accurate and believed it was accurate when it
was reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has said she believed her case against CNN was
strengthened by a partial deposition given by retired Adm. Thomas
Moorer, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moorer disclaimed the story after it went on the air and reached
a financial settlement with CNN weeks after it was retracted. The
Tailwind producers said Moorer had read and approved their script
before it went on the air.
</P>
<P>
   CNN settled before Moorer completed his deposition, Simmons
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver claimed in her lawsuit that CNN decided to fire her
''primarily on business and public relations concerns.'' She said
her case was an opportunity to publicize facts that CNN wanted to
bury.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are issues of honor at play here and there are issues of
fact-seeking and truth-finding,'' she said when the lawsuit was
filed. ''I want the public record restored on this so I'm not
buried under a sea of character assassination and a sea of
disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has since left journalism and is studying to become a
lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Rowland vetoes bill to give investigated company more work  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland vetoed a bill Friday
that would have allowed the company that runs the state's vehicle
emissions programs to do safety inspections of taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Envirotest Systems Corp., is under investigation by
the state amid allegations of illegal conduct. Company employees
are accused of stealing emission stickers and accepting bribes to
pass cars that failed inspections. Two emissions inspectors were
accused of charging drivers $50 to $60 to change a failed
inspection to a passing one.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, the Department of Motor
Vehicles and the state police are probing the company. Rowland also
directed the DMV to review its quality control practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the allegations pending, I thought it would be
appropriate to veto the bill until Envirotest is cleared,'' Rowland
said. ''But right now it doesn't make sense to give more authority
or give more responsibility to Envirotest until the allegations are
cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the DMV will maintain responsibility for inspecting
taxis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sailed through the House and Senate with unanimous
approval, but lawmakers are not expected to override Rowland's
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't a desire to attempt an override,'' said Larry
Perosino, a spokesman for the House Democrats. ''It was expected,
and we understand the veto message.''
</P>
<P>
   The veto was Rowland's second following this year's legislative
session. Earlier this month, he refused to sign a bill that would
have publicly funded political campaigns and cap how much
candidates could spend on their races.
</P>
<P>
   Although Envirotest is still running vehicle inspection
stations, Rowland said average motorists have nothing to worry
about when they get their cars checked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the allegations being made ... I can't imagine anybody
engaging in illegal activity after the lid has been blown,''
Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Envirotest's alleged misconduct deprives
the state of money and threatens the credibility of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest, which received a 10-year, $25 million state contract
in 1994 to run the emissions testing and safety inspections
program, maintains the incidents are isolated. The East Granby
company says the workers accused of misconduct were fired and
arrested after the wrongdoing was brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   The company had no comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nine-state plea to FDA for allergy warnings on food  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A coalition of attorneys general from nine
states, including Vermont, called Friday for food manufacturers to
more clearly label products that contain ingredients such as
peanuts and eggs which can be deadly to people with certain
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a strong belief that the vast majority of deaths
attributed to food allergy are preventable deaths and needless
deaths,'' said Mark Violette, a spokesman for New York Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer. ''The deaths can be prevented sometimes in
ways as simple as clearer labeling on food packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 6 million and 7 million Americans are affected by food
allergies, according to the Food Allergy Network, an international
research and education organization based in Virginia. The group
estimates that about 125 people die each year from consuming food
to which they are allergic.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general sent their request to the Food and Drug
Administration Friday, asking the agency to:
</P>
<P>
   --Create a symbol, such as a circled letter ''A'' and require
manufacturers to prominently display that symbol on a specific area
of the food packaging. The symbol would denote the product contains
potentially allergenic substances such as peanuts, tree nuts, milk,
eggs, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, wheat and soy beans.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish a toll-free hotline for consumers through which they
can obtain reliable food ingredient information.
</P>
<P>
   --Mandate food ingredient lists to include all ingredients, even
if used in trace amounts.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish food industry guidelines to prevent allergenic
ingredients from spreading to one product to another during food
processing and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Welch, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said the agency would
give the request ''careful consideration'' when it is received.
</P>
<P>
   Food Allergy President and CEO Anne Munoz-Furlong praised the
effort by the attorneys general but said it could be misguided.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned that any labeling effort needs to take place on a
national level so consumers have a standard symbol to look for and
that a hotline could be dangerous since ingredients can change from
week to week.
</P>
<P>
   ''A better solution would be to work on a national level to
improve the ingredient statements on all products, so that when
consumers read that statement, there should be plain and simple
language there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The labeling is extremely important and it's got to be
something they can trust. They're making a life or death
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Violette, whose 12-year-old son is allergic to peanuts, also
said he could not underestimate the importance of the requests. But
he emphasized it is not just about drawing awareness to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fully expect the FDA to address these concerns seriously,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The request was welcome news to Lori Ira, president of the
Albany-based New York Nut Allergy Awareness Group, an organization
she founded for her daughter, Kaitlyn, who is severely allergic to
some kinds of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ira said the recommendations have been a long time coming and,
if accepted by the FDA, would make her arduous trips to the grocery
store a little less so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled,'' she said. ''It's hard to have faith in the
things that we purchase in stores. This will certainly make
purchasing food products a lot more reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states joining in New York's request are Connecticut,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Vermont and
Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Findings on Pool Alarms Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Memorial Day weekend marks the first time many
Americans hit the water -- bound for beaches or backyard pools-- but
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday consumers should
check to make sure pool alarms are operating before they dive in.
</P>
<P>
   Pool alarms are devices that sound a warning when someone,
especially a child, falls into the water accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   In an evaluation of the devices, the commission found the best
performers generally were underwater alarms which sounded more
consistently and were less likely to sound a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Two other types -- ones that float and detect surface waves and
water-sensitive wristbands -- are either impractical or less
effective, the commission noted.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater alarms can be used in conjunction with pool covers,
while surface alarms cannot. Wristbands, used primarily by parents
who put them on children, can often be forgotten and harmless
exposure to any water, even tap water, can set them off.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also suggests ''layers of protection'' around
residential pools, including securely latched fences or walls at
least four feet high, locks on any doors that face the pool area,
and motor-powered safety covers for pools not in use.
</P>
<P>
   If 2000 is a typical year, the federal government estimates that
about 350 children under five years old will drown in pools, and
2,600 will be treated in emergency rooms for near-drowning
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of pool alarms have doubled since 1994, the government
said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands remember Sealy's 'reliability, loyalty'  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Malik Sealy was 13, he joined the Riverside
Hawks, a youth league basketball team that practiced in the bowels
of a church not far from his Bronx home.
</P>
<P>
   That church was filled Friday with remembrances of Sealy's
''reliability and loyalty'' by family, friends, coaches and cohorts
during a moving tribute to the Minnesota Timberwolves player killed
in a car crash by a man charged with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Former St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca and current coach Mike
Jarvis were among the strong contingent from Sealy's university at
stately Riverside Church overlooking the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves teammate Kevin Garnett, who chose Sealy's St.
John's number when he turned pro, was a pallbearer. Garnett wore
dark glasses and kept his head bowed, shuffling slowly down the
aisle as a rendition of ''You've Got a Friend'' was sung during the
processional.
</P>
<P>
   Among the estimated 3,000 mourners were NBA commissioner David
Stern and dozens of players, including Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson
and Chris Mullin, whose Indiana Pacers are in New York to play the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is one consolation that stands out -- Malik touched many
people,'' Carnesecca said from the pulpit, looking out over a
wreath of red-white-and-blue flowers designed to look like the
NBA's logo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Malik was the captain on my last team and made those last
years a real joy by his example and leadership. I know the man
upstairs will have a spot for him on the starting five.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy, 30, was remembered during the three-hour funeral for his
generosity, someone whose basketball talent was superseded by his
talent for touching others with a smile or kind words. His
charitable work, particularly with children who use wheelchairs,
was lauded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to honor a man who surmounted all the little
differences between people with his reliability and loyalty,'' said
Ernie Lorch, who coached the skinny Sealy at Riverside and still
runs its basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to honor not just the NBA player Malik, but the
solid kid, the solid teenager, who lived through all the problems
the kids downstairs now are dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy helped Minnesota to its top year in franchise history by
averaging 11.3 points this season. He was returning from a birthday
celebration for Garnett when he was killed early last Saturday in a
head-on crash.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett's newlywed wife, Lisa, fighting tears, said Sealy was
''a great dad -- he cooked, he changed diapers, he did laundry -- a
great example'' for their 3-year-old son, Malik Remington.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never got the big contract, he never got the accolades in
the NBA, so give him a standing ovation as he leaves us,'' she told
the mourners, whose applause ricocheted loudly off the church's
vaulted ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be really missed. He added so much to our team
on and off the floor,'' Timberwolves vice president Kevin McHale
said. ''From a management standpoint, he was one of those guys who
made this whole business fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the ceremony, a 20-by-20-foot screen was wheeled
to the front of the church, and video clips were shown of Sealy
playing basketball at various levels, walking through his Bronx
neighborhood, getting married to Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   One segment showed the 6-foot-8 swingman sinking a game-winning
buzzer-beater for the Wolves. He celebrated by dropping to his
back, throwing his arms in the air and kicking his feet up --
smiling and rolling around like a child on a gym floor in the
church basement.

<HEADLINE> UN: More S. Leone Hostages Released  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- The United Nations said Friday
that Sierra Leone's rebels had released 46 more U.N. hostages, but
that several mutilated corpses found this week were probably U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses found Monday are believed to be four Zambians and
one or two Nigerians, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said. They were
badly decomposed, and in some cases only whitened bones remained.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been collecting information from the
various forces who had fighters in the area near Rogberi Junction,
about 50 miles east of the capital, Freetown, where there was a May
6 battle between U.N. peacekeepers and rebels from the
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   Four Zambian and two Nigerian soldiers were reported missing
after the battle, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bodies found were dressed in Zambian military
uniforms bearing the U.N. insignia. However, in the past rebels
have stripped U.N. captives of their weapons and uniforms and used
them in battle, so there could be rebel bodies among them, Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were discovered not far from where Associated Press
Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora and Reuters
correspondent Kurt Schork were later killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora and Schork died Wednesday in a rebel ambush
along the road east from Rogberi Junction to Lunsar. South African
cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek photographer Yannis Behrakis
suffered light injuries in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneons and
intentionally mutilated many more during the country's eight-year
civil war, which ended in July with a shaky peace accord. The
conflict reignited earlier this month when the RUF took about 500
U.N. peacekeepers hostage and began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an alliance of pro-government forces has been
pushing the rebels away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian President Charles Taylor, who has close ties to the
rebels, has been helping negotiate the peacekeepers' release. A
group of 46 hostages were freed, and ferried by helicopter Friday
night to the Liberian capital, Monrovia, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   On Taylor's instructions, the 46 -- most of whom were believed to
be Zambians -- were spending the night in Monrovia. The expectation
is that they would fly to Freetown on Saturday, possibly
accompanied by more freed hostages, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 U.N. personnel are still being held by the rebels,
and Taylor has said 30-40 of them are injured.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and other human rights officials have also received reports
that both rebels and government forces abused civilians in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch accused the Revolutionary United Front of
imposing a ''reign of terror'' during its weeklong occupation of
the area around Masiaka, a town 45 miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters abducted, raped, killed and mutilated civilians
in the area before they were repelled more than a week ago by
pro-government forces, the international group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also been looting and destroying homes, and
forcibly recruiting civilians, U.N. human rights official Richard
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of beatings and slayings by
pro-government forces. Both sides have been re-enlisting child
fighters, some as young as 10, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians have fled their homes. More than 35,000
people have poured into Freetown alone since the beginning of May.
Up to 10,000 other people have gathered on an island just north
Freetown after fleeing violence, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   	   Also Friday, U.N. officials in Sierra Leone received
confirmation that 46 of the peacekeepers still held by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front had been released to authorities in
neighboring Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Leader Recruits Backers  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Scores of Fijians on Friday rushed to support
armed rebels who have held the elected government hostage for the
last week, flooding past military barricades to join the men.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been in chaos since the May 19 coup attempt
by ethnic Fijians against the Indian-dominated government of Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. While the leader of the effort, George
Speight, declared himself premier and appointed a Cabinet, most of
the country's army and civil administration have remained loyal to
Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The leading defector on Friday was Maj. Josefa Savua, the
brother of Fiji's Police Commissioner Isikia Savua. He said he
joined the rebels ''because I am a Fijian. I want a future for my
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the beginning,'' said rebel spokesman Simione
Taikani. ''The police might come. Everybody might come.''
</P>
<P>
   With 60 gunmen, Speight, who is championing the ethnic majority
Fijians against the minority ethnic Indians, stormed the
parliament, seizing Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who has declared himself prime minister and appointed a
Cabinet, left the Parliament complex after 18 soldiers marched to
the gates and joined his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ringed by men who linked arms to form a barricade around him,
Speight walked to two barbed-wire checkpoints guarded by armed
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   At the first barricade, Speight's supporters scuffled with
soldiers, and a rebel and army officer pointed guns at each other
but did not shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Speight then shook hands with the lieutenant at the roadblock,
and a rebel supporter pushed aside the barricade and more backers
joined the pro-rebel crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He walked to a second roadblock, talked with soldiers, and
cleared the way for more supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how many supporters had entered the
complex, but there appeared to be scores of them. More than 1,500
people had gathered inside before the roadblocks were established.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, a committee of the Great Council of Chiefs -- the
supreme body representing Fiji's various tribal royalty --
re-entered negotiations with Speight to try to end the eight-day
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is demanding immunity from prosecution, the abrogation
of Fiji's constitution and the resignation of President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara, who has declared a state of emergency since the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting, the spokesman for the chief's
committee, Epeli Kanaimaii, reported no agreement and said meetings
would resume Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister last year, is the first
leader of Fiji from its ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, whose brother defected, later
announced that Fiji's police had handed security in the region of
the city including parliament to the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am unable to secure the protection of the police at our
checkpoints,'' Savua said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and foreign governments including the United
States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have criticized the
tribal leaders for not cracking down on Speight and his backers.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the chiefs
had 48 hours to support the democratically elected government or
face economic and political sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight is a terrorist -- this is an act of terror,''
Downer said in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is an island nation located in the Pacific 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia. Ethnic Indians make up 44 percent
of the population of 813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for
51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Corzine pours money into TV, mailers and fellow Democrats' coffers  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- How does a political candidate spend $15
million in 47 days?
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented river of cash pouring out of the campaign
coffers -- and personal wallet -- of U.S. Senate candidate Jon
Corzine goes to all forms of advertising, from prime-time network
television to fliers in the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   It also pays for coast-to-coast consultants; researchers who do
polls and hold focus groups; New York lawyers; Irvington caterers;
and a West Orange exterminator. Of insects, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also spent money on his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A spot examination of Corzine's spending by The Associated Press
shows gifts of cash totaling $309,000 to state and county
Democratic organizations in April and May. They included donations
of $25,000 to $30,000 to several major county committees that have
no real primary fights of their own, but on whom Corzine is relying
to rally the party faithful to the polls on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has denounced these sorts of contributions as payoffs to
win endorsement from Democratic leaders and a ''hostile corporate
takeover'' of the Democratic Party. Corzine and the Democratic
leaders getting the donations defend it as essential funding to
build up the party.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's report to the Federal Elections Commission filed last
week shows he had spent $25 million as of May 17 and had obligated
his campaign to another $2.2 million in debts, contracts and bills
yet to be paid. The filing shows Corzine expects to spend at least
another $5 million through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's FEC report showed he had spent $1.9 million by the same
date. Both figures include spending for 1999, $3.7 million by
Corzine, $466,000 by Florio.
</P>
<P>
   The report details item-by-item spending for the April 1-May 17
period. Florio's spending was listed on 12 pages. Corzine's took up
108 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Corzine spent $14.6 million over those six weeks and
five days, roughly $311,000 a day, exceeding in the brief period
his spending of the previous nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign spending included $12.2 million on TV, print and
radio advertising and direct mailings. Of this, $10.4 million was
spent on TV ads and the preparation of TV commercials for later
use; $1.7 million was spent on mailings and $649,345 on radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's chief TV advertising firm, Shrum, Devine &AMP; Donilon of
Washington, D.C., was paid $10 million, including $194,000 over
seven weeks just for editing and consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   His chief New Jersey media firm, Steve DiMicco's Message &AMP; Media
of New Brunswick, was paid $1.4 million to prepare and place
published ads, radio commercials and mailers. Another $1.7 million
was spent on the mailings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn Schoen polling firm of New York was paid $640,000 in
two weeks in mid-April -- the reports do not specify the nature of
the polling -- and Lester and Associates research of Washington
D.C., was paid $36,000 to conduct focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various individuals listed as consultants, Regina Thomas
of Washington, D.C., got the largest single check, $50,000 on May
2. Total spending on staff and consultants is hard to figure, but
the campaign had to pay $46,780 in state and federal payroll taxes
in April and $49,788 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $228,000 was spent in the six-week period on legal fees
or retainers, including two $100,000 payments to the New York law
firm Arkin, Shaffer and Kaplan, though the campaign has yet to
become embroiled in any public legal problems.

<P>
   A payment of $11,562 was made April 24 for office space at the
Robert Treat Hotel in Newark. An exterminator was paid $238 on
April 5. The report does not specify which office needed
de-bugging.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Monday he intends to spend at least another $2
million per week on TV commercials for the final two weeks of the
campaign, although a portion of that could have been contracted by
May 17. He is also expected to deploy large sums on Primary Day in
get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banks and van shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   The May 17 report brings the self-financing Wall Street
millionaire to within a few big checks of shattering the national
record set in 1994 by California Republican Michael Huffington, who
spent $30 million in a failed bid for U.S. Senate against Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided money tally in the New Jersey Democratic primary
comes along with a Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday giving
Corzine an overwhelming lead over Florio, 56 to 30 among registered
Democrats who said they were likely to vote, with 14 percent
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 5.1 percentage points,
which even when skewed to Florio's maximum advantage gives Corzine
a 16-point lead.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Waters Protection  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSATEAGUE ISLAND, Md. (AP) -- Over the roar of ocean surf,
President Clinton pledged Friday to place unique stretches of sea
and beach beyond danger from fishing, drilling or other human
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in shirt sleeves and sunglasses, gestured to an expanse
of wild and windblown beach as he outlined plans for a federal
system of protected marine areas.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that oceans cover about 70 percent of the Earth's
surface and support all manner of economy and jobs. But, he said,
they are also among the world's endangered places, under siege from
pollution, global warming and other threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are immensely powerful, as anyone who has ever been
caught in an undertow can tell you,'' Clinton said. ''But they are
also very, very, fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the network of protected marine areas would resemble
the national system of parks and reserves that safeguard unusual
and threatened regions on land, the White House said. The federal
government has set aside more than 200 million acres of wilderness
and national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans have no immediate effect on fishing, oil
drilling or other industries. Where those activities would be
barred in the future is not known.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of new areas declared off-limits to commercial
fishing angered Freeland Mason of Kilmarnock, Va., not far from
Assateague.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole world is against watermen, and now you have the
world plus the president,'' said Mason, past president of the
Virginia Watermen's Association. ''The conservationists want to cut
out all commercial fishing. They don't want any fishing except by
hook and line. The waterman is an endangered species these days.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already a host of restrictions on commercial and sport
fishing, said Patricia Martin, general manager for The Angler, a
60-person charter fishing boat that sails out of Ocean City, Md.,
for blues, croaker and sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   All new regulations have the potential of hurting the fishing
industry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would really depend on the details, like if they were going
to restrict where we could fish, how far out, or how much per
person,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked a short way along the beach at the Assateague
Island National Seashore, a windblown barrier island off the
Maryland-Virginia coast. Then he addressed a crowd of casually
dressed beach-goers and environmentalists from a podium erected on
the beach, beneath a brilliant sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''For thousands of years, oceans and beaches have stirred the
human imagination,'' Clinton said. ''They still stir the curious
child in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The land and water at Assateague are already protected, but
Clinton said too little of America's ocean resources are also safe
from pollution and other threats. As an example, he cited a
spreading dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, roughly the size of New
Jersey, caused by pesticides and other runoff.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republican congressional leaders of trying to thwart,
through the budget, his efforts at environmental preservation, and
he called for ''a clear, national, bipartisan commitment on the
grass-roots level'' to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the leadership in Congress is swimming against the
tide,'' Clinton said. ''It is in our national interest to do this,
and it should not be a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also directed federal agencies to come up with a quick
plan for protecting Hawaiian coral reefs. He also wants the
Environmental Protection Agency to adopt tougher water pollution
standards in some areas to protect beaches and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans do not require action by Congress, but could be
undone by the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a federal proposal in 90 days that would
permanently protect reefs along a 1,200-mile string of islands in
far northwest Hawaii. The coral reef system there represents 70
percent of all reefs in U.S. waters, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The reefs support threatened sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian
monk seals and other marine life found nowhere else, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Interior and Commerce departments would draw up
lists of threatened areas and weigh how best to protect them --
through total bans on fishing, drilling or other activities, or
through milder measures. A new federal office would administer the
process.

<HEADLINE> Manhunt continues for gunmen in Wendy's shootings  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police had one suspect under arrest and were
questioning another Friday afternoon in the Wendy's
quintuple-murder case that shook Flushing, Queens this week.
</P>
<P>
   Police lifted the palm print of John Taylor, a former short-time
employee of the restaurant, from a recently delivered box as they
sifted through evidence in the bloody basement of the fast-food
restaurant where five employees were killed and two wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was later arrested in Brentwood, Suffolk County, Friday
afternoon, according to a high-ranking police source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A man believed to be an accomplice in the crime was also being
questioned, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee emerged as the prime suspect in Wednesday
night's massacre on bustling Main Street. First Deputy Police
Commissioner Patrick Kelleher -- refusing to comment on the palm
print -- publicly revealed Taylor's name Friday, at first just
asking for help finding him.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was already wanted on an outstanding warrant. He was
arrested on June 23, 1999 for robbing a McDonald's in Queens, but
had missed a court date in connection with that case.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 100 detectives were working around the clock on
countless leads they developed in the Wendy's slayings, Kelleher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked at the Wendy's briefly in 1999, leaving in
October. And he left under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a suspect in a case of missing money from Wendy's,''
Kelleher said. ''It was an internal investigation -- he was never
charged with any criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Once police ran the palm print, they discovered a warrant had
been issued last year for Taylor, after he missed a court
appearance for the McDonald's robbery. He had once worked there,
too. Taylor, 36, of Queens, was on probation at that time for a
1996 burglary of another McDonald's, that one in Manhattan, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wendy's officials and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
announced the creation of an Employees Relief Fund to help the
families of the victims. A single fund will be established and
divided among the seven families. Wendy's has offered a $50,000
reward and the city $10,000 for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of the persons responsible.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, JaQuione Johnson, 18, underwent
surgery Friday and remained in critical condition at New York
Hospital Medical Center in Queens with a gunshot wound to the head.
Johnson has been thinking about joining the Marines, and raps in a
group called Family 4 Life with his brothers and cousins. He lives
with his aunt in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The other survivor, Patrick Castro, 23, was released from the
hospital Thursday and is under police protection. The Queens man
was shot through both cheeks and is credited with saving Johnson's
life.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims -- bound, gagged and with plastic bags over their
heads -- were shot about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, and the gunmen left
with about $2,000 in cash and a videotape from the restaurant's
security equipment. Castro was able to free himself two hours
later, call 911, and drag Johnson upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed were identified by police as Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Queens; Anita C. Smith, 23, of Queens; Jeremy Ryan
Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Queens; and Jean
Auguste, 27, of Brooklyn. Each was shot in the head, execution
style.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste was the manager and the gunmen asked for him by name
when they came to the restaurant at closing time. They went to his
basement office, then Auguste summoned his employees downstairs via
intercom.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste, a Haitian immigrant, became a U.S. citizen two years
ago. He and his girlfriend became engaged last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nazario worked at the Wendy's with his 41-year-old sister,
Maritza, who was off Wednesday. He liked to barbecue and dance,
said his brother, Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Mele graduated last year from Neptune High School and was active
in the ROTC program. Ibadat worked seven days a week to send money
home to his wife and children in his native Pakistan, said neighbor
Abdul Waheed. Smith was to start classes at York College in Queens
in the fall. Her family said she wanted to major in social work and
was training to work with disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Anyone with information regarding the shooting is
asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. Anyone wishing to
contribute to the victims' families can send a check to: Wendy's
Employees Relief Fund, Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, 51
Chambers St., Room 630, New York, N.Y., 10007.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 25; Nasdaq Off 0.24  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a quiet, fitful session with narrow
losses Friday as investors, unconsoled by new signs of a slowing
economy, focused instead on the prospect of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Every market average bobbed between gains and losses as
investors proved reluctant to take on any significant new positions
in advance of the three-day weekend for Memorial Day. The New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market both had their slowest
sessions of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.68 to 10,299.24. For
the week, the blue-chip index fell 327.61 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.24 to 3,205.11. It fell
185.29 points during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also fractionally lower. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.50 to 1,378.02.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks made several attempts to rally, but weakness
in some industry leaders undermined the sector. Qualcomm fell 2
15/16 to 66 1/16 and Dell Computer dropped 1] to 42].
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft slipped 1/16 to 61 7/16 after the Justice Department,
in a filing to a federal judge, pushed anew to have software giant
Microsoft split into two companies. The new document is the final
version of the government's proposed remedy to curb the company's
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks fell for a second straight day, following a
report from a Merrill Lynch analyst that Goldman Sachs is likely to
miss second-quarter earnings estimates. Goldman fell 3 3/16 to 69
13/16, pulling down rivals including Merrill Lynch, which lost 3\
to 91 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney became the latest Wall Street firm to raise
concerns about Goldman's earnings. Salomon analyst Guy Moszkowski
lowered his estimate for Goldman's second-quarter earnings to $1.35
a share from $1.50 a share, citing concerns about the impact of
recent market turmoil on the firm's private equity investments and
trading volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in high-tech and financial stocks made it difficult
for the rest of the market to advance, even after two reports from
the Commerce Department helped provided evidence of an economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus was on the report showing orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 6.4 percent in
April, its biggest plunge since December 1991. The decline was
mostly attributed to a steep slump in orders for electronics and
electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the government reported Americans' spending rose in
April at its slowest pace in nine months. Personal income grew at a
faster pace than spending for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
June in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflationary
pressures under control. The stock market has been under pressure
in recent weeks as investors fail to find any signs of a slowing
economy, which could persuade the Fed to soon end its cycle of rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Friday's economic reports showed some sign of a
slowdown, the economy remains far too vigorous to mollify the Fed,
said Zane Brown, director of fixed income at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still earning a lot of money, and as good
Americans, will continue to spend it,'' he said. Brown expects the
Fed to raise interest rates modestly in June unless economic data
in the next few weeks offers convincing proof that a slowdown has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 867.32
million shares, compared with 1.17 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.20 to 457.37.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 slipped 0.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Environmental-Safeguards Agreed On  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Sixty-four governments and the European
Union on Friday agreed to safeguards aimed at reducing the risk
that genetically modified plants will harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the U.N. Environment
Agency, warned that the genetically modified organisms could enter
the environment without such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He said they pact seeks to minimize risks posed by international
movement of such organisms. It addresses fears that without proper
policing, plants that have been altered genetically could pass on
traits to other plants with undesired results, or that imported
plants may threaten the ecology of their new homes.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of the biosafety protocol marked an end to a 10-day
conference, a follow-up to the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Convention on
Biological Diversity. About 1,500 delegates from 177 countries
attended. The protocol will take effect when ratified in 50 signing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is the term coined to cover the Earth's entire
range of plant and animal life and the importance of maintaining as
much diversity as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Toepfer said protecting biodiversity is essential because of the
services that it provides humanity.

<HEADLINE> Former employee jumps off eighth floor of Trump Marina garage  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A former employee of Trump Marina
Hotel Casino killed himself Friday by jumping off the casino's
parking garage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He was the third current or former casino employee to commit
suicide at a casino here in the last nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Charles LaVerde, 45, of Brigantine, a former floorperson at the
casino, plunged from the eighth floor of the nine-story garage
about 6 a.m., landing on pavement where incoming cars enter the
self-park garage.
</P>
<P>
   He died at the scene. The motive was unknown: There was no
suicide note, according to Sgt. Michael Tullio, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine what it felt like to do that?'' a Trump Marina
employee said later, looking up the side of the garage from the
spot where LaVerde landed. ''Once you make the decision, there's no
turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVerde had worked at the casino since it opened in 1985. Casino
officials wouldn't say when he left or why.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're being told not to say anything right now, until we have
all the information from police,'' said Suze DiPietro, a
spokeswoman. ''It's a police matter.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVerde, who lived with his adult daughter in a 1{-story maroon
bungalow just off the beach in Brigantine, was described by a
neighbor as a pleasant man who always said hello when he passed
neighbors in the street but otherwise kept to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, that's horrible,'' said Rachel Brandoff, 23, who lives two
doors from LaVerde, when she was told what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The parking garages of the casinos have become magnets for
suicides in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In August, three people jumped to their deaths from casino
buildings in an eight-day span. One jumped from the Resorts
Atlantic City, one from the Caesars Atlantic City Hotel &AMP; Casino
garage and one from a Trump Plaza tower. The person who leapt from
Caesars was a part-time dealer at the casino.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, a part-time dealer at the Sands Hotel &AMP; Casino
jumped to his death from the Trump Plaza garage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a shame,'' said Tullio. ''People should know:
There's help out there. They should think twice before they do
something like this to themselves and call us. We'll try to get you
some help before it's too late.''

By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Setting out a bright yellow menu on
the counter, hot dog stand owner Michael Maui looked out Friday at
the clear blue sky and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk tables in front of Maui's Dog House on New Jersey
Avenue were neatly arranged, the awnings clean and bright, the salt
and pepper shakers just so. Now, all he needed was customers. But
he wasn't worried. The Memorial Day weekend had finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Summer's here. It's in the air. You can smell it,'' Maui said.
''This is the weekend that all hell breaks loose. We'll be going 24
hours a day from now on. You can come here at midnight, you can
come here at 3 a.m. You should see this place when the bars let
out!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at Dad's Place boat rentals, general manager Mars
Anagnou was hustling. Sunny skies and temperatures in the high 70s
weren't helping him: There were boat bottoms to be cleaned, waxed
and painted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had so much rain, we couldn't paint bottom except for a
few days. Now we're trying to make up for it. And we still have to
do the landscaping out front, too,'' he said, pointing to overgrown
grass in front of the marina.
</P>
<P>
   At hotels, campgrounds, arcades and restaurants, shore merchants
tended to the last-minute details and winter-weary vacationers hit
the Garden State Parkway, bound for beach towns like this.
</P>
<P>
   In Margate, workers at Lucy the Elephant -- a six-story wooden
elephant open for tours -- were busy straightening up the gift shop
and stocking T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In Point Pleasant Beach, Gov. Christie Whitman welcomed the
season by predicting another ''phenomenal summer season.' Last
year, the state rang up $27.7 billion in tourism-related
expenditures, according to state estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A dreary weather forecast for the Memorial Day weekend -- the
traditional start of summer at the Jersey shore -- didn't dampen
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's already coming anyway,'' said Patty DeClemente,
owner of the Gulfstream Motel in Wildwood, whose six motel rooms
and efficiencies were booked for the weekend. ''It shouldn't make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Suitcase Motel, Jennifer Dietzel, 18, and four friends
from Pennsylvania were unpacking their car, about to check in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always went other places for Memorial Day, but my friends
talked me into coming here. We're here to have fun, go on some
rides,'' Dietzel said.
</P>
<P>
   In Stone Harbor, 35 children from Deerfield Township School were
getting a daylong primer on coastal ecosystems during a field trip
to the Wetlands Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to
research and education, offers tours, instruction and hands-on
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Memorial Day is the beginning of what we call the wonderful
madness here. We're here to show people the beauty of the coastal
ecosystem,'' said environmental educator Charlotte McDevitt.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who had arrived by Friday, the children were
happy to be at the Shore. And they weren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wonderful to be here,'' said Anne Longa, 39, of Bogota,
standing on the steps of the Boardwalk in Wildwood. ''I'm glad
summer's here. It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   She was in Wildwood for a convention of DARE officers from
around the state. The convention coincides with the 15th annual
Wildwoods International Kite Festival, which filled the air over
the Hand Avenue beach Friday with colorful, high-flying kites and
windsocks of all shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which runs through Monday, features stunt kite
competitions, choreographed musical flights, kite-powered beach
buggies and do-it-yourself opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Conservative group airs ads calling Republican lawmaker 'liberal'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of conservative Republicans is turning
up the heat in its campaign to defeat Rep. Marge Roukema of New
Jersey, a fellow Republican the group considers too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The Club for Growth this week began running radio and television
ads in Roukema's northern New Jersey district calling her ''too
taxing'' and ''too liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Roukema accused the group of launching a ''low-road'' campaign
against her. And a moderate Republican group in Washington has
launched its own ad campaign defending Roukema and assailing her
opponent, Scott Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight election, Roukema is locked in a primary
battle with Garrett, a conservative state Assemblyman who came
within 1,700 votes of defeating her in 1998. This year, Garrett is
getting help from Club for Growth, a Washington-based group
advocating ''the Reagan vision of limited government and lower
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, the group's president, said the goal is to ''send
a powerful message that the Republican Party will no longer stand
for higher taxes and wasteful government spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of the television ad says, ''Across 20 years, the
National Taxpayers Union ranks (Roukema) among the most liberal
Republicans in Congress. She supported raiding Social Security,
opposed the line-item veto and scrapping the IRS tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union, one of many interest groups that
rank members of Congress, gave Roukema a ''C-plus'' for her votes
in 1999 -- higher than two other Republicans from New Jersey, Reps.
Chris Smith and Jim Saxton, who got grades of ''C''. Roukema ranked
162nd out of 222 Republicans in the House, said John Berthoud,
president of the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema did oppose giving the line-item veto to the president.
She was one of 20 Republicans to vote against legislation scrapping
the IRS tax code, calling the bill ''just show business. You don't
eliminate the tax code unless you know how you're going to find a
substitute for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the charge of ''raiding Social Security'' is fair
because Roukema voted over the years for spending bills that,
technically speaking, relied on money diverted from the Social
Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Roukema says protecting Social Security is one of her top
priorities. She opposes Garrett's proposal to let people put a
substantial amount of their Social Security payroll taxes into
privately run investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The radio ad is a parody of a radio call-in show with the caller
pretending to be Roukema.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leading a double life,'' the mock-Roukema confesses to the
host. ''... I run for Congress pretending to be conservative, but I
go to Washington and vote like a liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Roukema on Friday ripped the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absolutely unbelievable,'' she said. ''This group has
hit a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the television ad inaccurately claims she
joined Congress when Jimmy Carter was president. In fact, Roukema
joined Congress in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't done their own homework,'' she said. ''I was part
of the Reagan Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Roukema noted that over the years she has won annual awards from
fiscal watchdog groups such as the Concord Coalition, Watchdogs of
the Treasury and the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   She's also been endorsed this year by the Republican
organizations in the four counties within the 5th Congressional
District and by Republican leaders in Congress, including House
Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council, which supports centrist
Republicans, is airing a television ad in the district that praises
Roukema and criticizes Garrett for voting in the Assembly for
higher fees on New Jersey residents and for a pay raise for
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said the charges of fee increases are ''not
substantial'' and that he plans not to benefit from the salary
increase because it takes effect next year, when he hopes to be in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Moore estimated that the Club for Growth will spend $90,000 to
$100,000 on the ad campaign against Roukema. The radio ads began
Tuesday and will run through June 5, a day before the primary. The
television ads began Thursday on local cable channels and will also
run through June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be very tough to knock (Roukema) off,'' Moore
said. ''This is a very pro-incumbent environment we're working in.
We think we have a chance, but the odds are against us.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Senator To Have Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Pete Domenici will undergo surgery next
week to relieve pressure on nerves in his neck, a problem that
developed after a Thanksgiving game of touch football with his
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The elective procedure will be performed Wednesday at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Domenici, R-N.M., whose
68th birthday was May 7, is expected to be hospitalized for about
three days, with a posthospital recovery period of around two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Domenici underwent therapy at the University of
New Mexico Hospital for inflamed nerves in his neck and right
shoulder caused by bone spurs irritated in the touch football game
with his grandchildren. Subsequent nonsurgical treatments to
relieve the problem failed, Domenici's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, canceled a
working trip to New Mexico next week during which he was to have
acted as host Tuesday for visiting Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deeply regret that the doctor's surgery schedule conflicts
with my work in New Mexico, but my family and I have decided that
getting this corrected now is the best way to proceed,'' Domenici
said in a statement issued by his office. ''I am confident that my
recovery from this procedure will be quick.''

<HEADLINE> GOP candidates spar in final televised debate of the primary  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Republican candidates for the U.S.
Senate looked and sounded comfortable Friday in their last
televised debate of the primary season with 10 days until Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The three candidates who are officeholders and have vied for the
support of mainstream Republicans offered a few contrasts to give
voters a basis on which to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, appeared as
practiced and polished as his primary opponent, state Sen. William
Gormley, R-Atlantic, in the debate taped in armchairs at WPVI-TV
studios here. It will be broadcast Saturday 3 p.m. on WPVI Channel
6 in Philadelphia and again Sunday 10 a.m. on its network
affiliate, WABC-TV Channel 7 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger showed more emotion at
moments and seemed determined to deliver a few speeches to the TV
audience, but the debate was tame compared with their encounters on
cable TV Monday and on New York radio Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest barbs Friday came from the Republican Party's
outsider, Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin, the former
Libertarian who denounced the ''left-wing liberal'' direction of
the national GOP and said his opponents are part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's debate was their fourth encounter, and the candidates
have tentatively scheduled a fifth debate Thursday in northern New
Jersey before an live audience but with no broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates disagreed Friday on giving vouchers to parents to
help pay for private school. Gormley opposed them, saying it was
better to emphasize charter schools. Franks said vouchers were a
good idea and he would permit federal funding to be used for them,
but said Congress must not create the program. He would allow state
governments to decide whether to try vouchers and in what form.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger supported vouchers for use in specific, troubled
school districts. Sabrin said he wanted to erase all federal
regulation and funding of schools, abolishing the U.S. Department
of Education in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the next great wave in education is home
schooling,'' Sabrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin has also set himself apart from his competitors as firmly
anti-abortion and an opponent of gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw those Korean merchants during the L.A. riots. Their
businesses were protected because they had the means to defend
themselves,'' Sabrin said. ''Where gun ownership is widespread,
legally owned guns prevent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates were asked an array of questions concerning
places foreign to New Jerseyans and far across the water: China,
Cuba, Israel, New York City and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On China, only Treffinger and Sabrin opposed granting the
country permanent free-trade status, and only Sabrin opposed the
embargo of food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   All were asked how they would react should Hillary Clinton win
the U.S. Senate race in New York. ''I am a man of religious faith
and I just pray that does not happen,'' Treffinger said.
</P>
<P>
   All said the federal government has no business regulating
smoking in restaurants, as Philadelphia is contemplating, but they
said cities should have the right to impose such bans.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley said they would not prevent same-sex couples
from adopting children, pitting them against their colleague, U.S.
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who is blocking an international
adoption treaty until same-sex adoptions are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't approve of the homosexual lifestyle, but at the end of
the day we have got to have a public policy in America that
recognizes that we have millions of children who are urgently in
need of a family,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley agreed. ''It is a situation where if you weigh the
well-being of the child, if you look at what the agency has
reviewed, then in certain circumstances it would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger and Sabrin both opposed it sharply, saying gay and
lesbian famlies cannot be condoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adoption proceedings should take place in a way that conforms
in the way that we live as Americans,'' Treffinger said. ''I would
vote with Congressman Smith on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin said the nation's embrace of homosexuality was dangerous.
''We now have schools teaching young people how to have gay sex,''
he claimed.

<HEADLINE> eBay pulls drug from auction site after students sickened  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An Internet auction site pulled a cough
medicine ingredient from its postings after four students at a
private boarding school were hospitalized after they acquired the
drug online and took it, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
investigating whether the sale violated its regulations, and eBay
said it will cooperate and provide the names of sellers, bidders
and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The four 17-year-old juniors have recovered and will probably
leave the Peddie School, of Hightstown, which has a
''one-strike-you're-out'' policy on drugs and alcohol, school
spokeswoman Susan James said.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently overdosed on DXM (dextromethorphan
hydrobromide), a white powder that is a common ingredient in
over-the-counter cough medicines.
</P>
<P>
   It produces a hallucinogenic high in large quantities, but can
also lead to vomiting, unconsciousness and, in extreme cases,
death.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA allows DXM to be sold in over-the-counter cough
suppressants as long as the product includes instructions for safe
use, said Thomas McGinnis, director of pharmacy affairs for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   DXM is not approved for bulk sales to the public, and the FDA is
trying to determine who was selling the drug, where they got it,
and whether proper dosage information was included, McGinnis said.
Offenders could face criminal charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The misuse of DXM appears to by cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 10 years ago, I heard about kids abusing
dextromethorphan, but now it seems to be picking up again,''
McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters once simply bought lots of cough syrup, but now
appear to be finding pure DXM, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA urges consumers to be cautious about buying drugs off
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Peddie incident began Tuesday night, when a disoriented girl
who had vomited was brought to the nurse's office, James said. Soon
after, a boy in the same condition was found in his room, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A student also found two unresponsive girls behind a nearby
Baptist church and flagged down a police car, James said.
</P>
<P>
   Students told paramedics the victims had taken DXM, and a bag of
white powder was found in the boy's room, James said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were taken to The Medical Center at Princeton, and
released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other students told school authorities the victims obtained the
DXM from eBay, James said.
</P>
<P>
   One offered 50 grams of DXM ''professionally weighed and sealed
in a plastic baggie'' with a starting price of $125. Bidding was to
end May 31. The other offered 20 grams starting at $49.99, and
bidding was to end May 29.
</P>
<P>
   The substance was available until Thursday evening from two
postings on eBay. By Friday morning, those entries had carried a
note saying ''the item you requested is invalid or no longer in our
database.''
</P>
<P>
   An eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said the entries were
removed because DXM may be considered a controlled substance, and
the auction site does not permit listing such items. It also does
not permit the posting of illegal or prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in San Jose, Calif., has reviewed its
listings for the past 30 days -- the furthest back it can check --
and found seven postings for DXM, Pursglove said. Five sold, and
the other two were the ones taken down this week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're continuing to gather information on all of these
listings, including sellers, bidders and buyers, and will share
this information with the appropriate law enforcement agency,''
Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has not determined whether any of the Peddie
students were among DXM buyers, but that it would not make that
information public when it concludes its review.
</P>
<P>
   The Peddie School has about 500 students in grades eight through
12. About 300 students are housed in seven dormitories on the
campus.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Withdrew for Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said in an
interview broadcast Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
had ordered a withdrawal from Lebanon because he wanted peace, not
because guerrillas forced Israel out.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have
celebrated the withdrawal as a victory for Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas, who led the fight to oust Israel from a border zone it
occupied for 18 years. In the West Bank city of Nablus on Friday,
1,500 people marched to protest Israel's holding Palestinian
prisoners, shouting: ''Barak you are a coward, you ran away from
Lebanon!''
</P>
<P>
   In many Arab countries, there were calls for Arafat to learn
from Hezbollah's example and use force to regain Palestinian lands
captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, however, dismissed suggestions that Israel withdrew from
Lebanon to flee the guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want to tell me that Barak gave the instruction to
withdraw because of Hezbollah?'' Arafat scoffed during a rare
interview Thursday with Israel's Channel Two television.
</P>
<P>
   Barak ordered the withdrawal ''to implement United Nations
resolution 425,'' which calls for Israel to leave Lebanon, Arafat
said. Israel also agreed to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as a basis for peace talks, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are negotiating a final peace treaty
to determine the boundaries and scope of a Palestinian state. The
Palestinians have said they'll accept nothing less than all of the
West Bank and Gaza, but Arafat appeared in the interview to show
some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Barak had offered 80-90 percent of the West Bank,
but said that if presented with such an offer, ''we have to discuss
it in detail through negotiations on what had been signed and
agreed upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Spain on Friday, Arafat praised Israel's withdrawal
from Lebanon. But he said real peace would only come when Israel
withdrew from all the lands it captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He said peace talks had run into ''some difficulties,'' an
allusion to the apparent deadlock over the release of 1,600
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Man arrested in Wendy's shootings  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police had one suspect under arrest and were
questioning another Friday afternoon in the Wendy's
quintuple-murder case that shook Flushing, Queens this week.
</P>
<P>
   Police lifted the palm print of John Taylor, a former short-time
employee of the restaurant, from a recently delivered box as they
sifted through evidence in the bloody basement of the fast-food
restaurant where five employees were killed and two wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was later arrested in Brentwood, Suffolk County, Friday
afternoon, according to a high-ranking police source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A man believed to be an accomplice in the crime was also being
questioned, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee emerged as the prime suspect in Wednesday
night's massacre on bustling Main Street. First Deputy Police
Commissioner Patrick Kelleher -- refusing to comment on the palm
print -- publicly revealed Taylor's name Friday, at first just
asking for help finding him.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was already wanted on an outstanding warrant. He was
arrested on June 23, 1999 for robbing a McDonald's in Queens, but
had missed a court date in connection with that case.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 100 detectives were working around the clock on
countless leads they developed in the Wendy's slayings, Kelleher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked at the Wendy's briefly in 1999, leaving in
October. And he left under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a suspect in a case of missing money from Wendy's,''
Kelleher said. ''It was an internal investigation -- he was never
charged with any criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Once police ran the palm print, they discovered a warrant had
been issued last year for Taylor, after he missed a court
appearance for the McDonald's robbery. He had once worked there,
too. Taylor, 36, of Queens, was on probation at that time for a
1996 burglary of another McDonald's, that one in Manhattan, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wendy's officials and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
announced the creation of an Employees Relief Fund to help the
families of the victims. A single fund will be established and
divided among the seven families. Wendy's has offered a $50,000
reward and the city $10,000 for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of the persons responsible.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, JaQuione Johnson, 18, underwent
surgery Friday and remained in critical condition at New York
Hospital Medical Center in Queens with a gunshot wound to the head.
Johnson has been thinking about joining the Marines, and raps in a
group called Family 4 Life with his brothers and cousins. He lives
with his aunt in Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The other survivor, Patrick Castro, 23, was released from the
hospital Thursday and is under police protection. The Queens man
was shot through both cheeks and is credited with saving Johnson's
life.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims -- bound, gagged and with plastic bags over their
heads -- were shot about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, and the gunmen left
with about $2,000 in cash and a videotape from the restaurant's
security equipment. Castro was able to free himself two hours
later, call 911, and drag Johnson upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed were identified by police as Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Queens; Anita C. Smith, 23, of Queens; Jeremy Ryan
Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Queens; and Jean
Auguste, 27, of Brooklyn. Each was shot in the head, execution
style.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste was the manager and the gunmen asked for him by name
when they came to the restaurant at closing time. They went to his
basement office, then Auguste summoned his employees downstairs via
intercom.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste, a Haitian immigrant, became a U.S. citizen two years
ago. He had asked his girlfriend to marry him last month and she
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Nazario worked at the Wendy's with his 41-year-old sister,
Maritza, who was off Wednesday. He liked to barbecue and dance,
said his brother, Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Mele graduated last year from Neptune High School and was active
in the ROTC program. Ibadat worked seven days a week to send money
home to his wife and children in his native Pakistan, said neighbor
Abdul Waheed. Smith was to start classes at York College in Queens
in the fall. Her family said she wanted to major in social work and
was training to work with disabled children.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Anyone with information regarding the shooting or
the whereabouts of John Taylor is asked to call Crime Stoppers at
(800) 577-TIPS. Anyone wishing to contribute to the victims'
families can send a check to: Wendy's Employees Relief Fund,

York, N.Y., 10007.

<HEADLINE> Central New Jersey rail project endorsed by Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON (AP) -- Opinions are split on a proposed $400 million
rail line through Monmouth, Ocean and Middlesex counties. Some see
it as a convenient way to beat the traffic in fast-growing central
New Jersey, but others call it a dangerous boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   The project has languished for years, but was recently put on
the fast track by NJ Transit officials who say they cannot improve
local roads such as Route 9 fast enough to keep up with regional
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to area congestion, backers say, is a commuter rail
system linking northern Ocean County, western Monmouth County, and
southern Middlesex County, where it would connect with the busy
Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly weighed in Thursday, voting 43-23 to endorse
a new central New Jersey rail project. But the Assembly vote did
not designate a specific route.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a Democrat whose district includes three southern
Middlesex County communities through which residents they fear the
line will pass led the charge against the Assembly measure.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Gary Guear, D-Mercer, said Friday that residents of
Jamesburg, Monroe Township and South Brunswick oppose the line for
safety and economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   There are schools, houses and senior citizen centers close to
the line, he said. In Monroe alone, school buses cross the line,
which is currently used by freight trains, 136 times a day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the safety hazard is of paramount concern,'' the
lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that the line will suffer from low ridership
and require a $1 million monthly state subsidy to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit Executive Director Jeffrey Warsh said ridership will
be adequate -- about 5,300 people a day -- but he admitted that the
state will lose money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's isn't a single mass transit agency that turns a
profit,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   More heavily used transit lines in northeastern New Jersey help
support projects in the central and southern parts of the state, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for the line would be to run north from Lakewood
to Red Bank.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit will decide where to place the new rail line based on
demand, environmental studies and engineering factors, Warsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The case is very clear that the (Middlesex, Ocean, Monmouth)
region is among the fastest growing residential and commercial
sectors in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of regional road and bus improvements along heavily
traveled Route 9 cannot keep up with the booming growth of the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlesex Route would serve shore commuters who need to
travel to Rutgers and Princeton universities or the jobs-rich Route
1 corridor, in addition to those eventually heading to New York, he
said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Chief Freeh Faced Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department considered but decided
against an independent counsel to investigate FBI Director Louis
Freeh for inaccurate congressional testimony, The Associated Press
has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was the subject of a 30-day preliminary independent
counsel inquiry in 1997 after the department's internal watchdog
accused him of giving false testimony during a hearing about the
FBI laboratory's mishandling of cases, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno concluded that while Freeh's
testimony was inaccurate, there was no evidence of criminal intent
that would warrant the appointment of an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Reno said she agreed with the Justice
Department investigators, who concluded that Freeh had simply made
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have worked with Director Freeh for nearly seven years and
have the utmost respect for his integrity,'' Reno's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Freeh inquiry, the director and Reno were
beginning what became a lengthy disagreement over whether an
independent prosecutor should be named to investigate the
fund-raising activities of President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The no-criminal-intent rationale for declining an independent
counsel in the Freeh matter was similar to the one Reno used to
decline appointment of a counsel for Gore. Reno used other
standards for declining such an appointment for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the Freeh matter, Reno also concluded there was no evidence
the director knew that his testimony was inaccurate, the officials
said. As soon as he did, Freeh sent a letter to a House
Appropriations subcommittee to correct the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The internal debate is detailed in documents recently turned
over to House and Senate investigators reviewing why Reno refused a
special prosecutor to investigate fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page statement Friday, Freeh said he cooperated with
the preliminary inquiry and was exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cooperated fully with this preliminary investigation even
though I was confident that the subcommittee record was, in fact,
made complete by my letter and this simple matter had been
appropriately resolved,'' said Freeh, who has been FBI director
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary inquiry by the Justice Department public
integrity section was closed ''after concluding without question
that I had done nothing wrong,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure comes as Republicans and Democrats intensify
their review of Justice's fund-raising investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FBI belatedly turned over a memo Freeh wrote in
1996 suggesting that the head of the Justice Department public
integrity section felt pressure not to proceed with the
fund-raising probe because he feared Reno's job hung in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Lee Radek, has testified he cannot recall making
the remark. Two FBI officials witnessed the comments, according to
testimony and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh has openly disagreed with Reno's decision against naming
an independent counsel for fund-raising, as did the former chief
prosecutor in the case, Charles LaBella.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is reviewing their memos arguing for appointment of the
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill intend to use the revelation about the
Freeh matter to argue that the FBI director benefited from the same
Reno analysis of the law that led to the decision not to appoint a
special prosecutor for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reno concluded there were no grounds to name a special
prosecutor for Gore's fund-raising in part because there was no
evidence of a ''knowing disregard of the law.'' She used a similar
standard for declining Freeh's case.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's case had the added element that the evidence showed the
FBI chief was unaware his testimony was wrong and that he corrected
it as soon as he found out, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were surprised when Justice turned over documents in
the unrelated Freeh case to their fund-raising probe.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pressing for the release of all documents gathered
by Congress in the review.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that only a complete release will put an end to the
gamesmanship we see here today,'' Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the
senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said earlier this
week after a hearing on the Radek matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Freeh matter, the Justice Department public integrity
section began a 30-day preliminary independent counsel inquiry
after Inspector General Michael R. Bromwich made his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh testified March 5, 1997, before the House subcommittee
that FBI lab whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst was suspended with
pay ''solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation by the
inspector general and their findings with respect to Mr.
Whitehurst.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich objected in writing, saying his report never formally
recommended that Whitehurst be suspended and that the FBI also made
the suspension because Whitehurst refused to be interviewed during
a separate Justice investigation into a press leak of his
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   After Bromwich demanded a correction, the FBI director sent a
letter to the subcommittee that his testimony ''was incomplete.''
He wrote that Whitehurst's refusal to cooperate with the leak
investigation was a basis for the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Friday, Freeh said he didn't know about the
second basis for Whitehurst's suspension because he had been
recused from the FBI lab matter earlier to avoid the appearance of
a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immediately after learning that my answer was not factually
complete, I drafted a letter and sent it to both the subcommittee
chairman and the DOJ inspector general,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Meat Industry  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the food industry
Friday ''to use its vast resources'' to maintain the safety of meat
following a Texas judge's decision striking down a testing program
to detect salmonella contamination in ground beef processing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, a small minority of meat plants are acting
against the best interests of the American people,'' Clinton said
in a statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Joe Fish said that the
Agriculture Department exceeded its authority by pulling inspectors
from a Dallas plant -- effectively shutting it down -- after the
facility failed the department's salmonella inspection standards.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the tests are not a fair measure of sanitary
conditions in a plant. His ruling applies to plants in the northern
district of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials said that the testing program ensures raw ground
beef is safe for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Justice Department has vigorously defended this vital
program and will decide on an expedited basis what further legal
action to take,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle threatens to ''undermine an inspection system
that is clearly effective in reducing food poisoning, jeopardizing
the confidence that consumers have in the safety of the food they
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The salmonella standards are part of a new inspection system
that requires companies to prevent pathogens from reaching food
products rather than leaving it to USDA inspectors to find
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   USDA withdrew its inspectors from the Supreme Beef Inc. plant
Nov. 30, 1999, but was forced to send them back later in the day
when Fish granted a temporary restraining order. The plant had
failed three salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Beef, a supplier of meat to the federal school lunch
program, said the rules were arbitrary.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Outbreak Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO, Ontario (AP) -- Police launched an investigation Friday
into one of North America's worst E. coli outbreaks as residents of
a small Ontario town buried the first of five people killed so far
by the bacteria contaminating the local water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of grief and finger-pointing came a day after
Ontario provincial officials took control of the water supply in
Walkerton, a farm town of 5,000 people some 90 miles west of
Toronto where hundreds have been sickened since last week with the
intestinal bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have died and hundreds have been sickened in the E.
coli outbreak, Canada's worst ever.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will focus in part on why the local Public
Utility Commission did not immediately notify health authorities
that water from town wells was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor David Thomson of the Brockton municipality, which includes
Walkerton, said the general manager of the Public Utility
Commission -- which provides water and electricity to the town -- has
acknowledged that the commission was aware of the problem as early
as May 18 but failed to notify local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said Thursday that the utility failed to tell his office
or health authorities, even after a local health official issued a
boil order for the water supply Sunday following reports from
doctors of bloody diarrhea. The health officer said he had asked
the utility commission three times if the water was clean, and was
told it was.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kieffer, chairman of the utility commission, said utility
workers may have been unaware of how dangerous E. coli could be.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Richard Kotwa of the Ontario Provincial Police
said a police investigation into the E. coli contamination began
Friday with interviews of officials and gathering of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a criminal investigation at this point. It could be
later,'' Kotwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday the crisis appeared to have peaked, with
the number of people seeking medical treatment failing to increase
and tests of water from dozens of sites around Walkerton testing
free of E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Burns of B.M. Ross Engineering Consultants, who is helping
the Ontario Environment Ministry investigate the contamination
problem, said the boil order for tap water in the town would remain
in effect for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Premier Mike Harris visited Walkerton on Friday and told
an outdoor news conference that ''every aspect of this, from every
level of government, will be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris left without answering a question yelled by Veronica
Davidson, a Walkerton resident who said she wanted the premier to
say exactly what would be done to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Thomson put the utility under the control of the
Ontario Clean Water Agency, which will examine the water wells and
recommend how to prevent any future problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Thomson said the chlorinating unit on one of the
two main wells pumping water had been working only sporadically. He
said a new unit that officials had ordered weeks earlier arrived
last week and was installed over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspect recent flooding caused by heavy rain may have
contaminated the town's water supply with animal feces. Burns and
environment ministry officials said the source also could been a
construction site in the area.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burns, 53 of 58 water samples from around Walkerton
tested clear of E. coli. The five positive tests came from one
building that he refused to identify, saying the owners of the
property were notified.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Waterloo, Ontario, 12 people who recently visited
Walkerton have complained of E. coli infection symptoms and one
case has been confirmed as E. coli, said Bob Hart, manager of
infection control for the Waterloo Community Health Department.
Hart said none of the cases was serious.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony Friday at the Sacred Heart Church in Walkerton,
family and friends gathered for the funeral of Lenore Al, 66, a
librarian who'd just retired with her husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were going to enjoy life together,'' said Beulah
Turnbull, 64, a longtime friend. ''She was an all-round nice
person; she will certainly be in God's garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The first deaths were reported Wednesday -- a baby and three
adults, including Al. Another elderly victim died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from around the region were converging on South
Bruce-Grey Health Center to help the beleaguered staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are children in intensive care who are not getting
better, they are getting worse,'' Dr. Douglas Matsell, a pediatric
kidney specialist, said of patients airlifted to a hospital in
London, Ontario. ''I worry that there will be more deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The contamination caused officials to close all five schools in
the community, along with the daycare center.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has evoked memories of an E. coli poisoning from
tainted hamburger meat at Jack-in-the-Box fast food restaurants in
Washington state. The 1993 outbreak killed four people and sickened
hundreds.

<HEADLINE> Pay Disparity Among Sexes Persists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women earned an average of 76.5 cents on the
dollar last year compared with men doing the same full-time work.
</P>
<P>
   The pay gap between the sexes was little changed from 1998, when
women took home an average of 76.3 cents for every dollar earned by
men, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a report released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, when the agency started keeping track, women have
closed the gap by 14 cents. Some ground was lost in the mid-1990s,
however, and women have still not regained it to reach he high of
77.1 percent of men's earnings they took home in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wage discrimination remains an unfortunate reality for many
women,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, black and Hispanic women earned 64.1 and 54.5 cents
respectively for every dollar earned by white men, also little
changed. Among blacks, women earned 83.7 percent of what men earned
and Hispanic women made 85.7 percent of Hispanic men's earnings.
Among whites, women made 75.7 percent of what men did.
</P>
<P>
   Women's employment in typically higher-paying jobs is growing.
The percentage of women in managerial and professional jobs grew to
49.4 in 1999 from 40.9 in 1983, the first year the statistics were
kept.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pay disparities between the sexes in many of these
jobs are higher than average. In 1999, women financial mangers, for
example, made 60.9 cents for every dollar their male counterparts
did. Female doctors made 62.4 cents.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules on Skinhead Attack  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A jury has ruled that a black man was
partly to blame for an attack by white skinheads in a grocery store
and awarded him just $53,000 of the $1 million he sought from the
store chain.
</P>
<P>
   The all-white jury Wednesday apparently agreed with the store's
contention that the victim made things worse by fighting back. The
jury also rejected a claim that the Fred Meyer chain discriminated
against the man by discouraging him from shopping at the store
after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had absolutely nothing to do with discrimination and the
jury supported that,'' said Rob Boley, a spokesman for Fred Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez ''Val'' Polk was attacked at an Oregon City store in
1997 by three whites wearing skinhead symbols. One shoved him and
made racial insults, and Polk responded by knocking the man down,
according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Polk said the store detective failed to intervene, despite
repeated requests by customers, until his attackers fled in advance
of police. The store detective aimed pepper spray in their
direction, and ended up spraying Polk and the lone white customer
who tried to help him, Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   Polk claimed that Fred Meyer was negligent for failing to
provide adequate security, failing to train employees to recognize
hate groups and failing to warn him that skinheads were in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that the store was 53 percent negligent and that
Polk was 47 percent negligent. Polk said Friday he believed white
jurors found it difficult to put themselves in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to a black man alone. Do you help or just
watch?'' Polk said. ''And then Fred Meyer tells me it's my fault
for fighting back, when they didn't help me one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the attackers were convicted of felony intimidation and
other charges. They served jail terms and were ordered to avoid
skinhead groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer, an 800-store grocery chain founded in Portland,
operates in 12 states. It was sold last year to Kroger Co. of
Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Precede: NEWARK  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In the past eight days U.S. Senate
candidate Jon Corzine has plowed another $5.8 million into his
campaign account, pushing his likely spending for the Democratic
nomination to at least $31 million -- a new national record.
</P>
<P>
   The funding, disclosed late Friday in updated reports to the
Federal Election Commission, make it now certain that the former
Wall Street executive will surpass the amount spent in California
six years ago by Republican Michael Huffington. Huffington spent
$30 million in his losing bid for U.S. Senate against Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   A report filed with the FEC Thursday by Corzine showed he had
spent $25 million as of May 17 and that his campaign on that date
had another $2.2 million in debts, contracts and bills yet to be
paid, for a total of $27.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday show that two days after the May
17 reporting date, Corzine wrote a check to his own campaign for
$4.4 million, and followed that three days later with three more
checks totaling $1.4 million, pushing his total spent plus cash on
hand to $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the recently added funds are used for new spending,
Corzine will have spent $33 million. If some of that money is
needed to pay off his $2.2 million in debts, the total would be $31
million -- still a national record.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's FEC report showed he had spent $1.9 million by May 17.
Both figures include spending for 1999, $3.7 million by Corzine,
$466,000 by Florio.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented river of cash pouring out of Corzine's
campaign coffers has gone to all forms of advertising, from
prime-time network television to fliers in the mailbox, according
to Thursday's report.
</P>
<P>
   It also pays for coast-to-coast consultants; researchers who do
polls and hold focus groups; New York lawyers; Irvington caterers;
and a West Orange exterminator. Of insects, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also spent money on his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A spot examination of Corzine's spending by The Associated Press
shows gifts of cash totaling $309,000 to state and county
Democratic organizations in April and May. They included donations
of $25,000 to $30,000 to several major county committees that have
no real primary fights of their own, but on whom Corzine is relying
to rally the party faithful to the polls on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has denounced these sorts of contributions as payoffs to
win endorsement from Democratic leaders and a ''hostile corporate
takeover'' of the Democratic Party. Corzine and the Democratic
leaders getting the donations defend it as essential funding to
build up the party.
</P>
<P>
   The report details item-by-item spending for the period from
April 1 to May 17. Florio's spending was listed on 12 pages.
Corzine's took up 108 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's chief TV advertising firm, Shrum, Devine &AMP; Donilon of
Washington, D.C., was paid $10 million, including $194,000 over
seven weeks just for editing and consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   His chief New Jersey media firm, Steve DiMicco's Message &AMP; Media
of New Brunswick, was paid $1.4 million to prepare and place
published ads, radio commercials and mailers. Another $1.7 million
was spent on the mailings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn Schoen polling firm of New York was paid $640,000 in
two weeks in mid-April -- the reports do not specify the nature of
the polling -- and Lester and Associates research of Washington
D.C., was paid $36,000 to conduct focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various individuals listed as consultants, Regina Thomas
of Washington, D.C., got the largest single check, $50,000 on May
2. Total spending on staff and consultants is hard to figure, but
the campaign had to pay $46,780 in state and federal payroll taxes
in April and $49,788 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $228,000 was spent in the six-week period on legal fees
or retainers, including two $100,000 payments to the New York law
firm Arkin, Shaffer and Kaplan, though the campaign has yet to
become embroiled in any public legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   A payment of $11,562 was made April 24 for office space at the
Robert Treat Hotel in Newark. An exterminator was paid $238 on
April 5. The report does not specify which office needed debugging.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Monday he intends to spend at least another $2
million per week on TV commercials for the final two weeks of the
campaign, although a portion of that could have been contracted by
May 17. He is also expected to deploy large sums on Primary Day in
get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banks and van shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided money tally in the New Jersey Democratic primary
comes along with a Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday giving
Corzine an overwhelming lead over Florio, 56 percent to 30 percent
among registered Democrats who said they were likely to vote, with
14 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 5.1
percentage points, which even when skewed to Florio's maximum
advantage gives Corzine a 16-point lead.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A former alderman convicted of taking $80,000 in
cash to protect a group of companies that turned an illegal dump
into a three-story mound of debris was sentenced Friday to three
years and three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Z. Giles, 47, also was sentenced for cheating on his taxes
and his city expense account and for pocketing $10,000 in cash
slipped to him by corrupt contractor John Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you lie down with dogs you get fleas,'' U.S. District
Judge Elaine Bucklo said in sentencing Giles. ''You knew what
Christopher was.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles knew Christopher was willing to pay bribes to get his help
in obtaining city contracts. But he didn't know Christopher was the
FBI's key informant in an investigation of Chicago-area political
corruption and was making a tape of his encounter with Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people have been indicted and 15 have been convicted,
six of them aldermen, in the seven-year federal investigation
dubbed Silver Shovel. Christopher, who pleaded guilty to tax and
bankruptcy fraud, was also sentenced to three years and three
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the payoff from Christopher, Giles also took
$80,000 in bribes from dumpers, who piled such a huge mound of
debris that it blew dust throughout the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He also was convicted of using his city expense account to buy a
Chrysler Imperial, pay for the insurance and even pay off a stack
of parking tickets.

<HEADLINE> Reds Set To Retire Perez's Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- This is shaping up to be a pretty good year
for Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The former Reds first baseman, will be inducted into the Hall of
Fame in July, was in Cincinnati this weekend to have his No. 24
jersey retired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I came to this country, I never think things like this
can happen,'' Perez said Friday, before a game between the Reds and
Florida, where Perez is a special assistant to the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just to be back in Cincinnati is special. I have so many good
memories here. I never heard my name booed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 58, is the first Cuban-born player voted into the Hall of
Fame. He was always a fan favorite in Cincinnati, where he drove in
at least 90 runs a year for 10 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1967 and 1976, he led the major leagues with 1,028 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His jersey number is the sixth to be retired by the Reds, and
Perez has links to the other five -- Fred Hutchinson was his first
big-league manager, slugger Ted Kluszewski was his batting coach,
Frank Robinson was an early role model, and Johnny Bench and Joe
Morgan were his Big Red Machine teammates as Cincinnati won
consecutive World Series in 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a special guy and very deserving of the honor,'' said
John Allen, the Reds' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very excited about our young ballclub and the prospect
of moving into a new stadium. But we also want to remember our
history and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez ranks among baseball's career leaders in RBIs (18th),
games (19th), at-bats (25th), doubles (33rd), home runs (tie for
40th) and hits (47th).
</P>
<P>
   With the Reds, he's second in RBIs and third in home runs and
total bases.
</P>
<P>
   About the only unpleasant experience in Cincinnati was Perez'
short-lived career as manager. He was fired after just 44 games
(20-24) in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Corzine plows $5.8 million more into coffers, pressing likely spending past $31 million </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Senate candidate Jon Corzine has plowed
another $5.8 million into his campaign, pushing his likely spending
for the Democratic nomination to at nearly $31 million -- a new
national record.
</P>
<P>
   The funding, disclosed late Friday in reports to the Federal
Election Commission, make it likely that the former Wall Street
executive will surpass the amount spent in California six years ago
by Republican Michael Huffington. Huffington spent $30 million in
his losing bid for Senate against Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   A report filed with the commission Thursday by Corzine showed he
had spent $25 million as of May 17 and that his campaign had
another $2.2 million in debts, contracts and bills yet to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday show that two days after the May
17 reporting date, Corzine wrote a check to his own campaign for
$4.4 million, and followed that three days later with three more
checks totaling $1.4 million. That pushed his total amount spent
plus cash on hand to $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the recently added funds are used for new spending by
the June 6 primary, Corzine will have spent $33 million. If some of
that money is needed to pay off his $2.2 million in debts, the
total would be almost $31 million -- still a national record.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic primary opponent Jim Florio's FEC report showed he
had spent $1.9 million by May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate's report includes spending for 1999, $3.7 million
by Corzine, $466,000 by Florio.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented cash pouring out of Corzine's campaign coffers
has gone to all forms of advertising, from prime-time network
television to fliers in the mailbox, according to Thursday's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also spent money on his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A spot examination of Corzine's spending by The Associated Press
shows gifts of cash totaling $309,000 to state and county
Democratic organizations in April and May. They included donations
of $25,000 to $30,000 to several major county committees that have
no real primary fights of their own, but on whom Corzine is relying
to rally the party faithful to the polls on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has denounced these sorts of contributions as payoffs to
win endorsement from Democratic leaders and a ''hostile corporate
takeover'' of the Democratic Party. Corzine and the Democratic
leaders getting the donations defend it as essential funding to
build up the party.
</P>
<P>
   The money tally comes along with a Quinnipiac College poll
released Thursday giving Corzine an overwhelming lead over Florio,
56 to 30 among registered Democrats who said they were likely to
vote, with 14 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of
5.1 percentage points, which even when skewed to Florio's maximum
advantage gives Corzine a 16-point lead.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rams Coach Poole Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIPOSA, Calif. (AP) -- Hamp Poole, the former Chicago Bears
player who coached the Los Angeles Rams, died Friday of congestive
heart failure. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Poole died at John C. Fremont Hospital in Mariposa, former Rams
executive Jack Teele said.
</P>
<P>
   Poole was a fullback and end for the Bears from 1940-43, and was
one of nine Chicago players to score a touchdown in the team's 73-0
victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1941 NFL championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Poole was the backfield coach for the Rams in 1951, when they
won the NFL championship, and succeeded Joe Stydahar as the team's
head coach the following year, serving through the 1954 season.
</P>
<P>
   Poole coached in Canada after leaving the Rams, but returned to
the team as an assistant under Bob Waterfield in 1960. Following
his retirement as a coach, Poole was head of the NFL's first
scouting combine, made up of the Rams, San Francisco 49ers and
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Poole lived on a ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada
mountains, about 50 miles from Fresno, since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Olive, his wife of 63 years; sons John Poole
of Mariposa and Robert Norman Poole of Anchorage, Alaska; and
daughter Suzanne Mitchell of Walnut Creek; six grandchildren, and
two sisters, Elaine Ridner of Alamo, Calif., and Mildred Schelling
of Hawaii.

</P>
<P>

Federation's Records Committee during its annual summer meeting in

<HEADLINE> Lindros' Homecoming Shortlived  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' homecoming lasted eight
minutes and 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers' star was helped off the ice after he
was elbowed in the head by New Jersey's Scott Stevens in the first
period of Friday night's Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who missed 10 weeks due to post-concussion syndrome,
was playing in his second game -- his first at home -- since
rejoining the Flyers after the lengthy layoff.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Lindros was skating up ice with the puck
when Stevens blindsided him with an elbow 8:50 into the first
period. Just before the hit, Devils forward Jay Pandolfo impeded
Lindros' progress by placing his stick between Lindros' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros appeared to bang his head on the ice, and was helped to
the trainer's room. No penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on the extent of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game back, Lindros scored the Flyers' only goal in
a 2-1 loss at New Jersey, which pulled the Devils even at three
games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The former captain hoped to return home and lead the Flyers into
the Stanley Cup finals, but his injury changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   While Lindros was recovering, he also became the central figure
in hockey's most-publicized family feud.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, once forced to choose between Lindros and general manager
Bob Clarke, the franchise's former hero, were solidly behind No.
88.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't win the Stanley Cup without him,'' said 27-year-old
Tom Pizzi, a diehard Flyers fan from South Philadelphia. ''Anybody
who says they don't need him is nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, however, when fans wondered whether Lindros
would ever wear a Flyers uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   He received a concussion when he was checked by Boston's Hall
Gill on March 4 and later was stripped of his captaincy after
criticizing the team's medical staff for failing to diagnose the
severity of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   His photo was taken off promotional advertisements. He wasn't
included in the team's highlight reels and the mere mention of his
name left players, coaches and even the team's broadcasters feeling
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   To add further insult, the ''C'' was airbrushed from Lindros'
sweater in an action photo on the cover of the team's postseason
media guide.
</P>
<P>
   But most fans supported Lindros throughout the soap opera. They
questioned management's motives and even booed Clarke during a
pregame ceremony when his name was announced as the team's most
valuable player award bearing his name was given to Mark Recchi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clarke made it personal and he shouldn't have done that,''
said John Colarelli, a lifelong Flyers fan from South Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As Lindros recovered from a series of concussions, the team
overcame a 15-point deficit in the regular season to win the
Eastern Conference, then moved within a game of reaching the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lindros returned to the ice against the Devils on
Wednesday night, fans debated whether the team really needed its
star player.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted on WIP-AM, the all-sports station in
Philadelphia, the results were overwhelming. Nearly 75 percent of
callers to Wednesday's morning show said Lindros should play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care what he says or what he does as long as he plays
and they win,'' said Alexis DiSpensa of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros not only played, but he was the best player on the ice.
He scored the only goal for the Flyers, had another one go in a
half-second too late, and was the team's main offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't take the best guy on the team and make him sit,''
said Colarelli, who drove to Pittsburgh and watched the Flyers'
five-overtime victory over the Penguins in Game 4 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' career in Philadelphia could still be winding down. He
becomes a restricted free agent after the season and, considering
the bad blood between the Lindros family and team management, it's
possible that he will leave.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros said he hadn't thought about that or the fans' reaction.
He was booed by Devils fans at the Continental Airlines Arena, but
received a standing ovation from many of the Flyers fans who made
the trip up the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've always been real supportive in the past,'' Lindros
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all fans are as supportive as others, and there are a few
who'd rather not see Lindros in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a cancer,'' said Rafael Robles of Philadelphia. ''He's
just like Barry Sanders. The Detroit Lions went to the playoffs
without him and the Flyers are better off without Lindros.

<HEADLINE> Former NH Justice Denies Violations  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA MAHONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- A former state Supreme Court justice who
resigned from the bench amid an investigation by the New Hampshire
attorney general said Friday he committed no ethics violations and
stepped down only to avoid a prolonged legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer made his first public comments about the
allegations during a court hearing on his motion to lower his child
support and alimony payments.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned March 31 to avoid prosecution by Attorney General
Philip McLaughlin, who accused him of illegally trying to influence
the court's handling of his divorce from Judith O'Brien Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer recently testified under a grant of immunity in a secret
hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, which is investigating
whether any other justices committed impeachable offenses by taking
part in cases from which they were disqualified. It is the first
impeachment probe of any New Hampshire judge in 210 years.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that a grand jury would have cleared him of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I committed no criminal act,'' he said. ''I knew it
would all end if I resigned and got on with my life. It was the
best thing for the people I love and the best thing for the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied trying to interfere when Mrs. Thayer appealed the
divorce case to the Supreme Court. He said he simply told the other
justices that retired Superior Court Judge George Pappagianis had a
conflict of interest and should not be appointed to the appeals
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said he had once overturned one of Pappagianis' rulings,
and Pappagianis responded by sending Thayer a critical letter.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer said he had to resign because the media damaged his
credibility with stories about his failure to disclose a $50,000
loan from a Manchester lawyer on a bank loan application.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much was I supposed to put up with? I can't sit on the
bench and be expected to fulfill my constitutional duties when I
was being dragged through the mud on federal felony bank charges,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors eventually said Thayer had not committed
bank fraud. However, a court ethics committee is looking into his
failure to report the loan on the bank loan application and on
annual financial disclosure forms for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer argued that his payments to his ex-wife should be reduced
because his notoriety has kept him from getting a job with a law
firm.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Senate candidate Jon Corzine has plowed
another $5.8 million of his own money into his campaign account,

<HEADLINE> Authorities Break Up Wis. Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARABOO, Wis. (AP) -- Sheriff's deputies broke up the annual
Weedstock festival promoting legalizing marijuana Friday, ordering
several hundred people to leave and arresting 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Randy Stammen got a court order to close the music
festival and campout, which was to end Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the court order, authorities let people leave
voluntarily for three hours. Event organizer Ben Masel and 11
people who refused to leave were arrested for contempt of court,
Stammen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people seem to think they can stomp all over the
Constitution, and they're wrong,'' Masel said.
</P>
<P>
   Masel and other organizers refused to get a county permit to
hold the event at the farm near Fairfield, saying it was
unnecessary since organizers had a permit from the state.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival was the 13th Weedstock.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities received 96 complaints about the 1999 Memorial Day
weekend festival. There were 49 arrests, 43 traffic citations and
28 drug investigations, the sheriff's office said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Block Abortion Ban  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge refused to issue an emergency
restraining order Friday to block a new state law that bans a
certain type of late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a lawsuit
challenging the Florida law, signed by Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday,
and asked for the restraining order to go into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard said she wanted to hear from
lawyers for both sides before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   Margie Kelly, a spokeswoman for the organization, said the judge
scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law will remain in effect at least through Wednesday,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The law bans the intentional killing of a ''partially born
living fetus.'' Doctors who perform the procedure medically known
as dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X, could be convicted of a
second-degree felony and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of a
similar Nebraska law and is expected to rule by late June.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine other states have similar laws. Those in Nebraska,
Arkansas and Iowa were invalidated by a federal appeals court in
September. A month later, another federal appeals court upheld
similar laws in Wisconsin and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy argues that the
Florida law is too broad and could prohibit doctors from performing
abortions in early pregnancy. The center also says it doesn't
incorporate adequate exceptions to protect the life and health of
women.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokeswoman said the governor was adamantly opposed to
the procedure and believed the law is constitutional.

<HEADLINE> U.S. and Russia Warn Taliban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and the United States warned Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban movement to clamp down on terrorist bases, according
to a Foreign Ministry statement issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement followed two days of talks in Moscow between U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and Russia's Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov preparing for a visit to Moscow
by President Bill Clinton June 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said this week that it is considering air strikes
against Afghanistan for allegedly supporting Chechen terrorists,
but the Foreign Ministry statement did not mention that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The statement called for ''immediate dismantling the terrorist
infrastructure operating on the territory under (Taliban) control,
which threatens stability in the region and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply may lead to ''consideration of further
measures'' by the United Nations Security Council, where the United
States and Russia are permanent members.
</P>
<P>
   What measures would be considered were not specified. The U.N.
imposed economic sanctions on Afghanistan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also did not indicate the U.S. position on
Russia's contention that the Taliban are supporting Chechen rebels,
or a direct response to Russia's threat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States launched a cruise missile attack against
Afghanistan in 1998 for harboring suspected terrorist mastermind
Osama bin Laden, blamed for bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Nairobi that year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Russia condemned the U.S. action. But the Kremlin
now explains its war against Islamic separatist movement in
Chechnya as a battle against international terrorism, including
mercenaries allegedly trained in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin says bin Laden is also involved in aiding Chechen
units.
</P>
<P>
   The statement says both countries were ''seriously worried''
about the Taliban's support for terrorism, which both sides have
earlier described as bases nestled high in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush
Mountains where young men from all parts of the Islamic world train
in the use of weapons and explosives.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Jackson Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Mike Jackson,
signed to a $3 million, one-year deal over the winter, had
athroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Friday and will not pitch
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was performed by Dr. Craig Morgan at Wilmington
Hospital in Delaware to repair tears in capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 35, has been on the disabled list since March 31. He is
to begin his rehabilitation Saturday at the Chester County
Orthopedic Sports Physical therapy Center.
</P>
<P>
   He signed as a free agent with the Phillies after going 3-4 with
a 4.06 ERA for Cleveland in 1999. He had 39 saves for the Indians
last year and totaled 79 the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals appeared set to sign Jackson to a $12
million, three-year contract, even calling a news conference on
Nov. 19, but the news conference was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia then signed him on Dec. 1 to a deal that would have
guaranteed him $7 million for two years if he remained healthy. The
Phillies have an option for 2002 that would make the contract worth
$11.25 million for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hoped that we had addressed our back-end of the bullpen
problems during the offseason with Mike, and we knew there were
some physical concerns at that time,'' Phillies general manager Ed
Wade said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the MRIs that we had done showed that it was a good risk
on our part. And, in reality, the problems (that required surgery)
hadn't shown up on the MRIs. So obviously it's a disappointment for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's shoulder began bothering him just after the Phillies
left spring training, and Wade said it became apparent later that
he would probably need surgery when he was unable to throw more
than 20 pitches in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies have used Wayne Gomes and Jeff Brantley as closers.
Gomes was 2-4 with a 2.93 ERA and six saves in nine opportunities
going into Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Brantley had no decisions, a 3.38 ERA and was 3-for-3 in save
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, we've got Brantley and we've got Gomes, and we're
just going to have to continue to try to figure out how to get over
it,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia manager Terry Francona said: ''We have plenty of
time to feel sorry for ourselves in the offseason. Right now, our
job is to try to find a way to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, with a 53-61 record, 3.26 ERA and 138 saves in 14 major
league seasons, broke in with the Phillies in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Mike and I've played with him, so you feel for him,''
Francona said. ''I know he tried so desperately hard to come back
and now you look at what he actually was trying to come back from
and you feel for him.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Francis Lederer Dies at 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Francis Lederer, who starred
in the 1929 German drama ''Pandora's Box'' and brought continental
charm to ''Midnight'' and other Hollywood films in the '30s, has
died. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer died Thursday at his Palm Springs home, his wife,
Marion, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a very magical life. Until just the last several weeks,
he was in very good shape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Darkly handsome, the Prague-born actor appeared in a variety of
films, often playing suave Europeans, in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared with Ida Lupino in ''One Rainy Afternoon,'' 1935;
with Lynn Bari in ''Bridge of San Luis Rey,'' 1944; with Paulette
Goddard in Jean Renoir's ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' 1946; with
Edward G. Robinson in ''Confessions of a Nazi Spy,'' 1939; and with
Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche in ''Midnight,'' a 1939 comedy
cowritten by Billy Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Francis Lederer is aptly cast as the love-pirate,'' the show
biz bible Variety wrote in its review of ''Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederer was already a successful stage actor in Europe when he
began making films there in the late '20s.
</P>
<P>
   He was billed as Franz Lederer in ''Pandora's Box.'' The 1929
German silent film, directed by G.W. Pabst, stars American actress
Louise Brooks as the amoral, doomed beauty who is involved with
both a prominent doctor, whom she kills, and his son. Lederer
played the son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely adored her -- she was a mysterious person,
perfectly cast for that part,'' he said. ''We couldn't talk. She
didn't speak a word of German, I didn't speak a word of English. We
just looked at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1932, and his Broadway
appearance in ''Autumn Crocus'' led to work in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   One of his last roles -- one he said he'd like to forget -- was as
the vampire in ''Return of Dracula,'' 1958. Around that time,
Lederer founded the American National Academy of Performing Arts,
teaching acting with a variation of the Stanislavski method.
</P>
<P>
   While some references said he was born in 1906, he celebrated
his 100th birthday in November by receiving honors from the Los
Angeles City Council and the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer told The Desert Sun he was most proud of having formed
an anti-war group, the World Peace Federation, in 1934 to urge

<HEADLINE> Peru President Faces Turmoil  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori heads into Sunday's
presidential runoff alone, racing toward certain victory -- and a
possible future of international isolation and domestic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism rained down Friday after Fujimori's decision to go
ahead with the runoff despite the boycott of opposition candidate
Alejandro Toledo, violent street protests and the withdrawal of
foreign monitors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged Peru on Friday to postpone the runoff,
saying that without a delay, there is no way to ensure the election
is fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a
democratic society,'' Clinton said. ''Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters late Friday, Toledo called Fujimori, ''a
dictator who is attempting to perpetuate himself in power with
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that by running uncontested, Fujimori risked
having the legitimacy of his rule questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he has done is suicide,'' said political scientist
Fernando Rospigliosi. ''It will be a government considered
illegitimate by a large portion of the population and will be
questioned constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitors from the Organization of American States insisted the
election be postponed at least 10 days to give their experts time
to evaluate ballot-counting computer software. The OAS said it
would reduce its mission to an absolute minimum because by
international standards, Peru's electoral process is tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is seeking a third five-year term despite a
constitutional ban on three consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Fujimori forces the election on the 28th and he is
proclaimed president, he is not going to last until the end of the
year,'' predicted Julio Carrion, an authority on Peruvian politics
who teaches at the University of Delaware. ''People have been
mobilized. The international community is clearly against a
continuation of his rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has shown surprising resilience in the past.
International criticism of his actions seemingly has no effect on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls released this week show Fujimori with a comfortable lead
of eight to 10 percentage points over Toledo, prompting many to
wonder why he did not agree to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''By allowing the postponement to go on it was a win-win
situation for President Fujimori,'' Eduardo Stein, head of the OAS
mission, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But hard-liners within the government, particularly military
commanders, apparently feared public opinion could swing to Toledo
again during a prolonged campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has ruled in close alliance with the military, which
supported him when he temporarily shut Congress and the Supreme
Court in 1992, accusing them of blocking his war on leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's running mate, Francisco Tudela, told foreign
correspondents Thursday that it was possible the United States
might impose sanctions, but he was confident Latin American
countries would not.
</P>
<P>
   Caretas magazine reported Friday that Prime Minister Alberto
Bustamante told OAS observers: ''Peru has the means to withstand
the pressure and the possible economic isolation.'' Peru has nearly
$9 billion in foreign reserves. When Fujimori assumed power in
1990, the country was virtually bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts within and outside Peru warned that
Fujimori's government could face years of economic sanctions and
tension with Washington that could put the brakes on investment and
growth.
</P>
<P>
   In one indicator this week, Peruvian bond and stock prices
plummeted and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings
that threatened to increase interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Nelson, Thompson Lead Boone Valley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Mo. (AP) -- Larry Nelson and Leonard Thompson shot
6-under-par 66s on Friday to share the first-round lead in the
Senior PGA Tour's Boone Valley Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the 1998 winner, had six birdies in a bogey-free round
on the rain-soaked Boone Valley Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only missed one fairway and I was putting well,'' said
Nelson, who won the Las Vegas Senior Classic last month for his
sixth senior title.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really important to drive the ball well because this
rough is really tough. I'm happy to have made six birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not portrayed as an exciting person and I think my round
today was steady like I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson had an eagle, six birdies and two bogeys in the round
that was delayed for 4{ hours because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never really felt loose most of the day,'' Thompson said.
''I don't usually play well in this kind of weather. My back was
tight all day and I never did get comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dougherty opened with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had five birdies with no bogeys and that was sort of a
surprise,'' he said. ''I'm thrilled we got the round in and I'm
thrilled to shoot 5 under.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, playing at Boone Valley for the first time, shot a
68 on the 6,723-yard course, 40 miles west of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Quigley, the winner last week in Kansas City, also was two
strokes back along with Gibby Gilbert, Dave Eichelberger and Jim
Holtgrieve.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, the St. Louis area resident who won the tournament
in 1997 and 1999, shot a 70. Arnold Palmer opened with a 77.
</P>
<P>
   The players were allowed to lift, clean and place the ball in
the fairway because of the wet conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he wasn't concerned that the tournament might have
to be shortened to 36 holes because the weather forecast for
Saturday calls for more rain, threatening the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won my only tournament on the senior tour when the rain
wiped out one round,'' he said. ''It wouldn't bother me at all.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 4, Yankees 1  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a game interrupted when a fan fell from the
upper deck onto the screen behind home plate, the Boston Red Sox
beat the New York Yankees 4-1 Friday night on the pitching of Ramon
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley hit a two-run homer and Carl Everett had a two-run
single as Boston broke a first-place tie with the Yankees in the AL
East. New York has lost nine of 13.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the start of the Yankees' no-alcohol policy in
the bleachers. The bleachers usually hold the most rowdy fans at
Yankee Stadium, but the crowd of 54,470 was startled by what
happened in the upper deck in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson Delgado of the Yankees batting, a 24-year-old man
fell headfirst onto the netting behind the plate. As play continued
for two more outs, the fan remained motionless for about five
minutes before suddenly sitting up and raising both arms high.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans cheered, apparently thinking he was unhurt, while
others booed, believing it was a stunt -- police said it was unclear
what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The fan then crawled his way into the middle of the ballpark's
three decks, leaving a wallet on the screen. Able to walk, he was
led away in handcuffs by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Loosen the cuffs, man, they're too tight,'' he told officers.
</P>
<P>
   The man was taken to Lincoln Hospital for treatment, although
the nature of his injury was not known. It was likely he would be
arrested or issued a summons, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees finished batting in the third, the game was
halted for six minutes while players on both teams and the umpires
moved in for a closer look. Beneath the fan, stadium security
officers, police and emergency workers gathered with a stretcher,
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   In a game on Aug. 23, 1989, between the Red Sox and Yankees in
New York, a 24-year-old man jumped onto the netting. He was not
hurt and was charged with reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Yankees started a stretch in which they play
each other 10 times in 28 days. Aside from the first week of the
1995 season, the longtime rivals had not meet when tied for first
place since their famous one-game playoff for the AL East title on
Oct. 2, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (4-3) allowed seven hits, including Clay Bellinger's
home run, in 7 2-3 innings. He struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe pitched the ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone (1-4), in his 10th start of the season, made a bad
decision that cost him in the first. With runners at the corners,
he fielded Brian Daubach's comebacker and, rather try for an
inning-ending double play, trapped Jeff Frye off third.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing rundown left runners at second and third, and
Everett followed with his single. Stanley homered in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees hope to activate SS Derek Jeter, on the
disabled list with an abdominal strain, for Saturday's game. He
played for Class A Tampa on Friday night and went 2-for-3 and was
flawless in the field. ''I'm out of here at 10:30,'' Jeter said.
''I'm anxious to get back regardless of who we're playing.
Obviously it's a big series, but at this point you've been away so
long I'm just looking forward to playing again.'' ... The Red Sox
hope to activate SS Nomar Garciaparra from the disabled list
Saturday. He's been out since May 12 because of a strained left
hamstring. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch was a late scratch from the
Yankees lineup because of a strained left forearm. ... Jose
Offerman was out of Boston's lineup. He left Wednesday's game
because of a strained left groin. ... LHP Allen Watson was
activated from the disabled list and pitched to one batter, giving
up a single to Troy O'Leary.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori, Chavez Test Democracies  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's presidential election is
off, for now. Peru's is going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez and Alberto Fujimori stand to gain from those
decisions: Fujimori might get a third five-year term as Peru's
president in uncontested elections and Chavez can avoid the
perception of flawed balloting at a time when he's soaring in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a down side: Running without a challenger casts
a pall on Fujimori's legitimacy and Chavez's challenger for
Venezuela's presidency now gets a chance to close the gap in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chavez and Fujimori -- who many view as embodiments of
strongman rule -- are testing the boundaries of democracy in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In an Andean region plagued by recession, military rumblings,
high crime and political uncertainty, millions of poor people have
placed their hopes for a better life in the populist presidents of
Venezuela and Peru, both of whom rely heavily on the military and
neither of whom have shown any great fondness for the democratic
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Inhabitants of the slums of Caracas and Lima -- who have seen
their standard of living plummet -- often prefer bold action and
tough leadership to democratic niceties. And Fujimori and Chavez,
despite their failures, deliver both.
</P>
<P>
   Peru and Venezuela were both supposed to hold elections this
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's highest court suspended the vote Thursday, citing
technical glitches in the vote tallying system. Peru, however, is
proceeding with the vote despite fraud allegations, technical
problems and the threat of international isolation and violent
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's challenger, economist Alejandro Toledo, is boycotting
the race to protest the election board's decision to hold the vote
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Organization of American States have
objected to the court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   International observers said Venezuela's decision augured much
better for democracy than Peru's -- since it should allow officials
to fix the computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''However the election comes out in Venezuela, I would say that
is a more legitimate process,'' said David Scott Palmer, a former
member of the Organization of American States observation team in
Peru. ''And that means Venezuela will be in a better position in
regard to its own people and the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   With most polls showing Chavez 15 to 20 points ahead of his
nearest challenger, former Zulia state governor Francisco Arias
Cardenas, he had little to gain by going ahead with flawed
elections that could endanger the legitimacy of his hoped for
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army officer who led a 1992 coup attempt, took
office only 16 months ago but is up for re-election because of a
new constitution he pushed through last year that requires public
powers to be ''re-legitimized'' through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   With the elections postponed, Arias, who helped Chavez stage the
coup attempt but has broken with the president, has a fresh chance
to close the gap in the polls. Despite their shared history as coup
plotters, Arias is seen as more moderate than Chavez, whose
democratic credentials have been widely questioned.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know why Fujimori would seek to proceed with
Sunday's vote despite the costs, which included violent protests on
Thursday and a warning from President Clinton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a
democratic society,'' Clinton said. ''Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who's been in power for 10 years, is loathe to cave in
to international pressure, possibly for fear of alienating
hard-liners in his government, especially the military hierarchy.
He also knows more time could mean more support for Toledo in a
hotly contested race.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts surrounding Venezuela's vote are technical while in
Peru they are political. And if polls are correct, Peru's
presidential race is much closer than Venezuela's.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no accident that both Fujimori and Chavez get their
most ardent support from the poor, whose numbers have swelled in
Latin America -- the region of the world with the most unequal
distribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Both men came to power on anti-establishment, anti-corruption
platforms. Both have vastly increased the role of the military in
society. Both feel more comfortable in a slum than in a board room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fujimori has had 10 years to show his stuff, while Chavez is
just starting out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spectacular success in taming inflation and fighting
rebels, Fujimori has repeatedly assaulted democratic institutions,
including the 1992 temporary closure of both Congress and the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is still out on Chavez, whose popularity has so far
allowed him to push through radical changes through democratic
channels.
</P>
<P>
   It's now up to the legislature to set a new date for Venezuela's
elections. Although the postponement uncovered what appears to be
astonishing incompetence among electoral authorities, Venezuelan
officials are hailing it as a triumph for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The institutions are working,'' Attorney General Javier
Elechiguerra said Friday. ''We should all celebrate this.''

Shooting Breaks Out in Fiji
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- After a confrontation at a roadblock, shooting broke out
Saturday between rebels holding top government officials and military troops
hostage. The exchange of gunfire came as about 200 rebels and their supporters
confronted soldiers about one-quarter mile from the Parliament compound. Ethnic
Fijian rebels have held the country's ethnic Indian prime minister and others
hostage in Parliament for more than a week in a move to seize control of the
country. The soldiers fired warning shots and then the armed rebels fired back.
The rebels then dispersed and the soldiers withdrew. The government has been in
chaos since the May 19 coup attempt by ethnic Fijians against the
Indian-dominated government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the food industry today ''to use
its vast resources'' to maintain the safety of meat following a Texas judge's
decision striking down a testing program to detect salmonella contamination in
ground beef processing plants. In a ruling yesterday, U.S. District Judge Joe
Fish said that the Agriculture Department exceeded its authority by pulling
inspectors from a Dallas plant -- effectively shutting it down -- after the
facility failed the department's salmonella inspection standards. The judge said
the tests are not a fair measure of sanitary conditions in a plant.

Foday Sankoh, leader of a rebel group skirmishing with government forces. The
U.N. peacekeeper captives were handed over to authorities in Foyah, a border

U.S. Wheat Arrives in Sudan

   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- A shipment of American wheat has arrived in Sudan for
the first time in more than 10 years, a daily newspaper reported Friday. The
ship carrying 30,000 tons of U.S.-harvested wheat docked Thursday in Port Sudan
on the Red Sea. The wheat, purchased by Sheik Mustafa el-Amin Group, was the
first to come to Sudan since the 1989 coup that brought President Omar el-Bashir
to power. Sudan used to rely heavily on U.S. wheat, but U.S. assistance dwindled
after the 1983 implementation of Islamic law, and ceased completely after
el-Bashir's takeover.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Sets Execution Date  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge Friday set an Aug. 5 execution
date for convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, who would become the
first federal prisoner put to death in almost four decades.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's order calls for Garza to be
executed by injection at 6 a.m. at the federal death chamber in
Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Garza is among 20 inmates awaiting execution. Because of pending
appeals, no other inmate has an execution date.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Prisons and Justice Department officials were
reviewing a draft of a detailed technical manual governing the
manner of conducting the execution, said U.S. Attorney Mervyn
Mossbacker Jr., who filed the motion seeking an execution date.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government seeks to ensure that this first execution, and
those that follow, will be carried out in an appropriate, dignified
and expeditious manner,'' Mossbacker said.
</P>
<P>
   The last federal execution was in 1963. The Supreme Court ruled
in 1972 that the death penalty was unfairly applied. State and
federal procedures were revised and the high court restored the
death penalty on the federal level in 1988, more than a decade
after states resumed the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Among Garza's death row colleagues is Timothy McVeigh, convicted
of the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured
hundreds of others five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, 43, was convicted in Brownsville, Texas, in August 1993
for killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991. A
10-count indictment named him as the boss of a drug ring that
imported tons of marijuana into the United States between 1983 and
1993. Prosecutors sought the death penalty under a 1988 ''kingpin''
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't kill any of these people,'' he told The Associated
Press in a 1994 interview. ''I'm not responsible. ... I got the
shaft.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 8, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Darrin Fletcher hit his third grand slam of the
season to power the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-2 win over the
Detroit Tigers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's slam, the sixth of his career, keyed a seven-run
eighth as the Blue Jays broke open a pitchers duel between starters
Frank Castillo and Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez hit a solo homer, his ninth, giving Detroit a 2-1
lead in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who allowed two runs and eight hits, was relieved by
Doug Brocail (1-3) after Raul Mondesi's double leading off the
Toronto eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado greeted Brocail with an RBI single to tie it 2-2.
A walk to Brad Fullmer and Tony Batista's single loaded the bases
with no outs. Fletcher stroked a 1-2 pitch into the right-field
seats for his ninth homer of the season and a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Villafuerte relieved Brocail, who gave up five runs on
three hits and one walk without retiring any of the five batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez, who had singled, scored on a wild pitch by
Villafuerte for the seventh run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo had allowed only five hits and had easily retired the
first two batters in the seventh when Gonzalez stroked a line drive
over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo became angry at plate umpire Larry Young after going
3-0 to the next batter, Bobby Higginson. After he walked Higginson
on four pitches, Castillo was relieved by John Frascatore (1-1) and
scattered paper cups as he walked through the Toronto dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who allowed six hits and four walks, was facing the
Tigers for the first time. Castillo pitched for Detroit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Frascatore pitched 2 1-3 innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 1-0 lead on consecutive doubles by Gonzalez
and Higginson in the second. Higginson got the RBI on a soft flare
down the left-field line that was fair by no more than an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who singled, scored on Batista's sacrifice fly to tie
it 1-1 in the fourth. A walk to Jose Cruz later in the inning
loaded the bases with two outs, but Mlicki got Alex Gonzalez on a
fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit loaded the bases with one out in the fourth, but
Castillo struck out Luis Polonia and Shane Halter to nip the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers had runners at first and third with two outs in the
fifth, but Castillo got Luis Polonia on a soft fly to left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto's Shannon Stewart extended his hitting streak to 10
games. ... Gregg Jefferies, who drew a leadoff walk, was doubled up
easily in the Detroit fifth when he ran to second on a routine
flyball to right by Juan Gonzalez. ... CF Juan Encarnacion,
sidelined with a sore rib cage, will begin serving his three-day
suspension Saturday for his part in Detroit's brawl in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Sent to the Minors  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Typical of Orel Hershiser: feeling he wasn't
helping the Dodgers, he volunteered to go to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm not able to play or contribute at a high level right
now, then I need to get myself in a position to be able to do that.
I thought the best way to do that would be to go get some innings
in the minors,'' Hershiser said Friday after Los Angeles sent him
to Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't ask; I suggested it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, has not pitched in a game since May 9, and
struggled with control problems before that -- he tied a modern
major league record by hitting four batters -- in just 1 1-3 innings
-- on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful pitchers in Dodgers' history,
Hershiser said he would never have suggested to Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson to put him in a game, or to ask him when he was going
to pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it pays to be a squeaky wheel. I don't think it
pays to look just at yourself. I think it just pays to fulfill your
contract and do the best you can,'' Hershiser said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think your ego or your resume or whatever you want to
label it should get in the way of what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ''Bulldog'' by former Los Angeles manager Tom Lasorda,
Hershiser was the 1988 Cy Young winner and World Series MVP after
pitching a major league record 59 consecutive scoreless innings
that season, is 1-2 with a 10.70 ERA in seven appearances this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's collective bargaining agreement, the 18-year
major league veteran could have refused to be sent to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But, since reliever Mike Fetters was coming off the 15-day
disabled list Friday and needed a spot on the Dodgers' roster,
Hershiser stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to them (Dodgers management) originally about 10 days
to two weeks ago, then I re-suggested it about four days ago,''
Hershiser said. ''With all the things that were going on -- Fetters
getting healthy and different things going on with the pitching
staff -- it became more and more evident that I really needed to get
serious about doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser will make his first start for San Bernadino on Tuesday
against Lancaster. It will mark his first appearance in the minors
since 1991, when he made four starts for three Dodgers' farms team
in his rehabilitation from shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, he hasn't pitched in the minors in 18 years,
since he first came up to the Dodgers. Hershiser has a career
record of 204-147, including a career-high 23 wins in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''Orel has always been a winner and a part of
championship-caliber teams,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ''His decision to go to the minors shows his commitment to
winning and to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that he will get the proper work and innings
in, so we can get him back up here, where he best belongs to
contribute to this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, who had been out with a sore right elbow, is 1-0 with a
2.53 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 8, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles hit four solo homers off
rookie Mark Mulder and extended their winning streak to four by
defeating the Oakland Athletics 8-3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, Cal Ripken, Jeff Conine and B.J. Surhoff
connected for the Orioles, who had 13 hits. It was the first time
in seven games that Baltimore won when getting at least 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson (2-1) allowed three runs and six hits in six
innings. He walked one and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder (2-2) allowed six runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings. The
left-hander had allowed only three home runs in his first seven
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs homered for the A's, who have lost seven of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Three players left the game with minor injuries and another
received a huge scare. Oakland's Jeremy Giambi sprained his right
thumb on a play at first base in the first inning and was replaced
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   On the same play, Baltimore's Mike Bordick was hit in side of
the batting helmet by a throw from shortstop Miguel Tejada. He lay
prone for several minutes but remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Johnson left after a foul ball by Ben Grieve
struck him in the groin. He was replaced behind the plate by Greg
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland reliever Mike Magnante left in the Orioles' four-run
sixth with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore went up 8-3 in the sixth. Surhoff led off with a homer
and Mulder issued a one-out walk before being replaced by Luis
Vizcaino, who gave up a two-run double to Delino DeShields and an
RBI double to Conine.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead in the third with his
seventh homer, the first since April 24. Stairs tied it in the
fourth with his seventh home run, a drive to right on a 3-2 count.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken led off the bottom of the inning with his ninth homer.
The Orioles then loaded the bases before Bordick got an infield hit
to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Conine homered in the fifth, his first since April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve and Tejada hit RBI singles in the sixth to make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Notes: By the fifth inning, every Orioles starter reached base
safely. ... Stairs has more homers against Baltimore (12) than any
other team. ... Erickson was 0-3 with a 10.67 ERA against Oakland
last year. ... Oakland's Doug Jones made his 808th appearance,
moving past Nolan Ryan into 23rd place on the career list.

<HEADLINE> Russia Gen. Against Changing Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With a U.S.-Russia summit a week away, a top
Russian general on Friday spoke out against compromise on one of
the main disputes between the two countries -- U.S. efforts to
change the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov said ABM treaty changes, vigorously
opposed by Russia, should be ''taken off the agenda'' of the June
3-4 summit with President Vladimir Putin. A U.S. official meanwhile
said no arms control breakthrough was expected during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are conducting all those talks with Americans not in order
to find a way to change the ABM treaty but in order to take it off
the agenda altogether,'' Manilov, first deputy chief of the general
staff, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. wants to modify the ABM treaty, which bars nationwide
missile defenses, to allow a limited national missile defense
against attacks by so-called rogue states such as North Korea.
Russia opposes the changes, fearing they would undermine the
deterrent value of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, who spoke to reporters Friday, confirmed that
no ABM agreement had been reached despite recent visits to Moscow
by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians have so far given no go-ahead, no indication that
they are ready to accept the amendments to the ABM treaty,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia appearing to hold its ground on the ABM, no quick
progress is expected on further nuclear arms cuts under the
proposed START III treaty, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Washington may offer Russia deep arms cuts in
exchange for the ABM changes. Russia, burdened by the cost of
maintaining its nuclear arsenal, is eager for such cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has threatened to abandon all arms treaties with the
United States if Washington follows through on the missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   After years of delay, the Russian parliament recently approved
the START II Treaty, which would roughly halve U.S. and Russian
nuclear arsenals to some 3,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. military has expressed reservations about Russia's
proposal to reduce each side's arsenal to 1,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin will have an opportunity to continue efforts
to reach arms control agreements at another three meetings they are
expected to have later this year, the U.S. official added.
</P>
<P>
   Along with arms control, Clinton and Putin have many other
issues to discuss, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton plans to reiterate U.S. calls for Russia
to stop its military action in Chechnya and to negotiate a
political solution, the U.S. official said. He would also like to
hear Putin's plans for reforming the Russian economy and the
government structure and discuss Russia's bid to join the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the recent raid of Russian police on the Media-MOST
company that has prompted fears of a government crackdown on the
news media, Clinton plans to ''underscore our belief that free
press is an absolutely essential and critical element in the
development of democratic society,'' the U.S. official said.

<HEADLINE> Possible Albanian Gift Poses Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations has not rejected a
statue of Mother Teresa offered by the government of Albania -- but
it does have a political problem with the possible gift.
</P>
<P>
   The nun, who became known as the ''Saint of the Gutters,'' was
born an ethnic Albanian in Skopje, in what is now neighboring
Macedonia, and became an Indian citizen in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Albania is considering offering the statue as
a gift to the organization, but the United Nation's isn't sure that
the statue represents Albanian culture or art, said U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   ''And therein lies the rub,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to established U.N. practice, he explained, a gift
''should be representative of the culture or art of the state
presenting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard was commenting on a report in the New York Post which
said the world body had turned down a 6-foot bronze statue of
Mother Teresa because the sculptor isn't famous enough and it isn't
a one-of-a-kind piece.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not true,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's U.N. mission has been consulting with the U.N. Arts
Committee about presenting a statue of Mother Teresa as a gift but
''there's nothing formal on the table right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to reach Albania's ambassador to the United
Nations were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 11, Devil Rays 4  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Rickey Henderson's third leadoff
homer against Tampa Bay in a week began a six-run first inning that
helped Aaron Sele and the Seattle Mariners beat the Devil Rays 11-4
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson connected in the first inning off Trachsel (3-4) for
the second time in five days, extending his own major league record
for leadoff homers to 78. He also hit one off Tampa Bay's Esteban
Yan in his first game with Seattle last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (5-2) beat Trachsel for the second straight outing and
remained unbeaten in four career decisions against Tampa Bay. He
allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings, struck out seven
and walked one to win his third straight game overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner went 3-for-3 with a homer and four RBIs for Seattle,
Mike Cameron, Dan Wilson and Mark McLemore drove in two runs
apiece, and the Mariners also scored twice on bases-loaded walks to
snap a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox hit his first major league homer, and Vinny Castilla
and Fred McGriff also drove in runs for Tampa Bay, which has lost
10 of 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson signed with Seattle after being released by the New
York Mets on May 13. He led off his first game with his new team
with a homer off Yan and repeated the feat the following day
against Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel's pitching has gotten progressively worse in three
outings since he won consecutive 1-0 decisions on the road over
Boston's Pedro Martinez and New York's Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander have allowed 16 runs, 21 hits and walked seven
in 10 innings, while going 0-2 with one no decision in his past
three starts. He gave up six runs on two hits and walked four in
one-third of an inning Friday night, equaling the shortest outing
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell, who popped out after Henderson homered, was the only
batter Trachsel retired. The Devil Rays starter walked the next
four hitters before Cameron's bases-loaded, ground-rule double
bounced over the wall in left center field.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson singled off Cory Lidle to drive in the fifth run of the
inning, and McLemore finished the uprising with a sacrifice fly.
The Mariners added run in the fifth on Buhner's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added three more in the ninth on Buhner's 10th
homer of the season, a two-run shot, McLemore's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn is day to day after leaving in the
sixth inning with a strained right hamstring ... Trachsel, then
with the Chicago Cubs, lasted one-third of an inning of a 16-3 loss
to St. Louis on Aug. 7, 1998 ... The Mariners have outscored
opponents 48-27 in the first inning this season, including a 19-4
advantage in the last 10 games ... Henderson argued unsuccessfully
that interference should have been called on the fan who reached
out and caught Cox's home run with a hat ... McLemore, suspended
for charging the mound last Saturday after he felt Yan threw at
him, was booed before each plate appearance. The second baseman
remains in the lineup while he appeals the five-game penalty.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leads in Suriname Vote  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) -- Voters rejected the ambitious
development plans of President Jules Wijdenbosch and all but handed
control of the National Assembly to the labor-backed opposition,
according to election returns Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of votes from Thursday's election counted, the
New Front, which includes labor unions and has the support of
former President Ronald Venetiaan, had a projected 33 seats in the
51-seat National Assembly -- one shy of the two-thirds majority
needed to elect a president.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition selects the president in Suriname. The New
Front, which governed this Dutch-speaking South American republic
from 1991-96, led former dictator Desi Bouterse's Millennium
Combination.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition hasn't named its presidential candidate, and
Suriname's complex election law mandates a 30-day waiting period
before the results are certified. But Venetiaan, who served as
president in the early '90s, is a leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked hard to win and we hope that we will get it,'' said
Fred Derby, leader of the Suriname Labor Party, part of the New
Front.
</P>
<P>
   Bouterse's Millennium Combination was projected to win only 11
seats, according to Suriname's elections council -- a poor showing
that reflected many voters' reluctance to back a man who is
currently fighting a cocaine trafficking conviction in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and United Nations have identified Suriname as
a growing transit point for drug trafficking to European and U.S.
markets, gun smuggling and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist Bouterse, who led two coups in 1980 and 1990,
has an Interpol warrant out for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The platform led by incumbent Wijdenbosch, a former Bouterse
ally, had just two projected seats.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old president called elections a year early to quell
street protests demanding his resignation over the struggling
economy, with inflation at 70 percent a year, and unemployment at
20 percent. Critics accuse him of spending in new infrastructure at
the expense of education and health.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Gutierres Placed on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chicago shortstop Ricky Gutierrez was
placed on the 15-day disabled list Friday because of a separated
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs also placed struggling reliever Brian Williams on
waivers for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Chad Meyers and pitchers Tim Worrell and Matt Karchner
were all recalled from Triple-A Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Karchner filled the roster spot of right-hander Kyle Farnsworth,
who was optioned to Iowa on Thursday. Worrell took the spot of
Williams, who had gone 1-1 with a save and a 9.62 ERA in 22 relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, disabled retroactive to Thursday, was hurt in
Colorado on Wednesday. He felt his hamstring cramp up while legging
out a grounder and when he grabbed it, he fell awkwardly, hurting
his shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Report: Taiwan Detains Chinese Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan has detained a Chinese ship near
the island's southern coast and arrested five alleged spies, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was detained Monday off Tainan in southern Taiwan, the
China times reported. Five Chinese men on board claimed to be
fishermen but could not explain why they carried night-vision
cameras and Taiwanese maps but no fishing equipment, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted unidentified security officials as saying
film seized from the men showed shots of military facilities and
sentries deployed on the outlying Taiwanese islands of Penghu and
Wuchiu.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   The reported seizure comes at a sensitive time. On Thursday,
China began weeklong live-fire artillery exercises near outlying
Taiwanese islands.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military said the drills were routine, denying
newspaper reports that the Chinese would aim their guns at Wuchiu.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan separated amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing
has repeatedly threatened to invade. Relations have been especially
sensitive since a new democratically elected government took office
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing distrusts Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian although
Chen has backed away from his earlier views that Taiwan should seek
formal independence from China. The mainland considers Taiwan a
renegade province.

Police: Student Kills Fla. Teacher
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- Police said a 13-year-old student who fatally shot a
teacher today with a semi-automatic pistol got the gun and bullets from a
dresser drawer at his grandfather's house last week. Seventh grader Nathaniel
Brazill was sent home from school for throwing water balloons on the last day of
classes and returned to Lake Worth Community Middle School shortly before 3:30
p.m., Police Chief William Smith said. He spoke to teacher Barry Grunow, pulled
out a .25-caliber pistol and fired a single shot, killing the 35-year-old
language arts teacher, he said. Brazill flagged down a police officer about a
quarter mile from the school and surrendered. Smith said police are considering
filing charges against the grandfather.

3 Wounded In Fiji Shooting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- At least three people were wounded Saturday after a gun
battle broke out in Fiji between rebels who have been trying for a week to seize
power and government soldiers. The shots were fired about one-quarter mile from
Parliament where coup leader George Speight and about 60 gunmen have been
holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his
government hostage. Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister last year, is the
first leader of Fiji from its ethnic Indian minority. The shooting occurred
after about 200 supporters of the coup and at least three of the armed rebels
left the parliamentary compound and confronted about eight soldiers at the
roadblock.

Clinton Criticizes Meat Industry

ground beef processing plants. In a ruling yesterday, U.S. District Judge Joe
Fish said that the Agriculture Department exceeded its authority by pulling
inspectors from a Dallas plant -- effectively shutting it down -- after the
facility failed the department's salmonella inspection standards. The judge said
the tests are not a fair measure of sanitary conditions in a plant.

Foday Sankoh, leader of a rebel group skirmishing with government forces. The

August 1993 for killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991, is among

his second goal of the game with 2:32 to play as the Devils beat the

Devils won the final three games of the series, but the clincher will forever be
remembered for Scott Stevens' first-period hit on Lindros that knocked out the

at 8:50 of the first period.

<HEADLINE> Former Rams Coach Hamp Pool Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIPOSA, Calif. (AP) -- Hamp Pool, the former Chicago Bears
player who coached the Los Angeles Rams, died Friday of congestive
heart failure. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Pool died at John C. Fremont Hospital in Mariposa, former Rams
executive Jack Teele said.
</P>
<P>
   Pool was a fullback and end for the Bears from 1940-43, and was
one of nine Chicago players to score a touchdown in the team's 73-0
victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pool was the backfield coach for the Rams in 1951, when they won
the NFL championship, and succeeded Joe Stydahar as the team's head
coach the following year, serving through the 1954 season.
</P>
<P>
   Pool coached in Canada after leaving the Rams, but returned to
the team as an assistant under Bob Waterfield in 1960. Following
his retirement as a coach, Pool was head of the NFL's first
scouting combine, made up of the Rams, San Francisco 49ers and
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Pool lived on a ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada
mountains, about 50 miles from Fresno, since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Olive, his wife of 63 years; sons John Pool of
Mariposa and Robert Norman Pool of Anchorage, Alaska; and daughter
Suzanne Mitchell of Walnut Creek; six grandchildren, and two
sisters, Elaine Ridner of Alamo, Calif., and Mildred Schelling of
Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Rebels Declare Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lanka's president on Saturday
offered the nation's rebel leader a government post in hopes of
ending the conflict, as the guerrillas announced a 12-hour
cease-fire to allow civilians to leave the island's north ahead of
an expected showdown with government troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital Colombo, President Chandrika Kumaratunga said in
a television interview that she was ready to offer Vellupillai
Prabhakaran, the head of the Tamil Tiger rebels, a provincial
government position if he ended the 17-year-old rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Prabhakaran ''can even be the leader or chief minister ...
perhaps even for a certain period without elections,'' she told the
Star television network.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga said she would talk to Prabhakaran herself ''if it
is required ... to bring about peace in my country I shall do it,''
Kumaratunga said. ''I shall never consider him my personal friend
but it will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga survived an attack by a suspected rebel suicide
bomber in December. She was blinded in one eye by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast over the rebels' clandestine radio station, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said it had stopped fighting and
would observe a cease-fire Saturday to allow people to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel broadcast, heard by residents in the
government-controlled city of Vavuniya, came three hours after the
guerrillas' deadline expired for government forces defending the
northern city of Jaffna to surrender or face a ''blood bath.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the warning, Sri Lanka's air force bombed rebel
positions Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The radio broadcast asked civilians in Jaffna city, the rebels'
former capital where 40,000 soldiers are fighting the guerrillas,
to move to one of the city's western neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''To avoid the death of civilians, we have asked them to go to
Walikamamam West,'' the broadcast said. ''The government has
declared a curfew and is preventing people from going there, which
is a violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the deadline expired, Voice of Tiger radio repeated
its call to the troops to give up. The warning was first issued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, dismissed
the surrender call as a ploy by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam to unnerve the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have been fighting for a homeland for the minority
Tamils since 1983, accusing the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. The Sinhalese, who control
the government and the military, deny the charge.

<HEADLINE> Sen.'s Son Sentenced to Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANOKA, Minn. (AP) -- The son of Sen. Rod Grams was sentenced
Friday to 90 days in jail for borrowing a friend's car, forging
checks in her name and using her credit card without her consent.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Grams pleaded guilty to all three charges earlier this
month. He was also ordered to pay a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   While in court for the sentencing, he was arrested for failing
to appear in court on charges stemming from a separate incident, in
which he is accused of destroying property and disorderly conduct
at a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Grams was stopped in a borrowed rental vehicle after
his father called the sheriff for help finding his son. A deputy
found 10 bags of marijuana and several beer cans in the vehicle. He
was not asked about the items, leading to questions about whether
he received special treatment because of his father's position.
</P>
<P>
   Following an outside investigation, Morgan Grams pleaded guilty
in February to a misdemeanor marijuana charge and was sentenced to
90 days in jail, with 86 days stayed and credit for four days
served.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation uncovered no evidence he received special
treatment by authorities. It also absolved the older Grams of any
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Riggleman Back in Chicago With Cubs  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jim Riggleman is doing fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Slimmer and wiser 7{ months after he was fired by the Cubs, he
returned to Chicago for the first time Friday with a new job and a
fresh outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Through box scores and sports pages, he still follows the team
he managed for five seasons. He quickly points out how the roster
has been revamped with new players surrounding constants Sammy Sosa
and Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   But if there are new faces, there is also one problem that still
persists, one that certainly contributed to Riggleman's downfall
and a 95-loss season in 1999 that followed a trip to the playoffs
the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   That glaring deficiency is poor pitching, especially out of the
bullpen. The Cubs, as they were a year ago, are still struggling.
They were 18-30 before a Friday night game in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was managing that club, the record would be just what it
is right now,'' Riggleman, now a third base coach with the
Cleveland Indians, said during an hour-long chat with reporters in
the Comiskey Park dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pitching struggles I can relate to. They need to get
(Kerry) Wood and (Ismael) Valdes going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were eight games over .500 in early June a year ago and
then after losing three straight to the White Sox, they never
recovered. Without the injured Wood, they won just 26 games after
the All-Star break and Riggleman was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the season ended, I went home and didn't know which way
things would go,'' Riggleman said. ''It was not surprising that I
was let go. Not a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman wasn't sure what he would do before some job
possibilities opened up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they hadn't, I would probably have watched the Cubs on TV
in the afternoon and the Braves at night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He interviewed for the Indians job before it went to Charlie
Manuel and was hired as a coach one month after the Cubs let him
go.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland, he can now watch first-hand how one of the most
successful teams in the last five years operates.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman, who had a 486-598 in seven seasons as a manager with
San Diego and Chicago, thinks he will manage again some day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been asked that and I haven't given it much though. It
would depend on where the opening was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm completely confident I can manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have identified Riggleman as a fall guy for the Cubs
collapse after the front office decided to stick with the same
fading veterans who led the playoff run in 1998, but he has no ill
feelings. At least not ones he expresses.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged there were a few players he didn't see
eye-to-eye with during his final season but said the differences
were patched up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is too short to be bitter,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Fan Falls From Upper Deck  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fan fell from the upper deck onto the screen
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium during the third inning of
Friday night's game against Boston and, able to walk, was taken to
a hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Laurenzi, 24, of Yonkers, N.Y., was arrested on a charge
of disorderly conduct, police Lt. John Roeder said, adding there
was a chance a charge of reckless endangerment could be added.
</P>
<P>
   Laurenzi was unconscious for a short time while sprawled on the
netting and the game was delayed. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital
for observation, but Roeder said the man seemed OK.
</P>
<P>
   Police said it was unclear whether the fan jumped or fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have witnesses who say both,'' Roeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurenzi, wearing a dark T-shirt with No. 21 and the last name
of Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill, seemed to fall head first on
to the netting. Security escorted the man in handcuffs to the
police office in the stadium's basement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Loosen the cuffs, man, they're too tight,'' he told officers.
</P>
<P>
   Laurenzi remained motionless on the screen for about five
minutes while the game continued before suddenly sitting up and
raising both arms high. Some fans cheered, apparently thinking he
was unhurt, while others booed, believing it was a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He popped up in a drunken stupor,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium security and medical personnel gathered beneath him,
bringing a stretcher with them. He then crawled his way into the
middle of the ballpark's three decks and was led out through a
private suite.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was scary because he didn't move,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ''You thought he broke his neck or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The game then resumed. A pack of cigarettes and a wallet
remained on the screen after the fan crawled off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, there was only a high backstop behind the
plate and no netting extending to the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two years ago, he would've fallen on somebody,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The fall occurred in the bottom of the third inning with Wilson
Delgado of the Yankees batting. After Delgado flied out and O'Neill
hit an inning-ending grounder, the game was halted for six minutes
while players on both teams and umpires moved in for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like that before,'' winning pitcher
Ramon Martinez said. ''Only in the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning of a game between the same teams at Yankee
Stadium, on Aug. 23, 1989, a fan jumped onto the netting.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Krisztin, then a 24-year-old from Old Bethpage, N.Y.,
climbed down the netting, then swung onto the field. He wasn't hurt
but, after being ushered off the field by security, was charged
with reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   ''That guy was awesome,'' said Red Sox reliever Rob Murphy, who
was pitching at the time. ''That was so exciting, it was worth the
price of admission.''

<HEADLINE> Nun, Priest Silenced on Homosexuals  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A priest and nun ordered to end their ministry
to gays and lesbians were silenced this week by the Vatican,
prohibiting them from publicly discussing their work or the
decision to discipline them last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jeannine Gramick said she and the Rev. Robert Nugent were
summoned to Rome and instructed by their religious orders not to
talk about the Vatican's decision. While they ended their ministry,
both have spoken about the church's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gramick, a member of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, said
Friday she would not obey the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I choose to obey the voice of God within me, and in this
instance, the voice of God is saying that I should not collaborate
with my own oppression,'' Gramick said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the order said that Gramick was
obligated by her vows to follow the Vatican's latest directive. She
could be dismissed if she fails to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent's order, the Society of the Divine Savior, said that
Nugent would issue a statement soon on whether he would heed the
decision. Nugent was scheduled to return from Rome late Friday
night and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent and Gramick co-founded the New Ways Ministry in 1977 in
Mount Rainier. The pair ministered to gays and lesbians, held
retreats, published works on homosexuality and the Roman Catholic
church and traveled the nation to hold workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Church hierarchy began an investigation of New Ways in 1988.
While the church teaches that homosexual acts are evil, it also
says that homosexuals should be treated with ''respect, compassion
and sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Vatican informed them they could no longer conduct
their ministry.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Eric Milton allowed two hits in seven
innings, and Jay Canizaro had four RBIs to help the Minnesota Twins
break a four-game skid with a 10-2 win over the Texas Rangers on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, who lost all 12 games to Texas last season, have won
three of the four games played between the two teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (4-1) walked three and gave up two runs in the first two
innings, before settling down to win his second straight start.
</P>
<P>
   The second Texas run came when Scarborough Green stole home,
easily beating Milton's pitch to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Milton then retired 16 of the final 17 batters he faced,
including consecutive strikeouts of Chad Curtis, Ivan Rodriguez and
Rafael Palmeiro in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander has the last two Minnesota wins, pitching eight
scoreless innings in a 3-0 win at Oakland last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver (1-3) lasted only four innings, giving up five
runs and seven hits before he was replaced by Matt Perisho to start
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0, the Twins took the lead in the second inning on
Canizaro's two-run double and an RBI single by Denny Hocking.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey's third homer in the third inning made it 4-2.
Canizaro added RBI groundouts in the fourth and the Twins' five-run
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Green had an RBI double in the second before stealing home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Green became the 21st Ranger to steal home when he scored
in the second inning. The last to do it was Tom Goodwin at Oakland
on Sept. 24, 1997. ... Twins 3B Jason Maxwell singled twice,
doubled and hit a sacrifice fly to the warning track in center
field in his first appearance since coming off the 15-day DL. ...
The Rangers failed to reach double digits in hits for the sixth
straight game.

<HEADLINE> Split Verdict in Mass. Trial  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A couple charged with ignoring the screams of two
children killed in a house fire were convicted of assault Friday,
but the jury deadlocked on manslaughter charges against the
children's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Jada Amicone, 27, the mother, and Michael
Panagopoulos, 24, failed to heed the cries of 5-year-old Tyler
Amicone and 3-year-old Brianna Keene until it was too late to save
them.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also said the children were locked in their room
at the time, but the defense denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Panagopoulos, Amicone's former live-in boyfriend, was acquitted
of manslaughter. Prosecutors said they have not decided if they
will retry Amicone on the manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Amicone and Panagopoulos each face up to 10 years in prison. Had
they been convicted of manslaughter, they would have faced up to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the two children started the fire with either
matches or a lighter. While the fire spread, Amicone was sleeping
off a cocaine high and Panagopoulos was playing video games,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the couple smelled smoke and went to the bedroom, it
was too late to save the children. Tyler was found draped over
Brianna in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Amicone called 911, hysterically reporting the children were
trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the couple regularly locked the children in
their room behind a door that could only be opened from the
outside. Amicone's attorney said the bedroom door was not locked
the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said the smoke alarm was disconnected by the
couple because steam from the shower frequently set it off.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Jeter May Return Saturday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- All-Star shortstop Derek Jeter, sidelined since
May 11 by an abdominal strain, was expected to return to the New
York Yankees' lineup for Saturday's game against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hoped to activate Jeter from the 15-day disabled
list after he arrives at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks that way,'' manager Joe Torre said after Friday
night's 4-1 loss to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter played for Class-A Tampa in the Florida State League on
Friday night, going 2-for-3 with a double and scoring twice against
Lakeland. He was flawless in the field. He headed to the airport
for a late flight back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm out of here at 10:30,'' Jeter said following the minor
league game. ''I'm anxious to get back regardless of who we're
playing. Obviously it's a big series, but at this point you've been
away so long I'm just looking forward to playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to see if I'm healthy, that's the biggest
concern,'' he said. ''I feel healthy, but sometimes you really
can't tell until you get into a game, the adrenaline gets going and
you get into a game situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is hitless in his last four games for the Yankees. At
0-for-13, it's his longest slump since a four-game drought in April
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is hitting .266 with three home runs and 13 RBIs for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough injury,'' he said. ''It's something every
movement you do, you don't throw, you can't run, you can't swing,
you can't even roll over while you're sleeping because you use that
muscle. You can't much to it, just rest it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a situation where right now we're tied for first place
and by no stretch of the imagination are we playing well. That's a
testament to our pitching staff. We haven't swung the bats, but yet
we've still been able to find ways to win. Hopefully, we can get
going on all cylinders and get a little roll going here.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 2, Rockies 1  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Francisco Cordova pitched eight strong innings and
drove in the go-ahead run with his first hit of the season as the
Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Colorado Rockies 2-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benjamin, hitting .412 over his last 11 games, added two
hits to help the Pirates end a five-game losing streak. Pittsburgh
has won five straight in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The three runs matched the second lowest combined score in six
years at Coors Field. The Rockies were averaging 9.7 runs per game
at home and had scored at least 10 runs in 11 of their previous 13
games at Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova (2-4), who won for the first time in seven starts, gave
up only four hits, including a solo homer to opposing pitcher
Masato Yoshii (1-6).
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander also got his first hit in 19 at-bats this
season, a grounder down the first-base line to score Benjamin in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams pitched the ninth for his seventh save. Williams
got Jeffrey Hammonds to ground out with runners on first and third
to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii deserved a better fate as he dropped his fifth straight
decision, matching the longest losing streak of his career. He gave
up two runs and eight hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team managed more than one hit in an inning until the
Pirates broke through in the sixth when Warren Morris led off with
a single and scored on a two-out double by John Vander Wal.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii tied the game in the sixth when he hit a 386-foot homer
to left. He sprinted to second base before slowing to a trot after
second base umpire Gary Cederstrom told him it was a home run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pittsburgh C Jason Kendall played against his father, Fred,
for the second time in his major league career. Fred Kendall is
Colorado's catching coach. ... Kendall extended his hitting streak
to 11 games with a first-inning double. ... The Pirates did not
arrive in Denver until 4 a.m. after playing in Phoenix on Thursday
night. ... Rockies 1B Todd Helton ended an 0-for-13 spell with a
single in the seventh. His average has dropped from .418 to .387.
... Yoshii's homer was the 13th by a Colorado pitcher in the team's
eight-season history.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Drops Congress Demand  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hoping to defuse the worst political
crisis of his presidency, President Andres Pastrana announced
Friday that he was dropping a proposal to dissolve Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pull the proposal from a planned referendum
meets a key demand of opposition lawmakers, who had vowed to block
economic reforms and called for early presidential elections in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, Pastrana announced he would hold a referendum to
dissolve Congress and hold elections for a new legislature after
the discovery of fictitious contracts worth $2.7 million by the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana said he was backing off in order to prevent
political turbulence from destabilizing a fragile economy
struggling to emerge from Colombia's worst recession since the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment has come for grandeur,'' Pastrana told a nationwide
television audience following what he termed several days of
''serene reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Though embarrassing politically, Pastrana's retreat was bound to
be applauded by financial markets and many Colombians who felt his
plan to call early legislative elections this fall was driving the
country to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The peso has dropped sharply since the president announced his
referendum plan March 30, and Colombia's debt ratings have been
downgraded amid weeks of political brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Pastrana said he would still push a popular
referendum to fight graft, but without the call for early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's call for elections infuriated lawmakers, who said
they were being unfairly singled out when corruption is also
rampant in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Liberal Party, which holds a majority of seats,
threatened to block economic reforms Colombia has pledged to enact
in loan agreements with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the opposition now backs off its demand for early
presidential elections, the next balloting for congress and the
presidency would take place in 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Robin Ventura broke a seventh-inning tie with a
two-run, bases-loaded single as the New York Mets ended the St.
Louis Cardinals' five-game winning streak, 5-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton (6-4) escaped early trouble to win his fourth
straight start, quieting an attack that had totaled 48 runs during
the streak. He allowed two runs and nine hits in eight innings, and
has given up only three runs in 30 1-3 innings during his streak.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, last year's NL Cy Young runner-up is 6-1 in
his last eight outings. He also went 2-for-3 at the plate with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds hit his third homer in four games, his 16th overall,
and Fernando Vina had a run-scoring groundout for St. Louis. Mark
McGwire, the major league leader with 20 homers, went 0-for-3 with
a walk.
</P>
<P>
   New York won for the seventh time in 10 games as Ventura
improved his career average with the bases loaded to .364 with 154
RBIs and 14 homers in 129 at-bats. He also hit a sacrifice fly in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals pitchers tied a season-high with nine walks, including
three straight by Pat Hentgen that forced in a run in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-all in the seventh, Mark Thompson (0-1) got two
outs and then walked Derek Bell, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza,
bringing up Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton got out of a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the
first when Eric Davis grounded into a double play. The Cardinals
loaded the bases in the second on singles by Placido Polanco,
Hentgen and Fernando Vina before Edgar Renteria struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton nicked Mike Matheny with in the fourth and it finally
cost him a run as Polanco singled, Hentgen sacrificed with a
two-strike bunt and Vina followed with a run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen, who has a 5.52 ERA, put together his second straight
solid outing, allowing two runs and four hits in six innings.
Notes: Edmonds is almost halfway to his best season homer total of
33 in 1995. ... Armando Benitez pitched a hitless ninth for his
13th save in 14 chances. ... Cardinals pitchers also had nine walks
April 20 at San Diego. ... The Cardinals have 97 homers in 47 games
and need three in the next three to tie Seattle's record of
reaching 100 homers in 50 games last season. The NL record for
reaching 100 is 64 games by the 1956 Reds. ... Alfonzo is only

<HEADLINE> Opposition Members Arrested in Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitian rights activists on Friday
denounced the arrests of dozens of opposition politicians after an
apparent election victory by former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party.
</P>
<P>
   At least 34 opposition figures have been arrested since Sunday's
vote for Parliament and local offices. Fifteen are members of the
Struggling People's Organization, and 19 from the five-party Space
for Concord coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Several more Space for Concord members were arrested in
provincial towns, said Space for Concord spokesman Evans Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Roy, director of the National Office for the Protection of
the Citizen, an autonomous state agency, condemned the arrests,
which he said were conducted without warrants. ''We are troubled by
the fact that police have singled out members of the opposition,''
Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven detainees were candidates -- including former
parliamentary majority spokesman Sen. Paul Denis, accused of
illegal firearms possession.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Jean-Dady Simeon said those arrested faced
charges of inciting violence, illegal arms possession, violence at
the polls, threats and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Denis was released from the jail later Friday, party spokesman
Sauveur Pierre Etienne said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's government had no immediate comment. But the
Organization of American States election observer mission believes
that ''the arrest of Paul Denis was illegal,'' said spokeswoman
Mary Durran.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people, most opposition members, were killed in
pre-election violence. Police have made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Aristide's Lavalas Family party -- which declared a
sweeping victory in Sunday's election, though results haven't been
released -- repeatedly deny any role in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval, an Aristide supporter, locked lawmakers
out of Parliament in January 1999 after an 18-month standoff with
the Struggling People's Organization. In March 1999, Preval
appointed by decree a new premier and the provisional electoral
council that organized Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition parties accuse Preval and Aristide of
collaborating to establish a totalitarian state. Aristide, Haiti's
most popular politician, is expected to easily win a presidential
election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was elected in 1990 but overthrown in a 1991
army-backed coup. U.S. troops restored him to power in 1994, but
Haitian law barred him from seeking a consecutive term in 1995
elections. Since the invasion, the international community has
poured more than a billion dollars into this Caribbean nation, one
of the world's least developed.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Arrested in N.Y. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two suspects were arrested Friday in the
killings of five employees in the basement of a Wendy's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Both men admitted participating in the crime and both face
first- and second-degree murder charges, authorities said. John
Taylor and Craig Godineaux were being held pending arraignment
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 36, was arrested at his sister-in-law's house on Long
Island by police responding to a bicycle accident in front of the
home, First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a weapon in a fanny pack that was in his possession, a
.380-caliber semi-automatic,'' he said, adding that police believe
the weapon may have been used in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned got a tip that Taylor may have fled to one of
several family locations on Long Island and had been staking out
the sister-in-law's house, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, a boy on a bicycle got into a slight accident with a
car in front of the home, Kelleher said, and Taylor was standing
outside around 4:30 p.m. watching the commotion when police
arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had briefly worked at the Wendy's last year. Police
lifted his palm print from a recently delivered box found in the
restaurant's basement.
</P>
<P>
   Godineaux, believed to be an accomplice, was arrested in Queens
at his job at a men's clothing store. Taylor and Godineaux, 31,
worked together at the clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Both men face multiple counts of first- and second-degree
murder, robbery and weapons charges, said Queens District Attorney
Richard A. Brown. The two suspects were expected to be arraigned in
Queens Criminal Court on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's massacre on bustling Main Street, in the
Flushing section of Queens, two gunmen entered the Wendy's around
closing time, bound and gagged the seven employees and shot them,
killing five and wounding two. The gunmen made off with about
$2,000 in cash and a videotape from the restaurant's security
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked at the Wendy's briefly in 1999, leaving in
October. At the time, Wendy's suspected him ''in a case of missing
money,'' Kelleher said, but no charges were ever filed.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested in June for allegedly robbing a McDonald's
in Queens at which he had worked. A warrant was later issued for
Taylor after he missed a court appearance. At the time of the
McDonald's robbery, he was on probation for a 1996 robbery of a
McDonald's in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's officials and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced the
creation of a fund to help the families of the seven victims.
Wendy's offered a $50,000 reward and the city $10,000 for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, JaQuione Johnson, 18, underwent
surgery Friday and remained in critical condition with a gunshot
wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Patrick Castro, 23, was released from the hospital
Thursday and is under police protection. He was shot through both
cheeks and is credited with saving Johnson's life.

<HEADLINE> Astros 5, Braves 4, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- It took an extra inning, but the Houston Astros
finally won a one-run game.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers' RBI single in the 10th inning gave the Astros their
first win in 13 one-run games this season, 5-4 over the Atlanta
Braves on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros rallied to win after close Billy Wagner blew his
sixth save in 10 chances by giving up an RBI single to Trenidad
Hubbard in the ninth inning. Houston had lost 14 straight one-run
contests since beating St. Louis 4-3 on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou led off the 10th inning with a walk off Rudy Seanez
(2-2). One out later, pinch-hitter Daryle Ward hit a bloop single
to left. With two outs, Spiers lined a single to center to win the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henry (1-2) pitched the 10th inning as Houston won its
first game against the Braves since losing last year's first-round
playoff series 3-1 to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's blown save cost Jose Lima a chance for his first win
since April 5. Lima has lost a career-high seven straight decisions
since beating Pittsburgh 11-2 in his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who got 39 saves in 42 chances last season, allowed a
leadoff double to Javy Lopez. Pinch-runner Rafael Furcal was thrown
out at third on Reggie Sanders' groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitters Bobby Bonilla and Hubbard followed with singles to
tie the game at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who won 21 games last season, has struggled all season,
winning just one time in eight decisions with an 8.19 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed three runs and eight hits in seven innings, just
the third time in 10 starts that the right-hander allowed fewer
than five runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Lima kept the Braves scoreless until the fifth when Chipper
Jones hit a two-run double. Lopez tied it at 3 in the sixth inning
with a solo homer off Lima, who has allowed a major league-worst 20
20 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's career-high 16th homer off Tom Glavine broke a
3-3 tie in the sixth inning. Glavine allowed four runs and eight
hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell tripled over Andruw Jones' head with a fly ball
that bounced off the hill in center field scoring Craig Biggio in
the third inning. Bagwell scored from third on second baseman
Quilvio Veras' throwing error to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey's added an RBI single in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 86 home runs hit in Enron Field this season in
23 games. There were 118 homers in the Astrodome all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Glavine has won eight straight decisions in Houston since
losing 1-0 on June 25, 1991 at the Astrodome. ... The Braves have
scored 70 runs in Glavine's 11 starts. ... The Braves have scored
85 runs in their last 11 games. ... Atlanta is second in the league
in fewest home runs allowed with 49. ... The Astros have sold more
than 2.5 million tickets for the entire season, already the second
best season total in club history. The club record was 2,706,017
last season. ... The Astros were 22-18 in one-run games last
season.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attends Texas H.S. Graduation  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas (AP) -- Crawford High had never had a
commencement speaker until Gov. George W. Bush volunteered,
choosing the Friday night event to say hello to his new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high school graduation will give us the opportunity to
celebrate a special occasion in a part of Texas where we find peace
of mind,'' Bush said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor last year bought a 1,583-acre ranch --
expected to be a sort of Western White House if he is elected --
along the Middle Bosque River. But the likely Republican
presidential nominee had yet to meet many of his neighbors,
including Mayor Robert Campbell. The ranch is about seven miles
west of Crawford, which is 15 miles west of Waco and 115 miles
southwest of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is kind of looking forward to it,'' Campbell said of
the ice cream social Bush was attending after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-minute talk, Bush said he and his wife look forward to
meeting neighbors and were glad to attend the graduation. He gave
the school's 45 graduates seven pieces of advice -- from doing
business with respect and dignity to always listening to their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned that no matter how old you are or how important
your job is you can never escape your mother,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced to truly change America, we need a renewal of
spirit in this country and return to selfless concern for others,
for duty and for country. Let faith be the fire within us. A
successful career can put a fancy car in your driveway, but it
cannot fill the spiritual well from which we draw strength every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of all I hope that when you look in the mirror, you will
always be proud of what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech caused a stir in the normally quiet town of 700.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids are all extremely excited. Everyone in the community
is all excited,'' Campbell said. ''Our problem is everyone wants to
come to graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony is usually held in the school gym, but to
accommodate the 2,500 people expected Friday, it was moved to the
football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, arrived shortly before the ceremony
began. The school band struck played and the crowd applauded. The
Bushes sat on the stage with Secret Service agents and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The governor smiled broadly and waved as the graduating seniors,
in their black caps and gowns, marched to their seats. The ceremony
opened with the national anthem and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Graduating senior Natalie Todd said she was looking forward to
Bush's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made it,'' she said. ''He's successful. He's had to
overcome obstacles, just like we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Don Harris was delighted that Bush accepted his
invitation to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has property in our community and we are really perceiving
this as an effort to meet the community and be part of what is
happening in the community,'' Harris said. ''I appreciate the
gesture on his part to become involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he could understand why Bush has chosen Crawford
as a second home. ''It's nice and quiet, a small community where
everybody knows everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And the mayor expected the governor's speech to put the town on
the map.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who don't know where we are, they will then,''
Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Injured, Exits Game  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' homecoming lasted seven
minutes and 50 seconds -- and now his career could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers' star was helped off the ice after he
was elbowed in the head by New Jersey's Scott Stevens in the first
period of Friday night's Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey beat Philadelphia 2-1 to advance to the Stanley Cup
finals, becoming the first team in NHL history to overcome a 3-1
deficit in a conference final.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who missed 10 weeks due to post-concussion syndrome,
was playing in his second game -- his first at home -- since
rejoining the Flyers after the lengthy layoff.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Pennsylvania Hospital and was expected to be
held overnight. There was no immediate word on the extent of the
injury or whether it was a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL fined the Flyers $10,000, apparently for violating
Stanley Cup playoff regulations by not releasing information on
Lindros' injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sickening,'' said Flyers forward John LeClair, who
helped Lindros off the ice. ''With everything he's been through, it
was tough to see. It's a great concern. We all know his history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, 27, sustained three concussions this season and five in
the last two years. His younger brother, Brett, retired from the
NHL because of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' career in Philadelphia could be over regardless of his
latest injury. He will be a restricted free agent and, considering
the bad blood between the Lindros family and team management, it's
possible he will leave.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Lindros was skating up ice with the puck
and his head down when Stevens blindsided him with an elbow 7:50
into the first period. Just before the hit, Devils forward Jay
Pandolfo impeded Lindros' progress by placing his stick between
Lindros' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros appeared to bang his head on the ice, and was helped to
the trainer's room. No penalty was called, and Flyers interim coach
Craig Ramsay as well as teammates said they thought it was a clean
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stevens is a big hitter,'' defenseman Dan McGillis said. ''You
have to have your head up when he's on the ice. It was right at the
whistle, but I think it was pretty clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was so upset by the result of the hit that New Jersey
coach Larry Robinson had to speak to him between periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to see anybody get hurt,'' Stevens said. ''It was
a little tough to play after that. It's always on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Flyers goaltender Brian Boucher said the team rallied around the
injury. Still, it wasn't enough to help the team earn its eighth
trip to the Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been through adversity,'' Boucher said. ''We still had a
hockey game to play. It's an unfortunate thing for (Lindros).''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair pointed to the 4-1 loss in Game 5 as the turning point
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out flat in Game 5 and that was a big part of it,''
LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet's goal tied the game 1-1 in the second period
Friday night. But the Flyers, who played their best hockey in a
week in that period, couldn't carry the momentum into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias' second goal of the game with 2:32 to play ended
the Flyers' season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not what you expect when you take a 3-1 lead,'' Flyers
captain Eric Desjardins said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game back on Wednesday, Lindros scored the Flyers'
only goal in a 2-1 loss at New Jersey, which pulled the Devils even
at three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The former captain hoped to return home and lead the Flyers into
the Stanley Cup finals, but his injury changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   While Lindros was recovering, he also became the central figure
in hockey's most-publicized family feud.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, once forced to choose between Lindros and general manager
Bob Clarke, the franchise's former hero, were solidly behind No.
88. They roared when his name was announced Friday and cheered each
time he came on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't win the Stanley Cup without him,'' said 27-year-old
Tom Pizzi, a diehard Flyers fan from South Philadelphia. ''Anybody
who says they don't need him is nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, however, when fans wondered whether Lindros
would ever wear a Flyers uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   He received his second concussion when he was checked by
Boston's Hall Gill on March 4 and later was stripped of his
captaincy after criticizing the team's medical staff for failing to
diagnose the severity of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   His photo was taken off promotional advertisements. He wasn't
included in the team's highlight reels and the mere mention of his
name left players, coaches and even the team's broadcasters feeling
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   To add further insult, the ''C'' was airbrushed from Lindros'
sweater in an action photo on the cover of the team's postseason
media guide.

<HEADLINE> Police: Student Kills Fla. Teacher  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-year-old student sent home from
school for throwing water balloons on the last day of classes
returned and fatally shot a teacher with a semi-automatic pistol
Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh grader Nathaniel Brazill returned to Lake Worth
Community Middle School shortly before 3:30 p.m., and tried to talk
to two girls in an English class taught by Barry Grunow, Police
Chief William Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   When Grunow told Brazill to leave, the teen-ager pulled a small
.25-caliber pistol out of a pants pocket and fired a single shot,
killing the 35-year-old teacher, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill, an honor roll student with a perfect attendance record,
flagged down a police officer about a quarter mile from the school
and surrendered. He was being questioned by police late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   School officials called Brazill a model student. He was slated
to serve as a student mediator next fall
</P>
<P>
   ''If you asked me to pick one kid out of a 1,000 to do something
like this, he wouldn't be the one,'' Palm Beach County Schools
Superintendent H. Benjamin Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other injuries and no other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, of Lake Worth, was shot in the face, said Mabel Cardec,
a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County School Board.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow was one of Brazill's teachers. An assistant principal had
sent him home.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Grunwald, 13, who was in Grunow's class, said the teacher
was standing in the doorway, talking to students in the hallway
when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was standing out in the hall, telling everybody to go back
into class because it wasn't time to be dismissed,'' she said.
''Five seconds later he was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazill likely will be charged with murder, but must appear
before a judge Saturday morning to determine whether he will be
charged as an adult or juvenile. He was to be taken to a juvenile
detention center Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Brazill got the gun and bullets from a dresser
drawer at his grandfather's house last week. Smith said police are
considering filing charges against the grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill's grandmother, Eberlena Josey, said the boy went to her
house mad and wanting a key to his house at about 2:30 p.m. Josey
said her daughter had called her in the morning and said that
Brazill was being suspended and that he was going to have to walk
home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't have a gun in her house. It was not clear if
she is related to the grandfather police said owned the gun used in
the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was the best boy. He was good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used in the slaying was described as a Raven, a
semiautomatic manufactured by Phoenix Arms. The pistol is compact,
barely five inches long, and is easily concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill earned A's and B's and had perfect attendance, said Nat
Harrington, a spokesman for the school board. ''He had no problems
of any kind, prior to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said Brazill told investigators he liked Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the apartment where Brazill lives with his mother,
stepfather and 2-year-old sister, neighbors said he was not a
troublemaker. Carmen Torres said she often heard him playing the
flute or would see him playing basketball outside with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, who had worked at the school for seven years, had a
wife, a 5-year-old son and infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Barry loved the kids and he would want us all to keep
loving the kids,'' said Jeff Neal, a teacher at the school and a
friend of Grunow's.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth is just south of West Palm Beach. The school has
about 1,500 students. It is a community school because
adult-education classes are held there in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth is in Palm Beach County, the fourth largest school
district in Florida and 14th largest in the nation with more than
149,500 students.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Leads Women's Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRIVER, Ore. (AP) -- The University of Arizona shot a
7-under-par 281 Friday to take a 28-stroke lead into the final
round of the NCAA women's golf championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go out and try to set some records,'' said
Arizona coach Todd McCorkle, whose Wildcats are 1 over after three
rounds. ''I can't imagine having a better lineup ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State set the four-round record of 3 over in 1998, and
Tulsa set the record for margin of victory at 36 strokes in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's performance was dampened by the news that freshman
Julia Kraschinski's father suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Kraschinski, playing on an hour's sleep after learning her
father had been hospitalized, appeared lighthearted on the course,
but cried after the round.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really tough,'' she said. ''I would rather think about
the good things. It was good to be able to play. I just hope he's
OK.''
</P>

   Kraschinski and teammate Jenna Daniels are tied for the
individual title at 6 under. Kraschinski shot a 70 and Daniels had
a 68 on the Crosswater Club course.

   With Arizona far ahead, other schools are concentrating on
second place. Southern California is 29 over, and Oregon, Georgia
and Texas are 31 over.

   ''We can't do a darned thing about Arizona,'' Georgia coach
Beans Kelly said. ''We haven't seen a team like that for a number
of years. I think it's going to be a heck of a race for second
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In individual play, Georgia's Laura Henderson, Auburn's Danielle
Downey and Stacy Prammanasudh of Tulsa are tied for third, seven
shots behind the Arizona duo.

<HEADLINE> Elias Scores Twice, Leads NJ To Win  </HEADLINE>

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patrik Elias sat home early and sent the New
Jersey Devils to the Stanley Cup finals late.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, who missed the first three weeks because of a contract
squabble, scored both Devils' goals Friday night as New Jersey
eliminated the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in Game 7 of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory capped New Jersey's comeback from being down three
games to one, the first such comeback in NHL conference finals
history. Not counting two 3-0 comebacks, the Devils became the 14th
team to rally and win from 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old forward from the Czech Republic was a restricted
free agent following last season and was without a contract in the
first eight New Jersey games. Elias was hoping for a $1 million
deal, but it was a waiting game he was not going to win. He finally
relented and rejoined the club.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only negative of the season for Elias, who led the
team with 35 goals and 72 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all knew how much we needed him,'' said defenseman Ken
Daneyko, who has played in all eight Game 7s in Devils history.
''Patrik's going to get his money in due time, he certainly
deserves a lot more, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   After New Jersey took an early lead, the Devils allowed the
Flyers to dominate the second period and tie the game. It could
have been worse, but the Devils did not fall behind, setting up
Elias' heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The third period was our best in the game,'' said Elias. ''The
second period we didn't play good at all. We weren't skating, we
weren't moving the puck and it looked like those guys had a pretty
good chance to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias hasn't slowed down his scoring pace in the playoffs -- he's
the top scorer again for New Jersey with seven goals and 15 points.
He gave the Devils a 1-0 lead 6:44 in, scoring on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   His second goal, coming from in front after Jason Arnott
dribbled the puck over to him, broke a 1-1 tie with 2:32 left and
sent the Devils on their second trip to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the type of game he is capable of playing, he is very
explosive,'' said New Jersey coach Larry Robinson. ''I sometimes
wish he would be around the net a little more -- he would score a
lot more goals than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey selected Elias with the 51st pick in the 1994 entry
draft. He scored four goals and set up another against
Philadelphia. Elias made the comeback possible by getting a goal
and an assist in the Devils' 4-1 victory in Game 5 at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a game breaker,'' Robinson said. ''It is nice to have
those guys on your club.''
