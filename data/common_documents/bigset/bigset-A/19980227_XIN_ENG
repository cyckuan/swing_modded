<HEADLINE> Bonn Praises China's Role in Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- German Deputy Foreign Ministry
Werner Hoyer Thursday praised China's responsibility in keeping a
constant exchange rate of the Renminbi (RMB) and pegging Hong
Kong's dollar to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer said after a visit to China last week that during the
Asian financial crisis, "China's role as political and economic
stability anchor in Asia has never been so evident".
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that Beijing would be able to
withstand the crisis this year, adding that if the RMB failed to
hold its value, it would exert a massive "shock effect" in the
Asian markets, affecting all western countries.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer started his China visit on February 16 in Hong Kong with
a meeting with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, who is also due to
pay a visit to Germany early next month. In Beijing, Hoyer also
held talks with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan, and
the Vice-Governor of China's Central Bank, Chen Yuan, on February

<HEADLINE> China Adds Modern Definitions to "Lei Feng Spirit" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Du Chunyan, a self-employed
merchant from northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, today
walked into the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of
China's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
She was invited to speak to a small gathering of Party and
government officials and the media people on the efforts she had
made to become one of China's model youths in learning from Lei
Feng, the country's top prototype of altruism.
</P>
<P>
Du, who was laid off in 1991 by a state enterprise on the verge
of bankruptcy, opened a private store and learned to run it well
with some kind people's assistance. After getting prosperous, she
rewarded society by helping many other young laid-off workers to
learn skills and find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
To Lei Feng, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army living
in the 1950s and 1960s, what happened in Du's life would be
nothing but strange and puzzling. And he wouldn't have the
slightest idea of terms like "self-employed", "laid-off workers"
and "re-employment", which, however, have almost become daily
vocabulary for today's Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
But officials in charge of China's ethical and cultural
progress today praised Du for having carried forward the essence
of the lofty spirit of Lei Feng under the new system of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the late Chairman Mao Zedong wrote in 1963 an inscription
urging the whole country to "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng", the
Chinese government has never stopped a nationwide campaign that
prompts the people to embrace altruism and do good things for
society.
</P>
<P>
As times change, the interpretation of the "Lei Feng Spirit"
has also been continually enriched, and has now far exceeded the
narrow scope of altruism.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Supply, Demand in 1997-98: IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- As a result of higher figures
for Russia, Argentina, China and Australia, the estimate for world
wheat production shows an increase of 5 million to a record 608
million tons in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Trade is 1 million higher at 96 million tons, principally
reflecting higher estimated imports by Algeria and Libya. Forecast
export shipments by Canada are up 0.5 million to 19.5 million
tons, ther International Grains Council (IGC) announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following substantial revisions to supply-demand data for
several countries, world consumption is estimated 9 million up on
last year at 590 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The revised figure for stocks is 128 million, an increase of 17
million over 1996-97, according to the IGC.
</P>
<P>
As far as coarse grains are concerned, production is 4 million
higher at 897 million tons, some 10 million down on last season.
The main increases concern Europe, Russia and China, which offset
reductions for Thailand and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of coarse grains is forecast 6 million lower at 900
million tons. Smaller domestic crops of maize will curtail use in
Brazil and South Africa, and pasture conditions are especially
favorable in Saudi Arabia, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Forecast stocks are up 10 million to 117 million tons. The
stock drawdown in China could be less severe than expected
previously, the council added.

<HEADLINE> China Adds Modern Definitions to "Lei Feng Spirit" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official in northeast China's Fushun City, where Lei Feng
served in the army, said that today's Chinese society is haunted
by many social worries, such as people's indifference to each
other, confusion in moral standards and distortion of social
values.
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of the general public, the Lei Feng Spirit
represents sincerity, kindness and purity. They wish to use it to
purify society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that there is also something in Lei
Feng's spirit that can help solve some of the most pressing
problems in modern China, such as the reform of state-owned
enterprises, which has led to massive layoffs of redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng put the interests of the country first, and was
always ready to make sacrifices. He was never overwhelmed by
difficult situations, but often encouraged people to help and love
each other. His spirit can keep the people in a good mood and help
ease social tension," the official explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lei Feng's dedication to his work is also a
precious legacy for today's Chinese workers, who should immerse
themselves in the establishment of the modern enterprise system in
China.
</P>
<P>
A State Council official noted that today's Chinese people
should learn something from the plain and frugal life of Lei Feng,
and resolutely fight against waste, extravagance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Youth League, China's leading youth
organization, has called on the country's youngsters to learn from
Lei Feng by offering more free community services, especially for
poor people and laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
A sociologist in Beijing commented that the "Lei Feng Spirit"
is an almost perfect combination of the traditional virtues of the
Chinese nation and Communist ideology, and therefore will have a
lasting impact on Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
"It can always have new definitions suited to the demands of
the times, and can be accepted by people living in different
periods or with different social statuses," he asserted.

BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Mercedes-Benz AG
resumed the delivery of its ill-fated A-Class subcompact car
Thursday after a three-month suspension to improve the car's
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
According to German press reports, 29 new A-Class cars were
delivered to their buyers in the Mercedes-Benz plant in Rastatt
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The A-Class, dubbed "Baby Benz," is the first-ever subcompact
car introduced by the German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz last
autumn. However, its delivery was suspended later last year after
several of them flipped over on sharp turns during safety tests.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz has since refitted more than 10,000 A-Class cars
with an electronic balancing system as well as lowered bodywork
and wider tires.

<HEADLINE> EU Exports to Slovakia Rise 50% Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union exports to
Slovakia rose an average 50 percent a year in the past four
years, reported Eurostat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exports came to 3,995,700,000 ECU in 1996, while the
figure in 1993 was only 1,221,300,000, said the EU statistical
agency.
</P>
<P>
Key EU exports to Slovakia in 1996 were machinery, mechanical
appliances, chemicals, and road vehicles which amounted to 31
percent of the EU exports in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's main EU trading partners are Germany, Austria, Italy,
France and Britain, which respectively account for 50 percent, 15
percent, 13 percent, 6 percent and 3 percent of the Slovakia-bound
EU exports.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said that the biggest export rise in the 1993-1996
period was registered in 1995, when exports rose by 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise is partially due to the EU enlargement program, though
Slovakia was still not on the list of the first batch of invitees.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union decided last December to invite Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Slovenia and Estonia to start
talks, scheduled for April, on admission to the EU.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Consider to End Dollar Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states are
considering to unlink their currencies from the U.S. dollar to
guard against persistent fluctuations and prevent further loss
in oil income, according to a senior Gulf official.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general trend in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states to detach the national currencies from the dollar and
consider linking them to a basket of world currencies to avoid
the negative effects on oil exports," Mohammed al Mulla,
secretary general of the GCC chambers of commerce and industry
was quoted by the UAE's Wam news as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The GCC countries are waiting for the creation of the single
European Union currency..., but this issue needs a political
decision although it is supported by the economists and other
concerned parties in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Kuwait, whose dinar is linked to a
basket of major world currencies, the currencies of the other
five GCC members are pegged to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC members, namely, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait, have discussed a joint
peg for their currencies as part of plans to intergrate their
economies and create a common market.
</P>
<P>
But they have failed to reach any agreement as some members
expressed reservations on unlinking their currencies from the
dollar on the grounds that it is the official price of oil and it
could be interpreted as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states export more than 12 million barrels of oil per
day, fetching them nearly two thirds of their total income.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that in the past years, the GCC states have
lost billions of dollars in oil revenues and higher import bills
because of the decline in the dollar against other major
currencies.

BAGHDAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction Thursday held a meeting with representatives of
the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, Iraq News Agency (INA)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the meeting was on the inspection of
chemical weapons. It failed to give more details.
</P>
<P>
The INA said 15 UNSCOM teams in charge of weapons inspection in
Iraq visited 14 sites today with full cooperation from the Iraqi
side. Three teams used helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on weapons inspection signed by Iraq with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad Monday granted the
UNSCOM complete and unconditioned freedom to inspect Iraqi
presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
So far, the UNSCOM has not inspected any of these palaces,
awaiting relevant instructions from the U.N. headquarters in New
York.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chief Richard Butler is expected to visit Baghdad early
next month for talks with Iraqi officials on the work of the U.N.

<HEADLINE> Annual Global Demand for Gold Up: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The demand for gold in
global market in 1997 increased by nine percent as compared with
the previous year to a record of 2,935 tons, a latest publication
by the Geneva-based World Gold Council (WGC) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the 21 key markets for gold consumption monitored by
the WGC, 10 of which accounted for over 100 tons of gold demand
in 1997, reached record levels during 1997, totaling 2,935 tons.
</P>
<P>
Of all the markets monitored, 13 showed continued growth, two
flat and six seeing some contraction in demand.
</P>
<P>
The most significant developments in gold demand during 1997
and the fourth quarter of the year in particular were India, the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
In India, the world's largest gold-consuming country, gold
demand in 1997 reached an all time high of 737 tons, an increase
of 229 tons or 45 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's gold demand in 1997 reached 213.8 tons, up three
percent compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the developing country markets, which covers India, China,
Southeast Asia, South Korea, Gulf States, Turkey, Brazil and
Mexico, annual demand for gold reached record levels in 1997,
totaling 2,129.2 tons, up 13 percent as compared with the
previous record set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the Gulf States reached record levels in 1997, up 21
percent to 142.2 tons and marked the third year of uninterrupted
growth.
</P>
<P>
Annual 1997 gold demand in Latin America (Brazil and Mexico)
reached the highest levels in over 10 years, up seven percent
compared with 1996 to 107 tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the developing markets, demand for
gold over the past 10 years has almost doubled, increasing from
1,088 tons in 1988 to 2,129 tons in 1997. The fastest growth has
been seen in India and the Middle East, where aggregate demand
has increased four fold over the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the WGC said, the Southeast Asia region's demand for
gold last year was down 26 percent from the record levels of
1996.
</P>
<P>
This largely reflects the adverse impact of the Asian
financial and currency crisis which manifested itself in July in
Thailand and subsequently widened to include Indonesia, Malaysia,
Korea and, to a lesser extent, Singapore by the final quarter,
WGC said.
</P>
<P>
In developed country markets, which covers Europe, the U.S.
and Japan, aggregate demand in 1997 totaled 806.3 tons, one
percent up compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
In terms of gold demand in Japan, the developed country
remained in the weak position. In 1997, its demand for gold fell
23 percent to 130.4 tons as its economy continued to struggle.

<HEADLINE> UK to Crack Down on Under-Age Lottery Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's regulators of the
national lottery Thursday ordered a crackdown on selling lottery
tickets to children under 16 as a survey showed that 5 percent
of the country's youths are gamblers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Camelot Corp, the consortium that operates
the lottery, was demanded by the Office of the National Lottery,
which regulates the lottery, to take tougher action against
under-age lottery ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a study which found that 549 young people
between the ages of 12 and 15, or about 5 percent of nearly 10,000
surveyed, had a problem with gambling.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, it is illegal to sell National Lottery tickets or
scratch cards to children under 16, but the survey found that
nearly half of those surveyed and those who had bought lottery
tickets are under 16 and some children use their lunch money or
even steal money to finance their gambling habit.
</P>
<P>
"Camelot has to shoulder its responsibilities, as do retailers
and parents," the Office of the National Lottery said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rejects Strike Without Warning Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has rejected the idea of launching an automatic military strike
against Iraq if it fails to honour the U.N.-Iraq weapons
inspection agreement signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Automatization (of a military strike) is not acceptable,"
Chirac said Thursday in the daily newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
"We think a military strike is a very serious gesture and it is
justified, as it would be made in the name of the international
community, that the U.N. Security Council make a debate on it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Iraq of "the most severe consequences" if it
fails to observe its agreement with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
"All options would be possible" if a violation of the
agreement is observed, the French president said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he would write another letter to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein urging him to respect his deal with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"I would tell him that all options remain open and possible,
notably the lifting of the sanctions and the re-integration of
Iraq into the international community, but that supposes that he
plays the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the military build-up by the United States in the
Gulf and the diplomatic efforts by France as two sides of one coin
which had the same object of achieving a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"We have never had a dispute with President Clinton. In the end,
we used two different means, but we had both of us the intention to
arrive at a peaceful conclusion," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that without the U.S. military build-up in the Gulf,
diplomatic efforts alone would not have allowed the
U.N. Secretary-General's mission to succeed.

<HEADLINE> Implementation of Ozone Treaties Hailed as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official said
the results of ozone treaties in the last 10 years had been
"startlingly good" and hailed by many as "a shining example for
solving other global environmental problems".
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here Wednesday, K.M. Sarma, Executive
Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat, noted that a total
consumption of about 1.1 million tons CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)
in 1986 had been reduced to 160,000 tons by 1996.
</P>
<P>
CFC is one of the Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) which are
controlled by ozone treaties like the Vienna Convention for the
protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CFC consumption in the developed countries
which stood at about one million tons in 1986 had been completely
phased out.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol allowed a grace period for developing
countries in implementing the control measures as more time will
be needed for them to obtain and introduce alternative ODS-free
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Sarma pointed out that the developing countries would begin
their implementation of their control measures by July 1999 and
phase-out thereafter.
</P>
<P>
According to atmospheric scientists, in Antarctic continent,
massive losses of ozone (ozone hole) discovered in 1985 increased
steadily to more than 20 million square kilometers in the early
1990s and has been varying between 20 and 25 million square
kilometers since.
</P>
<P>
From August to November last year, the area of the ozone hole
exceeded 24 million square kilometers, more than twice the area
of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that "the ozone layer will begin healing
only by the year 2000 and we can expect the healing to continue,
if the Protocol is fully implemented."
</P>
<P>
The full recovery of the ozone hole over Arctic will be
effected by the year 2050, they added.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries have phased out HBFCs by 1996 and are
committed to phasing out CFCs, Halons and Carbon Tetrachloride by
2010, HBFCs by 2040, and Methyl Chloroform and Methyl Bromide by
2015.
</P>
<P>
Talking about future challenges, Sarma noted, while the
protocol has been hailed as an extraordinary success so far,
there are still some challenges to be faced.
</P>
<P>
He said that the phase-out of Methyl Bromide is a difficult
issue because its alternatives are less easily available.
</P>
<P>
Methyl Bromide mainly used in soil fumigation and storage is
used only in a small number of countries and only for high value
crops.
</P>
<P>
According to Sarma, as of February 20, 1998, the Vienna
Convention had been ratified by 166 countries and the Montreal
Protocol by 165 countries.

<HEADLINE> Gold Industry to Shed 100,000 Jobs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Up to 100,000 workers in
the gold mining industry could be retrenched this year, the
National Union of Mine-workers (NUM) said at a two-day gold
summit which was opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the summit aimed at finding solutions to the mass job
losses in the industry, NUM President James Motlatsi said planned
down-sizing of gold mines would bring the number of people laid
off in the industry since 1987 to about 400,000, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from the country's major mining
companies, the government and the NUM, which accounts for almost
70 percent of the unionized work force in gold and coal mines in
the gold-rich country, are attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called by the union to try to halt job losses
in the industry which has been hit hard by the slumping gold
price. About 30,000 workers were laid off last year and in
January alone 500 workers were laid off each day.
</P>
<P>
Motlatsi said the crisis has national and international
dimensions. He said many people seemed to underscore mining and
gold's central role in South Africa's economy and therefore
failed to realize the crisis' impact on the country and the
region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The NUM called for a minimum 12-month moratorium on
retrenchments while solutions were being sought, the speedy
implementation of a social plan that would cater for retrenched
worker, state assistance to marginal mines and new regulations to
control retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chamber of Mines, the employers' organization of
the mining industry, said that there is little leeway at the
moment due to the sharp drop in the gold price. It said the key
issue is rather to alleviate the position of the laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
The gold mining industry is in a state of crisis worldwide
with the gold price at a 16-year low.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the largest gold producer in the world, with a
23 percent share of the world's total gold production in 1995.
Its gold exports accounted for 40 percent of the country's total
exports.

LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) - As a result of higher figures
for Russia, Argentina, China and Australia, the estimate for world
wheat production shows an increase of 5 m. to a record 608 m. tons
in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Trade is 1 m. higher at 96 m. tons, principally reflecting
higher estimated imports by Algeria and Libya. Forecast export
shipments by Canada are up 0.5 m. to 19.5 m. tons, International
Grains Council (IGC) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following substantial revisions to supply/demand data for
several countries world consumption is estimated 9 m. up on last
year at 590 m. tons.

<HEADLINE> Investors' Confidence Lowers in Zimbabwe: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Investors' confidence has
reached its lowest ebb since the introduction of economic reforms
by the government in 1991 following the recent economic and
social developments in Zimbabwe, First Banking Corporation said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its inaugural monthly economic commentary, the bank said
the economy was at crossroads with macro-economic instability at
its peak as inflation hovers above 20 percent and the budget
deficit projected to shoot to 12 percent of Gross Domestic
Product.
</P>
<P>
Volatility on the foreign exchange market threatened to "wipe
out commercial and industrial activities", while interest rates
ranged in the staggering regions of between 35 to 41 percent, the
bank added.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately this dime around, the predicament our economy
finds itself in is not caused by yet another drought, but by
lapses in economic policy formulation and management of
implementation processes," it said.
</P>
<P>
Not only foreign investors have lost confidence in Zimbabwe,
but local business people are also weighing the risks of setting
up ventures in high density suburbs following the recent food
riots which left a trail of destruction at shops in the areas,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said the launch of the second leg of economic
reforms, code-named Zimbabwean program for economic and social
transformation this year should mark the recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The new reform is primarily aimed at restoring macro-economic
stability by reducing government expenditure, interest rates,
inflation and volatility on the foreign exchange market.

solid.
</P>
<P>
While meeting a Chinese delegation led by Li Ying, vice
executive president of the China Federation of Literary and Art
Circles (CFLAC), King Birendra also said that China respects
sovereignty of Nepal, and Nepal appreciates assistance provided by
the Chinese government and its people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans to Discuss Land Issue in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers, academics
and representatives from the government will next month meet in
London to discuss the way forward on the land reform program, the
commercial farmers union said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Union Jerry Grant told the Zimbabwean
News Agency that they were determined to go forward with their
government colleagues on a similar basis and present a united
opinion on the land issue.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we need to do on an international conference
like this is to show divergency of opinion," Grant said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going there as one, and if we don't do this we would
do ourselves a lot of harm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Grant said the farmers felt they had gone a long way in trying
to meet the government's requirements on the reforms, and that
they had developed a program that they could discuss.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the government officials have accepted this as a
forward, although we have no clear mandate as yet," he said,
adding the union hoped this would be rationalized before the
London conference on March 11.
</P>
<P>
Last month farmers offered 1.5 million hectares of commercial
farm land that would be used for the settling of landless
peasants under the poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
But the government announced to compulsorily acquire more than
five million hectares of land from white farmers for the
resettlement.

<HEADLINE> Infants not Breastfed Risk Higher Mortality Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Infants who are not breastfed
are 14 times more likely to die from diarrhoea and three times
more likely to die from acute respiratory infections compared to
those who are breastfed, a Zambian official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Gender in Development Division at Cabinet Office
Auxilia Ponga said that lack of exclusive breastfeeding up to two
years and beyond is a significant cause of common preventable
infant and early childhood infections which result in
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
She told a mother support group convention that the full
potential of exclusive breastfeeding for the health of infants,
especially in the prevention of infections and for optimal birth
spacing has not been realized.
</P>
<P>
Some traditional practices and transcultural influences in the
urban setting especially among the affluent population, prevent
optimum breastfeeding practices, she said.
</P>
<P>
The convention is attended by representatives from mother
support systems from four provinces including Lusaka with a view
to sharing their experiences and coming up with viable
recommendations to improve the running of the support systems.
</P>
<P>
The mother support systems are community based child health
and growth promoters.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion Funny Kondolo from the National Food and
Nutrition Commission said that 46 health facilities have been
declared baby friendly, and 100 mother support systems have been
formed in seven of the all nine provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
This is a big achievement as the formation of a mother support
system is not an easy thing to do, she said.

MAPUTO, February 26 (Xinhua) The European Union is to send a

exporting to the European market is contaminated as reported.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican News Agency quoted Minister of Agriculture and
Fishery Carlos do Rosario as saying Thursday that if the team
prove the fish here is clean from cholera pollution as suspected
by some Europeans, EU would lift the ban on Mozambiqaue's fish
export.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said that the team is to arrive in Maputo in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
The team would also visit Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the
countries which have been banned from exporting fish to Europe
after cholera erupted in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the dispatch of the EU team is a result of
several talks between the Mozambican government and EU.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said that experts have reached a conclusion that the
fish from Mozambique is free from cholera contamination.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique loses about 600,000 U.S. Dollars each month after

</P>
<P>
According to ZIC's latest figures, of the 332 projects, 58 were

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lesotho Preparing for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho will dissolve
its parliament Friday, paving the way for the mountain kingdom's
third democratic general elections on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Thursday the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) would pass a motion calling for the dissolution
of parliament, after which the country's head of state, King
Letsie III, would by proclamation declare parliament dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Wednesday gave an
all-systems-go signal for the election, to be run by the IEC for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Voter registration ended Sunday and we expect the returns
tomorrow," IEC chairman Mafisa Sekara told the press Thursday in
the capital city of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of the election date, the IEC drew up
the election program, and plans to set up more than 2,400 polling
stations countrywide were progressing smoothly, said Sekara.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, helicopters will be used for the
hard-to-reach rural areas to ensure that voting goes smoothly
there as well.
</P>
<P>
LCD Deputy Secretary-general Monyane Moleleki said the thrust
of the party's election campaign would focus on social security,
job creation, education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the LCD was going into the election, confident that
the foundations for democracy had been laid.
</P>
<P>
The challenge Lesotho now faced was to entrench the gains made
in democratic governance over the past five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The LCD's former leader, 79-year-old Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle, has declared himself unavailable for re-election. He
recently declined re-election to the party leadership, citing
ill-health and old age.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, who filled the
position of party leader, and his deputy, Foreign Minister
Kelebone Maope, are expected to contest the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe poverty, unemployment, crime and
the government's intention to prevent religious groups from
playing a role in education will be among the issues opposition
parties will raise during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
They said poverty remained the number one problem in the
country, and with the continuing retrenchment of Lesotho mine
workers in South Africa, the situation would get worse.
</P>
<P>
The increasing theft of livestock was also expected to feature
high in the minds of the electorate. Cattle farming is the major
income earner of most rural population in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The analysts believe that the government's introduction of
legislation threatening the involvement of religious groupings in
education would result in religious issues affecting the poll.

<HEADLINE> Germany Set to Meet Euro Budget Deficit Target: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany is expected to announce
Friday a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1997, which is in line with the conditions set by the
European Union for joining the planned single European currency
euro, German government sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was expected to confirm the
budget deficit data at a press conference Friday, based on an
economic report to be submitted by the German Statistics Office,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty, a member state must bring its
1997 budget deficit to no more than 3 percent of GDP in order to
join the euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, euro criteria also require EU states to cut overall
national debt to no more than 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Germany is likely to overshoot the second
target slightly with an overall national debt of about 2.1 billion
marks (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or about 61 percent of
GDP. However, it is widely expected that this will not prevent
Germany from joining the euro from its start.
</P>
<P>
The final decision on the euro membership will be made by
leaders of the 15 EU member states in early May on the basis of
official convergence reports to be published by the European
Commission and the European Monetary Institute.

the atrocities in which the accused was involved," a special
report by Rwanda News Agency reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
During his trial, Karuranga -- a former driver and mechanic --
was assisted by a lawyer hired by "Avocats Sans Frontiers
(lawyers without borders)," a Belgian non-governmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
Karuranga had defended himself by claiming that he was badly
sick during the massacres in his home commune, rejecting all
charges.
</P>
<P>
During the massacres at Mbazi, he allegedly killed Tutsis who
had fled to his house and was seen driving others to the local
Mutunda soccer stadium to be killed.
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed at Mbazi have been estimated by
some human rights organizations at between 5,000 and 7,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The Butare court found Karuranga guilty of all charges and
sentenced him to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Both Karuranga and his lawyer maintain that he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Genocide trials in Rwandan courts started in late 1996 in the
eastern town of Kibungo.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Ministry of Justice, by
December 1997, 304 genocide suspects had been tried, with 108
death penalties, and 103 life sentences.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons waiting for trials.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has appointed Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka
commissioner of the U.N. Special Group on arms inspections in
Iraq, Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the group was included in the U.N.-Iraqi
memorandum of understanding signed during Annan's recent trip to
Iraq to resolve the crisis relating to arms inspections in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising senior diplomats appointed by Annan and
experts drawn from the U.N. Special Commission set up earlier to
dismantle arms of mass destruction in Iraq, is mandated to perform
inspections in eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, 60, received the appointment by Annan as U.N.
under-secretary-general for disarmament affairs in January.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala "will continue to be based in New York, and head the
Disarmament Department, but he will travel to Baghdad as
necessary," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Joining the Sri Lanka foreign service in 1965, Dhanapala has a
wide range of disarmament experience and held diplomatic
appointments in several countries between 1965 and 1983.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Purchase of Russian Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
Thursday denied press reports that it has signed a
20-million-U.S.-dollar deal to buy 40 Russian-made T-80U tanks.
</P>
<P>
"We deny a report that we have bought T-80 tanks. We had
bought T-80 tanks in 1995, which have upgraded our defense,"
government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the Cypriot government had signed the
deal to buy the tanks from an arms factory in the Siberian city of
Omsk in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of the Omsk National Assembly, Vladimir Varnavsky,
was quoted as saying that the Cypriot government had given a
three-million-dollar down payment for the tanks.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that any new arms deal would heighten
tension in Cyprus, with the delivery of Russian-made S-300
missiles set for late summer this year.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government signed an agreement with Russia early
1997 to purchase S-300 surface-to-air missiles to upgrade its
defense.
</P>
<P>
The deal angered Turkey which has threatened to strike the
missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Reduces Curfew Hours in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The west Africa peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has reduced the curfew hours in Sierra Leone to
between midnight and 6 a.m., a report reaching here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in view of the improved security in the
west Africa country, the report said, adding that the new curfew
duration has been confirmed by ECOMOG troops manning a checkpoint
in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG imposed a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. in early
February after it captured the Freetown peninsula from the
military junta of Major Johnny Paul Koromah.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG announced Wednesday that it had captured Sierra Leone's
second largest city Bo from troops loyal to Koromah, who has been
in hide after ECOMOG captured Freetown two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is now continuing in the interior areas of Sierra
Leone, including Kenema, a diamond-producing city in eastern part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
As ECOMOG is consolidating its control, outsted president
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who has been in exile in neighboring Guinea
since Koromah's coup last May, is expected to return to Sierra
Leone to resume office soon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Waives Sanctions Against Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
has decided to waive two-year-old sanctions against Colombia,
citing success made by the country in fighting narcotics, U.S.
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Waiver of the sanctions means that there will be fewer
impediments to U.S. assistance to Colombia's anti-drug efforts.
Colombia also will be spared economic penalties for the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be announced on the occasion that the State
Department releases a report in the afternoon on the
anti-narcotics efforts of 30 countries excluding the United States
itself.
</P>
<P>
U.S. administration officials said that most of the 30 were
expected to be "certified" as fully cooperating with U.S.
anti-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration is not certifying Colombia as fully
cooperating because officials believe that country's
anti-narcotics effort faces serious shortcomings, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Colombia will remain in the "decertified"
category. They added that the decision to waive the sanctions was
based partly on the emergence of the Colombian national police as
a highly effective counter-narcotics force.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Colombia has been ineligible for all
U.S. assistance except for humanitarian and counter-narcotics aid.
</P>
<P>
The certification process, first required by Congress in 1986,
is widely criticized by many countries, where it is seen as
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the certification process is a kind of interference
in their domestic affairs, the countries say the root cause of the
drug problem is insatiable U.S. demand.

<HEADLINE> Israel Appears Reluctant to Apologize Over Swiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel appeared Thursday
reluctant to officially apologize to Switzerland for the
espionage case that has chilled the otherwise friendly bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu confirmed that one agent of Israeli secret spy agency
Mossad is detained by Swiss police. He only said Israel is dealing
with the matter and would do everything needed to solve the
problem, but without giving further comments.
</P>
<P>
Following the news conference held in Swiss capital Bern by
Swiss judicial officials to detail the failed Mossad operation
last week, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur
 immediately convened a meeting of ministry officials to discuss
the implications of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said one of the assessments made at the meeting
was that the arrested Mossad agent would be put on speedy trial
and expelled by the Swiss authorities within weeks. Since Israeli
Ambassador to Switzerland has already expressed regret to Bern
over the affair last week, thus Israel tends not to offer official
apology.
</P>
<P>
But Swiss authorities are insisting that Israel must
officially apologize for the affair despite the traditional
friendly relations between the two countries. Bern charged Israel
for violating its sovereignty and the international law.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Switzerland originally preferred to solve
the case quietly through diplomatic channels, but the release of
the failed Mossad operation by Israeli media Wednesday prompted
Swiss government to publicize the case.
</P>
<P>
Swiss officials said five Mossad agents were caught when
trying to bug telephone lines in a private building in Bern on
February 19, but only one of the agents was detained. Arrest
warrants have been also issued to the other four agents, who are
believed to have already fled the country.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland denied that the Mossad agents tried to spy on
someone who has connections with Iran, Israel's arch enemy. But
others speculated that Mossad's target might be related to the
pro-Iran guerrilla forces Hezbollah (Party of God), which is
fighting a tough war against Israeli occupation of South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here expected the case to be settled
soon due to the friendly relations between Israel and
Switzerland. But what caused the highest concern among Israeli
leadership is the shocking disclosure of the highly secret
Mossad operation at a time when the agency is at its lowest
point following last September's failure to assassinate Hamas
leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The failed operation in Bern was believed to be the major
reason behind Mossad chief Danny Yatom's resignation Tuesday.
Yatom, who was held responsible for the Mashaal affair,
originally vowed to stay on his position. The disclosure of
the Bern operation was reportedly caused by serious inner split
within Mossad due to the pending reorganization.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials issued a strong call Thursday to
identify and apprehend those who released the Swiss espionage
operation to local media.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, Chairman of Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, said this issue touched upon the national
security of Israel. He demanded those within the Mossad who
was responsible be expelled immediately from the secret service.
</P>
<P>
Geodon Ezra, a lawmaker and former deputy chief of General
Security Service, said great damage had been caused by the
latest incident to Mossad and national security as well. He
believed that stricter scrutiny must be applied on Mossad itself
to ensure national security.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Netanyahu held consultations with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss choosing the new Mossad chief.
</P>
<P>
Accepting Yatom's resignation Tuesday, Netanyahu promised to
appoint a new chief within a week. Israel Radio reported
that the head of Army's Northern Command Amiram Levine, a
personal friend of Netanyahu's, now seems to be on the top
of the list of candidates.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Businessmen Urged to Do Business With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot businessmen were
urged Thursday to use the facilities and services on the island
to expand trade and economic relations between Cyprus and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Russia Today," Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Michael Michaelides said that since its
independence in 1960, Cyprus has always had close links with
Russia, which today are evident in many fields and in particular
the trade and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides described Russia as one of Cyprus' major trading
partners, saying that the volume of trade between the two
countries has expanded considerable over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The minister referred to the island's geographical location,
its excellent political and economic relations with its
neighbors, its highly developed socioeconomic structure, its
sophisticated banking system and the variety of services, which
make it an ideal center for business activities.
</P>
<P>
"The business contacts and experience of Cypriot businessmen,
coupled with their knowledge of the Russian market is an added
advantage for those who wish to use the island as a base for
penetrating this market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said that at the government level, the various
bilateral agreements Cyprus has signed with Russia provide a
framework for the strengthening of economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The existing potential for enhancing bilateral trade and
economic relations will be utilized, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar aims to explore the opportunities
available in doing business with Russia and the markets of the
region, as well as the facilities and services that Cyprus can
provide.

<HEADLINE> Germany Set to Meet Euro Budget Deficit Target:  Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany is expected to announce
Friday a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1997, which is in line with the conditions set by the
European Union for joining the planned single European currency
euro, German government sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was expected to confirm the
budget deficit data at a press conference Friday, based on an
economic report to be submitted by the German Statistics Office,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty, a member state must bring its
1997 budget deficit to no more than 3 percent of GDP in order to
join the euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, euro criteria also require EU states to cut overall
national debt to no more than 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Germany is likely to overshoot the second
target slightly with an overall national debt of about 2.1
trillion marks (1.2 trillion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or about 61
percent of GDP. However, it is widely expected that this will not
prevent Germany from joining the euro from its start.
</P>
<P>
The final decision on the euro membership will be made by
leaders of the 15 EU member states in early May on the basis of
official convergence reports to be published by the European
Commission and the European Monetary Institute.

<HEADLINE> British Envoy Arrives in Cyprus for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- British special envoy for
Cyprus David Hannay said here Thursday that he seeks to secure an
agreed approach regarding the participation of Turkish Cypriots in
the Cyprus-European Union (EU) accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at Larnaca airport upon his arrival for a
24-hour visit, during which he will meet President Glafcos
Clerides and hold talks with Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
to discuss a formula for Turkish Cypriot participation in EU
accession process.
</P>
<P>
Hannay told reporters that one of the main objectives he will
be pursuing in the Cyprus problem is to resume the peace process
initiated last June.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct talks last summer between
the Greek and Turkish communities' leaders failed to produce any
results following the refusal of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to continue the talks in protest against a decision of
the EU to start membership talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus-EU accession talks, the British envoy said
according to the Luxembourg EU summit conclusions his country,
holding the present EU presidency, "will have to see whether a
joint Cyprus negotiating team can be constituted for the accession
negotiations, due to start on March 31."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is one of the six countries which will start accession
negotiations with the EU in March.
</P>
<P>
"That is a task which has been given to the presidency and the
Commission," he said, adding that EU External Relations
Commissioner, Hans van den Broek, will be in Cyprus next week.
</P>
<P>
The British diplomat acknowledged that the participation of
the Turkish Cypriots is "a complex and sensitive subject."
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said he wants to hear the views of the
Cypriot government, "what is their idea in these matters and how
we can take this forward."
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed Turkish Cypriot participation in EU
membership talks, provided that the Turkish Cypriot side accepts
the principle of Cyprus' accession to the EU and the Turkish
Cypriot representatives are part of the Republic's negotiating
team.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has angrily denounced
the EU's decision on membership talks with the Cypriot
governnment and ordered suspension of bicommunal activities and
contacts with the Greek Cypriot side since last December in
retaliation for the EU's move.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy said he may not meet this time with Denktash,
who has repeatedly said that he will not see Hannay.
</P>
<P>
"I am rather saddened by that, particularly since the
explanation seems to me a rather inadequate one. But that's
his choice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Denktash refuses to meet Hannay because of British
government's decision last month to require visas for Turkish
Cypriots travelling to Britain.
</P>
<P>
London has explained that the measure was introduced after
increasing numbers of Turkish Cypriots asking for political
asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over 37 percent of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Bans Mercenary Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Assembly Thursday approved the Regulation of Foreign Military
Assistance Bill, which bans mercenary activities by South
Africans, the South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Joe Modise, who introduced the bill, said it
effectively precluded any South African citizen, resident or
company from participating as a combatant in armed conflict for
private gain, nationally or internationally.
</P>
<P>
It was not intended to obstruct anyone from rendering
legitimate, lawful military assistance, where such activity
constituted technical and training support to
democratically-elected governments by private companies or
individuals, Modise said.
</P>
<P>
All activities falling within the definition of foreign
military assistance would be regulated by permits issued via the
National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC).
</P>
<P>
However, humanitarian and civilian activities aimed at
relieving the plight of civilians in areas of armed conflict were
exempt from the permit process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, who is also chairman of
the NCACC, said it was necessary for South Africa to conduct its
foreign relations in ways which were constructive and helpful to
its neighbors and the world community.
</P>
<P>
Mercenary activities are obviously counter-productive to
nation-to-nation relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said South Africa had not been pushed into taking this
step because of foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
"We take orders not from foreign powers or interests, but from
our own conscience and sense of what is right and wrong."
</P>
<P>
"This measure, therefore, is constitutionally necessary, it is

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Chairman Welcomes Deal Between U.N. Chief, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler Thursday
welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding between the U.N. chief
and Iraq and viewed it as strengthening the work of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the executive chairman of the UNSCOM in
charge of dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq said,
"The Memorandum of Understanding between U.N. Secretary-General
and Iraq was done at a very high political level and any reading
of ignoring this would make a serious mistake."
</P>
<P>
"At that high political level, it gave us the expression of the
fundamental commitment that is set forth in the resolutions of the
Security Council. That is UNSCOM must have immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites in Iraq for the
purpose of carrying out its mandate. The Memorandum of
Understanding reaffirms and reiterates that commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, I welcome it and view it as
strengthening UNSCOM in the conduct of its work in Iraq. I want to
make clear that those arrangements entirely satisfied me and the
organization I lead. That will give us access to presidential
sites in Iraq which are now described accurately as the
consequences of the work of the U.N. mapping team," he added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials Thursday signed a cultural and scientific cooperation
agreement in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, 20 joint projects in the fields of
science, education and culture will be launched between Israeli
and Palestinian universities and academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The million-U.S.-dollar budget for the projects came from some
European countries. This was part of a special U.N. program aimed
at promoting cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director General of Israeli Foreign Ministry Uri Bennir
and Assistant Deputy Minister of PNA Planning and International
Cooperation Ministry Anis Al-Qaq took part in the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Bennir said that the signing of the agreement was a
confidence-building measure between the two sides under the
current political situation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have been stalled since
March last year over the extent of next Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Bennir noted that the stalemated Israeli and Palestinian
peace talks would have no bearing on the implementation of this
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Anis Al-Qaq also stressed that PNA President Yasser Arafat has
fully endorsed the cooperation with Israel and offered support to
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges U.S. to Help Revive Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday urged the United States to "rapidly take a strong
initiative" to push for a revival of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the very firm position taken by the United
States toward Iraq, even though we are no longer in the same
situation as the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, it seems to me that
the Americans should rapidly take a strong initiative to help
relaunch the peace process," said Chirac in an interview with the
daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi crisis also helped reflect the
"unbearable character of the current impasse of the peace process
for Arab opinions," because the Arabs accuse the United States of
adopting a double standard in its policy toward Iraq on the one
hand and the peace process on the other.
</P>
<P>
"France does not accept the programmed death of the peace
process. It should be imperatively saved and relaunched," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that it seems that the Americans, who have been
reluctant to let Europeans meddle in its mediation between Israel
and the Palestinians, are now more open to a European
participation.
</P>
<P>
"The United States needs to rally all the good wills to
relaunch the dynamic of peace in the respect of the agreements of
Oslo, Taba and Hebron," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without naming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Chirac accused him of "being on the way of achieving the killing
of the process" and called on him to learn from his predecessors
-- Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parliament OKs Sale of Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Assembly Thursday approved a bill, giving the green light to the
sale of a 20-percent share in the Airports Company to a strategic
equity partner, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the Airports Company Amendment Bill, Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj said it was a great step forward in the
government's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Five foreign operators are in the running for the 20-percent
share, and Maharaj said earlier this month that the selection of
the successful candidate was entering the final stages.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 20 percent, 10 percent of the company's
shares would be placed in the National Empowerment Fund, 10
percent would go to black empowerment investors and nine percent
to company staff.
</P>
<P>
The state, which at present is the sole shareholder, will hold
the remaining 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bill was read a second time with the support of all
parties except the Freedom Front, which said it was unhappy that
the cabinet, rather than parliament, would give the final
go-ahead for the transfer of shares under the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly also unanimously approved the South
African Maritime Safety Authority Bill, which creates a new
authority responsible for administering laws designed to ensure
safe and clean seas, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj said the new body would operate under a board
appointed by him, and would operate essentially on business
principles. The authority would be empowered to impose levies on
ships in South Africa's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to begin operating on April 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President on Promotion of Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Al
Bashir said Thursday that his government attaches great importance
to the promotion of relations with China and has taken measures
to provide all facilities to enhance Chinese investment in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Al Bashir made the remarks during his meeting with visiting
Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Ministry Ji Peiding, who
arrived here Wednesday for a visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ji will take part in the meetings of
the joint coordination and consultation committee of the Chinese
and Sudanese Foreign Ministries to examine ways and means to
develop and enhance ties of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Al Bashir praised China's stances toward regional and
international issues as well as China's support for the
Non-Aligned Movement and third world countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ji said that China, prompted by reciprocal
interests and strong bilateral historic ties, supported Sudan in
all political and economic fields and would not agree to the use
of sanctions or threats against Sudan on the grounds that they
would only lead to more sufferings of the people and would further
complicate problems.
</P>
<P>
Official Sudanese sources said that the two sides have held a
series of meetings to discuss regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed welcome to the agreement reached Monday
between U.N. chief Kofi Annan and Iraq on peacefully ending the
U.N.-Iraq crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail has announced
that this year will witness the formation of a joint
Sudanese-Chinese ministerial committee which will meet alternately
here and in Beijing. He further asserted the importance of the
exchange of visits at top levels between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Thursday that the international community should break the
isolation being lived by Iraq and Iran, on the condition that the
two countries respect international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We should go out of the `double containment' of Iraq and Iran
and I hope that each acts in order to let the conditions for their
double re-integration appear," said Chirac in an interview with
the daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Iraq is "very important country at the
frontier of the Arab world and the Persian world, and at the
epicenter of world energy (resource)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has an important role to play in the regional balance, a
role that it is not in a position to play. Therefore, we should
find the way to reintegrate Iraq in the international community...
In some way, it is the same for Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Iraq should play the game in a "clear and
uncontestable way," which is the only way for the lifting of
embargo on it and letting it return to the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Gold Sales Exaggerated: Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The levels of central
bank selling bandied about as the main reason for the current
poor gold prices were grossly exaggerated and not large enough to
destabilize the market, World Gold Council Manager George
Milling-Stanley said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only five central banks had off-loaded some of their reserves
in the past few years, South Africa Press Association (SAPA)
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australia, he said, had recently off-loaded 67 tons while
another 125 tons were sold by the Argentine Central Bank. The
Czech Central Bank had also recently sold about 25 tons.
</P>
<P>
"These sales last year were not even big enough to unbalance
the market," Milling-Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the U.S. Dollar and the record level of
spectacular short selling also contributed significantly to the
flat prices in as much as the uncertainties over central banks'
selling did.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected no massive European sales in the future
owing to the creation of a single currency under the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said annual demand shot up nine percent to a record 2,935
tons in 1997 following a strong fourth quarter performance which
saw demand go up five percent to a record 754 tons.
</P>
<P>
Milling-Stanley expressed concern at the increase in gold
theft from the mines.
</P>
<P>
"Knowledgeable people in the industry here (in South Africa)
estimated that about 50 tons of gold are stolen every year, about
10 percent of production. I find it very staggering. If it is
replicated worldwide then about one third of gold produced will
not reach its destination," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Pulp, Paper Industry Gripped By Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's pulp and paper
industry has been hit by a merger wave that analysts said will
last two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal-based Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's
largest newsprint maker, announced Wednesday to bid for Avenor
Inc. with 2 billion Canadian dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will "definitely kick-start" further moves, said independent
industry analyst John Duncanson in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Many Canadian producers are on the prowl for acquisitions as a
way to grow. One reason is that it's cheaper to buy existing mills
than to build new ones, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The potential for cutting costs is also significant. Since the
former Abitibi Price and Stone Consolidated merged last Spring,
they have exceeded their target of 100 million dollars in annual
savings and are headed for 200 million dollars by June.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canadian producers bought and sold each other's
assets tallying up more than 10 billion dollars in mergers and
acquisitions, a record high for the industry.
</P>
<P>
With several deals already announced or apparently on the
horizon, this year looks likely to be even busier, the newspaper
predicted.

<HEADLINE> New Technique May End Painful Vaccinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- American scientists said
Thursday that they have developed a technique that could lead to
needle-free vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
They have discovered that the toxin produced by the cholera
bacterium stimulates an immune response even when it is put on the
skin, and that it speeds up immune responses to any other foreign
protein added to it.
</P>
<P>
Tests on mice showed that when the diphtheria and tetanus
toxins, which were mixed with cholera toxin, were applied to the
surface of skin, the body can generate antibodies to diphtheria
and tetanus.
</P>
<P>
"The implications are that one could eliminate needles." said
researchers of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, in
Washington DC. Their work was published in the science journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
Trials on humans are due to start at the end of next month. If
all goes well the system could be available commercially within
the next five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
This technique could revolutionize vaccination programs in
developing countries, where disease can be spread because of the
lack of sterile needles.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Foreign Reserves Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's foreign reserves is
expected to reach 707.87 million U.S. Dollars by the end of June
this year, compared with 479.70 million and 626.59 million U.S.
Dollars at the same time of 1996 and 1997 respectively, a local
report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Damoni Kitabire, acting director of budget in Finance
Ministry, was quoted as saying that the increase is reflected by
the high GDP growth rate which averaged 6.5 percent over the last
ten fiscal years and 7.9 percent over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Kitabir also attributed the reserves growth to the granting to
Uganda of a multi-lateral debt relief under the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
The level of foreign exchange reserves at the Bank of Uganda
has been displaying strong growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
In line with the economic development, the exchange rate of
the country's currency is stable in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves of the country are at the level of an
approximately five months of its imports of goods and non-factor
services, Kitabire added. In 1992-1993 fiscal year, the reserves
of the country could only cover some two months imports.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Fiscal Position Deteriorating: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland Finance
Minister Themba Masuku on Thursday warned that the country's
fiscal position was deteriorating and was projected to worsen in
the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the estimates for the 1998/99 financial year during
his budget speech to parliament, Masuku said the appropriated
deficit was about 192.2 million Rand (38.4 million U.S. dollars),
which was 4.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Masuku as saying
that in view of an urgent need for sustainable growth in the
economy, his proposed budget was expansionary in order to address
infrastructure problems, worsening crime and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Masuku referred to political, economic and social reform
projects started during the 1996/97 financial year which still
needed govenment funding.
</P>
<P>
Masuku pointed out that economic growth depended on creating
an environment conducive to foreign and domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
"To this end a Swaziland investment promotion agency is to be
established shortly to streamline and improve procedures for
starting businesses in the kingdom and to promote Swaziland
internationally as a stable haven for investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Masuku also warned that strikes, which last year badly
affected mainly the agricultural sector and education, had far
reaching implications which scared away investors.
</P>
<P>
This also increased already high levels of unemployment and
lowered the standard of living for all.
</P>
<P>
Referring to population issues, Masuku said while Swaziland's
population declined to 2.7 percent, it still needed to be reduced
to avoid outstripping the economic growth rate.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Crack Down on Underground Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government plans
to crack down on the underground economy again, beginning with the
construction industry, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Revenue Canada, the federal tax-collecting agency, is expected
to begin consultations soon with construction industry so the
government can track down millions of dollars in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
As part of its new moves, the agency wants to make it mandatory
for companies dealing with contractors to report once a year
details on whom they hired and how much they paid.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry said it generally supports the effort
to make reporting mandatory, but wants to make sure that small and
medium-sized companies are not saddled with an expensive,
cumbersome system.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to measure the size of Canada's underground
economy, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
But Revenue Canada has managed to collect more than 2.3 billion
dollars (1.6 billion USD) in additional tax since the end of 1993,
only using its voluntary disclosure and audits.
</P>
<P>
Apart from construction, the agency has also identified serious
problems in the auto sales and repair industry, jewellery sales and
the hospitality industry.

WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has appointed Walter Mondale as special envoy to Indonesia to
press political and economic reforms there, the White House said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton held a
conference call on Indonesia with his senior economic advisers on
Thursday ad then spoke directly to Mondale, a former U.S. vice
president and ambassador to Japan. Clinton was in San Francisco to

</P>
<P>
Mondale is going to Indonesia on Saturday "to encourage both

<P>
Indonesia has faced political and economic unrest since it
sought international help last year to cope with the fallout of
the collapse of the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah currency remains under pressure and there
have been riots and looting in several provincial cities due to
concern about rising prices for food and fuel.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Legislation Shelved Again in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of a campaign
finance reform bill failed Thursday to break a Republican-led
filibuster -- the delaying tactics, leaving the measure dead for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 51-48, 9 votes short of the 60 needed to overcome
the filibuster. Shortly afterward, Majority Leader Trent Lott, a
Republican announced he would remove the measure from the floor
and begin debating unrelated legislation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote lawmakers supporters and opponents repeated
arguments on legislation designed to clean up the current
scandal-scarred system for financing political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ken Conrad, a Democrat, called the current funding
system "broken... rotten... corrupting" and said it ought to be
changed.
</P>
<P>
But Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the measure,
with limitations on certain types of campaign spending, would
violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan bill, drafted by Senators John McCain, a
Republican and Russell Feingold, a Democrat, would ban unregulated
so-called "soft money" -- donations to national political parties
coming from corporations, labor unions and individuals. It also
would impose fresh curbs on labor unions and on advertisements
that attack candidates but escape regulation because they are
presented as "issue ads" not covered by existing election law.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say changes in the current law are needed to avoid a
repetition of abuses in previous Presidential campaigns. Opponents
say the bill violates the free-speech guarantee in the First
Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Feingold said on Wednesday evening that support would grow
during the coming election season, as candidates are pressed to
give their commitments to support campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
But McConnell countered, "No one in the history of American
politics has ever won or lost a campaign on this issue."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Senate agreed to a compromise on the issue of
union dues and attack ads, that had been written by Senator
Olympia Snowe, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
Under her amendment, unions would be barred from using dues
money and corporations would be barred from using their own funds
to pay for loosely regulated "issue advertisements" used to attack
candidates within 60 days of an election. Other organizations
would be permitted to air such ads, subject to speedy disclosure.
</P>
<P>
That provision loosened restrictions on such advertising that
was contained in the original bill, but was significantly less
onerous for organized labor than a proposal that Republicans had
been advocating.
</P>
<P>
Even with that modification, the McCain-Feingold legislation
could not attract additional support from Republicans.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Merging of Securities Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Securities Co. Ltd
was set up here today as an important move to foster the merging
of securities companies into large groups.
</P>
<P>
With a total registered capital of 850 million yuan (about
102.4 million yuan), Beijing Securities evolved out of the former
Beijing Securities and Beijing Fiscal Securities companies,
becoming the seventh biggest securities company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Economists have hailed the move as another new and important
step to encourage the formation of big securities companies,
following the setting up of Eastern Securities and Union
Securities late last year, each with total assets of more than one
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 450 companies and institutions are engaged in the
securities brokerage business in China at the moment, with
total assets of nearly 160 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, economists say that Chinese securities companies,
large in number as they are, still lack a competitive edge on
the whole, and merger and reorganization should be encouraged
so as to foster large-scale and powerful securities brokerages.
</P>
<P>
As the major securities institution in Beijing, Beijing
Securities has reported good business in the past few years. It
has been the lead or supporting underwriter of 35 shares, and its
turnover of securities and treasury bonds last year was listed as
one of the highest among its peers.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Students in Beijing Observe Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Today, the Tibetan Lunar New
Year Day, students of the Tibet Secondary School in this Chinese
capital wore their national costume and held gatherings to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
Gaisang Digi, aged 15, said, "I observe two Spring Festivals in
Beijing. One is for the Han people and the other is for Tibetans."
</P>
<P>
She said, "I love both of the festivals, but I prefer the
Tibetan Lunar New Year."
</P>
<P>
Gaisang Digi, who comes from Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, is studying in the first grade of the school.
</P>
<P>
"I came to Beijing last October," she said. "The costume I am
wearing today was made by my mother. I only put it for festivals."
</P>
<P>
In the morning, all the teachers and students of the school
gathered in the auditorium to hold a New Year celebration
gathering.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, the students presented guests with hada
(pieces of white silk used as greeting gifts by Tibetans), and
then they gave performances.
</P>
<P>
Piao Rongting, principal of the school, said that, as the only
one of its kind in Beijing, the school was set up in 1987. It now
has 680 students, all of them are from the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Zholma, a 13 year-old-girl, left her family in Lhasa last
October and came to the school for preparatory courses.
</P>
<P>
She said, "With the festival approaching, I am homesick. I miss
my parents and the blue sky of my hometown.
</P>
<P>
``I have become accustomed to life at the school. I phoned my
parents the day before yesterday to say Happy New Year to them,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
About her future, she said with confidence: "I will devote
myself to my studies, and when I graduate from university I will
go back to Tibet to help with construction there."
</P>
<P>
Principal Piao said, "In the past decade 639 Tibetan students
have graduated from the school and studied in universities and
professional schools. All of them have returned to Tibet and found
influential positions there."

<HEADLINE> Safari Rally Starts off in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Carlos Sainz is
looking for a record-breaking 22nd world championship victory as
the Safari Rally started here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sainz, winner here six years ago, said on Friday that tyres
will play a crucial role as they did in 1997 when he was knocked
out by punctures.
</P>
<P>
Sainz said his Toyota Corolla is strong, but unproven in the
Safari, "the roads are rough and the Safari is shorter this time
but fast throughout."
</P>
<P>
Sainz said he expected tough challenge from Tommi Makinen,
winner of the Swedish Rally early in February in a Mitsubishi
Lancer, and British former world champion Colin McRae in a Subaru
Impreza.
</P>
<P>
Ford's leading challenger, three-time Safari champion Juha
Kankkunen, said the event has changed from a marathon to a
European-type event but it still retains its unique
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
This year's Safari is the shortest in the 46-year history of
the event with 1,234.44 kilometers of competitive distance divided
into 16 stages over three days.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 27 (Xinhua) -- At least three Israeli
soldiers were wounded in a series of raids launched by Lebanese
guerrillas in south Lebanon Friday afternoon, local radio Voice of
the People reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Lebanese security sources as saying the
battles broke out after 1:30 p.m. local time at several posts
manned by Israeli troops inside its occupied "security zone."
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Lebanese resistance said they have
taken control one of Israeli posts called Bei Ak-Kailab and hung
their flags over it after fierce exchange of missiles and mortars.
</P>
<P>
The assaults caused direct casualties, including deaths and
injuries, on the Israeli side, it added. But there is no
independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery bombarded a wide range of areas
north of the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The radio said its reporters witnessed a total of 15 missiles
and mortar shells landed on several nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, three Israeli soldiers were killed and
another three wounded in south Lebanon. The casualties raised to
four the number of Israeli soldiers killed this year, with 28
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 15-kilometer-wide security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to prevent Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attack on its north. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, is spearheading a war to oust Israeli occupation forces.

ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan
Thomas Simmons has urged Pakistani businessmen to establish trade
relations with India which may help reduce the political tension
and smoothen way for peace process between New Delhi and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of businessmen in Lahore Friday, Simmons
said the peace process in sub-continent cannot be initiated unless
Pakistan and India demonstrate courage and political will to
resolve all political issues including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen, under new world trade order, have a
significant role to play in setting the wheels in motion for
peace, the U.S. Ambassador was quoted by the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen apprised the U.S. envoy of the problems and
hurdles hampering trade process between Pakistan and India. They
believed that trade would not be possible unless the Kashmir
issue, which has been a bone of contention between the two
countries, is resolved.

<HEADLINE> Germany Meets Euro Budget Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany announced Friday that it
has met the budget deficit limit set for joining the planned
single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
According to data published by the German federal statistics
office, the 1997 German budget deficit amounted to 96.5 billion
marks (53 billion U.S. dollars), or 2.7 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), well below the 3 percent of GDP limit set by the
Maastricht Treaty for Euro membership.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that with Germany
meeting the most important requirement for participation in the
Euro, a firmer foundation had been laid for a stable common
currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics also showed that Germany had narrowly
missed a second Euro target for accumulated national debt.
</P>
<P>
With an overall national debt of 2.23 trillion marks (1.23
trillion dollars) in 1997, or 61.3 percent of GDP, Germany
overshot the Maastricht limit of 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say that this is unlikely to prevent Germany from
joining the Euro from the start in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has argued that the huge costs of its 1990 reunification
have artificially driven up its debt levels.
</P>
<P>
The final decision on which countries will be able to join the
Euro will be made by leaders of the 15 EU member states early May
on the basis of official convergence reports to be published by
the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute.

<HEADLINE>   U.S. Confirms 3.8 Percent Economic Growth In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy ended 1997
with a 3.9 percent growth rate, below the previously estimated 4.3
percent in the last quarter, but still in robust shape, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest new estimate of the fourth-quarter in the
gross domestic product (GDP) was was unchanged from the full year
at a nine-year high of 3.8 percent, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
At the same time inflation fell to the lowest rate in 32 years,
2 percent for all of 1997 and a scant 1.4 percent annual rate
during the last half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists expect Asian financial crisis will bring down
U.S. economic growth to about 2.5 percent this year, mainly by
expanding the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The latest official estimate of export growth was cut from 11.3
percent to 10 percent. Import growth was much stronger, 6.4
percent for the quarter versus 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors of the economy in the fourth quarter look much
the same in Friday's report as they did in last month's estimate.
Consumer spending, accounting for about two-thirds of economic
activity, grew at 3.1 percent instead of 3.2 percent. Housing
construction increased at 9.7 percent versus 10.4
percent. Business construction and investment in new equipment
declined at 3.5 percent instead of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The estimate of growth in government spending was cut from a
1.6 percent rate to 0.4 percent. The revision was mostly accounted
for by the sale of the Elk Hills naval petroleum reserve to
private businesses, which offset 800 million dollars in federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the gross domestic product, unadjusted
for inflation, at 8.08 trillion dollars for the whole of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Edible Oil Market to Reach Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The supply of edible oil on
the Chinese market will be basically balanced with the demand this
year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a survey report jointly released today by
the State Planning Commission and the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The country's edible oil consumption is estimated at 15
million tons this year, up 4.7 percent compared to last year,
and its domestic supply will be 7.25 million tons of
vegetable oil and 3.35 million tons of animal fat, in
addition to 1.15 tons of edible oil in inventory.
</P>
<P>
So, China has planned to import more than three million tons of
edible oil this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the improvement of per ha edible oil
output is the only way to raise the domestic supply, because the
country's rapid industrialization has inevitably resulted in a
decrease in arable land.
</P>
<P>
China will boost the output of rapeseeds and peanuts
by 10 million tons in next few years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far achieved a basic balance between the
supply and demand for edible oil, thanks to the good harvests in
the output of oil-bearing crops for several years running as well
as a stable consumption volume.
</P>
<P>
So, little fluctuation is expected in the edible oil price this
year, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> 23 Draft Decisions Adopted at Fourth Basel Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Basel
Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous
wastes and their disposal concluded in Malaysia Friday with 23
draft decisions unanimously agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of List A (for hazardous wastes) and List B (for
non-hazardous wastes) as new annexes to the Basel Convention was
among the 23 draft decisions unanimously agreed upon at the
conclusion of the five-day meeting held in Kuching, Sarawak, East
Malaysia, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of hazardous wastes worldwide on List A is
expected to be enforced within six months, the reports quoted
Fourth Basel Convention President Rosnani Ibarahim as saying.
</P>
<P>
Placed as List A under Article 1, Paragraph 1 (a) of the Basel
Convention are 45 categories of wastes considered as hazardous for
transboundary movement because of their ecotoxic nature while
those in List B are non-hazardous and therefore not subjected to
any of the provisions.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting also decided to leave Annex 7 unchanged until
amendment contained in decision 23/1 enters into force," she was
quoted as saying at a news conference there.
</P>
<P>
Under Annex 7, countries listed as members of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European
Union are prohibited by the Basel ban adopted in 1995 from
exporting hazardous wastes to non OECD developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said the convention would undertake a study to
analyze the implications of Annex 7 for which ratification from at
least three fourths of the 117 members would be needed for the ban
amendment.
</P>
<P>
So far 17 members have ratified it while Malaysia is in the
process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
Apart from pushing for enforcement of the ban worldwide, she
said the convention also aimed at upgrading the capacity of
countries particularly developing nations towards improving their
sound management of wastes.
</P>
<P>
They could not continue to depend on other countries in the
handling of their own wastes, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greenpeace Movement and Basel Action Network in
a joint news conference in Kuching had singled out the United
States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand for their "bad faith
negotiations", according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Movement spokesperson Kevin Stairs was quoted as
saying these OECD countries were acting in self-interest to keep
open the cheap option of sending their hazardous wastes to
industrializing countries for disposal and recycling.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on the ban amendment was opposed by the Arab
League countries, Tanzania, India, Latin America and other
countries which had already imposed the ban.
</P>
<P>
Stairs said the most significant threat to the ban amendment at
the convention came from Israel and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is expected to host the next conference which is
being sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Approves Education Perspective Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
approved a 15-year secondary education perspective plan, the
official RSS news agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to enhance the quality of secondary education,
ensure equal secondary education opportunities for all, enhance
internal and external efficiency of the students and promote
relevance of secondary education, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
A secondary education task force has been constituted and
authorized to formulate programs for teachers training, management
and physical facilities, work out policy for private schools and
develop syllabus and examination system so as to give final shape
to a five-year secondary education action plan.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will help the perspective plan for secondary
education, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on secondary education action plan held
here Friday, Secretary at the Education Ministry Khem Raj Regmi
stressed that policy for secondary education should focus on
developing practical education, increasing the number of women
teachers and girl students and improving the quality of education.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils Prudent Budget for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government
unveiled what was described by Singapore press as a prudent budget
for fiscal 1998-99 on Friday against a climate of slower growth as
the regional financial crisis continued to run its course.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget at Parliament on Friday afternoon,
Finance Minister Richard Hu said that the government revenues
would be stagnant and a tight lid would be kept on operational
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
However, capital expenditures would be increased in the key
areas of education, economic infrastructure and defense in order
to invest for the long term.
</P>
<P>
Estimated revenue collection is about 30 billion Singapore
dollars (about 18.4 billion U.S. dollars), while operating and
development expenditures are budgeted at 27 billion Singapore
dollars (about 16.56 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This would give an operating surplus of 2.7 billion Singapore
dollars (about 1.66 billion U.S. dollars) which would allow the
government to add to its reserves further, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister pointed out that the regional crisis had clearly
demonstrated the importance of such reserves especially for a
small and open economy like Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He also said that businesses and individuals must prepare
themselves for a period of slower growth and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
They must be ready to respond to unanticipated developments and
not flinch from tough measures where warranted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the best approach is to acknowledge the realities of
the situation, however adverse they might be.
</P>
<P>
"It will show to investors our preparedness to tackle problems
directly instead of evading them," the Minister emphasized. This
would add to confidence in Singaporeans and in Singapore, he said.

<HEADLINE> Wei Urges Deepening of Anti-Corruption Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities
must unswervingly persist in the drive to root out corruption, Wei
Jianxing, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), says
in an article in the latest issue of Qiushi (Seeking Truth)
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Party will persevere in following the guidelines and basic
principles of the anti-corruption drive which have been set forth
by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection will seek
both temporary and permanent solutions and go all out to obtain
new achievements in combating corruption, said Wei, also secretary
of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The Party will work hard to check the insidious growth of
corruption, focussing on its effect on economic development during
the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the work will be combined with the Party's
ideological construction work and the improvement of the Party
organization.
</P>
<P>
The supervision of Party leaders at all levels is also stressed
in the article.
</P>
<P>
Wei underscored the major tasks for his commission in
1998: Implementing the eight stipulations on curbing extravagance
and the squandering of money by officials; and investigating and
dealing accordingly with major corruption cases and punishing
corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Party will firmly check unhealthy tendencies in
certain business sectors which have aroused popular indignation.
</P>
<P>
Wei also pointed out the necessity of strengthening the
building of the discipline inspection and supervision
organizations themselves.

</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Commissioner for Narcotics Clarie Lo has been

<HEADLINE> IOM to Discuss Impact of Migration on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization
for Migration (IOM) and the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will hold a two-day meeting here next Monday to
discuss the impact of migration on the spread of HIV/AIDS and of
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
</P>
<P>
Representatives of concerned international agencies and
independent experts will look into the results of an IOM/UNAIDS
joint review of the current knowledge, policy and research on the
impact of migration on HIV/AIDS/STD.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 30 million people are living with
HIV/AIDS, and over 90 percent are in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the key contributory factors to the rapid spread of HIV
in many parts of the world is migration, the IOM stated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 million people worldwide who are either
refugees, displaced persons or migrants, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The unsettled lifestyle of these people, the disruption of
their family lives and stable relationships, and the loosening of
traditional social controls on their behavior mean that they
become particularly vulnerable to HIV infection," it said.
</P>
<P>
The IOM stressed that this situation is compounded by the fact
that many do not have ready access to health and social services
in their new environments.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS is jointly sponsored by the United Nations Children's
Fund, the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations
Population Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, and the
World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Gain Relative Calm: HKMA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Most Asian financial markets
"gained relative calm" in late January and early February, said a
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) publication, which was
released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a regular review of Hong Kong's external environment, the
publication noted, the seemingly Asian market stabilization
followed favorable announcements relating to the external debt
resolution in South Korea and Indonesia, and the removal of
exchange control in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Although the region still has many domestic economic problems
to solve before investors' confidence can be fully restored, there
are signs of some recovery, especially on the trade front," the
February 1998 HKMA Quarterly Bulletin noted.
</P>
<P>
By January, Thailand had seen five consecutive months of trade
surpluses. Malaysia also had trade surpluses since November
last year, said the Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of trade balance is believed to be one of the
five major factors contributing to the stabilization of the Asian
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
As the Quarterly claimed, there are signs that export recovery
and import compression will turn the current account deficit from
4.7 percent of GDP in 1996 to surplus within 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This would generate a net inflow of foreign exchange to
compensate for recent capital outflows, thus providing a
stabilizing influence on exchange rates," it said.
</P>
<P>
The second favorable factor should be China's robust economic
growth amid the regional turmoil and its unequivocal commitment
not to devalue its currency, Renminbi, which have "provided
much-needed stability" to the region.
</P>
<P>
The currency and financial stability on the Chinese mainland
should benefit Hong Kong, which is economically integrated with
the mainland, while going a longer way to help the region weather
the financial turmoil, the HKMA publication said.
</P>
<P>
Also bringing relief and boosting investors' confidence in the
region are factors such as the stability of the Japanese yen, the
international community's willingness to rollover credit for Asian
countries, and a greater determination by Asia to implement
reforms under International Monetary Fund conditionality, the
Quarterly added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland to Jointly Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A joint project has been
launched with the support of the Mozambican, Swazi and South
African governments to contain malaria and encourage economic
development in the border areas between the three countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association Friday,
Manager of the project, Andrew Zaloumis, said the initiative aims
to contain malaria in the region and therefore create a suitable
climate for the establishment of vibrant tourism and agricultural
industries in South Africa's northern Kwazulu-Natal, eastern
Swaziland and southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Recent research shows that the high rate of malaria in these
regions is one of the major causes of continued under-development
and poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project's malaria intervention program involves increased
service at the primary health-care level, the spraying of homes
and mosquito-breeding areas with environmentally sound
insecticide and using geographic information to generate data
about malaria hot spots in the region.
</P>
<P>
Successful malaria control programs are in place in both
Swaziland and South Africa. These activities would now be
replicated in Mozambique, Zaloumis said.
</P>
<P>
In Kwazulu-Natal, each malaria-affected magisterial district
has been divided into approximately 20 malaria control areas,
which were again sub-divided into 10 sections.
</P>
<P>
Each house within a section was numbered and given a green
card bearing the findings of surveillance personnel and when the
house was sprayed with insecticide.

<HEADLINE> Rival Parties in Cambodia Declare Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government on
Friday ordered its troops to implement a truce throughout the
country, hours after rival forces loyal to Prince Norodom
Ranariddh announced a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"To end the suffering of the Cambodian people and to prepare
for the upcoming general election in July 1998, from midnight
today, February 27, 1998, I call on the Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) loyal to me to declare a unilateral ceasefire over
Cambodia," Ranariddh said in a statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prince, however, said that the RCAF fully reserved the
right of self-defense if attacked by government forces.
</P>
<P>
"I also proposed the creation of a bipartisan, ad-hoc committee
to monitor the truce, with the assistance of international
observers," Ranariddh added.
</P>
<P>
The prince ordered the truce after Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen promised on Thursday that the government would declare a
ceasefire if its rivals did it first.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the promise in response to a proposal from the
Japanese government last week to solve the conflict between Hun
Sen's forces and those of his ousted co-premier Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo suggested that the ousted first prime minister cut off
any military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge and announce a
ceasefire immediately.
</P>
<P>
In return, the government would guarantee the prince's "safety
and security" and allow him to take part in the general election
scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Prince Ranariddh announced a truce on Friday, Ke
Kim Yan, chief of the RCAF General Staff, ordered the government
forces to observe a ceasefire throughout Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Exports, Imports Decline in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports
and imports all declined in January 1998 on a year-on-year basis,
according to a release published here Friday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Total exports in January decreased by 4.1 percent over a year
earlier to 114.4 billion HK dollars (14.7 billion U.S. dollars).
Re-exports went down slightly by 2.9 percent to 99.1 billion HK
dollars (12.7 billion U.S. dollars), while domestic exports slid
by 11 percent to 15.3 billion HK dollars (two billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total imports slumped by 14 percent from a year before to 113.2
billion HK dollars (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
A visible trade surplus of 1.2 billion HK dollars (154 million
U.S. dollars) was recorded in the first month this year, in
contrast to a deficit of 12.4 billion HK dollars (1.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman pointed out that the trade figures
usually displayed greater volatility in the first two months of
the year. He attributed the year-on-year declines in exports and
imports in January 1998 to the different timing of the Spring
Festival in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Another Upsurge of Lei Feng Enthusiasm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The largest exhibition ever on
the theme of the altruistic hero Lei Feng opened here today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of China's third large-scale drive to educate
people in the ideals of the humble soldier who dedicated himself
to serving society.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of Lei Feng reflects traditional Chinese virtues,"
Qiao Anshan, who was an army comrade of Lei Feng, told visitors to
the exhibition in the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In 1963 Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an inscription which read,
"Learn From Comrade Lei Feng". At the same time he called on all
the Chinese people to emulate Lei's altruism and stoicism. In 1986
senior leader Deng Xiaoping also referred to Lei when advocating
the need for ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Lei, who was born into a poor family in central China's Hunan
Province, always sacrificed his own interests in order to help
other people, including his comrades, neighbors and even complete
strangers.
</P>
<P>
The stumpy young man, whose name became a household word, lost
his life in an accident at the age of 22. Almost everyone in China
during the 1960s and 1970s knew the words of a song eulogizing him.
</P>
<P>
Qiao emerged into the limelight after the success of a film
called "Days without Lei Feng", which also featured himself.
</P>
<P>
"As social and economic progress brings us more and more
material goods," Qiao said, "We need the sincerity, kindness and
unselfishness of Lei Feng more and more."
</P>
<P>
Although they live some 30 years after Lei Feng died, Li Yan
and her classmates from Beijing's Yucai Primary School, who
visited the exhibition on the inaugural day, claimed that they are
familiar with stories about Lei.
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old Li said that she is a member of a voluntary
group set up to learn from Lei Feng at her school.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition has on display some of the hero's personal
articles, such as a pair of shabby socks, which Lei Feng darned
over and over again. There is also a notebook containing his
attempt to write a novel.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises and businesses have contacted the organizers
to arrange group visits. Furthermore, at least six foreign news
organizations sent reporters to today's exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tribal Refugee Issue Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The 12-year old Chakama problem
came to an end on Friday with all the remaining refugees returned
to their ancestral homeland in Bangladesh, reported the national
news agency BSS.
</P>
<P>
The last batch of 79 Chakama families with 475 refugees was
accepted by the Bangladesh authorities in a function held on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35,982 Chakama refugees have been repatriated to
their homeland in Chittagong Hill Tracks (CHT), about 300
kilometers southeast of Dhaka in the final phase of the
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 Bangladeshi tribals mostly Chakamas took shelters
in six camps in Tripura State of India since April 1986 following
an "inconducive situation" in the CHT areas, BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,250 Chakama refugees were repatriated in the first four
phases in February and June of 1994 and in March and November of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing shelters to the returnees, the Bangladesh
government assured that the 20-point economic and rehabilitation
agreement signed with the refugees on March 9 last year would be
fully implemented, BSS added.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Production Quota Proposed to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) I.B. Sudjana said here
Friday that OPEC's 27.5 million barrel per day (bpd) production
quota could be lowered to stabilize the price of oil in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Production quotas could be lowered if all oil ministers from
OPEC member countries approved, Sudjana, who is also Indonesia's
mines and energy minister, said.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a call made by Sudjana Thursday, which
urged OPEC to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the fall of
international crude oil prices and the impact of higher of Iraqi
oil production.
</P>
<P>
The price of Brent North Sea oil in London on Thursday was only
14.03 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
one of the reasons for the fall of oil prices was seemingly a
result of the united Nations' approval of a plan for Iraq to boost
its crude oil exports to 1.5 million bpd, up 900,000 bpd from
600,000 bpd for each six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the lower oil price is an oversupply caused
by diminished industrial demand for oil in nations experiencing
economic turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana said here on Friday that most OPEC member countries also
want higher oil prices so a plan to convene a meeting was fully
supported by all ministers.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting, the organization will optimize supervision over
the possibility of quota violations. An OPEC monitoring minister
will be necessary in the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana said on Thursday that if OPEC ministers agreed to meet,
the conference would be held in Vienna after Indonesia's
presidential election next month.

<HEADLINE> China To Set Up 100 Key National Scientific Research Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China has outlined a plan for
the establishment of 100 national research bodies and ten more
universities by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been submitted to the central authorities and has
gained initial approval from the top leadership, Lu Yongxiang,
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) revealed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty cross-disciplinary and cross-regional research centers
will also be set up, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Research staff for the 100 research bodies will be recruited on
a worldwide base, and the selected staff will be evaluated and
re-selected every four years.
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of evaluation and re-selection, said Lu,
about 20 percent of the original staff will become permanent
researchers.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, China's scientific research will reach
the standards of the moderately advanced countries by 2005, with
the number of Chinese scientific papers quoted by the
authoritative Science Citation Index, as well as the international
competitiveness of Chinese scientific and technological research,
ranking among the world's top ten.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China's GDP ranked seventh in the
world in 1996, while the international competitiveness of its
scientific and technological research was only 28th.
</P>
<P>
The plan incorporates a budget system for national scientific
research bodies, in which each body will submit an annual budget
application to the Finance Ministry. After examination by the
ministry and approval by the state legislature, the budget will be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
It has also suggested the establishment of councils in the
research institutes, whose members will consist of representatives
from the government, scientific and business circles, and the
institute itself. The councils will give advice on and appraisal
of major issues concerning the institutes.
</P>
<P>
CAS plans to select several research institutes as pilot ones
for the project, said Lu, adding that the candidates will include
CAS research institutes on life and material sciences in Shanghai,
on mathematics, earth sciences and the environment, and
information sciences in Beijing, the State Observatory, on
advanced materials and manufacturing in Shenyang, and on
biological resources and diversification in Kunming.
</P>
<P>
"The future CAS will become a national research center
focussing on national strategic goals and international frontier
sciences," Lu added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Finance Ministers to Discuss Use of Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The second ASEAN Finance
Ministers Meeting scheduled here for Saturday will discuss the
issue of using regional currencies in an intra-ASEAN trading
system, a Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the newest issue," Chairman of Thailand's delegation
Sommai Phasee said after attending the second ASEAN senior finance
officials meeting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not say whether the idea would be finalized
at Saturday's meeting, saying that "it is being studied and
debated."
</P>
<P>
The topic of using regional currencies in a trading system
between member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has yet to be finalized. The idea was proposed at
the ASEAN leaders meeting in Kuala Lumpur last December.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
So far, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have agreed to
initially test the innovative scheme.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies instead of the U.S.
dollar is one of the strategies which members of the 30-year-old
organization plan to implement to control the financial crisis in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the nine-member regional grouping will
also talk about general issues concerning the economic turmoil
that has swept the region since mid-July last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic woes, first triggered by the depreciation
of Thailand's baht in mid-1997, have led to significant
devaluation of many ASEAN currencies.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Indonesian Finance Ministry Dono
Iskandar Djojosubroto said the ministers will also discuss the
decisions of the special ASEAN Finance Ministerial Meeting on
December 1, 1997 in Kuala Lumpur, including the status of the
ASEAN surveillance mechanism and the establishment of a
surveillance secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Other agenda items include reports on the implementation of
Manila framework and the development of an Asian bond market, Dono
said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourism Industry Hit by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown in international
visitor arrivals from Asia is continuing to hit the Australian
tourism industry, threatening investor confidence and job security
across the nation, an Australian official said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Officer of the Tourism Task Force (TTF)
Christopher Brown said: "However, we draw some hope from the
continued attraction in the United States, Europe and New
Zealand."
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data provided by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) showed that the tourists from South Korea reduced
by about 80 percent in January to 6,500 compared with 30,800 in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The tourists from Thailand also dramatically dropped - falling
30 percent to 3,300 in January compared with 4,700 in the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourist numbers from Indonesia reduced marginally (one percent)
to 10100 in January from 10200 last January, which may have been
falsely boosted by holiday-makers coming to Australia during
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
TCA Managing Director Bruce Baird cautioned the full impact of
the Asian financial crisis could not be determined on December and
January figures alone, but would emerge over several months.
</P>
<P>
Although there was a slight increase in overall January visitor
arrivals from Southeast Asia, the boost was skewed by an influx of
tourists to Australia for Chinese New Year with tourists from
Singapore alone increasing 85 percent from 8600 to 15,900, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Manchurian Tigers to Return to Natural Habitat (1) </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
HARBIN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The first group of artificially
bred Manchurian tigers currently being tamed for life in the
wild are to be released to their natural habitat in heavily
forested mountain areas in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province by the year 2010, conservationists here said today.
</P>
<P>
The effort will represent the first known attempt to return
domesticated Manchurian tigers to the wild. The pioneering program
is considered to be of great importance for efforts to protect the
endangered species, which is on the list of the top 10 rare
animals on the verge of extinction worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency reporters visited the tiger-breeding base
in the Lesser Xinggang Mountains in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province. There they saw how deer are released into the tigers'
compound to get the artificially raised tigers to learn how to
hunt, an essential skill if they are to survive in their natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
Peter Jackson, a senior official from the World Conservation
Union, who has paid two visits to the base, said that this is the
best way to prepare the tigers for release into the wild.
</P>
<P>
The Manchurian tiger, which used to roam widely over northeast
China and Siberia, lives mainly on deer and wild boars.

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate felling of trees, illegal hunting and the
animal's solitary nature, which is not conducive to breeding in
large numbers, have resulted in reducing the Manchurian tiger
population to around 300 worldwide, according to conservationists.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 China banned the production of traditional medicines
which use tiger bones, in order to help protect Manchurian
tigers.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang base, the largest of its kind in the world,
was set up in 1986, and so far 108 Manchurian tigers
have been bred there.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xichen, an expert on Manchurian tiger breeding and
training, told Xinhua today that in 1989 the breeding center
started training the tigers for return to the wild.
</P>
<P>
Beef was replaced by live chickens and rabbits as food for the
tigers as the first step in stimulating their hunting instincts.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the one-million-sq-m Manchurian Tiger Park was set up
in this capital of Heilongjiang, as the largest of its kind in the
world. It is now home to 30 Manchurian tigers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dan, a tiger raiser at the park, said most of Manchurian
tigers in the park are capable of hunting herbivores and of living
in the open in temperatures of 30 degrees Centigrade below zero,
which makes them fit for life in the wild.
</P>
<P>
A 1,000-sq-km mountain area, a traditional haunt for Manchurian
tigers where deers and wild boars, which are the tiger's main
food, are increasing in large numbers, has been set aside for the
first batch of artificially raised tigers to be released.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xichen stressed that this is a long-term experiment. He
also called for international aid for the project.

<HEADLINE> Cableway Accident Caused by Pilot Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Marines panel
investigating the Italian cableway disaster that killed 20 people
last month has determined that the accident was caused by pilot
error, the U.S. NBC network reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Using data from AWACS radar planes, investigators have
determined the warplane was flying at about 120 meters-500 meters
below the minimum -- when it cut a cable line in the Dolomites
near Mount Cermis, sending 20 people plunging to their deaths on
the mountainside below.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and three crew members, who were flying out of the
U.S. Air Force base at Aviano, have refused to explain to
investigators why they were flying at such a low altitude, NBC
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Marines spokesperson Scott Campbell did not comment on
the report, saying the investigation is nearly complete.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rejects US Drug Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities Friday
rejected the United States drug policy on the country, saying that
the policy is "finger pointing and scapegoating".
</P>
<P>
An official information sheet, released here Friday, quoted the
authorities as saying, "It is no secret that the U.S. government
had failed totally in her campaign against narcotic drugs in the
U.S. today. The problem of her failure totally lies in her
inconsistent and unrealistic policy making and incorrect
implementation of methods."
</P>
<P>
"The bigger problem lies in her will to force other countries
to accept and implement the unsuccessful method she has been
applying," it said. "The biggest problem is making others
scapegoats to cover up her total failure in the fight against
narcotic drugs."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Thursday announced an annual anti-drug certification
decision, denying "certification outright" to four countries
including Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Myanmar high official Friday stressed at a
narcotic drug destruction ceremony, "The danger of narcotic drugs
is a problem of the whole of mankind and not just that of one
country. We are ready to cooperate with any country that has the
basic good will."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar destroyed at the function 5,759 kilograms of narcotic
drugs including 898 kilograms of heroin and 4,587 kilograms of
opium.

<HEADLINE> China Ready for Treasury Bond Redemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's related departments
have made ample preparations for redeeming treasury bonds due
this year, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the ministry has allocated sufficient
funds for this year's treasury bond redemption, which will begin
on March 1.
</P>
<P>
This year's amount of principal and interest repayment will be
the biggest ever in China's treasury bond history. Altogether six
kinds of bonds will be mature this year, while another five kinds
of bonds, though not mature, will need to pay the annual interests.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the redemption of treasury bonds will be
well organized through multi channels, with various special
services offered to provide convenience for bond holders.
</P>
<P>
The redemption of treasury bonds due last year has been
basically finished, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China began to issue treasury bonds in the early 1980s. Since
then a large amount of funds have been raised to support the
country's economic development. Successful redemption over the
past years has won a high credit for the country's treasury
bonds.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Send Team to Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 67th ordinary
session of Council of Ministers of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has decided to dispatch a ministerial delegation to
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at impressing upon the secessionists Anjouanese to
realize the importance of the territorial integrity and unity of
Comoros, and to make them continue with the OAU-brokered dialogue
as a way of finding a lasting solution to the problem, according
to a press release issued by the session on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The session made the decision when it deliberated on
situations in Comoros, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Somalia and Angola
under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister of Tanzania Jakaya
Mrisho Kikwete Thursday afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
The OAU session expressed grave concern over the situation in
Comoros especially with the intransigence and lack of cooperation
by Anjouanese and decided to dispatch the ministerial delegation
to Comoros composed of Tanzania, Egypt, Madagascar, Kenya,
Mozambique, Mauritius and South Africa as well as Zimbabwe as
current OAU chairman and Burkina Faso as incoming chairman.
</P>
<P>
The release said, the session agreed that if the Anjouanese
continued to defy international appeals, they should be isolated
and meanwhile the OAU should work in collaboration with the
countries in the region and the international community with a
view to preserving the territorial integrity and unity of
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The 67th ordinary session is expected to be concluded later
Friday after adoption of a series of resolutions on African
political and socio-economic issues.

<HEADLINE> Government Builds Closer Ties with Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top decision makers
have formed closer ties with their major think tank, the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Ru Xin, vice-president of CASS, told an academy information
work meeting here today that its scholars submitted hundreds of
reports last year to the central government concerning urgent
issues, including the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the
financial situation, reform of state enterprises, Sino-US summit
talks and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have studied the reports, giving instructions
concerning many of them, and government departments have been
applying CASS' research findings in their practical work.
</P>
<P>
"These reports touched on a variety of subjects and provided
fresh ideas for policy makers," said an official in charge of
information work at the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Ru said that the researchers always make the fullest
investigations before submitting their reports, which are
characterized by independence of thinking.
</P>
<P>
He added that an electronic information channel is to be set up
between CASS and the central government.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese officials' ignorance of experts'
suggestions resulted in great losses, he noted, adding that it was
only after the debut of the reform and opening policies 18 years
ago that officials began to pay attention to scholars' research
findings.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the National People's Congress have repeatedly
called for the establishment of more think tanks to help them cope
with complicated situations.
</P>
<P>
Late senior leader Deng Xiaoping was said to have considered a
sociologist's opinions before introducing reforms to the rural
areas, according to Ru.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin and other top leaders now always pay close
attention to social science researchers' opinions before making
important decisions, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to CASS, think tanks have been created in the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in several ministries and
commissions of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Almost Half of S. Africans Fear for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Most South Africans view
crime as a grave threat to the country's well-being and almost
half the population fear for their personal safety, according to
a Survey.
</P>
<P>
The Star daily Friday quoted the 1998 Crime Index released by
the Institute for Security Studies as showing that confidence in
the government's control over crime is declining and disapproval
of the government's handling of crime is growing, increasing the
non- or under-reporting of crime.
</P>
<P>
Public's confidence in the South African Police Service is
also decreasing, according to a survey conducted by the Human
Sciences Research Council, people generally trust the police
despite being dissatisfied with the service they received.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has the world's highest rape rate. On average,
more than 140 rapes and attempted rapes were reported every day
during the first nine months of 1997, Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi said. The number of actual rape cases
could be much higher since only about half of all rapes and
attempted rapes were reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, about 65 people were murdered per day on
average.
</P>
<P>
But the government said repeatedly that serious crimes have
been steadily declining since 1994, only to be scorned by
opposition parties and members of the public. President Nelson
Mandela said earlier this week that those who did not believe
crime was declining were disloyal to the country.

<HEADLINE> Three-Fold Increase in Number of Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese cities
has quadrupled to 666 since 1980, according to the latest
statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of construction Li Zhendong told Xinhua today
that China's urbanization is characterized by growth in
medium-sized and small cities, and an increasing number of cities
in central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The country's urbanization strategy aims at "controling the
number and scale of large and extra-large cities and to give
greater room to medium-sized and small cities as well as small
towns in rural areas," he noted, adding that it has begun to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
Of the 666 cities, 75 are extra-large and large cities, 192 are
medium-sized, and 399 are small.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the rapid urbanization has improved the
uneven distribution of cities in eastern, central, and western
parts of the country. These three regions now account for 44
percent, 37 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of the total
number of cities.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization in the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia
Hui autonomous regions and Hubei, Qinghai, Shanxi, Anhui, Henan and
Jiangxi provinces is faster than in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said the number of cities in China is expected
to reach 800 by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Macao Stamp Sales Income Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Macao stamps turned out to be
one of the hottest pieces in 1997 as the sales income more than
doubled that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lopes, director of the Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department, told a press conference Friday that
the gross income from stamp sales last year was estimated at more
than 150 million patacas (18.75 million U.S. dollars), more than
double the figure in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said further accounting is being conducted and final figure
will not be available until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Along with the fever for Hong Kong stamps around the handover
of Hong Kong, Macao stamps also turned out to be hot pieces for
many collectors in China's inland, Hong Kong and local Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the peak period, buyers queued up for hours to buy just two
sets of new stamps. Vendors sometimes immediately sold the
newly-bought stamps at double prices.
</P>
<P>
Macao last year issued 13 sets of stamps, each at less than two
million pieces. Most stamps feature traditional Chinese customs,
well-known Macao buildings or typical Macao costumes.
</P>
<P>
A set of new stamps featuring Macao gateways will be issued
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls on OPEC to Meet Over oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has called for an
emergency OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
meeting to address decreasing oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of Mines and Energy L.B. Sudjana
on Thursday after meeting with President Soeharto, a local
newspaper "The Jakarta Post" reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana, who is also OPEC president, called for the meeting
following a drop in oil prices this week.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark brent crude oil traded at 13.73 U.S. dollars per
barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange Tuesday, the
lowest level since April 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I must take the initiative on this because of the oil price
drop. We should think together about the market developments. If
they (OPEC ministers) want to meet, we will look for a solution,"
Sudjana said.
</P>
<P>
Some oil analysts blame the oversupply on OPEC which decided to
raise its production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels per day (bpd)
from 25.03 million bpd during its ministerial meeting last
November in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
But Sudjana said OPEC's current production ceiling was not too
high. The weak oil price was because of lower demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana said if OPEC ministers agreed to meet, the conference
would be held in Vienna after Indonesia's presidential election
next month.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The guidelines covering

<P>
This was announced by Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the

Friday Morning.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, which have been revised by the government after
public consultations last December, also include those for

</P>
<P>
Noting that a total of 23 written representations were received
during the public consultation exercise, Woo said all views
considered reasonable and practicable have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
"One major modification to the proposed guidelines published
last year concerns combined polling arrangements," he said,
adding: "All electors, except the 800 Election Committee members,
may cast their votes at a polling station near their homes on May
24."
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines, the nomination period for the
subsector elections will run from March 13 to 20. For the
Legislative Council general election, nomination will last from
April 9 to 24.
</P>
<P>
A candidate, and in the case of a geographical constituency
list one of the candidates, on the list should submit his
nomination paper in person to the relevant Returning Officer, Woo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said public spots will be located to the candidates for
displaying election advertisements with their mutual consent or by
the drawing of lots after nomination closes.
</P>
<P>
No display of election advertisements will be allowed on any
designated spots before the allocation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member Legislative Council will be made up of 20 to be
returned by geographical constituencies through direct election,
30 by functional constituencies and 10 by an 800-member Election
Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
form a national steering committee to address the millennium bug
problem, which all the computer systems will face in the year
2000, national English newspaper The Bangladesh Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government had already taken some measures to face the
problem, Bangladesh's Science and Technology Secretary Fazlur
Rahman told a meeting on the millennium bug in Dhaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the government, non-government organizations and
private sectors will be included in the committee, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary further said that the government would organize
workshops to create awareness on the problem.
</P>
<P>
When the year 1999 rolls over to the year 2000, all the
computerized systems that use last two digits to represent the
"year", will develop the problem, A.K.M. Shamsuddin, president of
the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of 2000, the computers will read 1900," he pointed
out.)
</P>
<P>
"It was due to the negligence of the computer designers and the
programmers who worked in the Information Technology between the
60s and 80s," he added.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem will have impact in the activities of
all the sectors including banking and financial institutions,
business houses and utility services if remedies were not taken
before the year 2000, a millennium program manager said, adding
that almost all the countries had already taken steps to avert the
problem.

HANOI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tram Duc

Evidence submitted to the courts showed that the syndicate had
smuggled 224 kilograms of heroin into Vietnam from Laos within
about three years.

policemen working for the Interior Ministry, border guards,

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's External Reserve Hits $8.1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has announced that its
external reserve has hit 8.1 billion U.S. Dollars by February 24,
an increase of 400 million Dollars from last year's 7.7 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Minister Anthony Ani Thursday in
the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to fears expressed by many economic watchers, the
minister said the current weak oil price will not have any
significant negative impact on the government's 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer with a daily production of
over two million barrels a day, has more than 80 percent of its
budget revenue from oil export.
</P>
<P>
The government's 1998 budget projects an average oil price of
17 Dollars a barrel, but as at most time of the first two months,
Nigeria's crude oil has been sold at a much lower price in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's external reserve has been in a steady rise since
last year, sparking off criticism that the government is
deliberately propping it up as a proof of its achievement whereas
the economy is actually in a serious stagnation.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Deploys More Troops on Namibian Border: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government
has deployed more troops along the Namibian border where two
disputed islands are located, South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted a Namibian newspaper as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Namibian Defense Minister Erikki Nghimtina
said the move appeared to be in line with Botswana's initial
plans of erecting camps manned by its troops every 10 kilometers
stretching from the disputed island of Situngu to the border
located near the Mahangu game reserve.
</P>
<P>
Nghimtina declined to reveal the number of troops, citing
security reasons, but said that during a recent visit to the area
he had verified initial reports that the Botswanan Defense Force
(BDF) had stationed more troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said that under normal circumstances Botswana should have
notified its neighbors, including Namibia, about its current
military activities to ensure that neighboring states are not
alarmed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports that the BDF had escalated its military
exercises and ground maneuvers within Botswana and that a number
of explosions were being heard from a remote area being used for
military activities, the minister said, "We also heard something
like that -- they are training and making some military
exercises."
</P>
<P>
He said his office was not informed that there are some
military activities going on in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
This is also creating suspicion as to why they are doing it,
he said, adding the latest developments had aroused concern in
the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana are disputing the ownership of Situngu
and Kasikili islands in the Chobe River. Despite diplomatic
efforts to resolve the twin issues, Botswana has reportedly
stationed troops on both islands.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach an agreement last month on
Botswanan troops' withdrawal from Situngu, but agreed to set up a
joint technical committee to look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
They are waiting for a ruling by the International Court of
Justice in The Hague over Kasikili, which is called Sedudu by
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Over 5700 kg Narcotic Drugs Burned in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities set
ablaze here on Friday a total of 5,759 kilograms of narcotic drugs
including 898 kg heroin and 4,587 kg opium.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th narcotic drug destruction ceremony, held by the
Myanmar Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), also
destroyed were 1,499 liters of phensedyl, 2.84 million tablets of
stimulant and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Police Colonel Soe Win, who is secretary of the CCDAC, stressed
at the ceremony that "the dangers of narcotic drugs is a problem
of the whole of mankind and not just that of one country, we are
ready to cooperate with any country that has the basic good will."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has cooperated with the United States in conducting
four opium yield surveys between 1993 and 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's ceremonial narcotic drug destruction began in 1990.
Up to the 12th occasion, over 24,174 kg drugs, including 2,859 kg
heroin and 16,499 kg of opium, have been set on fire.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the Myanmar authorities
destroyed 33 opium refineries in Shan State of the country in
1997, seizing a total of 1,401 kg heroin and 7,883 kg opium as
well as more than 5 million tablets of amphetamine stimulant
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Also during the year, a total of 5,361 persons were taken
action in connection with 3,864 drug-related cases.

<HEADLINE> Pak Unhappy with U.S. Opinion on Anti-drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday expressed
disappointment over the United States failure to appreciate its
extensive and far-reaching measures to curb drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"The government (of Pakistan) is fully satisfied at the counter
narcotics efforts made by our agencies," Foreign Office spokesman
said in responding to the U.S. criticism of its anti-narcotics
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government Thursday criticized Pakistan for its poor
record in the war on drugs during 1997 but granted it a sanctions
waiver for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said during 1997 Pakistan intensified its
anti-drug efforts and passed a comprehensive legislation in the
form of Control of Narcotics Substances Act 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to actively cooperate with a
number of international organizations and countries in the region
and beyond, including the U.S., to eliminate the scourge of drugs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said these efforts yielded concrete results in the form of
increased number of seizures, arrests, curbs on cultivation and
indictment of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The steps taken by the Pakistani government have been
appreciated by some international agencies, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. opinion will not affect Pakistan's
determination to continue combating drug-trafficking as the
country itself is a victim of drug smuggling, transit and
addiction, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
While promising that Pakistan will comply with its commitment
to eliminating the menace of drugs, he warned that reduction in
international assistance would inevitably impair his country's
efforts in this field.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also drew attention to the growing demand for
illicit drugs in the West. Unless these countries took strong
measures to ensure demand reduction, the fight against narcotics
would remain elusive, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Exporters Urged to Help Asian Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian exporters should
be prepared to bear some financial pain to help their Asian
customers weather their financial problems, Primary Industries and
Energy Minister John Anderson said Friday in Hobart, a southeast
port city in the country.
</P>
<P>
Anderson was speaking at a news conference after federal and
state agriculture ministers held wide-ranging discussions on the
Asian financial crisis, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to formally acknowledge the importance
for Australian federal and state governments and industry to
maintain "quality relationships" with their troubled Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the federal government had made a significant
contribution, especially through participating in three
International Monetary Fund economic aid packages.
</P>
<P>
Individual companies should help by talking to their customers,
trying to meet their needs and "sometimes wearing some financial
pain in terms of lower prices in recognition that there will be a
recovery."
</P>
<P>
"If you work with your customers through difficult times you
can stay together and prosper together in the longer term."
</P>
<P>
Anderson also said it was too early to assess fully the effect
of the crisis on Australian farmers, but Indonesia's problems
would have a "real impact" on the live cattle trade.
</P>
<P>
The wool industry had already suffered significant price
reductions because of slackening activity in countries like South
Korea and horticulture had been hit hard.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- France attained in 1997 the
deficit criterion for joining the European single currency euro,
said the official statistics bureau INSEE Friday.
</P>
<P>
The public deficit of France last year was reduced to 3 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP), the very criterion set for
joining the single currency, said the institution.
</P>
<P>
Its public debt amounted to 58 percent of the GDP last year,
also below the 60 percent criterion set by the European Union (EU)
in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
France's inflation rate in 1997 was 1.3 percent, below the 1.5
percent EU criterion, while its currency exchange rates and
banking interest rates had also attained the criteria, said INSEE.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany and Italy also announced that their public
deficits in 1997 had attained the criterions for joining the
European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The EU authorities will decide on May 2 the first wave of
countries to join the euro on January 1, 1999, on the basis of an
analysis of their public deficits, public debts, inflation rates,
currency exchange rates and banking interest rates.

COLOMBO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
designate officials and secretaries from ministries, departments,
provincial councils and corporations to help implement the
country's language policy, The Observer newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted officials of the Public Administration
Ministry as saying that the move was aimed at strengthening the
implementation of the nation's language policy.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of Sri Lanka says everybody has the rights to
communicate or do business with the government and receive replies
and other documents either in Sinhala, Tamil or English.
</P>
<P>
However, due to various reasons, certain obstacles have
hindered a smooth implementation of the country's language policy,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It listed a dearth of qualified staff, who are capable of
working in two languages, and a lack of institutional facilities
as the main obstacles.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Public Administration Ministry has instructed
relevant authorities to take appropriate steps in accordance with
the government decision.

MOSCOW, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, in his routine radio address Friday, called for support
to small-scale businesses in the country, the Interfax news agency

Yeltsin said that the essential conditions for development of
small-scale busnesses are correct taxation and industrial

<P>
The latest cabinet meeting had considered ways to improve the
government performance, he added.
</P>

The small-scale businesses, which contribute about 12 percent

substantial financial aid from the state, said the president.

PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The black series of the Israeli intelligence Mossad
continued one after another, as another of its operation misfired,
this time in Berne, the Swiss capital, where one Mossad agent was
arrested this week. Israel and Switzerland originally decided to
keep the affair secret, but the officials of Mossad broke the news
out in order to force the resignation of their chief.
</P>
<P>
-- A new wave of bloody violence is engulfing Albania eight
months after the legislative elections which allowed the former
Communists to resume power. The 313 Prison of Tirana, where about
30 supporters of ex-president Sali Berisha are jailed, Wednesday
night became the scene of a mutiny hours after police arrest of 80
people who demonstrated in central Tirana at the call of Berisha,
who wants a new legislative election and whose Democratic Party
continues to boycott the parliament despite Western aid promises.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday promised to
raise all social minimum aid allowances from January 1, 1999, for
 unemployed people. He said that the draft law on fighting social
exclusion will be presented to the National Assembly on March 25
and is expected to be approved in summer.
</P>
<P>
-- The regional election to be held on Sunday in Lower Saxon
of Germany will decide who will be the candidate of the opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD) to wrestle with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in the next general election. The SPD minister-president of
Lower Saxon, Gerhard Schroder, has put the jumping bar very high
by declaring that if he will not win more than 44 percent of the
votes, he will not run for the chancellery and give the SPD
candidacy to his rival, Oskar Lafontaine.

<HEADLINE> Trading Human Body Organs Illegal, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Any form of trade in human
organs is in direct violation of Chinese law and is strictly
prohibited by the Chinese Government, according to a leading
government official.
</P>
<P>
The official from south China's Hainan Province cited the
futility of creating fraudulent accusations and fabricating false
stories about the transplantation of organs removed from
prisoners executed in China.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the official responded
to a report in the American media that Wang Chengyong has been
charged with alledgedly attempting to sell in the United States
organs removed from executed Chinese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Wang served as a deputy chief of the
Hainan Branch No.2 Criminal and Procuratorial Division under the
Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate, in February
1996. However, he resigned in March that same year, citing the the
low income level
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate approved Wang's
resignation in June 1996, and issued a notice clearly
stating: "After his resignation, Wang Chengyong will no longer be
associated with the procuratorate in any form or manner."
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that Hainan's judicial departments have
had no contact with Wang since his resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Wang applied to the public security
department for an exit visa to visit relatives in Thailand during
the first half of 1996. He later departed the country carrying a
private business passport.
</P>
<P>
Medical institutions in Hainan Province have never engaged in
any form of cooperation with foreign counterparts and personnel in
the transplantation of human organs. The Hainan Provincial Customs
Office has never detected or had a due cause to investigate a case
involving the illegal shipment of human bodies to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official strongly reiterated that any form of trade in
human organs is strictly against related Chinese law and is
prohibited by the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
He continued by saying that for the purpose of treating sick
people and terminally ill patients, and in accordance with
relevant provisions, medical units, public health departments and
related research institutes are permitted to use organs of
executed prisoners under strict conditions in which either the
prisoner voluntarily affixes his or her signature or his or her
relatives grant approval to his or her organ donation.
</P>
<P>
However, all related donations are subject to strict
examinations and must obtain the approval by relevant public
health administrative and judicial departments, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
The same procedure applies to other Chinese citizens who
voluntarily donate their body organs to medical units, public
health departments or research institutes following their death.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that Harry Wu fabricated a rumor
several years ago that a Chinese hospital was transplanting the
kidneys of an executed prisoner. Surgeons were, in fact, operating
on a patient with severe heart disease. Later, Wu publicly
admitted that he had fabricated the report.
</P>
<P>
The official said he had noticed some media reports said that
"Harry Wu who disguised himself as a customer then mentioned of
his own accord trade in body organs of citizens on the Chinese
mainland," and "This could possibly be a trap."
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that it will be futile to create fraud by
fabricating stories regarding the transplantation of the body
organs of executed Chinese prisoners.

<HEADLINE> All Ninth NPC Deputies Hold Valid Qualifications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- All the 2,980 deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, were
elected in accordance with law, and have passed the qualifications
examination.
</P>
<P>
Meng Liankun, chairman of the Credentials Committee of the
Eighth NPC Standing Committee, made these remarks in a special
report to the Standing Committee's 30th meeting that opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Meng said the Ninth NPC deputies were elected from various
electoral units that include all provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
and the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and that all elections
were conducted in accordance with the Law on Elections of the
National People's Congress and of Local People's Congresses at All
Levels and other relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
"The examinations by our committee show that the elections of
all deputies to the Ninth NPC complied with the stipulations in
relevant laws, and that all the 2,980 deputies held valid
qualifications," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, because Liu Lit-for, a deputy from the Hong
Kong SAR, died of disease on January 29, there are currently 2,979
deputies to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hong Kong SAR could fill the vacancy left by
Liu's death through a by-election after the Ninth NPC Standing
Committee has made a decision.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the 34 electoral units across the
country all attached great importance to the election of the NPC
deputies, gave full play to democracy and strictly abode by the
relevant laws, and that the Ninth NPC deputies have a wide
representation of various social strata.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among the deputies, 563, or 18.89 percent
of the total, are workers and farmers, and there are 628
intellectuals and 988 officials, accounting for 21.07 and 33.16
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred and sixty deputies are members of the
non-Communist parties or patriotic personages without any party
affiliation, while 268 deputies come from the PLA. They
respectively account for 15.44 and 8.99 percent of the total
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR has contributed 36 deputies, making up 1.21
percent of the total, while 37 deputies are returned overseas
Chinese, accounting for 1.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 2,130 deputies who are members of the Communist Party
of China, 71.48 percent of the overall number. Four hundred and
twenty-eight deputies, or 14.36 percent of the total number of the
deputies, belong to all 55 ethnic minorities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of female deputies, who account for 21.81 percent of
all deputies, has risen to 650, 24 more than in the preceding
Eighth NPC.

<HEADLINE> Manila Searching for More Marcos Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said Friday that the government is now in the process of
searching for 60 more accounts of the late former president
Ferdinand Marcos which are reportedly stashed in some foreign
banks.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Presidential Commission on Good Government,
Ramos said it was believed that there are 60 more Marcos accounts
in Switzerland, Hong Kong and New York, in addition to the 500
million U.S. dollars earlier discovered in two Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he had directed the Philippine ambassador to
Switzerland to send letters "to Swiss banks to inquire about the
status of those accounts."
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also make similar requests to other
banks abroad, particularly in New York and Hong Kong where there
are presumably Marcos accounts.
</P>
<P>
"If the existence of the accounts is confirmed and there is
money left in them, then we will file a petition for the recovery
of the money," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Federal Supreme Court last month ordered the
immediate transfer of the 500 million dollars in Marcos wealth
deposited in two Swiss banks to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an investigating committee of the Philippine Senate
said it had uncovered another 60 Marcos accounts kept in
Switzerland, Hong Kong and New York. Some of these accounts are in
the name of foundations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been searching for Marcos' hidden
wealth since 1986. The Presidential Commission on Good Government
has already recovered about 750 million dollars worth of Marcos
assets, mostly in shares of stocks, real estate and art pieces.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was ousted in 1986 by a popular revolt and died in exile
in Hawaii in 1989. The government has accused Marcos of looting
billions of dollars from the economy during his 20-year rule.

<HEADLINE> California to Get Government Funds For El Nino Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
allocate an estimated 250 million U.S. dollars to California to
compensate the damage caused by El Nino, said officials from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty million dollars of the funds will be used to help repair
highways and buildings torn up by rain and mud slides, said James
Lee Witt, director of the agency, who is making a survey into the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino resulted in serious storms, floods and mudslides in
the state, having brought about approximately 500 million dollars
worth of property damage since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is now in California meeting with local
officials and citizens to discuss recovering efforts.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said that, in the first 24 days of
February, the Los Angeles civic center received 13.38 inches of
rain, the most since records started being kept in 1877.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is experiencing the wettest winter in this
century with a total rainfall of 38.48 inches received during this
season.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has already been blamed for 90 deaths across the United
States since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Joe Friday, chief analyst in the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said this figure surpasses the
death toll in the 1982-83 El Nino, which had been the strongest
one ever studied.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters have warned that the El Nino weather phenomenon
will continue raging through late spring.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino will remain the same for the next two to three months
at least," said Vernon Kousky, another senior chief analyst in
NOAA, adding that it was impossible to tell if the worst was over
or if even more violent weather is on the way.

JERUSALEM -- Three Israeli soldiers were killed and three

The delay of the announcement was due to Israel's military

until the families of the victimized soldiers are informed. The

region possible.
</P>

Chairman of the Nairobi Stock Exchange said Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the three member states of the East African
Cooperation (EAC) will be treated equally in the three stock

<P>
"In this respect, the forthcoming privatization issues of
Tanzania Breweries Limited of about 50 million U.S. Dollars will
be absorbed in the market and will be listed in the three stock
exchanges," said Mbaru.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreigners will now get involved in

government to allow foreign investors and brokers to acquire up
to 30 percent of existing brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, foreign brokers can set a 100-percent-owned
subsidiaries while in Tanzania, foreign brokers are not allowed.

The goal of the three stock exchanges is to establish, within
the auspices of the EAC, a single East African Stock Exchange
with three trading floors in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, challenges including political stability still
threaten the region, he warned, citing recent tribal clashes in
central Kenya.

Australian cents a clean kilogram (kg) while the western market
indicator finished at 589 cents per kg, down three cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange's national indicator remained

</P>
<P>
A total of 86,471 bales were offered at sales in Newcastle,
Melbourne and Fremantle, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
said in its weekly wool report.
</P>
<P>
The pass-in rate was 16.8 percent.

with the quantity on offer under current market circumstances,
even allowing for the high pass-in rate in Fremantle," the council

"The easing of tensions on the waterfront and a relatively
stable currency have helped to stabilize prices for the time

LUANDA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations deputy
representative in Angola Behrooz Sadry announced that the
demobilization work of the remanent soldiers of Angola's

</P>
<P>
He made the announcement to the press here on Thursday night

</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is difficult to accomplish all tasks of

</P>
<P>
Up to Thursday, only 5,700 of UNITA's 7,800 remnant
militiamen had been disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Sadry pledged that he will keep in touch with the government
and UNITA to ensure that those who are not demobilized by the
scheduled date get their due welfare.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative went on to announce that a meeting of
the joint commission will be held here Friday to discuss relevant
issues concerning the peace process, especially on recent

<HEADLINE> Three Million Women Have Abortions Annually in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- An estimated three million
women in sub-Saharan Africa have abortions each year, with
adolescents accounting for the largest proportion, the East
African Standard reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Kenya have the highest abortion rates in the
region, according to a report by the U.S.-based Population
Reference Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Illegal abortions are a major contributor to sub-Saharan
Africa's extremely high rate of maternal mortality, said Thomas
Goliber, the bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
"Some physicians, especially public health doctors, are poorly
paid in the region and some provide abortion services as a side
practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr Fred Sai, former president of the International Planned
Parenthood Federation, was quoted as saying that there are at
least 150,000 pregnancy-related deaths in Africa each year, a
quarter of them due to unsafely procured abortions.

Except in South Africa, abortion is illegal or severely
restricted in sub-Saharan Africa. The laws regulating pregnancy
termination in most states in the region were inherited from old
colonial times.
</P>
<P>
South Africa passed the Choice on Termination Bill in 1996,
which permits abortion on demand from the 12th week of pregnancy
and makes it easily available through the 20th week.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Demonstrations Possible in Zimbabwe: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrations which are
likely to result in breakdown of law and order or infringe on the
rights of the majority risk being banned, Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 151 graduating recruit constables, including 24
graduates from University of Zimbabwe, the minister said the core
duty of the police is to maintain law and order.
</P>
<P>
"Those engaged in a demonstration expect their right to
demonstrate and express their views while on the other hand,
those not participating expect the same officer to ensure that
their rights of free movement and security of person and property
are not interfered with by those demonstrating," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he asked the public to understand that "when we ban
demonstrations, we do so in the interests of the majority, whose
rights are likely to be impeded in the process."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Public Order and Security Bill
is seeking to clarify ambiguities in police powers and will
express when and how police should resort to use of force
including the use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
"On use of force, and in particular firearms, the police
currently operate on the basis of their own administrative
guidelines which besides having no force of law are fraught with
problems of their own," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for public support and cooperation in this regard.

<P>
JINAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has revoked the business licenses of 78 inefficient firms
established overseas, according to sources with the Shandong
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission.
</P>

said that more poorly managed firms established overseas will also
face closure.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, a success story in China's economic reform effort,

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Stop Aid to Ailing Gold Mines: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) --The South African
government has warned that it will not provide financial
assistance to ailing gold mines any longer.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gold summit here on Thursday, South African
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni said: "The gold mines have over the
years received numerous direct and indirect subsidies. Over the
years, these have been gradually reduced, and maybe justifiably
so."
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong to use tax-payers' money to artificially
maintain production and employment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the government would establish a gold crisis
committee in a bid to control down-scaling in the industry before
a proposed permanent mining commission was established.
</P>
<P>
He outlined a six-point government plan, which includes the
formation of a gold crisis committee aimed at assisting the trade
union and the Chamber of Mines in tackling the crisis, but not
replacing the parties' own efforts.
</P>
<P>
On the gold crisis committee, the minister said the government
was prepared to facilitate an urgent meeting on its composition
and terms.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest estimation by South Africa's National
Union of Mineworkers (NUM)#,51,000 gold mining workers lost their
jobs last year following sustained slump of the gold industry.
</P>
<P>
The NUM forecast a further fall in employment of between
50,000 and 100,000 this year.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers
were killed and three others wounded Thursday in South Lebanon
by Hezbollah (Party of God) forces, Israel Radio reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delay of the announcement was due to Israel's military
censorship which bans publicizing news of military casualties
until the families of the victimized soldiers are informed.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that the incident occurred Thursday
afternoon when a long-range mortar shell fired by Hezbollah
directly hit the Karkum outpost in the western sector of
Israeli-declared South Lebanon Security Zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli gunners retaliated the attack by blasting Hezbollah
targets north of the security zone. Reports from Lebanon said
at least two Hezbollah gunmen were killed in a separate clash
in the Wadi Saluki region.
</P>
<P>
The report said the killed soldiers were from the same
unit as Nikolai Rappaport, a Russian immigrant soldier killed
early the month during a clash with Hezbollah forces. Rappaport
was the first Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon this
year.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties brought to 4 the death toll of
Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon since the beginning of the
year. There has been an average 35 Israeli soldiers killed
annually in South Lebanon since Israel's establishment of the
security zone in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Spend More on Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Residents of this largest
economic center of China have increased their overall spending on
services.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's per capita expenditure on services grew an average
of 29.8 percent annually between 1992 and 1997, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
An analysis indicates that urban residents of Shanghai spent an
average 242.7 yuan on children's schooling and nursing costs, up
5.8-fold from that in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Personal communication spending has also expanded considerably
in Shanghai in recent years, averaging 182.7 yuan each person in
1997, or 2.7 times the 1992 figure. More than 65 percent of the
families in Shanghai now have telephones installed.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications spending has soared in tandem with a decline
in postal expenditures, a tendency experts say indicates that
telephone and beeper calls are replacing letters as the primary
means of communications among people.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that transportation spending has
increased in Shanghai as more people took subways and taxis. Per
person transportation outlay soared 2.16 times five years ago to
124.9 yuan last year, with taxi costs rocketing 10.4 times.
</P>
<P>
However, medical and health-care spending stood at 16.3 yuan
each person last year, down 45.9 percent from five years ago after
adjustments for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Per person spending on entertainment dropped by 64.6 percent
last year, the largest rate of decline among all items of
spending.

<HEADLINE> Harare Airport Provides Best Customer Service in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A survey on airline and
airport services showed that the Harare International Airport is
rated among the best in Africa in customer care.
</P>
<P>
Daily newspaper The Herald Friday quoted Tadesse Gessesse,
Consumers International regional director for Africa, as saying
here Thursday that results of the survey showed that most
airports were not friendly to passengers, while a lot of African
airlines needed to improve.
</P>
<P>
"The results were submitted to the ministers of transport in
Africa and have not been made public yet," he said, adding
"Although the Harare International Airport is old, it is pleasing
to note that it was rated among the best in terms of customer
handling."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in 13 countries and focused on
availability of transport from town, handling of customers by
customs and immigration officials, services provided at the
airport and by airlines.
</P>
<P>
According to Gessesse, Consumers International would soon
launch another survey which would focus on visa requirements and
operations of travel agents.
</P>
<P>
"We have received reports that Africans are being subjected to a
lot of harassment when they apply for a visa to visit European
countries. We want to establish how serious the problem is and look
at ways of solving it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana and Nigeria were worst affected when it
came to discrimination and harassment in relation to visa
applications, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to harassment of Africans and intend to launch
an aggressive campaign against it after the survey," Gessesse said.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese white-collar
professionals are playing a growing important role in
foreign-funded ventures in Guangzhou, with local residents
occupying over 50 percent of the total number of senior positions.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, has
more than 2,400 foreign-funded ventures and ranks third behind
Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Good educational backgrounds and wide-ranging knowledge of
China's business laws and procedures are the main factors enabling
local residents to replace foreigners in high-level management
positions in forein-funded enterprises, according to an official
with the Guangzhou Foreign Investment Service Company.
</P>
<P>
The company, which was set up 16 years ago, has placed over
60,000 Chinese professionals in the city's foreign-funded
ventures. A substantial portion of the aforementioned group work
as chief representatives for branches of foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Shield for Internet Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Thursday said Thursday in San Francisco that the Internet
should be shielded from any tax, at least for five years.
</P>
<P>
He called for the passage of the Internet Tax Act, which would
put up to a five-year moratorium on new local, state or federal
taxes on electronic commerce and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no special rates for the Internet, but we
can't allow unfair taxation to weigh it down and stunt the
development of the most promising new economic opportunity in
decades," Clinton told a high-tech conference.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. governors expressed their concern that untaxed sales
over the Internet will drain money from their budgets as consumers
shift purchases away from stores.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that during the moratorium, a bipartisan
commission would work with states to help devise a tax strategy
for dealing in the future with online transactions, which will not
drain money from states while allowing "the Internet to flourish."

<HEADLINE> China Removes Production Materials from State Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China removed rolled steel,
timber and cement from the list of products under direct state
planning in response to its recent achievements in establishing a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
However, petroleum, natural gas, refined oil products, coal and
automobiles remain under strict state control, according to the
State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Officials noted that alterations in the state plan allow
Chinese enterprises to gage production of specified products in
line with market supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
They pointed to China's long-standing use of state planning to
guide the production of strategic production materials subject in
short supply. However, the prevailing buyer's market for most
production materials has eliminated the need for state planning in
many areas.
</P>
<P>
Various experts contend that China will abolish all state
planning once the socialist market economy is fully operational.

<P>
HARARE, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale commercial farmers
in Zimbabwe have lost 21,000 head of cattle worth more than three
million U.S.Dollars as cattle rustling increased over the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
Between January 1, 1996 and December 31 last year, about
20,330 head of cattle were stolen while only 3,000 head were
recovered, ''The Herald''quoted Chairman of the Cattle producers'
Association Les Mallett as reporting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least 906 head of cattle had so far been stolen this year.
Of these 106 head of cattle were recovered, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Although increasing cases of stocktheft have continued to give
producers headaches, what had worried them most was poor rate of
revovery.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Thursday, Les Mallett said while increasing
cases of stocktheft impacted negatively on the restocking
exercise, the rate of recovery of stolen cattle was
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''Recovering cattle is also made difficult by the
fact that cattle can be moved overnight for long distances."
Mallett called on farmers to immediately report the missing
cattle to the police.
</P>
<P>
To reduce cattle rustling, the association, in
conjunction with the Zimbabwe Farmers' Union, will soon launch a
police station in which the police will be offered a monthly
award with an aim to make police officers working more hard
towards recovery of the stolen cattle, according to Mallett.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The last Boeing 707 airplane
to serve Chinese airlines has been removed from service in the
fleet of China Southwest Airlines based in Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The B2410 aircraft was one of 10 Boeing aircrafts ordered by
China in 1973, after then U.S. President Nixon visited China in
1972. It was the most advanced plane in the world at that time.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing airplane has served safely in China for 25 years on
the air route from Chengdu to Lhasa, capital of Tibet Autonomous
Region. The route over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "Roof of the
World," is one of the most difficult for airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The plane has flown nearly 25 million kilometers on the Lhasa
route, which means that it has flown the equivalent of going
around the Earth's equator more than 600 times.
</P>
<P>
The plane will soon fly to the Persian Gulf and become part of
the "Flying Dolphin Airlines" of the United Arab Emirates.

<P>
ZAGREB, Feb 26 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) wants to deepen cooperation with Slovenia,
said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek, Solana said Slovenia was an active member of the
Partnership for Peace program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1998 will be extremely important in terms of
collaboration with the Western military alliance because NATO will
conduct its most important military exercise in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian Press Agency quoted Drnovsek as describing
Thursday's talks with the secretary general as a "new phase" in
Slovenia's cooperation with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek reiterated Slovenia's wish to become a NATO member. A
confirmation of the country's efforts were given in the Madrid
declaration. In this perspective, the talks were very important,
added Drnovsek.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who is on his second visit to the country as NATO
chief, said that NATO considers Slovenia's cooperation "very
important."
</P>
<P>
He said an important "16 plus 1" meeting would take place in
Brussels in March as part of the dialogue between Slovenia and
NATO.

<HEADLINE> "Cultural Revolution" Items Draw Public Attention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- An oil painting about Mao
Zedong has been given the title of "national first class cultural
relic", which has drawn wide attention to items connected with the
"cultural revolution" (1966-1977).
</P>
<P>
The painting, "Chairman Mao on His Way to Anyuan", depicting
Mao Zedong in the early 1930s on his way to do revolutionary work at
a coal mine in east China's Jiangxi Province, was one of the most
popular oil paintings during that period.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 million copies of the painting were made and
distributed all over the country. The painting was also included
in school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Cultural Relics Bureau told Xinhua
today that relics of the "cultural revolution", such as badges,
paintings and the "little red book" of quotations from Mao, are
also part of the country's historic heritage, are of
educational significance and should not be lost to history.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Committee for Cultural Relics
Authentication And Preservation, this is the first time the
committee has pronounced an object produced after New China
was founded in 1949 to be a cultural relic.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chunhua, head of the Beijing Painting Studio, has claimed
to be the sole executor of the oil painting. However, his former
colleagues have claimed that the painting was collectively created.
</P>
<P>
The painting was first housed in the Museum of the Chinese
Revolution here, and then kept by Liu for 15 years. Two years ago,
the painting was sold to the Construction Bank of China at a price
of 5.5 million yuan (660,000 US dollars) at an auction.
</P>
<P>
"When I took the painting from the museum and during the 15
years when I kept it nobody told me it was a cultural relic,"
said Liu.

<P>
The company which conducted the auction also claimed not to
know that the painting was a cultural relic, and relics
departments raised no objection at the auction.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Chinese media, including the Chinese
Central Television (CCTV), have reported the quarrel over the
copyright of the painting, raising the question of how to deal
with relics of the "cultural revolution".
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, important cultural relics may not be
sold.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Cultural Relics Bureau said that his
department will take resolute measures to implement the law on
cultural relics protection.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China has indicated that it will
comply with the decisions made by related departments.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that, as a result of the unpleasant memories that
many Chinese people have about that decade of "cultural
revolution," relics have not been well protected, and many have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Objects that have witnessed significant historic events, such
as the first national flag flying over the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), should also be regarded as cultural
relics, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
They added that it is urgent to make laws and regulations on
the authentication and protection of relics of the "cultural
revolution".
</P>
<P>
"Those who lived through it cannot bear to look back on that
`decade of turmoil'. But our offspring have the right to know and
understand the special historical period through the relics," said
an expert.

GUANGZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The market for commodity
housing in this capital city of south China's Guangdong Province
has taken a favorable turn recently. However, office space is not
selling well, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 27.9 billion yuan-worth of commodity
housing, totaling 3.59 million sq m, were sold in 1997,
respectively up 64.7 percent and 77 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Deals on office buildings involved 233,000 sq m, down 5.48
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the increasing purchasing capacity to the
rapid growth of residents' annual incomes. Cuts in interest rates
by banks have also triggered residents' desire in apartment
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou branch of the China Construction Bank said it has
made efforts to increase housing loans from 710 million yuan in
1996 to three billion yuan last year.

FUZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tourism grew rapidly in east
China's Fujian province in the 1992-1997 period, with revenues
totalling 2.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 5.64 million overseas tourists visited the coastal
province during the period, up 16.74 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has led China for nine years in terms of both tourism
revenue and overseas travellers.

In 1996, tourism income accounted for 4.95 percent of the
province's gross domestic product. Tourism is one of the
province's most rapidly developing economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has abundant tourism resources, with nine state-level
and 19 provincial-level scenic zones that have a total area of
1,139 square kilometers. It also has more than 200 relic sites
under state or provincial protection.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian provincial government has put tourism high on its
agenda by granting favorable policies, opening new travel routes
and cooperating with other provinces in developing tourism
resources, all of which have met demands of various tourists.

<HEADLINE> Computerized Fruit Marketing Emerges in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Computer networks have replaced
yelling for street sales by orange growers in Jian'ou, a city to
the north of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The city is a major orange-growing area, harvesting 16,200 tons
of orange in 1997. In the past, this kind of harvest might not
lead to assured earnings at year's end because of inadequate
market information. Farmers were often forced to peddle their
fruit to all-comers at less than cost.
</P>
<P>
Then in June, the city government invested in a nonstaple
agricultural commodity circulation center that has been hooked up
with the national postal computer network as well as supply and
marketing cooperatives nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The center now serves as a price indicator providing up-to-date
prices on China's 26 major fruit markets as well as local
marketing messages. Last year, it coordinated more than 400 tons
of orange sales worth more than nine million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center also specialized in market surveys and
analyses to guide local orange farmers. So far, harvested oranges
in Jian'ou have all been sold out.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand has dropped sharply as a result of the Asian economic
crisis, the Wellington newspaper The Evening Post reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a National Bank survey as saying that
nationally, a net 24 percent of companies expect business
conditions to worsen, a massive 30-point turnaround from a survey
conducted last December, when 6 percent expected things to get
better.
</P>
<P>
It was also 60 points lower than four months ago when the
confidence stayed at its peak.
</P>
<P>
National Bank's chief economist Brendan O'Donovan attributed
the drastic change to the Asian factor.
</P>
<P>
He said every sector of the economy surveyed was now more
pessimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
Among the sectors, services fell 25 points, manufacturing 28
points, retail and construction 29 points each and agriculture 42
points.
</P>
<P>
One positive finding in the survey was that manufacturers'
exports were holding up well, O'Donovan said, adding that a net
25-percent increase is expected in exports in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Moscow to Boost Itself as Tourism Venue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The municipality of Moscow is
determined to turn the Russian capital city into an international
tourism center with an annual reception capacity of 40 million
people by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by the municipality on Wednesday said Moscow
received two million tourists in 1997, four times that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the attraction of Moscow is still less than that of
St. Petersburg which received 2.5 million tourists, of whom 1.9
million were foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The municipality said Russia's underdeveloped tourism, with a
share of less than 1 percent in the international tourism market,
did not match the country's vast territory and rich and varied
tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the extremely poor infrastructure for tourism and
service trade, there was the problem of high charges and poor
services in the present industry, the municipality said.

for providing food to primary school students in an effort to
boost school attendance, press reports said Friday.

</P>
<P>
The rest will be to cover direct and indirect costs for

<P>
The project is expected to increase the average daily
attendance rate to at least 80 percent of the initial enrollment
by providing snacks to 200,000 students in 10 of the 75 districts

<HEADLINE> Italian, Bulgarian Ministers Focus on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Italian and Bulgarian defense
ministers believe it necessary to enlarge the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to include the Eastern European states.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their concern over the situation in the Balkans
during their talks here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta told his Bulgarian
counterpart, Georgi Ananiev, that Italy sees the entry into NATO
of these states as "an essential element" for the stability in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Bulgarian defense minister said NATO should be
enlarged to include the Balkan states as it would help create "an
atmosphere of security and stability in the area."
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian army is adjusting itself with an eye to
eventually joining NATO, said Ananiev. He said the present
103,000-strong forces of Bulgaria should drop to around 70,000.
</P>
<P>
Ananiev said that Russia, which has good relations with NATO
member states, should not be worried about any enlargement of the
Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has a deep concern for what is going on
in the Balkans, and in Albania in particular.
</P>
<P>
Italy was also closely following the developments in Albania,
but the Italian government was not considering a military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
"Albania is not an anarchic country," said Andreatta. The
Albanian police force was capable of keeping control of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We will give the maximum support to the Albanian
government".
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also discussed bilateral trade ties
and military matters, including the possibility of holding joint
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said Italy paid great attention to military
cooperation with the Balkan countries and would give Bulgaria,
free of charge, its surplus military materials. These included 30
light trucks, 30 M113 troop transporting vehicles and two
derricks.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Observe This Century's Last Eclipse in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of scientists
from all over the world gathered in Jaque, a city in the eastern
part of Panama, to observe a total eclipse of the sun on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse, the last in this century that will be viewed from
the American continent, started at 11:09 and reached its maximum
point at 12:43 local time, when the moon completely covered the
sun.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States, Mexico, Panama, Canada,
Spain, Germany and South American countries, along with thousands
of curious observers, gathered in the Panamanian community to
witness the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
According to astronomer Alberto Villegas, the solar eclipse is
important because it provides an opportunity to observe the outer
corona of the sun. The sun's temperatures often reach two million
degrees centigrade and can not be seen under normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Panamanian experts, the next eclipse of the sun
will occur in this country in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In the past 3,000 years, nearly 5,000 solar eclipses have
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse was also observable in parts of Colombia and
Venezuela, as well as in some Caribbean islands.

BANGKOK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand expects to receive 3
billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct investment this year, The
Bangkok Post Friday quoted Bank of Thailand's Economic Research
Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the lower prices of domestic assets brought by the
depreciation of the baht and economic slowdown, foreign investors
are likely to pour more money into several sectors, the research
department said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors are shopping for possible investment deals
in many sectors of the economy. Besides the financial sector, some
have expressed interest in hotels and property," Suchada Kirakul,
deputy director of the department, said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the country will see an increase in foreign
direct investment in the second half of the year as financial
reform progresses.
</P>
<P>
The rise will spur economic growth, considering that
adjustment loans from international agencies such as the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank would be tapped by April, the

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's PML Expresses Dismay over ANP Departing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (N) expressed dismay Thursday over the breaking of alliance
by the Awami (People's) National Party (ANP).
</P>
<P>
"We are unhappy over departing of ways by the ANP," said Sheikh
Aftab Ahmed, chief whip of PML (N) in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"This extreme decision should have been avoided in the greater
national interest," Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ANP Thursday formally broke its nine-year-old political
alliance with the PML (N) following the categorical "No" by the
PML (N) leadership over the issue of renaming the North West
Frontier Province as Pukhtoonkhwa, which means a place where
Pushto-speaking people live.
</P>
<P>
Federal Minister for Communication Azam Khan Hoti and three
provincial ministers in the North West Frontier Province, who
belong to the ANP, have announced their resignations from their
posts in protest against the PML (N)'s rejection of the ANP
decision to rename the province to give it an ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
"In a democracy, such changes do take place, but it is a good
omen that the ruling PML (N), which was (the) founder of the
country, refused to compromise on national interests," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his party preferred to
sacrifice their political interests rather than accept a demand
which was contrary to the ideology and integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed regretted that the ANP broke its partnership with the PML
(N) on a provincial matter rather than a national issue.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed made it clear that there was no agreement between the ANP
and PML (N) for renaming the North West Frontier Province as
Pakhtoonkhwa. Even the overwhelming majority of the people were
not in favor of the demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
He did not agree to the contention that the departure of the
ANP would have a negative impact on the political environment, and
destabilize the provincial government of the PML (N).
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that in the backdrop of the long and
close association and cooperation between the two sides, every
effort ought to be made to ensure that no rancor or bitterness
affect the future relationship of parties or aggravate the
political environment in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A multilateral monitoring
system in the war against drugs could be established within the
United Nations during a meeting scheduled for June 8-10 in New
York, Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a current meeting of education ministers taking place in
the city of Merida on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Green said the
experience of some nations that have partially legalized the use
of drugs will be analyzed. The certification made by the United
States every year to combat drug trafficking, which is considered
a unilateral measure, will also be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral monitoring, the minister said, would be a
different mechanism from the certification of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Green said that her country does not accept pressure from
anybody. Mexico works with the United States and many other
countries, but only on the matter of exchanging information and in
training. No prosecutions or detentions were ever made at the
request of other countries, she added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects U.S. Certification Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government has
rejected the United States' anti-drug certification process, a
process the U.S. has implemented annually since 1986, the Foreign
Ministry announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a communique, which was released only
hours after Washington announced the certification of Mexico in
the war against drug, that the decision to combat drug
is based on the danger narcotics poses to national well-being and
security, not on pressure from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the Mexican government has repeated
its rejection of the certification process for its bias and for
being contrary to the spirit of international collaboration.
</P>
<P>
It said the Mexican government reiterates its commitment to
fight drug trafficking, while ignoring unilateral evaluations.
</P>
<P>
With respect to each other's sovereignty and international
commitments in mind, Mexico will continue its efforts to crack
down on international drug traffic, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Mexico will continue to beef up global, regional
and bilateral cooperation schemes in the war against
trans-national drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has proposed a special
session on drugs during the General Assembly of the United
Nations, which will convene in New York from June 8 to 10.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Plain Identified As Cradle of Civilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chengdu Plain in southwest
China's Sichuan Province was one of the places of origin of
ancient civilization on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
according to Chinese archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
They came to the conclusion after excavating the site of the
4,000-year-old city of Sandaoyan in Pixian County.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Sichuan was considered as having been a wild and
uncivilized place until 1986, when archaeologists excavated the
site of ancient city Sanxingdui, which dates back 2,300 years, near
Guang'an City.
</P>
<P>
The site of the ancient city of Sandaoyan, 650 m long and 500 m
wide, is so far the largest excavation of a pre-historic
civilization on the Chengdu Plain.
</P>
<P>
The excavated items include flat-bottomed jars, pottery
vessels, stone axes and chisels.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists also discovered the foundations of a large
building in the center of the city, which was probably a palace or
temple of some sort.
</P>
<P>
The 550-sq-m building is also regarded as the largest public
building dating back to pre-historic times.

YANGON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Tin Oo has stressed the vitality of quality
products for export to be able to compete in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a two-day seminar on industrial products
quality control here Thursday, Tin Oo, second secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), emphasized the
need for exports to meet the required quality and standard to
compete in the foreign markets, the official newspaper The New

</P>
<P>
Myanmar's traditional main export commodities include rice,
beans and pulses, rubber, fish and prawn, teak and hardwood and
base metal and ores.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo said the motto -- double production, buy local products
and leap forward with industrial strength -- is being featured in
the press for Myanmar people to strive for self-reliance and
practice thrift for national economic progress.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted SPDC Chairman Senior-General Than Shwe as saying
Myanmar will have to give priority to local products and buy
foreign goods only when there is no choice. He called for
uplifting the quality and standard of local products, increasing
sales and doubling production.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar exported 725 million
U.S. dollars' worth of goods in the first 10 months of 1997, up
from 598 million dollars in the same period of the previous year.
Its imports amounted to 1.96 billion dollars in the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
unearthed the remains of 19 buildings dating back 7,000 years in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The find has just been selected as one of China's top ten
archaeological finds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to China's leading archaeologists here, who made the
selection, the buildings were part of a tribal settlement.
</P>
<P>
The buildings, with half of their structures dug underground,
can be divided into two groups -- one in the shape of square with
one round corner, and the other irregular.
</P>
<P>
The former usually cover an area of 30-40 sq m, with a stone or
pottery stove inside; the latter, smaller than the former, are
thought to have been used for the storage of pottery and food.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that most of the remains are well preserved, and
some even have pottery or stone wares placed in their original
positions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana said
Thursday that NATO's expansion is not directed at Russia and will
not create a new dividing line in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit, made
the remarks during a meeting of the foreign relations and defense
sections of the National Assembly of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO hopes to carry out a dialogue with Russia on
military and security issues and believes the two sides will
ultimately cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Justifying NATO's expansion, Solana said the expansion is not
only an important part of the European integration process, but
also the basis upon which NATO's reform plans rest.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have been invited to
join NATO in 1999 when the alliance celebrates its 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
NATO will not close its doors to countries applying for
membership who meet the standards of the bloc. The concept that
NATO will end its expansion process after the admission of current
applications for new membership is wrong, Solana stressed.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Hungarian leaders, including President Arpad
Goncz and Prime Minister Gyula Horn, Solana expressed satisfaction
with ties between NATO and Hungary. He said Hungary is the "most
stable" nation in Central Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Paddy Field Among Top Ten Archaeological Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A paddy field dating back some
6,000 years and believed to be the world's oldest found so
far has been selected as one of China's top ten archaeological
finds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The field, in Lixian County in central China's Hunan Province,
is evidence that China was the cradle of rice cultivation in the
world, said leading archaeologists here, who made the selection.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the field was originally U-shaped,
and included irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The earth in the field, grey-green and 40 cm thick, contained a
large amount of fossilized rice when it was first excavated.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the field was found under the eastern wall of
the site of Chengtoushan City, which, dating back 6,000 years, is
believed to be the oldest city site ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
The other nine top archeological finds last year were: a cave
in the Qinling Mountains with some 35,000 pieces of stoneware
dating back some 360,000 years; well-preserved building remains
from 7,700 years ago found in Shandong Province; a midden dating
back more than 5,000 years in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region; a neolithic site in Hong Kong; an earlier city site among
the remains of a city of the Shang Dynasty (16-11th centuries
B.C.); a hoard of bronze ware from some 2,500 years ago in Henan
Province; the site of an imperial summer resort of the Qin Dynasty
(221-206 B.C.); a ducal stone structure from some 2,000 years ago
in Guangzhou City; and a group of tombs nearly 2,000 years old on the
route of the Ancient Silk Road.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Hong Kong Residents Liked to Pull Teeth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- People living in Hong Kong
some 4,000 years ago had a propensity for pulling teeth, according
to an archeological find.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Chinese archeologists unearthed 20 tombs dating
back to the Late Stone Age. The find has just been selected as one
of China's top 10 archeological finds in 1997 by leading
archeologists here.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, a great number of people lived on the
coast of Hong Kong some 4,000 years ago. From the skeletons
remaining in 15 tombs, the experts deduced that the locals were
short in stature, had a wide mouth and had a custom of pulling at
least one tooth.
</P>
<P>
"Why the people had such a custom is yet to be researched,"
archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
The experts value the excavation also because it was the first
conducted in Hong Kong since it was returned to the motherland and
that it was the largest ever conducted there.
</P>
<P>
The other nine top archeological finds last year were: a cave in
the Qinling Mountains with some 35,000 pieces of stoneware dating
back some 360,000 years, well-preserved building remains from

5,000-year-old shell mound site in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, the world's oldest paddy field found in Hunan Province, an
earlier city site among the remains of a city of the Shang Dynasty
(16th-11th Century B.C.), a storage of bronzeware from 2,500 years
ago in Henan Province, the site of an imperial summer resort of
the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), a ducal stone structure from 2,000
years ago in Guangzhou city, and a nearly 2,000-year-old tomb site
on the route of the Ancient Silk Road.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Taxation Office is preparing a major
crackdown on high and average income earners who are repackaging
their salaries to avoid tax. The tax office is also investigating
non-profit groups such as schools, churches and sporting clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of potentially preventable deaths and injuries are
continuing to occur in Australian hospitals because there is not a
strong enough national push to improve health care safety, experts
warn.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Adults convicted of selling drugs to children will face life
jail terms, under tough new national proposals in a federal

all governments must join forces to combat the devastating impact
of illegal drugs on Australian society.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Corporate Australia has shrugged off many of its concerns
about the Asian crisis and now plans to significantly boost

<HEADLINE> Largest Dam Project On Yellow River Installing Key Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Xiaolangdi
Dam Project, the largest of its kind on the Yellow River, is
entering the phase of installing mechanical and electrical
equipment, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is an important turning point of the project's
construction following the river's blocking last October, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a turning point of the construction, the second in scale
only to the mammoth Three Gorges Dam Project on the Yangtze River,
will lay a solid foundation for completing the first group of the
project's turbine units, scheduled to be put into operation next
year," the paper quoted Cao Zhengqi, chief engineer in charge of
Xiaolangdi project, as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far this month, major preparations for the installation have
been completed smoothly. They include excavating the earth at the
power station and pouring concrete.
</P>
<P>
The power station will consist of six turbine generators of
300,000 kw each. The station's expected annual energy output will
be 5.1 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
All the work on the underground powerhouse has been completed
and the quality has met standards, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work on the project's other key items including the
main dam itself and the flood and sediment tunnels is going
smoothly to make sure the dam and the tunnels will be safe during
this summer's flood.
</P>
<P>
Work on the dam's concrete cut-off wall, with a maximum depth
of 82 meters, is expected to be completed ahead of this summer's
flood season.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers' Role Enhanced in Chinese Courts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law experts share the view that all these major changes will
lead to a greater demand for lawyers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China's contingent of lawyers has been expanding rapidly over
the past few years. Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show
that the number of Chinese lawyers surged to 170,000 at the end of
1997, from 50,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 8,000 law firms, whose advocates defended
140,000 criminal cases in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Xu Longchao, a lawyer with the Junhui Law Firm in Tianjin, said
that the new Criminal Procedure Law has given Chinese lawyers more
room to display their forensic skills.
</P>
<P>
"There are more confrontations and debates between the
prosecutor and the defending attorney nowadays, as the judge has
been placed outside the fray," he said, adding that the defendants
and their lawyers are now given more opportunities to make
statements in court.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that judges are paying increasing attention to
lawyers' advice, and that he himself has successfully defended
several clients.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Saijun, an official with the Ministry of Justice, pointed
out that lawyers re-emerged in China only in 1979, and that before
the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Law, lawyers were denied
access to both the defendants and their case files until seven
days before the trial.
</P>
<P>
"The Law on Lawyers and the amended Criminal Procedure Law have
laid a solid legal foundation for enhancing the role of defense
attorneys," he said. "This is really another major example of
progress in China's human rights protection."

<HEADLINE> Lawyers' Role Enhanced in Chinese Courts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Major reforms to the system of
criminal procedure in the past year have greatly enhanced the role
of Chinese lawyers in the courts and made the lawyer's profession
a more attractive one in China.
</P>
<P>
According to local law experts, the growing eminence of Chinese
lawyers conveys a message that this most populous country in the
world has made further progress in its protection of citizens'
rights by law.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, made major amendments to the country's Criminal
Procedure Law. The amended law enhances lawyers' involvement
in the criminal process by allowing them to provide legal
service for suspects during the investigation of a criminal case
and granting them greater power in court trials.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the supreme bodies of legislation, trial and justice
in China also jointly issued supplementary regulations on the
enforcement of the new Criminal Procedure Law, which explicitly
defines lawyers' rights to meet with criminal suspects and
collect evidence.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that during the investigation of a
criminal case, suspects or their relatives have the right to
engage lawyers, and the investigative organs are held responsible
for the timely transfer of suspects' requests for the assistance
of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the investigative organs must make timely requests to
relevant departments to recommend lawyers for suspects or
their relatives who are unable to name a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Public Security told Xinhua
that from now on, the police will inform criminal suspects about
their right to access to a lawyer when taking them into custody.
</P>
<P>
"This will probably complicate our investigations, but
we will do everything strictly in accordance with the law," he noted.

LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Berti
Ahern vowed Thursday to keep the Northern Ireland peace process on
track despite a recent spate of bombings and shootings in the
British-ruled province.

Thursday a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars equivalent for higher
education project in Hungary to support its comprehensive reform
program for higher education.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to develop a system of higher education
that responds to the nation's changed and changing social and
economic needs, operates efficiently and mobilizes greater private
finance and distributes the costs of education more fairly.
</P>
<P>
Since Hungary joined the World Bank in 1982, the Bank
commitments total some 4.35 billion dollars for 40 projects.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Make Progress in Extracting Hydrogen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of a cheap supply
of hydrogen could be a step closer as Japan and Spain scientists
succeeded in splitting the elements from water at room temperature
by the use of catalysts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese researchers, at Tokyo Institute of Technology,
using a copper oxide catalyst and visible light, successfully
extracted hydrogen and oxygen from water, the New Scientist
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although researchers have tried the technique before, the
process did not work in visible light. Sunlight reduces cuprous
oxide to metallic copper, which halts the process.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese team managed to avoid this problem by using
powdered cuprous oxide and the process is said to last for 1,900
hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Spanish team, at the Institute of Material Science
in Valencia, claimed similar results using a catalyst made of a
new molybdenum compound whose details are being kept secret while
a patent is applied for.
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen is well-suited to motor vehicles, earlier work has
shown that hydrogen can be used to run car engines with relatively
little modification.
</P>
<P>
Virtually pollution-free, it is widely touted as the fuel of
the future as water is an abundant source of the element.
</P>
<P>
However, the making of hydrogen gas from water by conventional
electrolysis is quite expensive.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Invited to See Titanic at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A British travel company on
Thursday invited adventurers to pay thousands of dollars to view
the real Tinatic ship which lay in the North Atlantic deep sea for
the past 86 years.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, travel company Wildwings is offering
week-long expeditions to the wreck site about 588 kilometers south
east of Newfoundland, Canada, from August for 50 people at 33,000
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"For people who are non-scientists and not part of a film
company, it will be the first time for them to do this," said Mike
McDowell, co-owner of Deep Oceans Expeditions, which will operate
the trip.
</P>
<P>
He said people interested in the expedition would dive to the
ocean depths of 6,000 meters in two Finnish MIR mini-submarines
that were used in the Hollywood hit movie "Titanic".
</P>
<P>
"The wreck itself is 12,600 feet deep. When we make the dive,
we will be within feet of the actual wreck. It'll be the same sort
of scenes you've seen in the movie," McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
The luxurious Titanic was said to be unsinkable. But on its
maiden voyage in April 1912, it struck an iceberg and went to the
bottom.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday told UN staff not to be saddeded by the
criticism over the Memorandum of Understanding reached by him and
the Government of Iraq days ago.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks following mounting criticism,
particularly from the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in the form of a letter to all UN staff, Annan
said "We should all await the Security Council action in this
agreement. It is the Council, not a few critics, who will have the
last word."
</P>
<P>
"It was not unexpected that there would be criticism of us and
misrepresentations of what we have done in Iraq. But you must not
be disheartened," the UN chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative to the agreement would have ended UNSCOM's
work. The Memorandum of Understanding has strengthened it.
Therefore I want you to treat the criticism with sympathetic
understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
for my part, I has done the work and I trust the Security
Council would do its duty," he added.

<HEADLINE> British PM Pledges to Continue Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Thursday denied there would be a U-turn in welfare
reform, saying single parents should be helped to get off benefits
and into work.
</P>
<P>
Blair told ITN television in an interview that the goal of the
reform was to help families with children and added it was
essential that the budget address ways of making work pay.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's right that lone parents get the same benefits
as couples do and we also believe it's right that the additional
money that we have is put into helping lone parents off benefit
and into work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 Labor MPs stood up last December against a cut in
benefits for single parents, dealing a blow to Blair's plan to
overhaul Britain's 50-year-old welfare system.
</P>
<P>
Blair is keen to limit the rise in Britain's total welfare
bill, now 164 billion U.S. dollars a year, but is thought to be
reluctant to squeeze the middle classes, many of whom voted Labour
for the first time last May.
</P>
<P>
So far the government has failed to give a clear line on
whether it favors means-testing benefits such as child allowance
which up to now have been paid to rich and poor alike.

<HEADLINE> Greece Describes Turkish Statement as Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece criticized Thursday the
statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry on Athens' response to
Ankara's proposal for bettering bilateral ties, saying that it was
"an unacceptable threat" with which Turkey could not hide its real
intentions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday that
Greece once again showed the world its disposition to maintain
tension in the Aegean and leave problems with Turkey unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish statement, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas accused the neighboring country of refusing to
operate within the framework of international law, saying that
Ankara was seeking "a form of communication without any specific
rules or content."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country could not proceed with political
negotiations based on Turkey's unilateral claims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis Thursday
reiterated Greece's stance on a step-by-step approach in the
relations between the two countries while attributing the disputes
between them stemmed from Turkey's "unacceptable demands and
pressures."
</P>
<P>
In a reply to a five-point proposal by Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem Tuesday, Greece dismissed Cem's proposal. In return,
Greece suggested that international law was the conerstone for
normalization of Greek-Turkish relations, urging Turkey to refer
all its claims to the international court of justice in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues Controversial Anti-Drug Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
Thursday announced an annual anti-drug certification decision,
which is certain to be criticized by countries in the blacklist.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton granted "full certification" to 22 of
the 30 countries which were termed as "major drug-producing and
transit countries," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, Colombia, Pakistan and Paraguay "were not certified
for cooperation, but were granted national interest waivers" while
Afghanistan, Burma, Iran and Nigeria "were denied certification
outright," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The certification process started in 1986. If a country is
denied full certification, there is a complete cut-off of sales or
financing of weapons, counternarcotics help and other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
When a country receives a vital national interests
certification, assistance is provided in the same manner as if it
had been given full certification.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the administration has decided to waive two-year
old sanctions against that Colombia, citing success made by the
country in fighting narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Waiver of the sanctions means that there will be fewer
impediments to U.S. assistance to Colombia's anti-drug efforts.
Colombia also will be spared economic penalties for the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
The certification process, first required by Congress in 1986,
is widely criticized by many countries, where it is seen as
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the certification process is a kind of interference
in their domestic affairs, the countries say the root cause of the
drug problem is insatiable U.S. demand.

The United States and Britain had threatened to launch
strikes on Iraq to force it to grant U.N. arms inspectors
immediate, free and unconditional access to its presidential sites
suspected of hiding banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> New Pig Virus Rekindles Fears About Animal Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A previously unknown virus in
pigs discovered in Australia has rekindled fears about the safety
of transplanting animal organs into human patients.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which caused deformities and stillbirths among pigs,
also infected two piggery workers who developed severe flu-like
symptoms, the New Scientist magazine reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest question marks over the future of
cross-species organ transplants is the potential of introducing
animal viruses into the human population.
</P>
<P>
Proponents have argued that animal organs can be screened for
viruses before use.
</P>
<P>
"But you can't screen for disease agents that you don't know
about," virologist Peter Kirkland was quoted by the magazine as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kirkland was a member of a large scientific team which tracked
down the cause of a disease which swept through a piggery near
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The team traced the virus to a colony fo grey-headed fruit bats
that were living near the piggery. They believe the bat is the
host for the disease.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which only attacked pig foetuses, has not been found
in pig products or other people who may have been exposed to it.
The two infected piggery workers also recovered.
</P>
<P>
Although the virus was contained, "there is nothing to say that
it won't break out again," Kirkland warned.

The 58 U.N. humanitarian staff left Baghdad a week ago as a

The crisis was triggered when Iraq refused to open some
sensitive sites like presidential palaces to U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>

But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused the crisis by
striking a deal with Iraq Monday that would give U.N. arms
