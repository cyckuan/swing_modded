<HEADLINE> Government Work Report Down-to-Earth and Inspiring: NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the National People's
Congress in session here praised the government work report
delivered by Premier Li Peng at this morning's session as
"down-to-earth and inspiring" in group discussions this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, said the past five years
are a period when Shanghai as well as China as a whole have had
the fastest economic growth and social development. It has been
achieved under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Abudul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, commented that besides being a summary of the
past five years, the report explains China's current economic
situation and sets forth concrete measures to tackle problems.
</P>
<P>
"It conforms with realities of the country and objective laws
of economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wanzhi, a deputy from Chongqing University, said the
report does not dodge problems and contradictions. "Goals and
measures put forward in the report are realistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the financial reform part of the report, Deputy
Ni Guangzu, a banker from Yunnan province, said China has made
great strides in reform of its financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that the principles, policies and measures
adopted by the central government in the financial field are
correct," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report has emphasized the importance of stability, said
Deputy Liu Mingzu, secretary of the Mongolian Regional Committee
of the Communist Party of China. The 50-year history of Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region has proved that it is of great
significance to safeguard national unity and social stability, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Maintain Ban on British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A proposal on easing the ban on
British beef export has failed to win sufficient support of the
chief veterinarians from the European Union's 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Veterinary Committee, made up by the chief
veterinarians, Wednesday failed to reach the qualified majority on
the United Kingdom's Export Certified Herds Scheme which would
allow for a limited resumption in beef exports from Northern
Ireland alone, said an EU statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler and Emma Bonino, European commissioners
respectively responsible for agriculture and health, described the
outcome of the discussions as "most regrettable."
</P>
<P>
They indicated that the issue would be sent to the Council of
Ministers for a decision on March 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
An EU official, who declined to be identified, said the
proposal obtained a simple majority in Wednesday's discussion, but
"the qualified majority needed wasn't reached."
</P>
<P>
But under EU voting rules, a simple majority at ministerial
level would be enough to carry the proposal through.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU) planned
negotiations with the United States would not cover the touchy
sectors of agriculture and audio-video services.
</P>
<P>
The United States must understand the EU's point in this regard
before the negotiations start, the European Commission, the EU's
executive body, said in a press release on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's only under these conditions that negotiations (with the
United State) have any chance at all of reaching a satisfactory
conclusion," an EU spokesman was quoted as saying in the release.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was reporting on Commission President Jacques
Santer's decision after the EU executive body discussed, for the
first time, plans to create closer trade ties with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States have long been at odds over the
issues of agriculture and audio-video services.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalization was
almost killed as the United States tried to scale down the
European system of subsidies to farmers and French demands for
protection of its audio-video industry.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Vehicles Sales Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in Canada slid 3.7
percent in February from year-earlier levels, reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canada's sales of cars, trucks and minivans fell to 84,068 in
February from 87,285 a year ago. It's the second month in a row
that sales have declined.
</P>
<P>
One explanation for the slow start to 1998 is that aggressive
incentive plans in late 1997 took some steam out of the market,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Though the auto industry is expecting the total market to be up
at least four percent in 1998, growth will be far below 1997's
18.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In February, Chrysler Canada Ltd. was the only member of the
Big Three to report a big growth of 14.9 percent, while Ford of
Canada Ltd. and General Motors of Canada Ltd. saw a 19.7 percent
and 13.5 percent drop respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Europe-and Asia-based manufacturers got big
gains, ranging from Toyota Canada Inc.'s 31.8 percent growth to
BMW's 42.6 percent increase.

ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the worst
floods in southwestern Pakistan has risen to 300 with 1,500 people
still missing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,700 houses have been completely destroyed while
8,000 partially damaged in the remote Makran Division of the
Balochistan Province, which was hit by devastating floods on
Tuesday following 36-hours of torrential rains, according to
reports reaching here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The gushing flood waters also took with them 7,200 head of
cattle while nearly 198 villages have been affected by the floods.
Turbat, division headquarters of Makran, is still cut off from the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Relief and rescue operations, jointly launched by the army,
navy and civilians, in the flood-affected areas of Makran are
continuing in full swing.
</P>
<P>
A vast area along the flooded River Dasht has been devastated
and it is feared that the death toll may rise to more than 1,000,
relief officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was also feared that if precautionary measures were not
taken by the people and the concerned officials, an epidemic could
break out in the flood-affected areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Union Leaders on National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Thursday described the two-day nationwide stayaway
by workers as a ''well deserved victory''.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the workers in most of the urban centres
stayed at home on Tuesday and Wednesday in response to a ACTU
call to protest rising prices of basic commodities and unpopular
government taxes.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here Thursday afternoon, ZCTU
Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said the ZCTU could not just
sit and ignore the problems facing the nation, and urged the
government to be sensitive to the demands of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to threats from the government that civil servants
who observed the stayaway would be punished, Tsvangirai said the
ZCTU had already put in place legal systems to defend those
affected.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued after the news conference, ZCTU
President Gibson Sibanda said the two-day mass stay-away was
characterised by high levels of discipline of purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''The workers have finally realised that they need to
work nationally to counteract the effects of price increases and
higher taxes.''
</P>
<P>
''No amount of threats, intimidation and provocation will
drive a wedge between genuine workers' demands and their
authentic leadership,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai stressed, ''Like before, we genuinely seek solution
to pressing economic issues through participation in economic
decision making. We will work with our social partners in
developing a lasting national consensus.''

PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday expressed concern
over reports from Yugoslavia that the Yugoslav security forces
have launched an operation against a village of ethnic Albanians
in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If these reports are confirmed, they would attest an
escalation of the violence which went in the opposite direction of
the appeal for restraint by the international community and
France," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that France condemns violence exerted by any side of
the conflict and "firmly reminds the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia that only dialogue will allow to find a
political solution to the question of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry of Serbia confirmed that security forces
conducted an operation in the region of Srbica Thursday morning
after two Serb policemen were wounded in an ambush by Albanian
"terrorists."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Enzhu on the Good Beginning of the Hong Kong SAR (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Director of Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch Jiang Enzhu today said the policy of "one
country, two systems" has been successfully implemented in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) since it return to
the motherland eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
When deliberating Premier Li Peng's government work report
together with other deputies from the Hong Kong SAR, Jiang said
the Hong Kong SAR is politically stable after its eight-month
operation under the Basic Law, and all facets of social life
is normal.
</P>
<P>
"In his report Premier Li particularly elaborated on the great
historical significance of the Hong Kong's return and the present
situation of the SAR, and reaffirmed the central government's
support to the SAR government. Li especially pointed out that the
SAR has had a good beginning and Hong Kong's future will be even
brighter. This conclusion absolutely tallies with facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's return eight months ago, its social system
and the way of life have remained unchanged and laws have been
kept basically intact, he said. The SAR government has
independently carried out effective administration of Hong Kong
society in accordance with the Basic Law, and its residents fully
enjoy the rights and freedom as provided by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong continues to maintain its status as an international
financial, trade and shipping center as well as the status of free
port," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that despite attack by the Asian financial
crisis since last October, Hong Kong still achieved a steady
economic growth. The measures taken by the SAR government have
been successful in pegging the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar,
and maintaining the economic and financial stability on the whole.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR now enjoys social stability, and its
residents have a sense of security and confide in the SAR
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since its return to the motherland, Hong
Kong has maintained and further reinforced its relations with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"All these facts demonstrate that the policy of `one country
two systems' has been turned into reality, and is increasingly
showing its great vitality," he said.

<P>
He attributed the factors underlining the achievements of the
Hong Kong SAR to the unswerving efforts made by the central
government to implement the policies of "one country, two systems"
and "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" with a high degree
of autonomy, and local residents' support to these policies; the
efficient leadership of the SAR government; as well as the
effective economic operating mechanism and financial management
principles.
</P>
<P>
"The most critical factor is the powerful backing of the
motherland," he acknowledged, adding that many noted personalities
in Hong Kong held that the country's good economic and social
situation has been playing a positive role in stabilizing Hong
Kong economy during the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, he added, the policy of "one country, two
systems" and the Basic Law will be implemented in an all-round
way, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will continue to be
maintained, and cooperation in all economic and social sectors
between the SAR and the interior area will be further promoted
and expanded.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will surely have an even brighter future," Jiang
said.

PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal
Milo Thursday called on European Union and the United States to
stage a diplomatic intervention in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
to prevent an escalation of violence there.
</P>
<P>
"I believe in a united European-American diplomatic action to
resolve the crisis in Kosovo," Milo told Agence France-Presse
after he arrived in the French capital to discuss with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Milo said that the international community, which has all the
means for an intervention, should urgently intervene before it is
too late and turns into another Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of a new conflict in the Balkans, Albanians will
not be the only one to pay the price, but also the Europeans, and
for a longtime," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the time being, the crisis in Kosovo has not
"attained such a dimension as they would spill beyond the borders
of Kosovo" into Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
France has urged both sides of the conflict in Kosovo to remain
calm and seek a solution through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
France has also asked the Serbian government to restore the
statute of autonomy for Kosovo, which was suppressed in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Cabinet Approves Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean cabinet has
approved a police framework for the indigenization of the economy
to enable the economically marginalized black majority to enter
the mainstream economy, a senior Zimbabwean official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for State Enterprises and Indigenization
Cephas Msipa said at a news conference here that the policy would
ensure the development of private sector which would be the
engine of economic growth and development as well as correcting
past imbalances.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the policy was to economically empower
indigenous Zimbabweans by increasing, through economic expansion,
their productive investment in the economy to create more wealth
and eradicate poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives were to create conditions that allow
disadvantaged people to participate in the economic development
and "earn themselves self respect and dignity" while developing a
self-sustaining economic structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the potential for inter-racial conflict would
"persist in Zimbabwe as long as economic justice is not
attained."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the underlying philosophy to indigenization
is to improve the lives of the indigenous majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the program, he said, the government
would work towards creating an enabling macro-economic
environment, redistributing the land, the mobilization of
financial resources and reviewing laws that constrain
indigenization and industrialization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Measures to economically empower people would be implemented
through privatizing state enterprises, practising employee share
ownership schemes, joint ventures and strategic partnerships, the
operationalization of national investment trust, sub-contracting
and business linkages, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at the moment 80 percent of the
country'seconomy is dominated by large foreign and local
multi-nationals and the minority white.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party of Nepal Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), the largest party in the
parliament, formally broke up Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bam Dev Gautam, former deputy prime minister and leader of a
minority faction of the CPN-UML, and the party's 40 MPs registered
a new party Thursday afternoon in the Parliament Secretariat,
General Secretary of the CPN-UML Madhav Kumar Nepal confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's law, 40 percent of members of a parliamentary
party or its central committee can form a new party and get
recognition. The CPN-UML has 89 MPs in the parliament, so the
breakaway faction has got more than what is needed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Committee of the CPN-UML at a meeting in
the morning expelled Gautam and his supporters from the party.
</P>
<P>
Differences between Gautam and General Secretary Nepal led to
the split of the party.
</P>
<P>
At the party's Sixth National Congress held in late January,
Kumar Nepal's political documents were adopted while Gautam and
his supporters boycotted the election of the central committee.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of negotiations held since then failed to patch
up the differences.
</P>
<P>
The breakup followed a split of the country's third largest
party the ruling National Democratic Party in January, when former
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and his supporters left the
party to form a new organization. Their new party has won formal
recognition in the parliament, but the Election Commission has not
recognized it as a national party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Edge 0.5 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. orders to factories
and mines edged 0.5 percent in January, the Commerce Department
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The January growth followed a revised 2.6 percent drop in
December, which had been the worst showing for the U.S.
manufacturers in more than five years, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
The steep drop in December was attributed mainly a falloff in
demand for aircraft. Aircraft orders rebounded sharply in January,
rising 71.9 percent and helping to push the overall transportation
category up by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, demand for U.S. manufactured goods was extremely weak,
dropping by 0.2 percent, the third setback in the last four
months.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that a recent financial crisis in some Asian
countries and the resulting economic slowdowns will cut into U.S.
exports and increase imports into the United States. Factories
here may eventually have to cut production and workers.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report today, the Labor Department said
that the number of applications for unemployment benefits dropped
by a bigger-than-expected 16,000 claims to 304,000 for last week.
The four-week average of claims remained stable at 308,750.
</P>
<P>
The report on factory orders showed that demand for durable
goods, items expected to last three or more years, increased by
1.6 percent. This was a sharp revision from an initial report last
week, which had put the rise in durable goods at 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Demand for autos was down 6.8 percent in January, and orders
for ships and tanks plummeted 68.5 percent, although this weakness
was offset by the strong gain in aircraft orders.
</P>
<P>
Demand for non-durable goods, including food and fuel, was down
0.9 percent in January, following an 0.8 percent increase in
December.
</P>
<P>
Orders for petroleum, coal and chemicals had the largest
decreases in the non-durable category. Warm weather caused by El
Nino has cut sharply the demand for heating fuel this winter.
</P>
<P>
Total orders for factory goods stood at 337.4 billion U.S.
dollars in January, 4.2 percent above the level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, which is regarded as a measure of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Welcomes Lockerbie Ruling of Intl Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa welcomed the
ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the
Lockerbie air disaster, the Foreign Affairs Department said in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa regards the ruling of the International Court of
Justice as positive and a step forward toward a sensible and long
overdue solution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice, which is based in The
Hague, Netherlands, ruled last Friday that it has the authority
to try two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, thus
rejecting demands of the United States and Britain that the
suspects be tried in either country.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has always condemned terrorism in all its forms
and wishes to see those who have caused the suffering surrounding
the Lockerbie disaster brought to justice," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said South African President Nelson Mandela has confirmed
South Africa's support for the abrogation of sanctions that are
daily causing hardship for the people of Libya.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations banned flights to Libya after Tripoli's
refusal to extradite the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will continue its support for the League of Arab
States (AL) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in this
matter and it shares with other like-minded countries the hope
that the ICJ's findings may herald the dawning of a new phase of
progressive and mature diplomacy in the world," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The AL and the OAU have been supportive of Libya's position
that the trials should be held in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Libya twice in October 1997 in defiance of
Washington's strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Libya brought the case to the international court in March,
1992, insisting that it should be allowed to try the men itself.
</P>
<P>
It later softened its stance to agree to hand the suspects for
trial in a third, neutral country.

<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's central bank the Bank of
England decided on Thursday not to raise interest rates this
month, leaving the base rate unchanged at 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced the decision at midday after its monetary
policy committee had held its monthly meeting which began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bank faced a difficult decision in
view of the evidence of a deepening split in the economy.

<P>
Manufacturing growth has almost come to a standstill whilst the
service sector continues to boom, running at its highest level for
seven months.
</P>
<P>
The decision is said to have pleased the City, where share
prices have been plunging over the last two days, partly on the
back of fears of a rise.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has set
a new deadline of March 15 for the completion of the remaining
tasks in the peace process in Angola, UN spokesman's office
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Secretary-General's Deputy Special
Representative for Angola Behrooz Sadry represented the Angolan
parties on Tuesday with a proposal for the new deadline of March
15 for the completion of remaining tasks in the undergoing peace
process," a UN spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the parties were now discussing the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has continued expressing
its concern at the general situation in Angola which remains
precarious. The peace process has stalled since a new timetable on
the implementation of the remaining tasks in the peace process was
adopted in January. The delay has been caused mainly by the
National Union for the total independence of Angola(UNITA).

<HEADLINE> British Govt Tones Down Red Meat Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Thursday
toned down health guidance on the link between red meat and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The latest advice says that while those eating more than the
average 90 grams of red meat a day should consider a reduction,
those on no more than 90 grams need not change.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Health Department said even those consuming
the average quantity should consider cutting down.
</P>
<P>
But the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition
Policy (COMA) said anyone eating over that amount should cut down
to reduce the risks of cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Adults who eat more than the average amount of red and
processed meat, especially those eating a lot more, might benefit
from a reduction," said Kenneth Calman, the government's Chief
Medical Officer and chairman of COMA.
</P>
<P>
This is a change from the committee's preliminary findings last
September which said those eating the average 90 grams a day
should also cut down.
</P>
<P>
The change is reported to follow a row between members of the
government committee looking into the issue.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Meet with Adams Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was ready to meet with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams but not until
after its exclusion from peace talks was over next Monday, a
government spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's spokesman said Blair would respond to Sinn
Fein's request for a meeting and the meeting would possibly take
place in the second half of next week.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army, was
barred from the peace talks late last month for IRA's involvement
in two killings early last month, but the party could regain its
seat if IRA takes no more terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Adams denied any Sinn Fein links with the
killings and requested a meeting with Blair to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a letter would be sent to Adams asking him
to come to the prime minister's London office for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although the party is free to return to the talks next Monday,
it has said it will not do so until Blair grants its leaders a
face-to-face meeting.

<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The release of some 100 Lebanese
prisoners by Syria makes up a gesture of opening by Damascus as is
wished by France and Europe, said French Socialist parliament
deputy Gerard Bapt on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bapt, who is chairman of the France-Lebanon Friendship
association, said the release came in the wake of "an unofficial
intervention" with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad by "a Syrian
friend" of France.
</P>
<P>
Bapt accompanies French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine in a
tour to Lebanon and Syria in January.
</P>
<P>
About 100 Lebanese prisoners, jailed by Syria since the
Lebanese civil war from 1975 to 1990, were returned to Lebanon by
Syria on Thursday, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Syria still detains 33 Lebanese charged with spying for Israel,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Before being returned to Lebanon, the prisoners were given a
verbal-verdict each by a Syrian court on whether they should stand
trial in Lebanon, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have signed a pact of "brotherhood,
cooperation and coordination" which includes security
cooperations, and 35,000 Syrian troops are stationed in Lebanon.

HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Planning
Commissioner Richard Hove Thursday called on the government and
trade unions to solve their diferences through talks, saying
dialogue is the best way to solve problems besetting the nation,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the job stayaway called for by the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), Hove said differences between
the government and the Trade Unions should always be temporary.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU organized a two-day mass stayaway, which ended
Wednesday, in protest against the government economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Accoring to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries, the
country lost about 40 million U.S.Dolalrs in production in the
national strike.
</P>
<P>
''There is need for dialogue between the government, the civic
society and other stalkholders to resolve the economic problems
the country is currently facing,'' Hove said at an investment
conference in the central Zimbabwean city of Gweru.
</P>
<P>
''Whatever differences exist between any organisation and the
government,'' he said, ''people should not forget that the
country belonged to all of us''.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''We have a country for ourselves and for posterity.
Whatever differences exist let they not be permanent and result
in our country losing respect from the outside community.''

LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Customers of mobile phone in
Britain are paying some of the highest charges in the world and
the country's telecommunications watchdog Oftel is to order cuts

demand that the cost of mobile phone calls from fixed lines run by
companies like British Telecommunications (BT) be cut from 32
pence (0.53 US dollar) per minute to 20 pence (0.33 US dollar).

in a statement that the demand for gold in the world in 1997

refrained from disclosing any details on a formula he discussed
with the Cypriot government officials for the Turkish Cypriot
participation in the forthcoming EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has refused to see Van
den Broek and British envoy Hannay in protest against the EU
decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
According to the conclusions of the Luxembourg EU summit last
December, the government of Cyprus is requested to include
representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community in the accession
negotiating delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has proposed Turkish Cypriot
participation provided that the Turkish Cypriot side accepts the
principle of Cyprus' accession to the EU and the Turkish Cypriot
representatives are part of the Republic's negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over 37 percent of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared in 1983 a breakaway "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Accuses Eritrea of Shelling Its Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has accused Eritrea of
shelling its border villages in the eastern state of Kasala,
injuring a number of villagers and damaging some water resources
and schools, the official Sudanese news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by the agency, a spokesman of the
Sudanese Armed Forces and Deputy Chief of Staff General Abdul
Rahman Sirrul Khatm said that the Eritrean artillery shelled the
Sudanese villages of Qasf, Abu Qaml and Hadra Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shelling was aimed at schools and civilian sites, but no
pupils were killed or injured as the shelling started before
school day, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese artillery responded to the shelling, he said, adding
that the fresh attack constituted a series of Eritrean aggressions
against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The shelling was the second of its kind in less than one
week and the Sudanese-Eritrean border strip has been subjected to
military escalation over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean ruptured its relations with Sudan in December 1994,
accusing Sudan of supporting its opposition group Islamic Jihad
Movement in its effort to overthrow Eritrean President Isaias
Afewerki.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Sudan has accused the Eritrean government of
giving shelter to armed Sudanese opposition groups, which use
Eritrean borders as springboard in attacking Sudanese military and
civilian targets in a bid to topple the Sudanese Islamic
government.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu left here Thursday for Madrid, starting a trip to four
Western European countries in a bid to win support for Israeli
policy on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day tour in Spain, Germany, Norway and Britain,
Netanyahu is expected to explain Israel's current effort to
resuscitate the peace talks with Lebanon and implement the related
U.N. resolution to withdraw troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Netanyahu said that "it is important
that the European leaders understand our position and perhaps as
a result they may agree with it. "
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that despite the great importance of
Israel's relationship with the United States, "Europe must not be
abandoned."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu proposed last week that if Lebanese government could
ensure the security of Israeli northern border, Israel was willing
to fulfill U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and withdraw its
troops from the buffer zone in south Lebanon, which it set up in
1985 to protect cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be in
the United Kingdom when Netanyahu gets there, "nothing has been
said and nothing arranged", Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is also expected to enlist European leaders' support
in pushing forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which
has been stalled for several months over the extent of Israel's
next pullback in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, New Zealand Urged to Identify New Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister
Keli Walubita Thursday called on Zambia and New Zealand to
identify new areas of cooperations in economic development to
enhance bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner for New Zealand Foreign Minister Don
Mackinnon here Thursday, Walubita regretted that despite buoyant
bilateral ties, there is very little trade and economic
cooperation between them, the state-controlled Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Walubita expressed his government's gratitude to New Zealand
for its technical assistance and agricultural training provided
to a large number of Zambians.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the tremendous development achieved by
the New Zealand government since the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
During the dinner given at the end of Mackinnon's two-day
visit to Zambia, Walubita briefed his New Zealand counterpart on
Zambia's reforms launched after the ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD) came into power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The MMD government initiated economic reforms designed to
liberate the economic activities with a view to encouraging both
local and foreign investment and thereby free the market from the
state control.
</P>
<P>
These economic reforms, though stringent and painful to most
Zambians, especially the vulnerable groups, have started to show
signs of sustainability, said the Zambian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some of the country's economic indicators such
as inflation and bank interests rates have ebbed to "manageable"
levels.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Accuses Israel of Not Honoring UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz on Thursday accused Israel of not honoring United Nations
resolutions and refusing to return the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, Boueiz criticized Israel for refusing
to accept the land-for-peace principle of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The principle of trading land for peace is widely accepted as
the cornerstone of the peace process. But Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu insists that the security of the Jewish state
should be guaranteed before making peace with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister stressed that the resumption of
the peace talks between Lebanon, Syria and Israel depends on
Israel's commitment to the principle.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa arrived in Lebanon on Wednesday to coordinate with
the Lebanese side about Israel's offer relating the issue of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Demanding an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon, al-Sharaa said Israel's proposal is a trap aimed at
driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed its readiness to pull out of south Lebanon
if the Lebanese government agrees to curb attacks on Israel by
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south
Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese resistance forces which have been fighting to
drive Israeli troops out.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria agree to coordinate their positions on key
issues and not to negotiate peace with Israel separately.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Hopes Iraq to Comply with UN Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) expressed his hope Thursday that fully
implementation of the U.N.-Iraq accord by Iraq would lead to the
lifting of the U.N. economic sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan said so in a press
statement after receiving the U.S. ambassador Whitish Fowler in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was hoping that the agreement signed by the
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz "will be an important step for Iraq's completion of the
implementation of all U.N. resolutions and a prelude for lifting
sanctions imposed on the brotherly Iraqi people," according to
Kuwait News Agency reports.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Hujailan and the American ambassador
discussed in their meeting the "latest regional and international
developments in light of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The agreement struck between Annan and Iraqi leadership on
February 23 defused the crisis over the arms inspections in Iraq
and avoided a possible U.S. military strike against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has to give the U.N. arms inspectors an unfettered and
unconditional access to eight presidential palaces suspected of
hiding weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Hujailan also urged in his statement all parties concerned to
exert all efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Angola Accuses Zambians of Backing UNITA Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola Thursday accused some
Zambians of supplying weapons to the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto told a news
briefing here that some Zambians have been supplying weapons to
the UNITA rebels through Zambia's Ndola airport.
</P>
<P>
He Claimed that Zambian territory is used in many ways by
these Zambians who support UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Augusto said Angola will try in its own ways to ensure that
Zambian territory is not used by the former rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
He described the situation in Zambian-Angolan border as
serious, saying the border is almost under the control of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But the ambassador denied that Angola has accused Zambia of
backing UNITA.
</P>
<P>
In January Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita said his
country was committed to the peace process in Angola and had
worked hard for the implementation of the Lusaka protocol signed
by the Angolan government and the UNITA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Walubita said Zambia has no intention of allowing its
territory to be used for hostile activities against any
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
After Angola's independence in 1976 the UNITA fought a civil
war of nearly 20 years against the government. Although the two
sides signed the Lusaka peace accord which ended the civil war,
UNITA has been blamed for not abiding by it and peace has not
prevailed yet all over the country.

<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to attend the reinstatement ceremony of
Sierra Leone's ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah next week, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the exigencies of his office did not allow him to be
present, he would send a strong delegation, the official news
agency quoted Annan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed his desire following invitation
extended to him and the Security Council by the Committee of Five
on Sierra Leone under the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to attend the ceremony billed for March 10.
</P>
<P>
The committee, led by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, is
in New York to brief Annan and the Council on the situation in
Sierra Leone, which is a member of the 16-state ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ikimi suggested the Security Council
send delegates since it might not be possible for all its 15
members to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Annan, Ikimi said the capacity of the
ECOWAS peace-keeping force ECOMOG needed to be enhanced to
effectively carry out its mandate in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG ousted the military junta in the Sierra Leone capital
Freetown about three weeks ago and has since been carrying out
disarmament of combatants in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi urged the U.N. to deploy a military observer mission to
Sierra Leone to join ECOMOG in the task of disarmament and boost
the security in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an increase in humanitarian assistance to
that country to alleviate its people's suffering.

UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday appointed Prakash Shah of India as his Special
Envoy in Iraq for an initial period of six months.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief's move came amid the difficulties arising from

Government of Iraq and his office in order to help avert the

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestinian security
forces arrested more than a dozen Hamas members after uncovering
one of its cells in the West Bank on Thursday, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli General Security Service detained 15 Hamas
activists in West Bank cities of Ramallah, Nablus and Jerusalem,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the arrestees were involved in two suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem last year, which killed 22 Israelis
and wounded 350 others.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security force, meanwhile, arrested some other
Hamas members of the cell in Nablus. They were found to have been
planning a terrorist attack somewhere in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement, came into being in 1987
when the Palestinian popular uprising against Israeli occupation
broke out. It opposes realizing peace with the Jewish state as
long as the occupation of the Palestinian land does not come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist attacks have bogged down the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israelis, which have been stalled since March,
1996 when Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli military court extended the
remand of another Hamas activist on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court said the activist spoke openly about his attempt to
take hostages in a foreign embassy in Israel to bargain for the
release of Hamas prisoners in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that its next troop pullback in the West Bank
depends on the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to fight
against terrorism.

MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia is bound to take a broader
approach to the issue of the rights of the Russian-speaking
population in Latvia and has no intention to take any measures
against the Baltic country, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Gennady Tarasov told a news briefing in Moscow that
Russia had expressed deep indignation at the disbandment by the
Latvian authorities of a mainly Russian-speaking pensioners' rally
in Riga on Tuesday.

Describing the Latvian police attack as "an arbitrary act which
cannot be justified", Tarasov said the Russian Foreign Ministry
has urged the international community to take energetic actions
against Latvia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "A crying violation of basic human rights is at
issue."
</P>
<P>
According to Tarasov, the Latvian side, instead of investigating
the crude use of force by the police and punishing the culprits,
is arguing other countries have no right to assess internal events
in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Russian spokesman said, human rights are not sole
competence of the state but a sphere of responsibility of the
entire world community.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has reportedly accused Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano of "interfering with Angola's internal
affairs."
</P>
<P>
UNITA made the accusation Thursday in a news release faxed to
Mozambique News Agency from Bailundo, one of its headquarters in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The information secretariat of the former rebel movement noted
in the statement that in the recently concluded summit of the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) held in Maputo,
Chissano had made himself "an activist of the committee of action
for the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola",
and "a mouthpiece" of Angolan Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
Problems in Angola are very complicated, said UNITA, which
urged people to "investigate before making any decisions."
</P>
<P>
The communique referred to SADC resolutions on Angola as
"disastrous."
</P>
<P>
Chissano said Monday at a press conference after the SADC
summit that UNITA had not yet demobilized all its armed forces,
nor had its radio station Vorgan stopped anti-government
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that SADC heads of state and government had
decided to take up measures to set up more effective mechanism to
implement U.N. sanctions on UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Coalition Battered in Parliamentary Vote on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
ruling coalition suffered a major setback today as some
parliamentary members from his own camp joined the opposition
parties in pushing through a legislation limiting police's power
to use bugging against organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The amendment drafted by the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) to immunize doctors, lawyers and journalists from police
bugging was adopted by a vote of 329 to 322 in the lower house of
the German parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About ten rebels from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the
junior partner of Kohl's ruling coalition, had voted in favor of
the draft.
</P>
<P>
The voting result was cheered by the opposition parties as
another defeat for Kohl within one week after his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) was trounced by the SPD in the regional
elections at the western German Lower Saxony state last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The state elections has sealed the nomination of Gerhard
Schroeder as the SPD challenger to Kohl in the September general
elections, an option which is likely to pose the most serious
threat to Kohl's bid to seek an unprecedented fifth term as German
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"Kohl's coalition has fallen apart," said a SPD parliamentary
leader, Peter Struck. Joschka Fischer, leader of the opposition
Greens party, also interpreted the bugging vote as "a continuation
of the farewell phase" of Kohl's ruling coalition consisting of
CDU, its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) and
FDP.
</P>
<P>
While expressing disappointment at today's voting result, the
CDU however dismissed the notion that the ruling coalition is in a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The former FDP justice minister of Germany, Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, also made a talk to play down her
party's defection today, saying that it was quite natural for some
FDP members to have different opinions on such an important
constitutional issue as the bugging practice.

(ECOWAS), who arrived in New York Tuesday to brief
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council on the
situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The retention of the arms embargo would be necessary until
disarmament was completed and security was reasonably established
in that country, said committee chairman Tom Ikimi, who is also
Nigerian Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed arms embargo and travel ban on the
military junta in Sierra Leone after it ousted the legitimate
government through a coup on May 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Security Council issued a statement on the
dislodgement of the junta from the capital Freetown and expressed
its desire to lift sanctions on the country after the
reinstatement of the elected government on March 10.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Detained Women Leader Charged with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's detained women leader
Nakatindi Wina who was allegedly involved in last October's
foiled military coup was formally charged here Thursday with
treason.
</P>
<P>
The charge was confirmed by police service spokesman Beenwell
Chimfwembe, the state-controlled Zambia National Broadcasting
Corporation (ZNBC) reported.
</P>
<P>
ZNBC quoted the spokesman as saying that Wina, the ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) Chairperson of Women
Affairs and parliament member, was charged Thursday morning along
with detained army officer Captain Stephen Lungu Alias Solo and
seven others.
</P>
<P>
Lungu is believed to be the mastermind of the coup. It was he
who on the early morning of October 28, 1997, announced the coup
on the State Radio after his men took its control.
</P>
<P>
All the nine charged with treason will appear at court Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi, wife of MMD National Chairman Sikota Wina, was
arrested on the night of January 27. She is the first and only
senior MMD official so far arrested in connection with the coup
aimed at toppling the government.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of MMD women leader comes in the wake of
investigations into the coup attempt in which the Winas' house
was reportedly implicated as having been the venue for the plot.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's security agencies have to date arrested over 90
alleged coupists, including former president and opposition
leader Kenneth Kaunda and another opposition leader Dean
Mung'omba.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, most of the coup-related detainees have been
charged. Among them, Kaunda was charged last month with
concealment of treason while 74 others were charged with treason.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces to Remain in Gulf for Foreseeable Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The American forces will remain
in the Gulf for a relatively long time even after the danger of
air strikes on Iraq had receded, the Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the
foreseeable future," Pentagon spokesman Ken. Bacon said. "There's
no decision yet made to reduce the forces."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military force in the Gulf includes 18,000 sailors and
Marines, 9,000 Air Force servicemen and women, 7,800 Army soldiers
and 2,600 other personnel assigned to headquarters staffs,
according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the troops would remain until Iraqi compliance with
the U.N. Security Council agreement weapons inspections had been
tested.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the disposition of Iraqi forces, Bacon said some of
Saddam Hussein's troops appear to be stabilizing their positions.
</P>
<P>
"They are going back to more normal operations," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Iraqi forces had adopted a defensive posture
by dispersing, making it harder for them to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that while Iraqi air forces remain dispersed in such
defensive positions, there has been a return of some ground forces
and air defense forces to more concentrated units.

<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
mixed on Thursday, with London and Frankfurt extending their
losses while Paris bouncing back in late trade to end slightly
higher.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed 37.5 points
or 0.65 percent down at 5,695.6, having been down 104 points at
worst in the wake of a shock profit warning from U.S. computer
giant Intel Corp, which raised concerns over the outlook for
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
The market took little comfort at midday from the Bank of
England's decision to leave the base interest rate unchanged at
7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It took a fairly resilient performance on Wall Street in early
trade to lift the London market out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed at 4,623.40, down 86.18
points or 1.83 percent as traders consolidated gains after recent
record highs and, with little market-moving domestic news,
investors were reacting to bearish international factors.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed slightly higher after bouncing
back in late afternoon trade from an early 1.5 percent dip, 14.48
points or 0.43 percent up at 3,395.80.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were supported by dollar movements against the
mark and other European currencies.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah to Take Full Charge of S. Leonean Affairs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah will be fully in charge of the country's affairs
after his reinstatement on March 10, west African countries have
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi,
who is now in New York to brief the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council on the
current situation in Sierra Leone, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Council, Ikimi said President Kabbah, who has
lived in exile in neighboring Guinea since his ousting in a coup
last May, had indicated that the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG was required to provide security in the country in the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Sierra Leone in the wake of the coup and
has been in charge of security in the country since it dislodged
the military junta about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The activities of ECOMOG in that country would henceforth
depend on the assistance given it by President Kabbah, said
Ikimi, chairman of the Committee of Five on Sierra Leone set up
by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) after
the coup.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the duration of ECOMOG's stay in Sierra
Leone would depend on the time required for establishing peace
and security, especially the disarmament of combatants.
</P>
<P>
Although ECOMOG had already liberated a number of towns in the
hinterland from the junta forces, there was more work to be done
in that regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman urged the international community to move fast in
providing logistic support for ECOMOG's assignment.
</P>
<P>
He told the Security Council members that some countries in
the sub-region, such as Guinea, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and
Mali had indicated willingness to beef up ECOMOG forces but
needed financial support from the international community to
deploy their troops.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, President Kabbah has expressed his
intention to ensure the total disarmament of all combatants,
reorganization of the army and rehabilitation of ex-combatants.
</P>
<P>
The president also wished to establish an inclusive government
and to down-size the government bureaucracy, taking full account
of the political and economic realities and the need for national
cohesion, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In their individual responses, the Council members commended
ECOWAS for its job of ousting the junta and making arrangements
to reinstate Kabbah's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on the need for national reconciliation and the
provision of humanitarian assistance for Sierra Leoneans, who
they said had suffered immensely during the junta's rule.
</P>
<P>
The Council members also supported the idea of sending a U.N.
military observer mission to the country but pointed out that
such a decision would have to be based on a review of the
security situation there.

LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Olara Otunnu, special
representative of the U. N. secretary-general on the effects of
violent conflicts on women and children, has solicited Nigeria's
support for achieving his mandate in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, a citizen of Cote d'Ivoire, made the request at a
meeting with Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, who arrived in
New York Tuesday to brief the U.N. on the situation of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday that Otunnu said
he needed Nigeria's support because of the commendable role the
country had played in restoring peace to Liberia and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The special representative said he had done the basic ground
work for his assignment and was set to visit the areas affected
by wars, such as Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He said he intended to use the example of Sierra Leone as a
model for addressing the problems of women and children affected
by violent conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"I am now ready to go to the affected areas and wish to begin
with west Africa, in recognition of the role that Nigeria has
played in Liberia and Sierra Leone," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a main player in the resolution of the crises in
both Liberia and Sierra Leone, leading the west African peace
keeping force known as ECOMOG to restore peace in these two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu's major tasks as a special representative were to
create awareness of the plight of children and women in conflict
situations, mobilize communities to stop the abuses of women and
children in such areas.
</P>
<P>
He would also make specific proposals for humanitarian
assistance in war zones.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ikimi pledged Nigeria's assistance in the U.N.
official's effort to achieve his goals.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspector Scott Ritter Returns to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Scott Ritter, an American
U.N. arms inspector whose team was banned from doing work by the
Iraqi government in January, returned to Baghdad Thursday,
well-informed U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Scott Ritter, with a 50-member U.N. team
from Bahrain, arrived at the Habaniya military airport, 80
kilometers west of Baghdad, Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had accused Ritter of being a spy with American Central
Intelligency Agency (CIA), implementing U.S. policy and trying to
create problems with the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
In mid January, Iraq barred a 16-member U.N. arms inspection
team led by Ritter from carrying out any activities in Iraq on
ground that the team, which was composed of nine Americans, five
Britons, an Australian and a Russian, lacked balance in its
composition.
</P>
<P>
The event led to the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspection. On February 23, Iraq signed a deal with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that averted an imminent
U.S. military strike against Baghdad.

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chief scientist for NASA's
Lunar Prospector mission said Thursday afternoon that there are
significant amounts of water ice at both the north and south poles
of the moon.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing at NASA's Ames Research Center near Mountain

Extracting water from the moon's surface to sustain research
teams, fuel spacecraft or power electrical-production systems
could cut in half the cost of future explorations to the moon or

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations office in
Baghdad on Thursday called for a swift delivery of food and
medicine to Iraq to ease the sufferings of its people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Eric Falt, spokesman of the
U.N. Coordination Office for Humanitarian Affairs in Baghdad, said
the shortage of food and medicine in Iraq has been worsened due to
the delay of delivery.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation would further exert negative
effect on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to step up efforts to
transport food and medicine to Iraq as soon as possible in the
current third phase of the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began to implement the deal from December, 1996, under
which Iraq can sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in every
six months. The U.N. has approved a resolution to increase the
amount to 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Falt added that Dennis Haliday, coordinator of the U.N. office,
has left Baghdad for New York to attend discussions on the new
food distribution plan in Iraq.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian youths Thursday ended
their two-million-man rally in the capital Abuja with a call on
the current head of state, General Sani Abacha, to contest the
August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the resolution taken at the end of the massive
rally, which the Nigerian Television Authority said has attracted
more than two million people across the country, has been
presented to Abacha's political adviser in the early hours of
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, according to Alhaji Iliya Ibrahim, national
chairman of the National Council of Youth Associations of
Nigeria, which organized the rally, represented the collective
voice and desire of the youths in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Sule Hamma, the political adviser who came to witness
the closing ceremony at about 5:00 Thursday morning, promised to
deliver the resolution without delay.
</P>
<P>
The rally, which began Tuesday morning, is seen as a major
move of pro-Abacha groups to press the head of state to announce
his decision to vie for the presidential election, which is to
end the five-year military rule on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
To counter the government-supported rally in Abuja,
anti-Abacha groups also held one in the national economic center
of Lagos Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the anti-Abacha rally, which the organizer vowed
earlier would draw five million people from all over the country,
only attracted about 10,000 participants and onlookers, who were
dispersed by armed policemen in about half an hour's exercise.
</P>
<P>
With less than half a year to the presidential election, there
are only two individual politicians who have announced their
intention to contest.
</P>
<P>
The five political parties have not produced their own
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the representative for the five parties commended
at the closing ceremony the Nigerian youths for their patriotism
to hold the carnival-like rally.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Abacha has kept silent on whether he would come out
to contest the forthcoming presidential election.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's offshore oil megaproject
Hibernia has cut its output by half because of a maintenance
needed to revive the pressure of its wells, said a report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hibernia platform, which pumped 60,000 barrels a day in its
first phase of operation, is forecast to average 30,000 barrels a
day from late February until late June, according to the Globe and
Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We will take a dip in production over the next few months
until we get the pressure maintenance completed," Hibernia
president Harvey Smith was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The offshore project recently shut its first two wells for
reservoir maintenance and testing. But the third well has been
pumping almost 30,000 barrels a day for the past week.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance program of injecting water or natural gas into
wells is designed to help push out crude oil that's hidden deep
beneath the North Atlantic, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The offshore project went into production last November, 18
years after the huge Hibernia oil field was discovered east off
the Canadian province of Newfoundland.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring Plan Draws Positive Response from Deputies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The blueprint on institutional
restructuring of the State Council, a proposal submitted for
approval at today's meeting, has drawn positive response from
deputies at the First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
It represents a pressing need for the restructuring of the
economy set-up and economic growth, and therefore it is an
imperative and popular move, -- this is a view shared by a lot of
deputies after being briefed on the plan this morning.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, said China has undergone
profound changes in economic conditions since it has been shifted
from the traditional planned economy to socialist market economy.
Without the timely restructuring of government institutions and
change of functions, there would be negative impact on its future
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The plan submitted for approval by the State Council calls
for the reduction of ministries from 40 to 29.
</P>
<P>
"This is something we should have done earlier," said deputy
Hong Fuzeng, vice-chairman of Jiusan Society Central Committee,
one of eight non-Communist parties in China, in an interview. "It
will be a popular plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Li Zibin, mayor of Shenzhen, a booming special economic
zone adjoining Hong Kong, said the remarks by State Councillor Luo
Gan on the restructuring plan was burst with responses this
morning. "This means the institutional restructuring is on the
minds of the people and it's urgent move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a thorough and detailed plan which conforms with
the requirements in economic development," said Li Chengyu,
vice-governor of Henan Province.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The 70 largest conglomerates in
south China's Guangdong Province reported combined profits of
12.96 billion yuan (1.56 billion US dollars) in 1997, a
year-on-year rise of 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which resulted from efforts to reduce or
eliminate the production of both unmarketable product and items
with low demand, reversed the downturn in efficiency recorded in
early 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various groups introduced organizational
restructuring to establish integrated production, scientific
research and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five industrial enterprise groups accounted for 10.98
billion yuan of the aforementioned total profits, with 15 groups
in the commercial, trade and construction sectors accounting for
the balance.

Tian Chengping, secretary of the Qinghai CPC Provincial Party
Committee, said, "The enthusiastic applause from NPC deputies
showed that the government plan on institutional restructuring has
already been approved."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanmin, vice governor of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, said that the existing government structure was set up
in the course of a planned economy. It is now disadvantageous to
China's economic growth, reforms and a shift of economic
structuring and economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dongsheng, a deputy from northeast China's Liaoning
Province, said the current institutional restructuring is a though
reform which involves a wide range of fields.
</P>
<P>
Lu Gongxun, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanxi
Provincial People's Congress, described the institutional
restructuring as an issue of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Governor Wang Yunkun said that in the course of market
economy, government institutions must be simplified, unified and
highly effective. This is an effective measure to overcome
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Lu Kejian, chairman of the Ninth Provincial People's Congress
in Gansu, said, "State Councillor Luo Gan promised that the
government institutional restructuring would be implemented soon
after it is approved. Such speedy work style has an epoch-making
significance.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan deputy Zhang Yingwen said that institutional
restructuring is a big issue since the existing government
structure is separated from the practice of market economy, and
hinders the growth of productive forces. So the institutional
restructuring is now feasible and inevitable, he said.

<HEADLINE> President on Asian Financial Crisis, Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
stressed the importance of viewing southeast Asian financial
turmoil in proper perspective and called for providing care to
workers laid off as a result of enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis afflicting some Asian countries since late
last year has lasted longer than expected, said Jiang at a group
discussion attended by deputies to the National People's Congress,
in session here since yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"China has not been seriously affected," he said. "But we
should have a correct understanding of the situation. We should
not underestimate its negative impact on our economy."
</P>
<P>
"We should see both its challenges for our economic
development and opportunities it may bring us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should be confident that we can fend off the crisis,
consolidate the current good situation at home and seek further
development as long as we follow the principles decided by the
central authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the priority for the country now is to do a good job in
developing the national economy and ensure that development be
fast and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Talking about state enterprise reform, Jiang said the central
government has formulated a series of policies for such reform,
which should be carried out in an earnest way.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for governments at all levels to show care for
workers laid off as a result of state enterprise reform, and he
urged the launching of massive reemployment programs to provide
jobs for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
"Reemployment programs have a direct bearing on the success or
failure of state enterprise reform and must be put on the agenda
of Party committees and governments at all levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for creating more job opportunities. "Strenuous
efforts should be made to develop collective, self-employed and
private businesses and support medium and small enterprises so
that they can provide more jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president cautioned against laying off husband and wife at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
Governments should also formulate preferential policies to
encourage laid-off workers to find jobs by themselves or launch
their own businesses, he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls for U.N. Debate on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
Friday called on the United Nations Security Council to hold an
urgent meeting to seek measures to stem further escalation of
violent conflicts in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in Kosovo as "highly explosive,"
Kinkel urged the U.N. to extend its military presence in the
Republic of Macedonia which borders Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
must also employ all available instruments of preventive
diplomacy, including sending its special envoy Felipe Gonzales of
Spain again to Kosovo and an expansion of the OSCE peace mission
in Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also called for an immediate meeting of foreign
ministers of the region with the international contact group
consisting of the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany
and Italy in a bid to seek coordinated actions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Germany had a special interest in seeking a solution to the
Kosovo crisis due to the presence of about 140,000 Kosovo-Albanian
refugees in Germany, Kinkel stressed.
</P>
<P>
"What is extremely necessary now is the beginning of a dialogue
between Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo about
the future of the Serbian province," he said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his warning that "Belgrade's return ticket to
Europe is dependent on its attitude on the Kosovo issue."
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also urged the militants of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
to stop terrorist activities, saying terrorism, provocation and
violence would not serve their cause and would not be tolerated by
the international community.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Speak Highly of Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Many authoritative sources with
the theoretical circles today spoke highly of the eperience
China obtained over the past five years, which was summed up by
Premier Li Peng in his government work report.
</P>
<P>
The theorists, who are attending the First Session of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), heard the premier's report Thursday at the
opening meeting of the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members reached consensus that the five-point
experience included in the report is of great significance to the
future work of the Chinese government, and should be taken
as the principles for guidance.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuzhi, deputy director of the Party History Research
Center of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said the experience scored embodies the essence of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and should be observed both at present and in the future.
</P>
<P>
China has shunned major economic fluctuations and maintained
rapid, sound and sustained economic growth, which shows that the
central collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core has
become more matured and experienced in controlling complex
situation in the reform and opening-up, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chungui, vice-president of the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee, said the valuable experience, which was
obtained in the practice of building socialism, reflects the
country's current specific conditions in a "dialectical and
all-round way."
</P>
<P>
Many theorists said that they are satisfied with the strategies
of revitalizing the country with the use of science and education
and sustainable development, which were eluciated in Li Peng's
report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bai Gang, deputy director of the Political Science
Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
noted that "the experience will be of great importance to guiding
the country's development into the 21st century."

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has taken
a number of measures for the effective implementation of the
country's 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan, the official RSS
news agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
These measures include increasing the use of chemical

also encouraged in areas where agricultural infrastructure like
roads and irrigation facilities are intact.

A one-day workshop was organized here Friday to review progress
made in the past six months in carrying out the agricultural plan
and formulate a strategy for the future.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was jointly organized by Nepal's National Planning
Commission and the Asian Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Political Turf War Likely to Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's political turf war
could turn for worse as the prosecution has been investigating
opposition lawmakers over their possible involvement in a smear
conspiracy against President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has launched a probe into the allegation that
the powerful Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP)
established a task force before the presidential election last
December to smear Kim Dae-jung, a presidential candidate of then
opposition, as a pro-North candidate.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Friday that some lawmakers of the
opposition Grand National Party were involved in the the smear
plot masterminded by former ANSP high ranking officials, who
allegedly plotted to make use of a letter sent to Kim by Oh Ik-je,
the South Korean defector to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) who once served as Kim's adviser.
</P>
<P>
In the letter published by the ANSP in the run-up to the
presidential election, Oh said DPRK leader Kim Jong-il wanted Kim
Dae-jung to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Kim's ruling coalition, of the National
Congress for New Politics and United Liberal Democrats, urged the
prosecution to uncover the truth behind scene that the ANSP and
the former ruling camp GNP exploited the DPRK to its advantage in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the GNP reacted with tough words on Friday, saying it is a
political retaliation by the ruling camp against the GNP as the
investigation came just one day after the GNP refused to approve
President Kim's appointment of Kim Jong-pil as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"If the probe is politically motivated, our party will not sit
idle and we will strongly oppose it," said GNP spokesman Maeng
Hyung-kyu.
</P>
<P>
President Kim appointed his coalition ally Kim Jong-pil as
acting prime minister Tuesday after the GNP, the majority of the
South Korean National Assembly, or parliament, collectively cast
"unmarked" vote slips to veto the nomination of Kim Jong-pil as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The GNP said it is illegal for the president to have named an
acting prime minister, vowing that it will take all legal and
political measures, including asking the court to issue an
injunction, to suspend the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Party Theorist on Experience of Past Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The most important experience for
China in the past five years is adherence to the ideological line
of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, a noted
Party theorist said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview, Xing Bensi, a deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress, told Xinhua that every success China
has made in the past five years can be attributed to this
ideological line set forth by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue adhering to this line, and further develop it
by combining Deng Xiaoping Theory with new practices," said Xing,
who is a vice president of the Party School of the Communist Party
of China's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said a major reason for China to be able to maintain high
economic growth while keeping inflation at a fairly low level in
recent years is that the government has successfully handled the
relationship between reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth, if not accompanied by social stability, can't
bring great benefits to a country and its people," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He said that although economic development is currently the
central task for China, it's also necessary to seek synchronous
progress in other aspects, such as legal system building, culture,
science and technology and education, for a comprehensive social
advancement.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the central government for having improved its
macro-control capabilities in recent years while developing a
market economic system.
</P>
<P>
"The current major concern of the Chinese society is reform of
state-owned enterprises, which is also an issue of government
macro-control. It's very arduous work, but we have confidence in
doing it well," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to stress the importance of science, technology and
education to China's future development.
</P>
<P>
"The development of science, technology and education will not
only add impetus to China's development in the next few years, but
also enhance the country's competitive edge in the global
community in the next century," he commented.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping Theory is the basic guarantee for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century," he said.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties Play More Important Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's eight Non-Communist
parties are playing more important roles in China's political
life, according to leaders of these parties speaking at a press
conference sponsored by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, in session
here since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomingtang (RCCK) Central Committee, said that RCCK has
conducted investigations and research on a wide range of issues
relating to reform and opening up programs and offered relevant
proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the government have set great store by
many of the proposals such as those on building a clear and honest
government and speeding up reform of the pension system.
</P>
<P>
At the current session of CPPCC, the RCCK has put forward
proposals on promoting a co-ordinated economic development along
the Bohai Rim and on promoting family planning among the country's
large transient population, she said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poland Prioritizing Bid for Entry Into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek said Thursday the prioritized diplomatic effort this year
is to seek the approval by NATO members for his country's entry
into the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Parallel to the effort, said Geremek in his report to the
parliament on the government's current keynote foreign policies,
Poland will begin negotiations for gaining the country's
membership at the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The parliament later passed his report after eight hours of
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Poland will work to expand relations
with countries like the United States, Germany, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Poland's status in its region relys on its significance in
NATO and the EU," Geremek said, adding his country hopes to work
together with the Czech Republic and Hungary on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Poland will, as always, back the integration among the three
Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and will formulate
a policy toward these countries.
</P>
<P>
About relations with eastern neighbors, Geremek said Poland
hopes to have "friendly, equal and mutually beneficial" ties with
Russia and will further its strategic partnership with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In the same report, the foreign minister also expressed
willingness to expand economic relations with countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> UNHCHR: Actions Needed to Ensure Women's Rights Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
move from fine words to firm actions to ensure that the rights of
women everywhere are fully honored, United Nations High
Commissioner Mary Robinson said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights (UNHCHR), made the remarks on the occasion of the
International Women's Day to be celebrated on March 8.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights are women's rights too and the United Nations
must be the uncompromising guardian of women's human rights," she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the words of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights coupled with those of the Vienna Declaration in 1993,
and that of Beijing in 1995 stand in sharp contrast to the daily
life of so many women.
</P>
<P>
"Women throughout the world have found that declarations and
conventions are not enough to guarantee their human rights," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty, 70 percent are
women; the majority of the world's refugees are women; female
illiteracy is invariably higher than male illiteracy; women and
girl children are becoming commodities in cross-border
prostitution rackets and the pornography industry.
</P>
<P>
Millions of girls are still subject to genital mutilation,
women are regular victims of domestic violence and they are often
targeted in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The best hope for women to realize their human rights lies in
the efforts made by women themselves, said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she promised her office is to take practical and
creative measures to help women realize their human rights, such
as civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural
rights and the right to development.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Admits Bank Crime Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi admitted that bank robberies in
the country last year had increased compared with 1996, The Star
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trying to disperse doubts over the disparity between police
statistics for bank robberies and that produced by banks,
Mufamadi Thursday said the two accounts were different because
they covered different periods of time.
</P>
<P>
The Council of South African Banks (COSAB) said on Tuesday
that bank robberies had increased by 14 percent, from 408 in 1996
to 465 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, police records showed a 29.4 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the latest police data on bank robberies covered
the period from January to September 1997, while COSAB's figures
covered the whole year.
</P>
<P>
South African banks said they lost nearly 140 million Rand
(28.4 million U.S. dollars) in robberies last year, 29 percent
more than the amount lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Safety and Security and COSAB have a common
enemy, which they must fight together in order to end the scourge
of armed robberies," Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
Police statistics indicated that robberies with aggravating
circumstances had decreased, while ordinary robberies had
stabilized. But opposition parties rejected the figures, saying
they were not true.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mufamadi told parliament that the South
African Police Service had achieved major successes in
investigating the spate of robberies involving large amounts of
money, identifying and arresting some key suspects.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Work on the Yellow River
Xiaolangdi Hydropower Project has proceeded smoothly since the
river was dammed on October 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
The project, located in Luoyang, central China's Henan
Province, is expected to enhance safely during the forthcoming
flood season, according to a local administrative official.
</P>
<P>
The massive project, including the dam which is 1,667 meters
long and 154 meters high, is being constructed at a cost of
34.75 billion yuan, including World Bank loans totalling 1.1
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 41 percent of the total investment has been
expended to date, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Flood control facilities, including a cofferdam standing 185
meters in height and a leak-proof water retention wall with a
thickness of 1.2 meters, are scheduled to be completed in time to
control anticipated summer flooding.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Stresses Development, Stability for Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese Party official Hu
Jintao said here today that the Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China must attach equal importance to economic growth
and social stability for its long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made
the remarks during a panel discussion with the Tibet delegation
to the ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"We can't concentrate on economic growth without a stable and
orderly social environment and a political situation of stability
and unity; it's also out of the question to maintain long-term
stability without economic growth, social progress and improvement
in people's life," Hu told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Tibetan people to take a clear-cut stand to
maintain national and ethnic unity, and oppose any activity aimed
to split the motherland and undermine ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the autonomous regional government to broadly
conduct education on patriotism and ethnic unity in a
down-to-earth manner, and spare no effort to foster and train a
contingent of highly-competent officials with a Tibetan majority.
</P>
<P>
He said it is of great importance to unite patriotic people of
all ethnic groups and social sectors and combine their forces to
add impetus to the development of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to carry out the religious policy of the
Communist Party and the government in real earnest," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the Tibet Autonomous regional government
push forward reforms in accordance with local realities, and pay
full respect to the people's wishes while taking new reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who once served as autonomous regional Party secretary in
Tibet, expressed his great concerns and solicitude for the
herdspeople in northern Tibet, who were inflicted by the worst
blizzards in decades in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"The local government should make good arrangements for
people's life in the disaster-stricken regions, and make efforts
to improve these regions' capability of preventing and resisting
future disasters," he urged.

HAIKOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Investors from Taiwan have invested
a total capital of close to 200 million US dollars to establish 233
agricultural companies in Hainan, China's southernmost island

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urges Constructive Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria Thursday urged the
conflicting parties in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province for a
constructive dialogue to prevent the crisis from worsening into a
regional security threat.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said Bulgaria was deeply worried over the
possibility that the violence between Serbian authorities and
ethnic Albanians could spread into other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement quoted by a Bulgarian Telegraph Agency report,
the ministry warned against the crisis in Kosovo could pose as a
threat against the security and stability of the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, a neighbor of Yugoslavia under which Kosovo is a
province, believed that other countries in the region should work
together to avoid further conflicts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Thursday, Joseph Lopez, the NATO
commander of forces in southern Europe, said the western military
alliance hoped to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people died the same day in a clash in the Srbica
region, about 30 kilometers west of Kosovo province's capital of
Pristina, said a report of Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo heightened last weekend when four policemen
and 16 Albanians were killed in an armed clash.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since
1981.

<HEADLINE> Video to Help Soccer Referees in Paris World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- For the first time video cameras
will be introduce to the World Cup to help referees decide whether
a ball crosses the goal line, according to soccer's world
governing body FIFA here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At FIFA has set the rules of soccer _ asked the English
Football Association to work with universities to develop
technology that might be used to avoid goalscoring controversies.
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials emphasized that the move is only a trial, and
that video evidence will not be used to judge other incidents,
such as tackles or handball.
</P>
<P>
Under the laws of soccer, the whole of the ball must cross the
whole of the line for a goal to be awarded.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, several goal-line decisions have proved
controversial.
</P>
<P>
In another decision, FIFA said that referees must send off any
player committing a tackle from behind that is deemed to "endanger
the safety of an opponent."
</P>
<P>
The move, which will come into force in time for this summer's
World Cup, will likely prove controversial as referees, players
and coaches have criticized earlier FIFA rulings that force
referees' hand in disciplining players.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will take action against any referee that fails to
automatically send off a player after such an incident.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Deputies Yearn For Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Fan Zengsheng, a Taiwan-born
deputy to the on-going Ninth National People's Congress, said,
"Many of my friends in Taiwan described my decision on return to
the motherland in 1979 as an insighted move."
</P>
<P>
Fan, born in Taiwan in 1939, was a graduate of a marine
university in Taiwan and left to study in the United States in
1970s.
</P>
<P>
"I returned to the Chinese mainland in 1980 under the
inspiration of the 1979 US trip by Deng Xiaoping, who called the
students to return to the motherland and work and contribute to
its modernization program."
</P>
<P>
"At that time, my friends in Taiwan mocked at me and cursed me.
But I was convinced that China has a bright future and the
motherland will get reunified sooner or later," he added.
</P>
<P>
"People of Taiwan origin are fully confident in China's
reunification after the transfer of power in Hong Kong," said Fan,
who is now deputy director of the Shanghai Harbor Administrative
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Another Taiwan deputy, named Chen Weiwen, is currently working
at the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine which
has enrolled over 300 Taiwan students.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yanjun said, "I am proud of being a NPC deputy and have
the opportunity to participate in discussing state affairs."
</P>
<P>
A deputy, named Wei Lihui, said, "When I studied abroad in the
1980s, many of my relatives did not want to meet me, but they
invited me to dinner one after another today."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation has 13 deputies who represent some 34,000
Taiwan compatriots residing on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guoqing, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots, said, "After the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland in 1997, Macao will follow suit in 1999. And I hope
that Taiwan authorities will clearly see these changes."

<HEADLINE> Economists on Economic Growth Rate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists share the view
that China is able to achieve an eight percent economic growth
rate in 1998 as proposed by the government and offer ideas about
how to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
The economists are here attending the annual session of the
Nation Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
An economic growth rate of five to six percent can be generally
regarded as "high," but for China, it is necessary to aim higher
since a one percentage point growth in gross domestic product
(GDP) would bring three to four million job opportunities. This is
a prevailing view from the economists.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a Beijing University professor, enumerated a host
of factors that favor a growth rate of eight percent this year,
including record grain reserves and other important raw materials,
a high savings rate among the Chinese people, low inflation, and
more channels for enterprises to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
Xiao calculated that, to maintain a growth rate of eight
percent, there should be about 600 billion yuan worth of
additional demand for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiao, three factors have a direct bearing on GDP
growth, namely investment, consumption and net exports.
</P>
<P>
"Since it is likely that China's exports will be affected by
the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and currency devaluation in
the Republic of Korea and since a slowdown in income increases for
both rural and urban residents since last year has resulted in
sluggish demand, growth has to be driven chiefly by increased
investment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Agriculture, Reform of State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today stressed the
importance of agriculture, the reform of state-owned enterprises
and the wellbeing of laid-off workers during a panel discussion of
the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture should be given priority in economic work,"
because a large proportion of the population in north China's
Hebei Province is engaged in agriculture, Li Peng told the NPC
deputies from province.
</P>
<P>
To achieve sustained and steady growth of agriculture, the
capability to withstand natural calamities should be strengthened,
the structure of agriculture and the mix of farm produce should be
readjusted, and farming production should be industrialized, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the reform of the state-owned enterprises, Li
said leading bodies of the enterprises should give guidance to all
workers and staffers, so as to help them become market economy
oriented; and the enterprises should conduct technological
upgrading, and a sound leadership is a decisive factor to
contribute to the good performance of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Premier Li Peng called on local governments to take
effective measures to the aid of the laid-offs and expand channels
for reemploy them through the means of vocational training and
relocation, so as to ensure smooth reform and social stability.

Xiao said China should strive to increase investment in capital
construction projects by more than 400 billion yuan in 1998. The
government should also direct people's savings deposits totaling
4.8 trillion yuan into investment areas.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, also a well-known economist, said China has
gradually moved from a society of shortages to a buyers' market --
there are now more goods than people would like to buy. The
government should guide individual investors to put their money in
areas considered as new economic boosters.
</P>
<P>
In Dong's view, such new economic boosters are infrastructure
construction, new and high-tech, technical upgrading of
enterprises, environmental protection, farmland improvement and
irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
He Keng, deputy head of the State Statistical Bureau and Zheng
Bonian, director of Inner Mongolia Economic and Social Development
Research Center, called for launching more infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
Investors can take advantage of cheap cement and steel to build
railways, highways, gas facilities and telecom facilities, they
said.
</P>
<P>
"This can have ripple effects boosting housing and auto
industries in addition to driving economic growth," He Keng said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, announced not long ago that China will invest a total
of one trillion US dollars in fixed assets investment before the
end of the century to ensure economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, also a renowned economist, proposed fine-tuning
economic policies, saying the government should appropriately
encourage consumption by making credit available for car and
housing purchases (by individuals).
</P>
<P>
The economists also warn against doing two foolish things -- to
boost the production of unsellable goods by loosening credit and
to engage in repetitive construction.

<HEADLINE> Joint Committee Formed to Pave Way for Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 6 (Xinhua)-- Somali faction leaders, Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and Abdulkadir Mohamed Aden Zoppe, agreed upon the
appointment of a joint political and technical committee on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between the two sides in the capital, the faction
leaders set off towards the implementation of the Cairo agreement
concerning the conflict settlement in Somalia's disputed
southwestern regions dominated by the Rahanwein communities.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued shortly after the meeting
on Thursday, the two sides have appointed the 11-member joint
committee chaired by a Rahanwein leader which will travel to the
regions of Bay and Bakol on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The members of the committee will pave the way for the
convening of the Baidoa national reconciliation conference due to
be held by the end of this month by separating the combatant
militiamen from both sides.
</P>
<P>
They will also work on the modalities in which a coalition
force would be deployed to replace Hussein Aidid's militiamen in
accordance with the Cairo peace deal singed on 21 December, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new coalition forces is said to be defending those regions
from what they called "the enemy" during the national meeting in
which an interim government for Somalia will be established.
</P>
<P>
The press release signed by the two leaders has called on the
people of Bay and Bakol regions to help the efforts of
pacification and reconciliation among the people in those regions
by the newly appointed joint committee.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid and Abdulkadir Zoppe have also urged the people
in those regions to unify their strength against whatever is
threatening the security in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the two factions have appealed to the international
community to help the Somalis morally and materially in convening
the national reconciliation conference in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The two regions of Bay and Bakol have been a conflict zone
between the Rahanwein communities and Hussein Aidid's men since
late General Aidid invaded those regions early September, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at a time when a series of consultative
meetings continue between Mogadishu's leaders in the capital in
an attempt of finding an inclusive administration for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A power sharing compromise still seems to be beyond the reach
of Mogadishu's faction leaders, observers said here.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Burundi's Demand for Lifting Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- France supports Burundi's demand for
lifting the economic embargo imposed on the central African state
by its neighbors, said Burundian President Pierre Buyoya Friday.
</P>
<P>
In meeting Buyoya at the Elysee presidential palace, French
President Jacques Chirac "deplored" the embargo extended by eight
African countries last month, said sources close to Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was effective 18 months ago after Buyoya came to
power in a bloodless coup staged by the Tutsi-led military to
overthrow the elected Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
"The French authorities have confirmed what they have always
said, that the embargo should be reviewed," said Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, here since Wednesday for a three-day visit, said the
Hutus and Tutsis of Burundi are on the way of reconciliation "on
an internal and external level," and the Burundian government has
"very clear projects" for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French presidential sources said the meeting between
Chirac and Buyoya was "long and very trustful."
</P>
<P>
Buyoya briefed Chirac on "the primary results from the efforts
of his government for national reconciliation" and on the "grave
consequences from the embargo on his country," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya also asked France to help seek aid from international
financial institutions and to provide aid in education, public
health and re-settlement of Burundian refugees driven out of their
homes during the three-year civil war starting October 1993.
</P>
<P>
At least 150,000 people have been killed in the civil war
between Hutus and Tutsis which devastated the country's economy.

The agreement calls for EximBank to grant loans totalling 4.2
million US dollars to the corporation, with the latter relending
the funds to a Cameroonian tire plant and tractor assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
The two Cameroonian projects, which China's Gansu Tire Plant

firms, are expected to benefit the growth of Cameroon's rubber,
farm machinery and agricultural sectors, in addition to boosting
China's exports of machinery, equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
EximBank, a policy-oriented bank established in 1994 to finance
China's exports of electronics, machinery and complete sets of
equipment, was assigned responsibility for granting preferential
Chinese government loans to foreign countries in 1995. By the end
of February this year, EximBank had signed some 30-odd loan
agreements with over a dozen recipient countries, including Sudan,
Cote Divoire, Gabon, Papua New Guinea and Guyana.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Calls for Formulating Supervisory Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A legislator in east China's
Zhejiang Province said here today that he would set forth a motion
on the promulgation of a supervisory law at the ongoing First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The motion should list specifications concerning the guiding
principles, contents, scope, procedures to go through and methods
of supervision, said Lin Xicai, chairman of the Standing Committee
of Taizhou City People's Congress, who is attending the Ninth
NPC's First Session held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It should also standardize supervision over the deliberations
and approval of government work reports, economic and social
development plans, financial budgets and final accounts.
</P>
<P>
To date, some laws are still not fully enforced or implemented
to the letter in some areas and departments, he said. A small
number of officials even misuse their power and become corrupted,
to the detriment of the interests of the state and the people.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced supervision by the people's congress is absolutely
essential for putting an and to corruption and other social evils
by a few functionaries in the executive, legislature and judicial
departments in accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, supervision by the people's congress is an
important component part of the people's congress system and a key
factor to giving full scope to the role of this legal system. Yet,
he added, this is the weak link in the related work of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Though the NPC and its Standing Commitare vested with the
supervisory power, there are still no detailed stipulations on the
content, procedures and methods of supervision. This has much to
do with the lack of a supervision law based on China's specific
conditions, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Audience Enthusiastic About British Theater's Othello </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- On a Beijing stage tonight, when
Othello strangled Desdemona and uttered his famous lines, the
Chinese audience's long applause showed their understanding of and
interest in this drama classic.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 people crowded into the Children's Art Theater in
the center of Beijing for their first taste of the Shakespearean
tragedy in English (with Chinese subtitles) performed by a British
troupe. The play, which was written in 1604, about the love of a
Moorish military leader for a girl of noble birth, is being
performed by the Royal National Theatre, the world's foremost
group of its kind.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shakespeare enthusiasts milled around outside the
theater looking for a last-minute chance to get in, even after the
performance had started, because the tickets were all gone a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yong, a teacher from the nearby city of Tianjin, who made
it to the theater after a two-hour drive, said, "Shakespeare
belongs to the whole world, and his works are a perfect study of
manipulation and human vulnerability."
</P>
<P>
Martin Davidson, a Counselor at the British Embassy in Beijing,
told Xinhua that the performance is the most important cultural
exchange program between China and Britain since the handover of
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Othello" is part of a series of exchange activities in
accordance with a Sino-British cultural affairs agreement. The
Royal National Theatre's performance of "Othello" debuted in Hong
Kong last week, where it was warmly received, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and China will have further exchanges this year in the
economy, science and technology, education, and culture, and the
drama is a good start, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Chinese theaters and art troupes that are interested in
Shakespeare have put on Chinese versions of his most renowned
plays, including "Hamlet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "The
Taming of the Shrew."
</P>
<P>
Li Moran, a leading Chinese dramatist, played the role of King
Lear 12 years ago, but, he's never witnessed a Shakespeare play
performed by dramaists from Shakespeare's own country, he said. He
spoke highly of David Harewood, the black dramatist who is
playing the title role, for his excellent acting and understanding.
</P>
<P>
For the past two months, Britain and China have had a number of
exchange programs in education, publishing, and the arts, sources
from the British Council in China and the China Performing Arts
Agency of the Chinese Ministry of Culture, who organized the
performance, said.
</P>
<P>
In its 35 years of existence, the Royal National, which was
Established in October 1963, has gained a formidable reputation
worldwide for the work by its people, like Sam Mendes, the
artistic director of "Othello," and Laurence Olivier, the first
director.

<HEADLINE> Detailed Plan on Restructuring of State Council (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, state councillor and
secretary-general of the State Council, made detailed explanations
about the blueprint concerning Institutional Restructuring of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), Luo Gan expounded the restructuring of
departments engaged in macro-economic control and special economic
sectors, those in charge of education, science and technology,
social security and resources, and administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
The main duties of macro-economic departments are to maintain
an overall economic balance, curbing inflation, and optimizing
economic structure so as to achieve a sustained, rapid and sound
development of the economy, Luo Gan said.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission will be renamed the State
Development Planning Commission. The State Economic and Trade
Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China
will be retained.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strengthen the State Council's leadership over
economic restructuring, the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy will be turned into a high-level deliberation body headed
by the premier with relevant ministers serving as its members.
And it will not be included into the series of component
departments under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The main responsibilities of specialized economic management
departments are to formulate sectoral programs and policies,
readjust the product mix of the sectors, and maintain the order of
competitiveness on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Such special economic departments should all practice the
separation of administration from business operation, effectively
change their functions and they no longer directly administer
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The relations between government and state-owned enterprises
are as follows: the government will enjoy the owner's equity
according to the amount of capital it has invested into
enterprises, send supervisory commissioners to enterprises who
will oversee the latter's capital operation and profiteering or
money-losing situation.
</P>
<P>
The government will also be held responsible for appraisal,
appointment and removal of principal leaders of enterprises.

On the other hand, enterprises will, according to law, manage
the operation on their own, take responsibility for their own
profits and losses, and turn in taxes according to relevant
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, enterprises will be responsible for keeping and
increasing the value of state-owned assets and cannot harm the
rights and interests of owners.
</P>
<P>
The ministries of railways, communications, construction,
agriculture, water resources, foreign trade and economic
cooperation will be kept.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry will be set up on the
basis of the existing Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and
Ministry of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
The new ministry will be held responsible for invigorating the
manufacture business of information products, telecommunications
and software industries, formulating sectoral programs, policies
and laws codes, mapping out overall plan for telecommunications
trunk networks (including local and long-distance
telecommunications networks), broadcast and television networks
(including radio and cable television networks), and special-use
telecommunications networks for military departments and other
departments.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will exercise sectoral management, allocation of
resources rationally, avoid overlapping projects and ensure
information security,
</P>
<P>
The government functions for information and network
management in the Ministry of Broadcast, Film and Television,
China Aerospace Industry Corporation and the China Aviation
Industry Corporation will be incorporated into the Ministry of
Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
The new ministry will also take charge of the State Postal
Bureau which is to be founded.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National

<HEADLINE> Number of HK Drug Abusers Drops in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of reported drug
abusers in Hong Kong totaled 17,555 in 1997, down 10.8 percent
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
More encouraging was that the number of young drug abusers also
dropped by 14.3 percent compared with 1996, Commissioner for
Narcotics Clarie Lo quoted figures from the Central Registry of
Drug Abuse (CRDA) as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a quarterly meeting of the Action Committee Against
Narcotics (ACAN), Lo said: "A total of 3,135 drug abusers aged
below 21 were reported in 1997 as compared with 3,656 in 1996."
</P>
<P>
There was also a small decrease in the number of female drug
abusers in 1997 when 2,216 abusers were reported compared with
2,429 in 1996, she said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in drug abuser figures was consistent with the
downward movement of drug-related factors such as reported crimes,
persons receiving treatment and admissions to drug treatment
agencies, according to ACAN.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding this observation, a thorough study on factors
affecting the drug abuse trend in Hong Kong was recently
commissioned by ACAN with a view to identifying the underlying
factors that affect the size, complexity and characteristics of
the drug abuse population in Hong Kong. The study will be
completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
More resources will be devoted to stepping up the beat drugs
campaign this year. The budget for ACAN's 1998-1999 preventive
education and publicity program amounts to about 5.1 million HK
dollars (654,000 U.S. dollars).

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Successful coding has made the
Tibetan language fit for use on the Internet, according to a
deputy to the National People's Congress, in session here since
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan has thus become the first language of an ethnic
minority in China to be usable in a computer age.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain, who is a
Tibetan from Gansu Province, a Tibetan-Chinese bilingual
information system has been successfully developed by more than 20
computer specialists and Tibetan teachers of the Northwest China
Institute of Nationalities.
</P>
<P>
A major component of the system is computer-oriented coding of
the Tibetan language, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other components of the system include designs of typefaces for
Tibetan characters, a data-bank relating to King Gesser -- a
well-known Tibetan epic, and Tibetan medicine-related data and
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The system has been assessed as up to standard by a group of
specialists, according to Jamyang.
</P>
<P>
A living Buddha, Jamyang is head of the Lapuleng Monastery in
Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The information system is expected to help promote the
development of information technology in areas inhabited by the
ethnic group as well as information exchanges in the Tibetan
language, he said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Warns Against OPEC Meeting in Hurry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has warned members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) against
hurrying into holding an emergency meeting this month, the
official Qatari news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to other OPEC states, Qatar's Energy Minister
Abdullah Bin Hamad al-Attiya said the chances for the success of
such a meeting would be "very slim" unless "careful preparations"
were made, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members should clarify the objectives of the meeting with
guarantee in mind to completely adhere to their oil output quotas
awarded by the bloc, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The letter came after OPEC Secretary General Riwanu Lukman
invited the group's 12 members to attend a scheduled four-man
monitoring committee meeting in Vienna on March 16 to discuss
ways of propping up sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The prices have lost by more than 30 percent in the past four
months and crashed down to 14 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The price collapse was due to ample supplies and declined
demand in world markets, which were triggered by OPEC's November
decision to raise its combined output ceiling by 10 percent to
27.5 million barrels per day, a mild winter in northern
hemisphere as well as Asia's economic turmoil.

<P>
HEFEI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- To people in Hongshan village in
east China's Anhui Province, farmer Zhu Xuncai is more mature and
far-sighted after nine years of doing transient jobs in large
cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
This year, after a short reunion with families during China's
traditional Spring Festival, Zhu didn't go to urban areas as he
had formerly done every year. What he did instead was talk with
local officials about buying a timber mill in their small village.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to make a fortune outside; my hometown also
has many opportunities," he said, admitting that cities still have
some attractions.
</P>
<P>
He plans to invest 2.1 million yuan in the mill and employ 110
farmers from the village.
</P>
<P>
Zhu had been one of the millions of surplus laborers in China's
rural areas who left their home for cities to make more
money. Their urban flow had set off a surge of transient workers
since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Now, the wave has entered a new stage where an increasing
number of former transient workers returned home from the cities
to start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that 80 million farmers go to urban
areas every year, but 15 percent of those return.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Anhui's agricultural sector shows that 37.6 percent
of the province's 4 million farmers now working in cities want to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's latest weekly air
quality report revealed that the Chinese capital continued to
suffer from comparatively poor environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The city's air pollution index for the period between February
27 and March 5 stood at 203, with the ranking indicating a medium
pollution level.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen and oxygen compounds constituted the major pollutants,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began issuing weekly air quality reports last week,
with the first report showing an index of 206.
</P>
<P>
China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)
classifies air quality in five grades, with an index of under 50
representing good environmental conditions. Relatively good
conditions fall between 50 amd 100; slight levels between 101 and
200; medium levels between 201 to 301; and serious pollution over
300.
</P>
<P>
"The use of coal and motor vehicle emissions are the major
factors creating pollution in Beijing," according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the local environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city ranks first amongst capital cities worldwide with
annual coal consumption standing at 28 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has over 1.2 million motor vehicles, up
three-fold on only ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities plan to extend great efforts to improve
the air quality over the next three years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Measures to Deal With Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will have more severe
water rationing for homes and farms since the island is suffering
from the worst drought in its history.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and
Environment Costas Themistocleous has declared water emergency on
the island, local press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that "we are really in a very
difficult situation. The dams are nearly empty. So, we have to
take some measures in order to reduce the supply of water."
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment by the Water Development
Department (WDD), all reservoirs on the island now hold only 12.2
percent of their capacity, with a mere 33 million cubic meters of
water.
</P>
<P>
Dam inflow from rainfall runoff totaled only 12.7 million
cubic meters this meteorological year, compared to a 10-year
average annual inflow of 87 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
This east Mediterranean island mainly relies on rainfall for
its water supply.
</P>
<P>
Haris Omorphos, spokesman for the WDD, said that the drought's
bite and its tenacity, which is now in its fourth year, make it
the worst dry spell in Cyprus history.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other way to solve the problem, except to reduce
the supply of water below current levels, mainly in the
agricultural sector and also in the housing sector," Omorphos
said.
</P>
<P>
He expected the Council of Ministers (cabinet) will soon study
the situation and announce a new water rationing regime.
</P>
<P>
Other measures taken to solve the water shortage problem
include a plan to build a second seawater desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to continue subsidizing borehole
drilling to provide homes with water for toilets (underground
water is not suitable for drinking) and it will make available
recycled waste water for any crops.
</P>
<P>
The WDD is now planning to complete a pipeline by the end of
March, linking between the Dhekelia desalination plant on
southeastern coast and Nicosia, to carry desalinated seawater to
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Dhekelia desalination plant, which was operational early
last year, will raise the output to its maximum of 40,000 cubic

<P>
Like Zhu, Xu Licun returned home to Anhui in 1994 after three
years of working in Shenzhen as a salesman. With the support of
the local government, Xu contracted for a state cold-storage plant
in his hometown and changed it to a privately owned forage mill.
</P>
<P>
After three years, Xu's mill is now capable of producing 40
tons of forage per day. Recently, he also invested 1 million yuan
to set up branches in other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Xu's long-term plan is to turn his mill into the largest in the
province.
</P>
<P>
With experience, money and -- more importantly -- a broadened
horizon obtained from working in urban areas, these formerly
transient workers have become a new driving force for rural
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that 100,000 workers have returned
to Anhui to start their own businesses, absorbing 700,000 rural
laborers and producing an annual output of 5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have become aware of this new
trend. China's central government has asked local bodies to guide
these local entrepreneurs on the track of healthy development and
protect their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the wave of transient workers has caused
instability in urban areas and Spring Festival transport problems
as workers migrated home for the holiday. To solve these problems,
China defines its policy as encouraging an "orderly flow" of rural
surplus laborers and for them to seek opportunities in their
hometowns.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Transit Route to Bangladesh Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has agreed
to extend Nepal's use of a transit route running through India to
Bangladesh, The Kathmandu Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"A letter from Indian authorities informing us about the
extension granted to the Phulbari (transit route) has been
received," the daily quoted Nepali Foreign Secretary Murari Raj
Sharma as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention the duration of the extension.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu said in a statement that the
operating mode of the route will remain the same as before pending
a review.
</P>
<P>
The Kakarvitta-Phulbari-Banglabandh transit route, long-awaited
for land-locked Nepal, was granted by Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral in early June last year as a good-will gesture during
his visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The transit route runs from Kakarvitta, Nepal's eastern gateway
to India, to Phulbari in northeastern India and then to
Bangladesh's Mongla port.
</P>
<P>
The transit route went into operation on September 1, 1997, on
a six-month trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said however that instead of boosting Nepal's
trade with Bangladesh and other countries as expected, the transit
route remained idle most of the time due to the small number of
trucks and containers on the Nepalese part and other problems.
</P>
<P>
Much of Nepal's foreign trade is still dependent as before on
India's Calcutta port.

<HEADLINE> Portion of 1,000-Year-Old Letter Located in U.S. Auction House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cultural relics expert
today appealed for the return of a piece of a treasured ancient
letter, which was found recently in the New York branch of
Christie's auction house.
</P>
<P>
Christie's was scheduled to sell its portion of the letter
written by an ancient Chinese duke for an opening bid of 300,000
U.S. dollars on March 24, said Cao Jinyan, vice-curator of the
Zhejiang Museum.
</P>
<P>
A careful examination by experts determined that the piece of the
letter in New York and the one with two dukes' handwritings in the
Zhejiang Museum have the same origin and date back 1,000
years. The two pieces became separated more than 600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two parts of the document, regarded as a national treasure,
were reunited in Shanghai on March 2 for a cultural relics
appraisal. Cao expressed his hope that Christie's sale of the
letter is delayed until funds are raised for its return to China.
</P>
<P>
According to Cao, Christie's in an auction notification in
early February asked the Zhejiang Museum whether it was willing to
compete with other buyers. Qian Chu, writer of the letter who was
on the throne between 948 and 978, governed the area which is part
of modern Zhejiang Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
In its notification by mail, Christie's stated that the letter
to be auctioned bore seals, signatures and annotations by 43
well-known ancient Chinese painters.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Museum responded that it owns a precious piece of
handwriting which might be related to the Christie's property.
</P>
<P>
After consulting the Complete Works of Chinese Fine Arts, which
has the picture of the letter, the auction house's experts
confirmed that they are twins.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, their Shanghai meeting proved the correlation in
paper, printing and calligraphic style.
</P>
<P>
Qian, the duke of the Wuyue Kingdom, handed down the letter to
his descendants, who had separated the original copy during war years.
</P>
<P>
One of the descendants donated a piece of the letter to the
museum in 1951. But the other half had been lost for hundreds of
years.
</P>
<P>
"I extremely hope that the other part of the national treasure
will come back to its homeland," Cao said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Friday
warmly welcomed the government work report delivered Thursday by
Premier Li Peng at the opening Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They carried editorials or ran special columns for the session,
hailing the government work report as a practical and realistic
document which inspires the Hong Kong people's confidence in the
country's modernization drive and its future as well.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily's editorial said the government
work report has given a clear message to the people throughout the
country and abroad that China is full of confidence in marching
forward into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
While summing up the achievements that the country has made in
every field over the past five years, the editorial said that the
document has also pointed out the existing problems such as low
economic efficiency in some state-owned enterprises and increasing
number of laid-off workers as well as corruption, and also put
forward suggestions to solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
The document has also spoken highly of social stability and
sound economy in Hong Kong since it returned to the motherland
last July and set tasks for the country's peaceful reunification
and tasks in the fields of diplomacy, defense, culture and
education.
</P>
<P>
An editorial by Ta Kung Pao described the government work
report as practical and realistic.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Li Peng's government work report mentioned Hong
Kong's smooth return to the motherland, reaffirming that a series
of principles of "one country, two systems", "the Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy will be
continuously carried out.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Central People's Government gives full
support to the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's editorial said that the government work report has
greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the Hong Kong people
and their confidence in the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people's fate is closely linked with that of their
motherland. The country's bright future will provide a powerful
guarantee for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the editorial
said.

LUANDA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
former rebel forces, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), have not accepted the new
proposal suggested by UN official here after two day's heated
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The proposal put forward by UN Deputy Representative Behrooz
Sadry on March 3, said that UNITA should guarantee to be totally
non-militarized by Thursday, and the government declares UNITA as
a legal political party by Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 12-points proposal also outlines that the UNITA radio
station to stop broadcasting by Saturday and the UNITA military
dismantle all its forces by Sunday.

proposal under the mediation of UN peace observation group and
the Portuguese and Russian representatives, hold different views
mainly on the time for the dismantle of UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
The government also insisted that UNITA, as an independent
political party, should not have its own military forces.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA representative at the joint committee of the Angolan
peace process, Isaias Samakuva, said that UNITA has never
promised to issue a non-militarization communique.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong opened its annual
flower show at the Victoria Park on Friday to display a wide range of
spectacular plants from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung, secretary for justice, officiated the opening
ceremony of the flower show this morning, the first after Hong
Kong's reunification with China.

</P>
<P>
Hydrangea, known for its beautiful florets, is selected as the
theme flower at the show, which came to its 12th session this
year. The organizers said that they hope hydrangea to bring joy
and vitality to Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 flower associations are participating in the
ten-day show. With tiny green plants, horticulturists from
southern China's Zhongshan city created statues of dolphin, an
oceanic animal taken as Hong Kong's mascot. Professional gardeners
from Beijing designed a map of China with thousands of flowers, to
illustrate the reunification of Hong Kong with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have received a total of 2,300 entries for this

<P>
However, radiation technology provides an environmentally clean
way to reduce infestations and quarantines of bulk grain being
imported or allocated through ports.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will grant 452,000 U.S. dollars of assistance to the
project, which will be implemented by the Tsinghua Science Park of
Tsinghua University.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, a grain radiation facility will be
installed at the Fangcheng port of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in Southwest China, one of the country's most impoverished
areas.
</P>
<P>
The radiation facility is expected to handle one million tons
of grain a year and reduce post-harvest grain losses by 100,000
tons, which is enough to feed 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
With financial assistance from the World Bank, Fangcheng is
becoming the largest grain transportation hub in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Grain going through the port, which has an annual handling
capacity of 1.6-to-2.15 million tons, will go to 120 million

<HEADLINE> NPC, CPPCC Sessions Conducive to HK's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The successful opening of the
sessions of both the National People's Congress (NPC) and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be
surely conducive to Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by Wen Wei Po on Thursday said the two
sessions will give an impetus to China's modernization drive and
at the same time bring benefits to Hong Kong's development in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that during the sessions, a new state
leadership upholding Deng Xiaoping's theory and the policies of
reform and opening up will be elected.
</P>
<P>
This will not only ensure the country's political stability,
but also boost Hong Kong people's confidence in their future, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the deepening of reforms in the country
will also help attract more investment from Hong Kong
industrialists and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of reform has been put on reorganizing or
canceling departments directly in charge of economic management
and reinforcing departments handling macro-economic control and
those enforcing the law and supervising law enforcement, and the
reform will change administrative patterns of the planned economy
in a relatively thorough way and facilitate the development of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
So, it will help bring into play Hong Kong businessmen's
initiatives of investment in the inland areas so as to promote
Hong Kong's economic development, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the reform of the state-owned enterprises
will provide a very good chance for Hong Kong businessmen,
rendering timely help to Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that the two ongoing sessions in
Beijing and the new Chinese leadership to be elected will take a
series of measures to promote the governing of the state by rule
of law so as to ensure the whole society's orderly progress.
</P>
<P>
This will be conducive not only to guaranteeing social
stability and economic growth in the inland areas, but also to
implementing the Basic Law and maintaining Hong Kong's stability
and prosperity, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said the nation is in a much stable position
economically with inflation as low as 0.25 percent over the last
six months.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, in his first six-month
report of 1997/98 to the parliament Thursday, Meles said if the
present trend continues Ethiopia will be a country with inflation
below one percent for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the revenue the country has derived from foreign
trade in the last six months exceeds by 24 percent the sum
obtained over the same period of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"If this persists in the coming six months, the country would
be able to register an over 20 percent growth in its foreign
trade for three consecutive years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the national production growth is expected to be
lower this year due to a fall in agricultural production owing to
rain failure and untimely rains.
</P>
<P>
He said agricultural production is expected to dwindle this
fiscal year as a result of rain failure precipitating food
shortage in the various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said food secured in aid and purchased with government
budget is being rationed among the needy in the drought affected
areas, adding that no casualty has so far been reported from the
drought affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The small rain season (February-May) rains this year has
started off well, he said, and added that central and regional
governments have joined efforts in distributing selected seed and
fertilizers to help farmers make the best use of the rain.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the budget, Meles said government has collected in
the first six months 3,438 million Birr (494 million U.S.
Dollars) in revenue accomplishing 49 percent of its annual
target.
</P>
<P>
He said government expenditure totaled 3,227 million Birr (464
million U.S. Dollars) accounting for 32.6 percent of its annual
plan, adding that untimely rain and delay in construction works
have forced the expenditure to fall below the target.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Two-thousand Chinese and foreign
women attended a reception in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing today to mark the 88th anniversary of the "March 8"
International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
The social status of Chinese women has improved during the past
year, said Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress and president of the All-China
Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Such steps as implementing the Law on Protection of the Rights
and Interests of Chinese Women and the Program for the Development
of Chinese Women have been taken as follow-up actions to the
world's Fourth Women's Conference, Chen said at the reception.
</P>
<P>
The number of women elected to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and the Ninth Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), both of which are currently
holding their first sessions in Beijing, have increased compared
with previous years, she said, adding that the number of women

while the number for the Ninth CPPCC is 341, or 16 percent of the
total.
</P>

unremitting efforts to achieve the goals of prosperity and
progress for all women in the world.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nigeria Enters Vital Stage of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- As the Nigerian military government
transition to civil rule program is close to the end, Head of
State General Sani Abacha will in "a few weeks' time" decide
whether or not to contest the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The decision is to break the impasse in the country's
political development as there are less than five months to go
and no presidential candidate has been produced.
</P>
<P>
With increasing request for Abacha to run the race, the head
of state will be engaged in consultations with his colleagues,
friends and family members before making any decision, according
to Abacha's political adviser Alhaji Sule Hamma.
</P>
<P>
Hamma disclosed this at the closing earlier Thursday of the
two-million-man rally in the capital Abuja, an important move by
pro-Abacha groups to draft him to the race.
</P>
<P>
Hamma assured the Nigerian youth that Abacha was not the type
of leader who would disappoint the nation when faced with hard
decisions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Abacha has over the past four years received
countless appeals from representatives of the people from all
sections and sectors that he present himself for election.
</P>
<P>
However, Abacha has kept silent till today, a posture many
observers believe to wait for the right time to make an
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Now the time is there as the massive carnival-like rally is
seen as the high tide of the appealing campaign, and Abacha could
find nowhere to go but to make known his decision on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the head of state, who came to power in 1993, could
not afford to delay further since there are less than five months
to go before the presidential election begins on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intention expressed by two individual politicians
to contest, all the five political parties have not yet produced
their own aspirants, probably waiting for Abacha's decision.
</P>
<P>
They even met not long ago to discuss whether or not to have
Abacha as their consensus presidential candidate. The meeting did
not witness an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha military administration has promised to hand over
on October 1 to an elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Abacha rally was organized by the National Council of
Youth Associations of Nigeria and gulped 500 million naira (about
six million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although at least three people lost their lives due to traffic
accidents on their way to the capital, the 48-hour rally was held
in good order, thanks to the support of the government.
</P>
<P>
However, an anti-Abacha rally organized by pro-democracy and
human rights groups was dispersed by the police in the national
economic center of Lagos Tuesday before it really began.
</P>
<P>
Support or oppose Abacha to run for presidency, the country's
transition to civil rule has entered its final stage. Whether the
coming civilian government is widely accepted will affect the
political situation and socio-economic development of the country
in both the short and long run.

<HEADLINE> Fake Invention Found in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The so-called century invention
that could allegely find hidden water, buried treasure and land
mines, and even identify criminals by their handwriting, has been
found by Lebanese police to be fake.
</P>
<P>
The bogus device that has hoodwinked people in Arab countries
was demonstrated here Thursday to reporters in the presence of the
suspect, Nassar Bin Omar Mahmoud Said, local English-language
newspaper Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret what I did because the whole thing was a
joke," said Said.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old suspect had promised to lend Kuwaitis his
device to remove mines left by Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have also promised to help Egyptian
explorers locate a French ship that sank off the Egyptian coast
last century and is believed to have been carrying precious
stones.
</P>
<P>
The device emitted a beam of red light which supposedly beeped
when touched on the target. But the beeper was commanded by a
small remote control held in the suspect's shoe and operated by
his toe.
</P>
<P>
Said claimed that one of his main aims was to gain Lebanese
nationality "which I heard is easily granted to inventors." But
the paper didn't say where the suspect was from.
</P>
<P>
The fraud was revealed last week when a state security cadet
stole the apparatus and was sued by Said.

<HEADLINE> Indian carpet Exporters Hire Lobbyist in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian carpet exporters have
hired a lobbyist in the United States to safeguard their interests
threatened by activists campaigning against child labor, an Indian
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Business Standard said the Carpet Export Promotion Council
(CEPC), an organization of Indian exporters in Washington, signed
a contract with Powell, Goldstein, Frazer and Murphy LLP (PGFM), a
Atlanta-based law firm.
</P>
<P>
The urgency for hiring the lobbyist arose out of a lawsuit
filed recently by a non-governmental organization, the
International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), under a new U.S. law that
bans the import of carpets made by children in bondage.
</P>
<P>
Indian exporters, alarmed by the ILRF demand for a blanket ban
of hand-knotted carpets from South Asia, visited the United States
twice in February to meet U.S. customs and treasury officials to
"tell their side of the story".
</P>
<P>
If the demand of the ILRF was accepted, it would harm India's
carpet industry seriously, whose exports were of the order of 600
million U.S. dollars, including 175 million U.S. dollars to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States imported carpets worth 329 million U.S.
dollars last year. India is the largest carpet exporter to the
Unite States followed by China.

LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Dramatic price cuts sweeping
the personal computer industry makes U.S. consumers more
accessible to desktops and laptops.
</P>
<P>
The cutting also makes powerful notebook computers affordable
for students, small-business owners and even consumers.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that laptop computers, which now account
for less than 20 percent of all PC sales, could become mainstream
machines within the next year.
</P>
<P>
Although more expensive than desktops with comparable
technology, one can now buy a notebook fully capable of handling
most computering jobs with 1,500 U.S. dollars or so.

BAGHDAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A 50-member arms inspection group
of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq led
by American Scott Ritter started its inspection work in Iraq on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the team led by Ritter, which
arrived in Baghdad Thursday afternoon, made a routine inspection
tour of some Iraqi weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq called Ritter "trouble-maker" and accused him of being a
spy with U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), implementing
U.S. policy and trying to create problems with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, Iraq barred a 16-people team headed by Ritter
from carrying out any activities in Iraq on the ground that the
team, which was composed of nine Americans, five Britons, one
Australian and one Russian, lacked balance in its
composition.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of Early Bronze Pieces Unearthed In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 pieces of bronzeware
dating back 2,500 years have been uncovered at a sacrificial site
in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The site, which was one of China's Top Ten Archaeological Finds
of 1997, is at a construction site in the city of Xinzheng, to the
southwest of the capital of the Zheng State of the Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 BC).
</P>
<P>
Scholars who selected the top ten finds say that the site was
where the Earl of Zheng, the ruler of the state, held ancestral
and harvest rites.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen pits of bronze pieces and 39 pits of horses buried
alive were found at the site, and 334 pieces of bronzeware
unearthed. These include nine tripod vessels and eight food
containers in one pit and a set of chimes in another.
</P>
<P>
Records show that the number of tripod vessels and food
containers used in sacrificial sites or as burial articles
indicate the rank of the person buried. The highest rank, that of
emperors, is indicated by nine tripod vessels and eight food
containers.
</P>
<P>
The Earl of Zheng defied the rules, scholars say, and that such
cases of defiance were frequent in the Spring and Autumn Period.
</P>
<P>
The set of chimes composed of 24 bronze bells, they say, had
been tuned before being buried, suggesting that they had been
played in a rite just before being buried.
</P>
<P>
The other nine top archaeological finds were: 30,000 pieces of
stoneware in a cave dating back 360,000 years in the Qinglin
Mountains, 7,700-year-old building remains in Shandong province, a
5,000-year-old shell mound site in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, the world's oldest paddyfield in Hunan province, a
neolithic site in Hong Kong, the earliest city with imperial
palaces in Henan, the remains of an imperial summer resort of the
Qin Dynasty (221-205 BC), a 2,000-year-old stone structure in
Guangdong, and some 100 ancient tombs on the Silk Road.

PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After a violent confrontation with an elite unit of the
Belgian gendarmerie military police, several senior leaders of the
terrorist Armed Islamic Group (GIA) of Algeria were arrested
Thursday during a double operation in Brussels, announced Belgian
Interior Minister Johan Vande Lanotte. Some of the eight GIA chiefs
arrested are of Scandinavian nationalities, and one of them is a
French national of Algerian origin, Farid Melouk, who was condemned
last month by a court in Lyon for terrorist attacks in France in
1995.
</P>
<P>
-- The situation continues to worsen in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, as
Serbian forces launched Thursday a mass attack with tanks and
helicopters on a dozen villages in the mountain near Srbica in the
Dernica region, stronghold of the Albanian guerrillas ``Army of
Liberation of Kosovo.'' The European Union warned Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that a political solution is urgent for this
province in southern Serbia with 90 percent of its population being
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The offensive by Serbian security forces against several
Albanian villages in Kosovo on Thursday killed at least 20 people,
while ethnic Albanians put the number of people killed since last
Saturday at 51, including six Serb policemen. The International
Contact Group on Former Yugoslavia will meet Monday in London for
emergency discussions on Kosovo, and the United States has sent a
severe warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- Three French teenagers killed Wednesday with a revolver a
grocer near Rouen, northern France. The murder has triggered a
strong feeling of anger in the local population.

<HEADLINE> Legislators from Ethnic Minorities Confident in Future Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers representing
ethnic minorities said they are full of confidence in good
prospects of economic and social development for their ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, who are here attending the ongoing session of
the Ninth National People's Congress to which they are deputies,
agreed that, since implementation of reform and open policies
began two decades ago, especially in the past five years, regions
with a concentration of ethnic minority people in China have
witnessed tremendous economic growth and social advancement.
</P>
<P>
Huanjue Cenam, a Tibetan deputy from northwest China's Qinghai
Province, described the past five years as "the best period since
the founding of New China" in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"Achievements in these years have proved the great success of
China in combining advantages of the socialist system with a
market economy," said Cenam.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Bao Yizhi, the sole representative of the Tu ethnic
group in the Ninth NPC, expressed appreciation for the importance
Premier Li Peng attached to ethnic minority regions in his
government work report he delivered earlier at the current
session.
</P>
<P>
"This shows the central government's great concern for ethnic
minorities, making us all the more confident in the future," said
Bao, vice mayor of Xining, capital of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the early 1990s, the Tu ethnic people, who
used to stress agriculture and despise commerce, have begun to
accept the concept of market economics and have seen a constant
rise in their living standard.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Deng Bentai, Party secretary of the Golog Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai, said that his hometown, a
secluded place with extremely harsh natural conditions and
backward economy, last year scored a record 9.96 percent growth
for local Gross Domestic Product with state support.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the prefectural government in 1997 spent 15
million yuan (nearly two million US dollars) in assisting more
than 9,000 local herdsmen to shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of their expectations, most legislators from ethnic
minorities expressed the hope that the central government would
provide more preferential policies for ethnic minority regions and
inject more investment in comparatively underdeveloped central and
western regions in key sectors like communications and energy
development.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 55 ethnic minorities, which account for
about four percent of its total population.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost half a
U.S. cent to close weaker Friday in Sydney, pressured by lower
Asian regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed here at 66.76 U.S. cents from 67.32
U.S. cents on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brent Aggar, a foreign exchange expert with Macquarie Bank,
said the Australian dollar had been under pressure all day.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian regional currencies are substantially weaker, the
Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit and the Singapore dollar
were all, over the week, on a closing basis very much weaker and
that's weighed heavily on the Aussie dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aggar said the low for the day was around 66.5 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"We could squeeze back to 67.20 U.S. cents but I think the
market will be quiet. If London can't take the Aussie back down
through 66.45 U.S. cents to 66.50 I think we will see a squeeze in
New York up to 67.20 U.S. cents."
</P>
<P>
The focus in the New York markets would be on gold prices
rather than the Asian regional currencies, Aggar said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar fell to 84.03 yen
from 85.65 at the close in Sydney Thursday. It rose to 1.2228
marks from 1.2217.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Sues Five California Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. said Thursday
that it is suing five California companies for copyright and
trademark infringement and distribution of alleged counterfeit
products.
</P>
<P>
The companies that allegedly sold or distributed counterfeit
versions of the Windows(R) 95 operating systems, Office 97
Professional Edition and Windows NT(R) Server Operating system are
-- Advanced Digital solutions International Inc., CHL Microsystems
Inc., Gogate International Inc., Silicon Computers as well as
Meladi Electronics Inc, which are all in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
Based on a federal law passed in 1996, Microsoft, the worldwide
leader in software for personal computers, is seeking up to one
million U.S. dollars in damages for each trademark counterfeited.
</P>
<P>
The software industry is a significant driving force of the
current economic prosperity in the United States, making a
102.8-billion-dollar market for software and software-related
services, payment of 7.2 billion dollars in taxes and 619,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, software piracy threatens the ability of the industry
to continue to contribute to the American economy, according to a
1997 study by the Business Software Alliance. The study found that
software piracy in 1996 resulted in the loss of 130,000 jobs,
nearly one billion dollars in tax revenues and 5.3 billion dollars
in wages.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Wool prices edged up
slightly at sales this week, although still down on the gains of
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The market appears to have established a new price basis
around 426 U.S. cents a clean kilogram benchmark, which is
bordering on a 10 percent reduction from 1997 price levels," the
Australian Council of Wool Exporters said in its weekly wool
market report.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose 1.3 U.S. cents to close at
426 U.S. cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
The western marker indicator remained at 392 U.S. cents per kg
as there were no sales in western Australia's city of Fremantle
and the Australian Wool Exchange's national indicator gained 0.66
U.S. cent to finish at 440 U.S. cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
A total of 58,741 bales were offered at the sales in Sydney and
south Australian coastal city of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
The council said there was increasing speculation about the
amount of wool likely to be available in the remaining weeks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
"Growers are withholding clips from sale in the wake of the
price drop experienced in January and we will, for example, have
only two auction sales in southern markets over the next six
weeks, including the traditional two week break over Easter.
</P>
<P>
About 79,000 bales will be offered at sales next week in
Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly report, wool broker Wesfarmers Dalgety said the
firm market marked the fourth consecutive week of stable prices.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is for the market to remain stable due to the lack
of quantity, with the possibility of an improvement in prices,"
Wesfarmers Dalgety said.

<HEADLINE> Asia Crisis Blamed for Weak Global Chip Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis in Asia
has hurt the growth of the global semiconductor market,
executives at Texas Instruments Inc. said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vladi Catto, chief economist at Texas Instruments, said that
the market would have grown between 15 percent and 17 percent this
year if not for the Asia crisis.
</P>
<P>
That means the global chip market will grow only about 13.5
billion U.S. dollars this year instead of between 20 billion and
23 billion dollars, said the executive.
</P>
<P>
The Asia crisis has taken at least a 6.5-billion-dollar bite
out of the global chip market, he added.
</P>
<P>
He spoke a day after Intel Corp., the world's leading computer
chips maker, stunned Wall Street with a warning of a first-quarter
earnings shortfall, citing weaker-than-anticipated demand for its
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
Weak chip orders "across the board" at the end of 1997 were
pressuring some key markets, said Bill Aylesworth, chief financial
officer at Taxas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
Both executives said the crisis will continue to hurt near-term
profits.
</P>
<P>
They painted a bright picture for 1999, however, saying that
renewed economic growth in Asia would boost demand and help a
recovery in the prices of common memory chips.

<P>
JINAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
recently begun to take measures to regulate its economic
development zones in an effort to encourage overseas investments in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Priority is being given to hi-tech and export-oriented projects
and to the finance, trade, and real estate sectors. Investors will
not be allowed to back projects that use outmoded technology or
equipment or that pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the zones are also encouraged to set up bonded
factories, workshops, and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas-funded projects in local development
zones increased to 1,400 last year, accounting for nearly 25
percent of the total in the province.
</P>
<P>
The development zones used 917 million US dollars of overseas
investment in 1997, a nearly 40 percent rise from the 1996 figure.
Their enterprises generated more than 47 billion yuan in
industrial output value in 1997 and earned nearly 1.69 billion US
dollars in foreign exchange from exports.

<P>
HANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A young man in east China's
Zhejiang Province recently received 1,000 yuan from the local
government because of his painstaking efforts to deal with his
deformity.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old man, Li Lingqin, who lost a leg in an accident
10 years ago in the city of Ningbo, became reticent, timid, and
afraid of the looks of other people after that.
</P>
<P>
But, with encouragement from the district government, he began
to study harder and eventually passed the Adult Self-teaching
Examination, which gave him further courage.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's policy is to give assistance to people
with deformities, and companies that hire a certain number of them
are entitled to certain preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Ningbo has managed to establish a kind
of environment that helps people with deformities build confidence
and to rely on themselves.
</P>
<P>
In addition to encouraging companies to provide jobs, the city
government also provides preferential policies for people with
deformities who want to be self-employed or work in collective
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"People with deformities long for respect rather than
compassion, and only want an equal chance rather than hand-outs,"
Li explains.
</P>
<P>
An official with the city government says that the government
provides various professional training courses for these people to
give them a competitive edge, because "People with deformities
also like fair competition, which provides them with the sense of
equality."

<P>
XIAMEN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The preparation work for a fair on
exports to Taiwan have largely been completed, according to the
fair organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The fair is the second of a planned annual event to be held
on April 8-12 each year in this coastal city of southeast China's
Fujian Province. Attending the event will be representatives from
companies that export on their own, overseas-funded enterprises
and firms funded by investors from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Last year's inaugural fair drew the active participation of
both inland enterprises and the leading industrial and
commercial groups in Taiwan, and has since helped to expand
cross-Straits trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Xiamen's exports to Taiwan soared
87 percent in 1997, while exports from the rest of the country to
Taiwan grew more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
An expected 1,500 to 2,000 business people representing
companies from 40 large- and medium-size cities -- including
Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Dalian and Ningbo -- will participate
in this year's fair, which has 300 exhibition booths.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers from Fujian, chief
ancestral home of Taiwan compatriots, said they will do what they
can to contribute more to China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion on the government work report given by Li
Peng, premier of the State Council, deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since yesterday,
discussed cross-Strait relations and ways to advance them for an
early reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Li Jiabao, a standing committee member of the Central
Committee of Jiusan Society, one of the eight non-Communist
parties in China, said the Taiwan question is looming larger as
the day is drawing near for Macao's return to the embrace of the
motherland following the successful return of Hong Kong last July.
</P>
<P>
Facing Taiwan across the strait of the same name, Fujian has
the responsibility to promote the reunification of the motherland,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The urgent thing for Fujian to do now is to accelerate its
opening to the outside world, speed up its economic development
and build up a vibrant economic corridor along the west coast of
the Taiwan Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Huang Changxi, a former vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of Fujian Provincial People's Congress, said that over
5,000 Taiwan-funded enterprises have been established along the
highway linking Fuzhou and Xiamen and that tens of thousands of
Taiwan businessmen are now living in the Xiamen-Quanzhou-Fuzhou
area.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the central authorities provide Fujian
with more preferential policies relating to cross-Strait
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to deepen mutual understanding," he said. "One
way of doing this, for example, is to allow more Taiwan students
to study in the mainland."

<HEADLINE> State Councillor on Institutional Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Luo Gan, on
behalf of the State Council, today underlineed the necessity and
imperativeness of institutional restructuring, the objective and
principles involved, the restructural reform of the State
Council's component departments and the arrangements for the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The administrative restructural reform represents an urgent
need to deepen economic restructuring and promote economic and
social development. It is also an important part of the reform
for the Party and state leading system and an objective demand for
forging closeer relationship between the government and the
masses of people, he said at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous achievements have been scored in China's economic
restructuring, opening to the outside world and socialist
modernization drive since the country pursued economic reforms in
the late 1970s, especially from the 14th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, under the restrictions of historical and
macro-economic conditions, many problems of government
institutions remain unchanged despite reforms on many occasions.
The contradictions between the establishment of institutions and
socialist market economy has become acute with each passing day,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The basic framework of existing government institutions was
formed in the course of a planned economic system. The outstanding
problems arising from this framework include confusion of
government administration and enterprises, direct involvement in
production and management of enterprises by the government,
failure of making scientific decisions in investment structure,
indistinct responsibility and faults in policy-making.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is difficult to give scope to the role of
market in the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
After two decades of reform and opening up, a situation in
which public ownership retain a dominate role with diverse
forms of ownership developing simultaneously, has taken shape
in China.
</P>
<P>
The scale of national economy has been increasing daily. Great
changes have taken place in the form of organization and operation
of enterprises. The mechanism of direct management over
enterprises by special economic departments can hardly suits the
requirements of building a modern enterprise system, Luo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the set-up of existing government institutions was
established under the condition of incomplete legal system, and it
has resorted chiefly to administrative means in managing economic
and social affairs, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The government has undertaken excessive heavy social
responsibilities, which could be resolved by legal means or by
intermediary organs, by setting up government management organs.
</P>
<P>
With development of socialist legal systems and intermediary
organs, there is an urgent need to revise the principle of
government institutional structure and change its way of
operation, define the responsibilities of government institutions,
enterprises and of social intermediary organs, and legalize and
standardize socialist market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The overlapping and overstaffing of the government institutions
have resulted in bureaucrac, corruption and unhealthy tendency
and caused a heavy burden on the state, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's reform and development has entered into a
new period and is confronted with new problems. It is imperative
to speeding up both government and economic restructuring,
promoting economic restructuring, promoting economic growth and
safeguarding social stability to create favorable environment
for China's development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that institutional restructuring is a revolution, Luo
said "reforms can't proceed without resistance and risks. However
there is no way out if we don't reform."
</P>
<P>
To date, the national economy maintains a good momentum in
its development. The national strength has been enhanced. People
from all social circles have reached consensus on institutional
restructuring. All these furnish a favorable condition for
institutional restructuring, the state councillor noted.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the current institutional restructuring is to
build an efficient, coordinated and standardized administrative
management system, further improve the public servant system, form
a contingent of qualified administrators and gradually build an
administrative management mechanism with Chinese characteristics
which keeps abreast with socialist market system, Luo said.

administration from business operation, change their functions
and no longer exercise direct management, he added.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the government and enterprises
should be divided like this: The government will enjoy the
rights and interests of owners in accordance with the capital it
has invested in enterprises. It will send special supervisors,
oversee the operation of assets and the performance of
enterprises and provide examinations, promotions and removals.
</P>
<P>

<P>
To cope with the requirements of the reform, the current plan
has readjusted both the institutions and offices directly under
the State Council. A total of 15 institutions directly under the
State Council departments and six administrative offices will be
established after the current restructuring. The corresponding
plan will be put into effect after being approved by the new
cabinet to be formed during the current session of the National
People's Congress, said Luo Gan.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan submitted has taken into account the need of
reform and development as well as the social endurance, and
therefore the program is still a plan in transition.
</P>
<P>
As China is in the process of building socialist market
economy, it is difficult to accomplish everything overnight
fulfilling the requirements of a mature market economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the current restructuring must make great strides
while settling the most outstanding contradictions so as to create
good conditions for further reform and economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the current program calls for the 40 existing
ministries and commissions of the State Council to be reduced to
29, a major but prudent step in institutional restructuring, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Luo expressed the determination that the State Council has
drawn a meticulous and careful plan to ensure the implementation
of the plan since the restructuring of the government institution
is an arduous task. Principles of the program runs as following:
</P>
<P>
Handling the institutional restructuring actively and
carefully. The current restructuring is a major restructuring
initiative which undergoes major changes in government
institutions and involves a large number of people. As more people
will be laid off this year, there will an overall plan in
promoting social and economic development and maintaining social
and political stability, so as to avoid major shakes to social and
political stability and economic growth, he said.

<P>
The newly established institutions will go in into operation
once the restructuring plan is examined and approved in the
current session of the National People's Congress (NPC), he said.
 The program to delimit structures, functions and sizes in
the program to delimit structures, functions and sizes of
different departments under the State Council will come out before
the end of the year. Then, the new government institutions will
start operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels will also undergone
restructuring after the restructuring of the State Council takes
shape.
</P>
<P>
Channeling cadres to improve the quality of civil servants and
staffs at the grassroots levels. Streamlining administration and
staff channeling are the difficult points in all previous
institutional restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The current reform will reduce the size of the institutional
cadres by half. The reduction of government size and fixing of
staff members should be completed by the end of this year, but it
will take roughly three years to channel the staff members.
</P>
<P>
The basic way to channel staff members in the government
institutions will be "channeling cadres while enjoying their
original material benefits, providing job-oriented training,
replenishing enterprises and optimizing the structure", he said.
</P>
<P>
Through efforts, the cadres to be channeled are expected to
play a full role in industrial, commercial and banking
enterprises, in law-enforcement institutions, including financial
and taxation departments, public security and procuratorial
organs, people's courts and market management offices, and in
cultural, education and public health institutions and
intermediary organizations appropriate to the development of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to readjust the age, knowledge and
professional structures of people in government institutions,
enterprises and grassroots to improve the overall structure of the
civil servants contingency and workers at the grassroots
government organizations.

He said that all government departments should work earnestly
for a shift in their functions, improve their style of work and
increase their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"These should be the criteria to judge whether the institutional
restructuring is effectiveness," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the institutional restructuring, either
newly-established or reserved, would shoulder greater, not lighter
responsibilities in their work.
</P>
<P>
"We must conduct administration according to law and perform
our duties as state organs in accordance with new requirements,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all government functionaries to study hard, work
diligently and be good public servants to the people's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of improving the legal system
concerning administrative structure.
</P>
<P>
"We will propose an amendment to the organizational law of the
State Council, and regulate the establishment of State Council
departments in accordance with the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he suggested that local organizational laws should
also be revised at due time, to make a more explicit definition on
the functions, responsibilities, powers and organizational
structures of all local governments.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that all government officials and employees
strictly comply with the administrative discipline, and subject
themselves to the need of the overall situation of reform.
</P>
<P>
Institutional restructuring and diversion of government
personnel will have an impact on the overall situation of reform,
development and stability, and will affect powers of various
departments and the personal interests of all the officials, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it is extremely necessary to take the
overall situation into account.
</P>
<P>
"Once the institutional restructuring plan is approved, it
shall be carried out resolutely, and concerted efforts made for
the success of the government reform," Luo Gan concluded.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in northeast
China, the country's oldest heavy industrial base, plans to improve
its ties with western European countries through a number of
environmental protection projects with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, governor of Liaoning, said in an interview with
Xinhua that the projects are not only conducive to sustainable
economic growth but also important to enhancing the mutual
understanding between EU members and the province in its bid to
tap the potential in other fields.
</P>
<P>
So far, the EU has donated 37 million ECU (European Currency
Unit) in carrying out the projects including the use of rivers as
energy sources and the treatment of air pollution and industrial
waste as well as readjusting its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is home to one-tenth of China's large- and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises with a combined asset value of 500 billion
yuan. The central government has attached great importance to its
reform of traditional companies that are of great appeal to EU
members who bear a lot of similarities with Liaoning in
traditional industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Wen's recent visit to EU countries has prompted the signing of
a number of contracts as well as letters of intent.

<HEADLINE> Noted Economists on Enterprise Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Three leading Chinese economists
today urged the government to tighten controls over the listing of
enterprises on the country's fledgling stock market to protect
investors' interests and the market itself.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, Liu Hongru and Wu Jinglian, all members of the
Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, made
the suggestion in a group discussion attending by members from
the country's economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"The government must take effective steps to strictly regulate
the listing of enterprises and prevent any disqualified enterprise
from getting into the stock market," said Xiao, a professor with
the prestigious Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are now more than 740 listed companies with
a market capitalization of about 1.7 trillion yuan (200 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"However, some local governments have neglected the quality of
listed companies and even allowed some poorly-managed enterprises
to be listed, affecting the normal operation of the capital
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a research fellow with the Development Research Center of
the State Council, China's cabinet, said that the government must
help enterprises change the misconception that the only purpose of
stock listing is to obtain money.
</P>
<P>
"The primary role of the stock market is to realize a rational
capital distribution and promote a needed change in the
operational mechanism of enterprises. Fund-raising is just a
secondary function of the market," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Xiao added that the government must strictly regulate listed
companies and raise their transparency to guarantee an orderly
development of the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Liu, vice president of the Chinese Monetary Society, said that,
as the number of listed companies surges in China, measures must
be taken to ensure their quality.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of listed companies has a direct bearing on the
interests of investors and serves as a cornerstone of the stock
market," he stressed.

LANZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province had 62
more overseas-funded enterprises in 1997, bringing in 107 million
US dollars of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 1,356 overseas-backed companies, with 2.3
billion US dollars of investment, 965 million US dollars of
that from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the number of companies is a result of local
efforts to bring in loans from overseas governments to improve
infrastructure, investment conditions, and outmoded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province sent representatives to Southeast Asia,
South America, Western Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent
States for trade talks. It also held a trade fair in the provicial
capital, Lanzhou, and got 256 million US dollars of overseas
investment by making 570 projects available.

<HEADLINE> Government Capable of Handling Complex Economic Situation: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress in
economic restructuring and dealt successfully with problems of a
bubble economy in the past five years, demonstrating that the
Chinese government is capable of handling complicated situations
in the process of economic development, said Wu Bangguo, a
vice-premier of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the comment in a group discussion attended by deputies
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) in session here
since yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the last five years are one of the best periods since
the founding of New China in terms of national economic
development. He enumerated reasons for his comment: the country
has had a rational foreign debt structure; it has embarked on a
road of economic development featuring a high speed and low
inflation; and it has maintained financial stability and good
growth momentum at a time when Southeast Asia is plagued by
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"China's steady, fast and healthy economic growth and stable
financial order are a positive factor for Asia's economic
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since China implemented policies of reform and opening to the
outside world, he said, links between the country's domestic
market and international markets have become closer.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia is expected to have some
impact on China's export and economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is an arduous task for China to maintain the current
economic growth momentum, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu called for working hard to expand both the domestic and
international markets and directing more investment in
agriculture, forestry, infrastructure, new and high-tech
technologies, technological upgrading and residential housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that China can achieve an eight-percent
economic growth rate while bring inflation under three percent in
1998 as long as the government handles macro controls well.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Plans are under way to
computerize the Kenya News Agency (KNA) offices in Nairobi to
enable it compete effectively with other media houses, a high
official was quoted as saying by the Kenya Times Friday
</P>
<P>
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Joseph Nyagah called
for the installation of fax machines in all KNA offices as a
temporary measure before introducing computers when he toured the
new KNA offices Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agency faces the risk of becoming irrelevant
unless it is receptive to the new technological development in
mass communication.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that efforts should be made to project
KNA as a serious and dependable news agency and urged KNA
reporters to diversify their news coverage by highlighting the
activities of the farmers and other success stories of the
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
In order to survive in the future, the minister said that KNA
and the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) should stop
transmitting stale news to its subscribers.

<HEADLINE> Gold And Silver Products Doing Well In Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- You'd be wrong if you tried to
buy mutton at the Yangrou (mutton) Hutong in the Western District
of Beijing -- try buying gold instead, because shops selling gold
and silver trinkets have replaced a number of old shops along the
narrow street.
</P>
<P>
The hutong was designated a special gold and silver market by
the Geology and Mineral Resources Ministry and the Western
District government in 1994, in response to consumer needs.
</P>
<P>
It now has 43 gold and silver jewelry shops, each with annual
sales of about a million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of Beijing's large department stores have opened
special counters here and have monthly sales of about a million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has six centers for gold, silver, and pearl objects
and many other wholesale markets and special shops. Sales for 1997
amounted to several billion yuan in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The prosperous gold and silver markets can be explained by the
fact that Beijing is a major distribution center of jewelry, and
there are an increasing number of foreigners coming to the city
and people's incomes are increasing.

<HEADLINE> Old Tomb With Frescoes Discovered in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a tomb dating back to the Song Dynasty (960 to 1279
A.D.), with frescoes on the chamber walls, in the city of Xinmi in
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered at a building site for a farmer's house, just
underground, at the foot of a bluff in Xinmi, not far away from
Kaifeng, the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty about 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The chambers are made of brick in an octagonal shape. The
vaulted celling is three meters high. The largest brick is 50 cm
long. The frescoes on the walls of the chambers tell of stories of
24 famous dutiful sons, and most are well preserved.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say the tomb was a copy of the architectural
style of buildings above ground. They plan to do a full-scale
excavation of the tomb, which is believed to contain a number of
funerary items.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Under Control in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The malaria epidemic that killed at
least 138 people in the southern Philippines has been under
control, the Philippine News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Mustala Hairon, secretary of Mindanao office of
the Department of Health, said this after making an on-site visit
to Siasi town, Sulu province on the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"With all the help that is pouring into Siasi and all the
efforts given, the epidemic is contained. Health personnel had
done malaria control measures even in neighboring islands to stop
its spread," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, most victims were suffering from malnutrition and lack
of water supply and their ability to fight off epidemic diseases
had been reduced, Hairon added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, He belied reports that health personnel were late in
responding to the incident.
</P>
<P>
He said Sulu Provincial Health Office had sent doctors to Siasi
as early as February 20 when the malaria first broke out.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Fidel Ramos announced Siasi a calamity area
and released millions of pesos as emergency assistance to the
area.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Creates "Heroes Street" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- On busy Chaowai Avenue in east
Beijing stand 50 huge, round, mirror-like light boxes on both
sides of the street bearing pictures of Chinese heroes.
</P>
<P>
The avenue, 1,080 meters in length and the location of such
famous buildings as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office
Building and the Blue-Island Building, now has a new nickname --
Beijing's "Heroes Street."
</P>
<P>
"These pictures make me feel that heroes are not actually far
away from us; they are just among the public," said a young man on
his bicycle, who goes to and from work past the pictures.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Chaoyang District which
sponsored the pictures late last year, their purpose is to
publicize the heroes' noble spirit of devotion to the liberation
and development of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep these light-boxes standing on the street-sides
forever so the passers-by have the opportunity to commemorate our
national heroes every day and be nurtured by their spirit of
patriotism," the official said.
</P>
<P>
These 50 heroes include Lei Feng, a model soldier who always
tried to help others; Meng Tai, a model worker who tried to save
every cent for his factory; and Wu Jinyin, a good Party chief at
the grassroot level who worked hard to help villagers rise from
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"These 50 heroes were selected from more than 100 candidates by
both the public and experts," said the official, adding that some
worthy people had to be omitted because of the lack of good
pictures.
</P>
<P>
The street also provides an ideal place for primary school
students to learn from former generations.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I pass by the pictures of Dong Cunrui and Huang
Jiguang (who have been widely known by the Chinese for protecting
their comrades with their own lives during wartime), I will more
cherish the peace and happy life I have today," said one student
from the Fangcaodi Primary School in the Chaoyang District.
</P>
<P>
In front of the District Government Building stand two huge
light-boxes with pictures of Kong Fansen and Li Suli (who are
known as model civil servants).
</P>
<P>
"This is to remind the government officials of serving the
people better," a passer-by told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Curbing Fraud Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- There is need for the
establishment of a multi-sectoral and specialised committee to
assist with investigations of all forms of serious fraud if the
crime is to be controlled, a Zimbabwean minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day conference on "winning the war against
corporate fraud" on Thursday in Harare, minister of home affair
Dumiso Dabengwa said that at least 80 cases of fraud are recorded
every week in Zimbabwe, the daily The Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"From these statistics," he said, "it is clear that fraud is
costing the country losses running into millions of dollars every
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said these losses were suffered by the private citizens,
government departments, non-governmental organisations,
parastatals and private concerns -- both big and small.
</P>
<P>
The minister said criminals were becoming so sophisticated
that traditional investigation methods were failing to cope,
hence the need for the setting up of a specialised agency to help
curb the crime.
</P>
<P>
"The committee should include experienced senior police
officers, lawyers, loss-control officers from the banking
industry and financial institutions, accountants, and computer
specialists among other experts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed corporate fraud was a major concern to both the
government and affected organisations in that it caused "severe
bleeding" of the economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, police deputy commissioner Dave Blake
said police were doing all they could to investigate all forms of
fraud, but this was not enough deterrent.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 6,122 cases were reported in 1997, an
increase of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the police would go out of their way to fight the
fraud menace which had engulfed Zimbabwe. He also urged the
participants to set up a committee to come up with a competency
framework strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- As the balance of India's
political forces tilted to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the
Congress reviewed Thursday the post-poll political scenario
concerning government formation and its future leadership.
</P>
<P>
Leading newspapers reported Friday that the Congress working
Committee (CWC) adopted a resolution Thursday evening unanimously
expressing its willingness to play a constructive role in the
process of formation of a stable government at the center.
</P>
<P>
The CWC, the highest policy-making body of the party, said its
aim is to enable all secular forces to work together to strengthen
the pluralistic character of the country.
</P>
<P>
Senior party leaders attending the three-hour meeting were
unanimous that the electorate had not given any categorical
mandate to the BJP, now the largest political force in the
multi-party country.
</P>
<P>
The CWC expressed its deep sense of gratitude and appreciation
of the efforts make by Sonia Gandhi to help the Congress in the
just concluded Lok Sabha elections.
</P>
<P>
The CWC formally requested Sonia Gandhi to help the party reach
a consensus on the choice of its leader in the parliament "to
ensure total unity in the party".
</P>
<P>
Observers here see this request as a beginning of the subtle
process of Sonia's takeover of the Congress.

</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhou had took firm actions to maintain the

started from the actual reality, they said, adding that Zhou's
attitude laid the foundation of the concept of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>

commemorate the late premier is to learn from his lofty spirit and

State Council, eight macro-control goals and seven major tasks for
China's economic and social development in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The eight main macro-control goals for 1998 are:
</P>
<P>
-- The economy should grow by 8 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Investment in fixed assets in the country should increase by
10 percent or more;
</P>
<P>

percent throughout the country and the rise in consumer prices
should be controlled at about five percent;
</P>
<P>

-- The natural population growth rate should be confined to
1.06 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- The registered unemployment rate should be about 3.5 percent
in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
"Once these targets have been examined and approved at the
current session of the National People's Congress, we must take
effective measures to achieve them in accordance with the policy
of promoting development while maintaining stability. We shall
make appropriate and timely changes to these targets in light of
changes in both the domestic situation and international
conditions in our vigorous efforts to promote the rapid growth of
the national economy," said Chen in his report on the draft plan
to the session.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft plan, the major tasks for national
economic and social development in 1998 include:
</P>
<P>
-- Stabilizing and strengthening the position of agriculture as
the foundation of the economy and developing all the sectors of
rural economy;
</P>
<P>

new points for economic growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Maintaining appropriate growth in investment in fixed assets
and readjusting and optimizing the investment structure;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to develop an open economy and doing better in
opening to the outside world;

<P>
-- Strengthening the management of revenue and expenditures and
guarding against and reducing financial risks;
</P>
<P>
-- Following a strategy of developing the country through
science and education and working for sustainable development to
develop all social undertakings in an all-round way;
</P>
<P>
-- Stepping up efforts to implement re-employment projects and
continuing to improve people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan also listed a host of indexes for China's
economic and social development in 1998, which include a total
grain output of 492.5 million tons and cotton output of four
million tons, reducing the number of the needy people in rural
areas to below 40 million, an annual steel output of 107 million
tons and a yearly electricity output of 1.2 trillion KWH, a total
fixed asset investment of 2.785 trillion yuan (including 1.050

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Official: Dialogue Leads to Greater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A Senior U.S. defense official
said here Thursday that the Pentagon is seeking more dialogue with
the Chinese military to promote mutual understanding and reduce
miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth H. Bacon, assistant secretary of defense for public
affairs and the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, told reporters that
"the more that China and the U.S. can talk to each other, the more
avenues we have open between us, I think the better and sounder
our relationships will be, the better our understanding will be."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. military have been engaged in "types of
discussions and openness" with their Chinese counterparts since
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian visited Washington in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that that dialogue leads to a greater
understanding. And understanding reduces the chances of
miscalculation. It reduces the chances of people making mistakes
in their dealings with one another," Bacon noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen returned a visit to
China early this year. The trip has led to the signing of an
accord on avoiding accidents in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Bacon admitted that differences still exist between the two
sides, but they could be overcome through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that we are not going to agree with everything
China does, nor is China going to agree with every part of our
policy. That's a given between any two sovereign nations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to develop, despite our differences, ways to
overcome those differences and work around them and to cooperate
in areas that make sense to us and where we can make the world
stable, and in areas where we may disagree, to disagree in a
mature and non-disruptive way," Bacon added.

QUITO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 people died and dozens
were injured in a mudslide on Ecuador's central northern coast
Thursday.

Before dawn, part of a mountainside slid onto the village of
Rio Cana, 150 miles (240 km) south of the capital Quito, say

Rescue workers were reported to have dug out three bodies, and
at least 18 others were still buried deeply.

<HEADLINE> Reports on Finance, Budget, Institutional Restructuring Made (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Three reports on the country's
finance, budget and government restructuring were delivered here
this morning at the second plenary meeting of the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, delivered a report on the Implementation of the 1997
Plan for National Economic and Social Development and on a Draft
1998 Plan for National Economic and Social Development.
</P>
<P>
He said implementation of the 1997 plan was good with high
economic growth and a low inflation rate, but there remain some
problems with the economy and social affairs which should be
resolved with more efforts through in-depth reform.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Chen Jinhua listed major tasks in economic and
social development in 1998: to stabilize and strengthen the
position of agriculture as the foundation of the economy and
develop all sectors of the rural economy; to improve the quality
of industrial operation and foster new areas for economic growth;
to maintain appropriate growth in investment in fixed assets and
readjust and optimize the investment structure; to continue to
develop an open economy and do better in opening to the outside
world; to strengthen the management of revenue and expenditures
and guard against and reduce financial risks; to follow a strategy
of developing the country through science; to step up efforts to
implement re-employment programs and continue to improve people's
living standards.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli delivered a report on the
implementation of the central and local budgets for 1997 and draft
central and local budgets for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of relatively large increases of the past four
years in succession, revenue in 1997 increased by a big margin.
The ratio of revenue to GDP has continued to rise. The increase in
expenditures for 1997 was still lower than the increase in
revenue. The central deficit has been further reduced," Liu
Zhongli said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to efforts to deepen reform, strengthen management and
effectively implement an appropriately stringent financial policy
in the past few years, the country's financial situation is
improving, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guiding principles for preparing the central and local budgets
for 1998 are as follows: to further strengthen agriculture; to
support reform of state-owned enterprises and improve the social
security system; to do better in opening to the outside world; to
tighten and improve macroeconomic controls, continue to carry out
an appropriately stringent financial policy, strive to increase
revenue, tighten control over expenditures and reduce deficits;
and to promote a sustained, rapid and sound development of the
national economy and all-round social progress.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain and further improve the good macroeconomic
situation in 1998, we shall continue to follow an appropriately
stringent financial policy and reduce the central budget deficit
by ten billion yuan from the actual figure for 1997," Liu Zhongli
said.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Luo Gan, also secretary-general of the State
Council, explained a draft Plan Concerning Institutional
Restructuring of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan is to establish a highly efficient,
well-coordinated and standardized administrative system with Chinese
characteristics which meets the need of a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Principles for the reform are: to change governmental functions
and separate administration from business operation; to establish
a simplified, unified and efficient administrative structure; to
readjust the responsibilities and powers of government
departments; and to promote the exercise of administration
according to law, Luo Gan said.
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting will also decide on the establishment of an
additional special committee under the NPC and a namelist of the
chairman, vice-chairmen and members of the NPC Financial and
Economic Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday that his government will try to
seek a political solution to the ethnic Albanian unrest in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remark in a meeting with visiting British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, two Serbian policemen and 20 ethnic Albanians
were killed in the latest outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that Yugoslavia will take all measures to
eradicate terrorism in the province, but a division should be
made between the terrorists and mainstream ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted on March 1 when Serbian police and Albanians
clashed, leaving four policemen and 16 Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on Britain, currently chairing the
European Union presidency, to help develop cooperation between
Yugoslavia and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived in Belgrade Wednesday, also called for a
political solution in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the population, have been seeking independence since
1981.
</P>
<P>
He condemned terrorism, but stressed that the problems
could not be solved by force.
</P>
<P>
Cook also met Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. He
called on the government to allow the establishment of an EU
office in Kosovo to monitor the situation and before decisions
were made on EU economic aid to the region.

local budgets for 1998.
</P>
<P>
He delivered the report at the ongoing session of the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft budgets, revenue in the central budget
for 1998 totals 530.919 billion yuan, up 10.2 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures in the central budget total 576.919 billion yuan,
up 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This leaves a deficit of 46 billion yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both total revenue and expenditure in local budgets come to
798.935 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
For the nation as a whole, in 1998, total revenue is expected
to be up by 12.1 percent over last year; and total expenditures up
by 10.3 percent, 1.8 percentage points lower than revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
China must work hard to successfully implement re-employment
projects for laid-off workers and allocate funds to ensure a
minimum standard of living for them, Liu said.

<P>
At the same time, financial departments at all levels should
increase expenditures to guarantee the implementation of
enterprise reform measures such as those designed to disperse
redundant employees to other jobs in cities where experiment to
establish a modern enterprise system is conducted, provide loans
with interest borne by the state finance to help enterprises
having difficulty meet their payrolls, reduce the spindles of the
textile industry and return income taxes for the purpose of
increasing circulating funds to cities where experiment to
optimize the capital structure is conducted.
</P>
<P>
The country's grain reserves have increased considerably owing
to the good harvests of the past few years in succession. This has
resulted in sharp rises in expenses for grain reserves and
subsidies for surplus grain reserves, so that existing risk funds
for grain production cannot meet actual needs.
</P>
<P>
To encourage production, protect peasants' interests and ensure
implementation of the state policy of purchasing as much grain as
possible at protective prices, the central budget for 1998 will
add 3.7 billion yuan to the risk funds for grain production and
local budgets will be required to arrange for an increase of 5.55
billion yuan in expenditure.
</P>
<P>
This year the government will not levy customs tariffs and
value-added taxes on imported equipment which cannot be produced
in China as well as technologies for projects using high
technology and domestic and foreign investment projects encouraged
by the state industrial policy, resulting in a total import tax
reduction of about 10 billion yuan, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall appropriately raise the tax refund rate for exported
textiles, which will result in an increased tax refund of 4.5
billion yuan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Central budget expenditures for servicing domestic and foreign
debts in 1998 will amount to 234.86 billion yuan, and the deficit
for 1998 will come to 46 billion yuan. This requires that treasury
bonds worth 280.86 billion yuan will be issued at home and abroad
in 1998, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Deficit by 10 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to have a
deficit of 46 billion yuan this year, 10 billion yuan less than
last year's actual deficit, China's Finance Minister Liu Zhongli
said here today, addressing the annual session of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
This will be the biggest drop in China's recent budgets.
</P>
<P>
After being faced with a deficit of 65.68 billion yuan in 1995,
the central government has been striving to basically balance its
budget by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last year, central expenditures exceeded revenues, leaving a
deficit of 56 billion yuan, one billion yuan less than the
budgeted amount, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts to deepen reform, strengthen management, and
effectively implement an appropriately stringent financial policy
in the past few years, the country's financial situation is
improving, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Total state revenue for 1997 increased by 123.4 billion yuan
over the 1996 figure. The proportion of individual income tax,
stamp tax on securities transactions and business tax in the total
revenue increased from 15.1 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This shows that with restructuring of the national economy,
sources for revenue increases have diversified to create favorable
conditions for sustained and steady growth in revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, total expenditures were brought under control. The
increase in expenditures for 1997 was lower than the increase in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, newly added expenditures were used for
substantial increases in investment in education, science, risk
funds for grain production, anti-poverty funds and building up the
national strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to implement an appropriately stringent
financial policy, oppose the unhealthy practices of squandering
public funds and indulging in extravagance and waste, streamline
the administrative structure and reduce the number of personnel
supported by the state finance and spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- In his government work report
delivered Thursday at the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, Premier Li Peng talked about "one country, two
systems." Following is a brief explanation of the term.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" was first put forth
by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the concept has gradually come to
maturity and become a fundamental state policy.
</P>
<P>
It was first proposed for the solution of the Taiwan question.
Deng Xiaoping explained, "After the reunification, Taiwan can
continue to practice its capitalism, while the mainland maintains
its socialist system. But there must be only one unified China.
This principle can also be applied to the Hong Kong question."
</P>
<P>
The government work report endorsed by the Second Session of the
Sixth National People's Congress (NPC) in May, 1984, formally used
the term "one China, two systems" to summarize the CPC's principle
for addressing the Taiwan and Hong Kong questions to realize the
reunification of China. Later, the expression was changed to "one
country, two systems."

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
explanation for the term "three favorables" used in the Government
Work Report delivered Thursday by Premier Li Peng at the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 when China's reform and opening to the outside world
entered a critical moment, Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of
China's reform and opening-up, visited southern China and put
forward a criterion to judge whether a new development is
socialist or capitalist in nature.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping pointed out that it should be judged according to
the criterion of whether or not it is favorable for promoting the
growth of productive forces in a socialist society, favorable for
increasing the overall strength of socialist China and favorable
for improving people's living standard, or "three favorables" in
short.
</P>
<P>
After the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in 1992, the "three favorables" criterion has become a
common view shared by all Party members and people throughout the
country.

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, in his Government
Work Report delivered Thursday at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, talked about "to crack down on all
criminal activities and launch special campaign to fight crimes
and social evils." Following is a brief explanation for the term.
</P>
<P>
To crack down on all criminal activities and launch special
campaigns to fight crimes and social evils are fundamental methods
to improve all facets of public security across the country.
</P>
<P>
Crackdowns are focused on severe criminal activities such as
violent crimes, gun-related crimes and group crimes, drug-related
crimes, and economic crimes such as embezzling, bribery and
misusing public funds.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, law-enforcement departments often carry out
special nationwide or local raids against social evils such as
prostitution, gambling, and the production and
spread of obscene materials.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: "To Grasp with Both Hands and with Equal Emphasis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, in his government
work report delivered Thursday at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, talked about "to grasp with both hands
and with equal emphasis." Following is a brief explanation of the
term.
</P>
<P>
"To grasp with both hands" means to do two things at the same
time: one is to promote material progress, and the other is to
promote ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
"To grasp with equal emphasis" means to attach equal emphasis
to doing the two things. That is to say, material progress should
not be pursued at the expense of ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The thinking was first put forward by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, material progress refers to the improvement
of people's material life, while ethical and cultural progress
means advancement in people's intellect and morality.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping once said: "Socialist ethical and cultural
progress not only refers to education, science and culture, but
also covers the Communist ideology, ideals, beliefs, morality,
discipline, revolutionary stand and principles, and comradeship
between people."

<HEADLINE> China Sets Forth Macro-Control Goals for 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of
the State Planning Commission, today sets forth, on behalf of the
State Council, eight macro-control goals and seven major tasks for
China's economic and social development in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The eight main macro-control goals for 1998 are:
</P>
<P>
-- The economy should grow by 8 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Investment in fixed assets in the country should increase by
10 percent or more;
</P>
<P>
-- The rise in retail prices should be controlled within three
percent throughout the country and the rise in consumer prices
should be controlled at about five percent;
</P>
<P>
-- The deficit should be reduced by 10 billion yuan;
</P>
<P>
-- The total volume of currency to be issued should be 150
billion yuan;
</P>
<P>
-- The total imports and exports should reach 345 billion US
dollars;
</P>
<P>
-- The natural population growth rate should be confined to
1.06 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- The registered unemployment rate should be about 3.5 percent
in cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
"Once these targets have been examined and approved at the
current session of the National People's Congress, we must take
effective measures to achieve them in accordance with the policy
of promoting development while maintaining stability. We shall
make appropriate and timely changes to these targets in light of
changes in both the domestic situation and international
conditions in our vigorous efforts to promote the rapid growth of
the national economy," said Chen in his report on the draft plan
to the session.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft plan, the major tasks for national
economic and social development in 1998 include:
</P>
<P>
-- Stabilizing and strengthening the position of agriculture as
the foundation of the economy and developing all the sectors of
rural economy;
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the quality of industrial operation and fostering
new points for economic growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Maintaining appropriate growth in investment in fixed assets
and readjusting and optimizing the investment structure;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to develop an open economy and doing better in
opening to the outside world;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening the management of revenue and expenditures and
guarding against and reducing financial risks;
</P>
<P>
-- Following a strategy of developing the country through
science and education and working for sustainable development to
develop all social undertakings in an all-round way;
</P>
<P>
-- Stepping up efforts to implement re-employment projects and
continuing to improve people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan also listed a host of indexes for China's
economic and social development in 1998, which include a total
grain output of 492.5 million tons and cotton output of four
million tons, reducing the number of the needy people in rural
areas to below 40 million, an annual steel output of 107 million
tons and a yearly electricity output 12,000 billion KWH, a total
fixed asset investment of 2.785 trillion yuan (including 1.050
trillion yuan for capital construction), and a rise of about four
percent in real terms for the per-capita disposable income of
urban residents and the per capita net income of rural people.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Reaffirms Demand for End to U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Affairs Ministry
Thursday reaffirmed a demand for an end to the 35-year-old United
States economic embargo against the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said that the blockade was
a complete failure, senseless and lacking moral legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that several Cuban-American organizations on Monday
stated their opposition to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The call came as Cuban Brigade General Aroldo Ferrer Martinez
urged Cubans to continue their vigilance against constant threats
by the U.S to the revolution.
</P>
<P>
The general was speaking in the eastern province of Santiago de
Cuba at a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the third front
against the forces of former dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
He said that defending Cuba's independence became more
difficult as the U.S. blockade intensified.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chen said the 1997 plan for national economic and social
development was carried out satisfactorily, and listed some major
achievements:
</P>
<P>
-- The national economy continued to grow rapidly; in 1997
China's gross domestic product reached 7.4772 trillion yuan, an
increase of 8.8 percent over the previous year; market prices
basically remained stable, and retail prices rose by 0.8 percent
over the previous year;
</P>
<P>
-- Progress was made in economic restructuring and the
"bottlenecks" restricting national economic growth eased notably;
</P>
<P>
-- Government revenue grew rapidly and the financial situation
remained stable;
</P>
<P>
-- Reforms, especially reform of state-owned enterprises, were
intensified with progress scored in important areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Fairly rapid growth was registered in foreign trade and
foreign funds were better utilized; China ranked 10th in the world
in 1997 in terms of foreign trade, and a total of 64 billion US
dollars in foreign funds was used during the year.
</P>
<P>
However, he also acknowledged that there are a number of
outstanding irregularities and problems in China's economic and
social life, such as:
</P>
<P>
-- The quality and performance of the national economy as a
whole remains poor and unsound aspects of the economic structure
are still glaring; economic growth is still based on extensive
production;
</P>
<P>
-- The economic performance of enterprises is still fairly low;
at the end of 1997 losses of independent accounting industrial
enterprises operating at a loss increased by 11 percent over the
previous year, with those of the state-owned enterprises running
at a loss rising by 8.2 percent; and quite a number of state-owned
enterprises had difficulties in production and operation;
</P>
<P>
-- The number of laid-off employees and unemployed people
increased, adding pressure to employment; although some redundant
workers had been re-employed, there were 4.8 million such workers
still without employment at the end of 1997;
</P>
<P>
-- Financial supervision and control has to be improved and the
financial order is somewhat chaotic in some areas; the level of
non-performing loans in financial institutions is fairly high;
</P>
<P>
-- Relationships between incomes and distribution of social
wealth have yet to be straightened out and the means for making
adjustments are far from adequate;
</P>
<P>
-- Life is relatively hard for some people in both urban and
rural areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Population growth and economic development exert tremendous
pressure on resources, and the ecological environment in some
regions has been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these problems have been accumulating over a long
period of time, whereas others have arisen in the course of reform
and development. It is essential to make great effort to bring
about the shift in the economic system and in the pattern of
economic growth, and strive to resolve these irregularities and
problems through reform and development," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Satisfied with Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Many members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) said that the Government Work Report delivered
by Premier Li Peng yesterday is "practical" and that they "are
very satisfied with the report."
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 CPPCC National Committee members heard the
premier's report in the Great Hall of the People here and later
discussed the report in 48 groups.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC members shared the view that China has made
remarkable achievements in reform, opening-up and the
modernization drive over the past five years and that the overall
national strength has considerably increased.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, an economist with Beijing University, said the
proposed eight percent economic growth rate for this year is
"practical and feasible."
</P>
<P>
"Such feasibility is demonstrated by better conditions of
resources, transportation and raw materials, abundant grain
supplies and better financial conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongru, vice-chairman of the China Finance Research
Society, said that, with the separation of "policy" banking and
commercial banking, the regulatory and supervisory roles of the
central bank have strengthened.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the fundamental cause for bad loans lies
in the fact that banks lack decision-making power. "Such a state
of affairs should change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xian Dingchang, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said the emphasis on high technology by China's leadership
indicates that the government has a good command of the economic
development trend in the world and is aiming at long-term
development.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM to Visit Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad will pay an official visit to Myanmar in the near future
at the invitation of Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council and Prime Minister Than Shwe, according to an
official announcement here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first visit of a Malaysian leader to Myanmar
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, Than Shwe went to Kuala Lumpur on a state visit,
during which an agreement between the two governments on economic,
scientific and technical cooperation was signed.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the bilateral trade between

<HEADLINE> Imelda Gets Temporary Reprieve from Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine First Lady Imelda
Marcos has gotten a temporary reprieve from her 12-year conviction
for graft after a Supreme Court division suggested a review of her
case by the entire tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star reported on Friday that the tribunal's
third division referred the matter to the entire court as it acted
on a motion filed by Imelda on February 25 to allow a full-court
hearing to review and reverse her conviction.
</P>
<P>
Imelda was sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Manila court in
1993 for underpricing a government-owned lot in Manila to a
private company in 1984. A division of the Supreme Court upheld
the ruling on January 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
In her six-page motion, Imelda said the ruling was only based
on the evidence presented by the prosecution and that was not
enough. She also wanted to know why she was convicted while her
co-accused, former transportation minister Jose Dans, was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Once the tribunal accepts Imelda's motion, her scheduled
detention will take a little longer since the case can drag on for
a certain period of time. If not, she might be jailed before the
year-end, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda is a House representative of her hometown Leyte province
at present.

<HEADLINE> Visitors in Upper Hand after First Leg in Euro Soccer Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Four visitor teams were put in the
upper hand with two victories and two draws on Thursday in the
first leg of the European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals matches.
</P>
<P>
Vicenza of Italy almost booked a berth for the semi as the
Serie A underdogs routed Roda JC Kerkrade of Netherlands 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Vicenza, who are struggling at the bottom half in domestic
league, put up an earlier lead with three goals in the first half,
all coming from headers.
</P>
<P>
Striker Pasquale Luiso scored a double and defender Davide
Belotti added another, meaning the Roda defence was not in the
class of Vicenza's offence.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Otero gave the Italian team a 4-0 lead after 66 minutes
before Bob Peeters answered a late consolation for Roda.
</P>
<P>
English Chelsea were also in the driving seat in the return leg
as the Premiership club walked away with an crucial 2-1 win over
Real Betis of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo's pair in the first
12 minutes, the English hopefuls left their Spaniards opponents a
real toil in the late match.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Perez headed in from close range one minute after
halftime for Betis, but their constant efforts in the second half
did little to change the score mark.
</P>
<P>
Germany's VFB Stuttgart coule be contend with a 1-1 draw with
Slavia Prague of the Czech Republic, who did not hold onto a gold
opportunity for a home win.
</P>
<P>
Stuttagrt scored the lone goal in the 51st minute through
Gerhard Poschner who capitalized a blunder of keeper Jan Stejskal
to level the match.
</P>
<P>
Slavia was up in the 40th minute when Karel Vacha scored an
easy goal as Marc Ziegler parried Lubos Kozel's shot into Vacha's
way.
</P>
<P>
Robert Vagner missed a late penalty after he was tackled down
by Thomas Berthold in the 72nd minute and was awarded a gold
chance.
</P>
<P>
AEK Athens of Greece could not find the back of the net in a
home clash against Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia as the tie ended 0-0.
</P>
<P>
The Russians solid defence kept AEK out of the area and, for
most of the time, the Greeks' attacks ended as long range shots.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to accelerate
the establishment of a socialist market economy and continue to
make progress in the reform of major areas this year.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came from Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the
State Planning Commission, in his report on the implementation of
the 1997 plan for national economic and social development and on
the draft 1998 plan for national economic and social development
to the ongoing First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress today.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, China will step up the pace of reforms in
the following areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Successfully reforming state enterprises. Aiming mainly at
improving the state sector of the economy as a whole, China will
effectuate a strategic reorganization of state-owned enterprises
through good management of large enterprises while relaxing
control over small ones. The capital reserves added for clearing
bad debts in 1998 will be used mainly to extricate the textile
industry from its difficulties and on major restructuring items.
China will combine financing in the stock market with the reform
of state-owned enterprises and encourage listed companies to merge
with enterprises that have good prospects but are experiencing
temporary difficulties. China will also make the textile industry
the forerunner in the reform of state-owned enterprises and in the
campaign to extricate those enterprises from their difficulties.
The government will begin in the coastal provinces and cities in
1998 and strive to spread successful practices to the interior.

<P>
-- Speeding up reform of the financial system. China plans to
use three years to basically establish financial institutions,
financial markets and a system of financial control and
supervision to gear to a socialist market economy. This should
improve the operation and management of the financial industry and
bring about a marked turn for the better in financial order across
the country. China will put an end to the proportioned
distribution of branches of the People's Bank of China (PBC) and
state-owned commercial banks in all administrative divisions and
reduce the number of management bodies and branches. China will
increase the number of urban commercial banks and start to
experiment with county (city) commercial banks in selected areas.
China will also gradually develop the capital market, expanding
the use of direct financing as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
-- Reforming the grain distribution system. China will
gradually establish a grain distribution system that is suited to
a socialist market economy and able to carry out the state's
macro-control tasks. China will further relax control over and
invigorate the retail market for grain. The government will set
protective prices for purchasing grain and ceiling prices for
selling it, and regulate market supply and demand and prices
mainly through economic means such as the use of its grain
reserves.
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to deepen the price reform. The mechanism for
setting prices mainly through the market will be improved. The
government will review the temporary administrative measures it
took to control prices in order to curb inflation, and abolish or
revise regulations incompatible with the current economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the macro-control system. Macroeconomic control
and coordination will be further improved. To address the new
conflicts and problems arising in the economic operation, China
will balance economic growth and efficiency, and overall economic
growth and the pattern of growth, and appropriately tighten and
trim monetary policy. The government will mainly guide and
standardize the activities of all major economic entities by
economic and legal means.

<HEADLINE> Harkness Denies Collymore Racism Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool defender Steve Harkness
said in a press release on Thursday that he did not racially abuse
Aston Villa striker Stan Collymore during the team's English
premier league match at Villa Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Liverpool, Harkness said: "I
vehemently deny the accusation that I made racist comments to Stan
Collymore during or after the game at Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to press reports, I did not at any point attempt to
enter the Aston Villa dressing room and was not involved in any
scuffle with Stan Collymore.
</P>
<P>
"The particular background to this game may have meant that
there was more going on on the pitch than is usual, but that does
not extend to racial abuse of any kind.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a racist and I am proud to count Paul Ince and his
family as some of my closest friends and people with whom I and my
family spend a lot of time."
</P>
<P>
Liverpool have given their full backing to Harkness and have
asked Professional Footballers' Association representative Brendan
Batson to mediate in the affair.
</P>
<P>
Collymore, who moved from Liverpool to Villa in the summer for
7 million pounds (11.5 million U.S. dollars), claimed Harkness had
abused him during the game that Villa won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Collymore was quoted in English newspapers as saying:
"Harkness called me a 'coon' and some things even worse. I was
getting racial abuse from him and being wound up throughout the
game.
</P>
<P>
"It is Steve Harkness that has to live with this now. I have
made it my business to make sure the black players at Liverpool
know what was said.
</P>
<P>
"Harkness has got to be part of that squad with those players,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Harmattan Disrupts Flights in Nigeria Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Flight disruptions again took a
heavy toll Wednesday in almost all airports across Nigeria as
airlines could not operate their normal passenger service due to
poor visibility caused by the recurring harmattan haze.
</P>
<P>
Only the airports in the capital Abuja and Port Harcourt in
the south were confirmed Wednesday night by airlines officials as
having the capability to accommodate flights.
</P>
<P>
The haze of Harmattan, a seasonal hot, dry and dust-laden wind
originated from the Sahara, usually causes very poor visibility,
which also adds difficulties to motor drivers.
</P>
<P>
The poor visibility led to a suspension of domestic flights
all over Nigeria for several days running at the turning of this
year, forcing many passengers to resort to travel by motor.
</P>
<P>
Lack of advanced airport equipment is one of the major factors
that explain the vulnerability of the local airlines to weather
impact.
</P>
<P>
International flights were not affected even in the heat of
the harmattan haze this season, which extends from November to
March.

Germany accused scientist Karl-Heinz Schaab, 63, of supplying

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- World Cup Organising Committee
(CFO) and the European Union officials met on Thursday, discussing
a possible way to settle down a dispute over the allocation of
tickets by France for the competition.
</P>
<P>
World Cup organisers' representatives and lawyers met EU
officials for three hours in Brussels to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
CFO director general Jacques Lambert told reporters the meeting
had been constructive, but he declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
A number of European soccer associations, led by England, have
complained about how few tickets they will receive for the
French-organised competition.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on ticket allocation will be made at a meeting
between CFO and world soccer body FIFA in Paris next week.
</P>
<P>
Organisers have claimed they have merely followed guidelines
agreed months ago by FIFA and approved by the EU while the
European Union executive said the current allocation of tickets,
giving 60 percent of all tickets to French residents, could breach
EU anti-trust laws.

Shaanxi Province is expected to create a bright future for
agriculture there, even during long periods of drought.
</P>
<P>
Although Shaanxi is regarded as an important agricultural area,
it is hindered by its dry weather. So, the provincial government

stop soil erosion and plant trees and grass on 65 percent of the
province's land.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is divided into three natural zones in its northern,
middle and southern parts and six ecological zones to improve
low-yield grain fields, curb soil erosion and develop water saving
irrigation, build agriculture products bases, and get the most out
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Along with these six, the province will have six pilot projects
in ecologically-sound agriculture, dryland agriculture,
sustainable utilization, rich soil, and organic food.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Friend Testifies for  Second Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's close friend, said Thursday he did not help former
White House intern Monica sewinsky find a job and a lawyer in
exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
Following his second day of testimony before a federal grand
jury, Jordan reiterated that he never told Lewinsky to lie about
her relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jordan told reporters, "I did not in any way tell her,
encourage her, to lie. My efforts to help find her a job were not
a quid pro quo for the affidavit that she signed."
</P>
<P>
In her sworn affidavit given to Paula Jones's lawyers, Lewinsky
stated she never had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating whether
President Clinton, or an intermediary, urged Lewinsky to deny the
alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
Jordan maintained he did nothing to influence Lewinsky's
testimony.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 336 Million U.S. Dollar Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday two loans totaling 336 million U.S. dollars equivalent
for two projects in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
First loan of 186 million dollars is earmarked for Rio de
Janeiro mass transit project. This project will help improve the
mass transit system of the city of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit thousands of low-income households in
the city's metropolitan region, which has 9.8 million inhabitants
and is one of the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The project will develop a fully-integrated urban
transportation system and reduce the operating subsidies received
from the state, as the private sector is given a larger role in
operation and management.
</P>
<P>
Another loan of some 150 million dollars will be used for
Brazil's second water modernization project.
</P>
<P>
This project will help improve the country's water supply and
sewerage services in the poorest regions, expanding coverage for
the poor and improving the quality of service.
</P>
<P>
Improved environmental conditions will also contribute to the
recovery of beaches as well as to increased tourism and
recreational activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Dragged by a fall-off in
Intel-led technology shares, U.S. stocks fell sharply on Thursday,
with the Dow Jones industrial average ending 94.16 points lower to
8,445.08.
</P>
<P>
This was Dow's second biggest decline this year since January 9
when 220 points were lost due to investors' worries about the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Intel, world's number one chip-maker, lost almost 13 percent on
the New York Stock Exchange following its announcement last night
that its first quarter earnings may drop 10 percent, citing lower
demand for PCs as a reason.
</P>
<P>
Intel faces fierce competition from other companies for low
priced chips used in sub-1,000 U.S. dollars machines.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of other computer companies followed suit,
pressuring the technology-heavy Nastaq composite index to go down
47.78 to 1,711.92.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock list fell 12.29 to 1,035.04 and
the NYSE composite index fell 4.16 to 540.30.
</P>
<P>
On the smaller companies' line, the Russell 2000 index was down
5.31 to 456.82 and the American Stock Exchange composite index
fell 4.84 to 704.31.

<HEADLINE> House of Representatives Legislation to Ease Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen states in the United
States that have failed to computerize their child support systems
would escape severe penalties under legislation approved by the
House of Representatives on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although these states would still face fines, they would be a
fraction of what a 1988 law required. The legislation now goes to
the Senate, where some lawmakers support even lower penalties.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, states without working computer systems
would lose all federal child support funding, which is used to run
collection systems. In addition, state welfare funding is
contingent on having a working child support program, and states
could lose their entire block grant.
</P>
<P>
Representative Clay Shaw, co-sponsor of the bill acted on
Thursday, said, "Penalties of this magnitude are devastating and
would cripple both the child support and welfare programs. Then
everyone would lose."
</P>
<P>
His legislation would reduce the penalty to 4 percent of child
support funding for this year, increasing to 8 percent next year
and 16 percent in 2000. States that haven't finished their systems
by 2001 would lose 20 percent each year. They would not lose any
general welfare funding.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress required states to computerize their systems
to allow for easier tracking of parents who owe money as they
travel within a state and between states. Since then, more than
2.6 billion dollars has been spent on the project. The deadline
was extended once to give states until October to finish their
work.

<HEADLINE> Albright Set Agendas for 2nd Summit of Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday that education, free trade,
economic reform and narcotics control will be high on the agenda
of the second summit of Americas to be held in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders will seek to build on the vision of a true
hemisphere community put forward in Miami three years ago,"
Albright told the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
A two-day "Conference of Americas" celebrating the OAS's 50th
anniversary was convened at the organization's headquarters in
Washington as a preparation for the Santiago summit.
</P>
<P>
"Together in Santiago, we should reaffirm our conviction that
the path to increased prosperity for the greatest number resides
not in a retreat from reform, but in its refinement, in more
openness, coupled with more accountability and high standards,"
said Albright.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions in Santiago will also review so-called
second-generation economic reforms that extend accountability and
the rule of law to the financial world, thereby promoting
prosperity that is broad-based and less vulnerable to the kind of
disruptions we see now in East Asia," she added.
</P>
<P>
The second summit of Americas will take place in early April.
President Bill Clinton and leaders from other 33 countries on the
hemisphere will attend the event.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will also seek to launch negotiations to create a
Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the year of 2005,
according to Albright.
</P>
<P>
The secretary stressed that "the FTAA remains a keystone of
the president's policy of cooperation in this hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
The summit will restate commitment to the war against
international narcotics trafficking and crime, she added.
</P>
<P>
"We must move ahead together on all fronts and unite in
emphasizing to the people throughout the region that... drugs are
wrong, drugs are illegal, drugs will kill you," she affirmed.

LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook pledged Thursday evening fresh European efforts to give a new
impetus to the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Anglo-Arab Association in London, Cook said
that a "key international priority for the British presidency of
the EU is the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We have two clear aims: justice for the Palestinians and
security for the Israelis. We based our approach firmly on
international legality," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On European Union initiatives on the Middle East peace process,
Cook, who is due to visit the region next week, urged both parties
to restore confidence by honoring existing agreements, opening the
Gaza airport and halting all expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the 15-nation bloc will provide practical
assistance in a bid to help boost the Palestinian economy and
fighting terrorism.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Air Force Lt.Col. Eileen
Collins, the first woman to pilot a U.S. space shuttle, was named
the first woman to command a shuttle mission December this year.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton
said, "Heroes come in all sizes and gender", "even the sky is no
longer the limit".
</P>
<P>
"Today we celebrate the falling away of another barrier in
America's quest to conquer the frontiers of space," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Collins became the first woman to pilot a space shuttle when
she flew aboard a mission in February 1995 that was the first
flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Her second
shuttle flight in May 1997 was the sixth mission to rendezvous and
dock with the Russian space station Mir. She has logged more than
419 hours in space.
</P>
<P>
During her December shuttle Columbia mission, she will command
the shuttle to launch the 1.4 billion Advanced X-ray telescope
that is a counterpart to the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Public Employees Protest Government Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish public sector workers took
to streets Thursday to protest a government-proposed bill which
allegedly aims to limit union rights.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale demonstrations were reported in the provinces of
Ankara, Istanbul, Antalya, Edirne, Gaziantep as well as Samsun,
according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Ankara to show
their anger over the new union bill, saying that they were
determined to defend their legal rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
They shouted slogans such as "We are right, we'll win," and
"No to fake union laws."
</P>
<P>
Protesters clashed with riot police armed with batons and gas
grenades. Some people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
They said Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, who earlier enjoyed wide support from
public workers, want to limit the rights of the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Cengiz Uzuner, a senior member of the KESK, said that railway,
postal and health workers all participated in the nationwide
strike aimed at defending civil rights.
</P>
<P>
"Work has halted all around the country. We will continue our
protest until the government withdraws this bill," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's demonstration in the central district of the
capital was a continuation of Wednesday evening's protest on the
same spot in which about 7,000 labor union members were involved.
</P>
<P>
Local televisions were constantly showing the scenes that many
protesters sitting on the ground shivered under the freezing water
spurted by police water cannons.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight protesters and 21 policemen wounded in the clashes
were rushed to the hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
On the public sector protests around the country, Yilmaz said
that the demonstration took place at a "wrong time," saying this
will do no good to the issue.
</P>
<P>
"If everyone takes to the streets to protest a bill currently
being discussed in Parliament, this means inflicting pressure on
Parliament, and therefore it may have a negative effect on
Parliament's work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill submitted by the Yilmaz government last
month is now still under the Parliament debate.

<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook announced Thursday evening that Britain is to host an
international conference on implementing a new U.N. deal to
increase the amount of oil Iraq can sell for food.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a London conference on the Middle East, Cook said
that Britain, as the current European Union (EU) president, will
organize a meeting to work out how Europe and others can help the
U.N. in swift and effective implementation of the expanded
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
"Doubling the size of the program throws up many opportunities
which we are determined to seize" in an effort to meet the most
pressing needs of the Iraqi people, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that the planned meeting "will provide a chance to
consult with all the key players, including the U.N. and NGOs (non
governmental organizations), to ensure that the European
contribution to the scheme is used to the fullest advantage of the
Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary did not give the concrete date for the
conference, but British government officials reportedly said that
the meeting will take place before the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Virtue Party Becomes Biggest in Turkish Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The newly formed Virtue Party (FP)
became the biggest party in the Turkish parliament on Thursday
when six independent lawmakers jointed it.
</P>
<P>
The FP now has 140 seats in the 550-member legislature,
surpassing the Motherland Party, a longtime partner of the current
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the FP parliament members are ex-deputies of the former
Welfare Party (RP) which was banned in January for its strong
Islamic color.
</P>
<P>
A ruling by the Constitutional Court said that the RP had
become a center of the pro-Islamist political force and posed a
threat to Turkey's secularism.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts fear that the FP will follow the former RP and
become a new mouthpiece of the Islamists in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
FP leaders has repeatedly said the FP is a new party and
different from any other political parties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Withdraws Offer for Yugoslavia over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
decided to punish Yugoslavia for escalating violence in Kosovo by
withdrawing limited economic concessions granted only last week to
lift sanctions.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley warned that there will
be "serious negative consequences" for the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia as a result of the latest violence in the Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
The United States is withdrawing positive measures announced by
U.S. Bosnia special envoy Robert Gelbard when visiting Belgrade
last week, said Foley.
</P>
<P>
The measures are mainly cosmetic because Washington has
insisted on maintaining the so-called "outer-wall" of sanctions,
imposed by the U.S. and its allies in 1992 when the former
Yugoslavia broke up.
</P>
<P>
Foley confirmed that four measures withdrawn include Belgrade's
participation in the U.S. Southern Europe Cooperation Initiative,
a plan to increase number of Yugoslavia's diplomats in New York at
the U.N., opening a consulate in the U.S., landing rights for
Yugoslav airline in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Foley threatened that the U.S. will respond further to possible
actions taken by Belgrade in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We have a broad range options available to use," Foley said,
but refusing to speculate about what they might be.
</P>
<P>
Asked if military option is ruled out, Foley said,"I'm not
specifically addressing that option, in either a positive or
negative way."
</P>
<P>
He urged both the ethnic Albanians and Belgrade to resolve the
issue through dialogue. "Our firm message to both parties is that
the difficulties in Kosovo cannot be solved through the use of
force."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gelbard threatened to intervene militarily in the
crisis when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Foley said there was an "erroneous report" that attributed to
Gelbard a specific comment in the regard of military option.

<HEADLINE> German Jobless People Take to the Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Jobless people in more than 200
German cities, modeled on the recent mass protests by their
French counterparts, Thursday took to the streets to protest the
persisting record-high unemployment in Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates of organizers, at least 50,000 people
had participated in peaceful demonstrations before banks, stock
exchanges, government institutions and offices of political
parties across the country.
</P>
<P>
In several cities, jobless demonstrators wrapped themselves in
garbage bags to present themselves as the "garbage of prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Some jobless groups from France also demonstrated in Germany
Thursday to show their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations came as the German Labor Office released the
latest official data Thursday showing the country's unemployment
still remained at the record high of over 4.8 million, or a rate
of 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and economists are not expecting any major
improvement on the job market within this year despite an expected
economic growth of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to put pressure on politicians, unemployed groups said
that before Germany's general elections in September, they would
launched demonstrations every month on the day when the government
released the official jobless data.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Jacques Santer, president of the European
Commission, told a conference of eastern German state premiers in
Rostock Thursday that the high levels of unemployment in Europe
could only be reduced considerably within five years provided that
international cooperation involving all social partners could be
mobilized.
